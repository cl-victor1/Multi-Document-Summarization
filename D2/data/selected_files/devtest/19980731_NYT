HOUSE BLOCKS AMENDMENTS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>

of several campaign finance amendments Thursday evening and adding
information on a spending bill that was pulled from the floor.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picking up the pace on the campaign finance debate,
a majority of the House voted repeatedly on Thursday night to
preserve intact bipartisan legislation to cut back on money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like hockey goalies, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Rep.
Martin Meehan, D-Mass., kept up an effort to block 16 of the 37
amendments proposed to their bill. They asserted that the proposals
were intended to divide their coalition and drive away supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective today is to defeat all the poison pills,'' Shays
said. ``We're still alive. This is the bill that won't die. But
we're in the middle of a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of votes Thursday night, the two lawmakers handily
defeated eight amendments, including six that most concerned them.
The votes showed their coalition holding strong against the
onslaught. More amendments will be considered on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would effectively ban unlimited and
unregulated contributions to political parties, or soft money,
which were at the heart of the 1996 campaign finance abuses. The
bill would also restrict independent advertising by single-issue
advocacy groups in specified periods before elections.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation _ with a companion bill in the Senate _ is
fiercely opposed by the Republican leadership and most
rank-and-file Republicans. Some view it as a way to erode their
party's traditional advantage in fund-raising while others call it
an unconstitutional abridgement of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout weeks of intermittent night-time debate, the
coalition supporting the Shays-Meehan bill has managed to defeat
several amendments and competing proposals and show that it has
majority support.
</P>
<P>
   After stretching out the debate for months, the House is now
pushing toward a final vote on the overhaul of the campaign finance
laws early next week, when the Senate will already be on its August
recess.
</P>
<P>
   With Shays-Meehan supporters increasingly confident of victory,
the Senate recess will eliminate the possibility that Democrats
could capitalize on House action and try to force the Senate to
take up campaign finance legislation immediately. Similar
legislation died in the Senate earlier this year when it drew a
slim majority but not enough votes to cut off a filibuster.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the amendments defeated Thursday night were several,
strongly opposed by Democrats, that would change the ``motor voter
law'' on voter registration to allow states to eliminate mail-in
registrations and to require photo IDs for voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans crafted such proposals in response to a contested
California congressional election in which Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a
Democrat, drew strong support among voters of Hispanic origin and
toppled Robert Dornan, the Republican incumbent. The Republicans
charged that a number of illegal immigrants had voted but
ultimately allowed Ms. Sanchez to keep her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment that was defeated 278-147 would have required
candidates for congressional seats to raise at least 50 percent of
their campaign contributions inside their districts. Democrats get
more of their money from political action committees than
Republicans do and this change would have made it harder for them
to rely on such committees.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of why Shays and Meehan have been leery of amendments,
a wide array of 65 groups concerned with immigrants' rights came
out against the campaign finance legislation on Thursday because of
passage earlier in the month of an amendment sponsored by Rep. Vito
Fossella of Staten Island. The amendment would ban contributions by
noncitizens who are legal residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Rep. Tom Delay, the House majority whip, welcomed the
opposition, consisting of groups ranging from Catholic Charities
Immigrant Services in Honolulu to the Jewish Federation of
Metropolitan Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, R-Texas, has led the fight against Shays-Meehan _ as well
as the strategy of trying to sink it through amendments. ``We've
always been against Shays-Meehan,'' said John Feehery, DeLay's
spokesman. ``Now we've won some converts.'' But even some of the
staunchest opponents of the campaign finance legislation were
admitting on Thursday night that they no longer thought they could
stop it from being approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   On a related issue, Senate Republicans were forced to pull a
spending bill from the floor Thursday after Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., attacked an amendment that would limit the term of the
general counsel for the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats threatened to tie up the bill if Republicans did not
allow a full debate on McConnell's measure, which they called a
backdoor attempt to stop the Federal Election Commission from doing
its job overseeing campaign spending.

GUZMAN DAZZLES RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers did not score.
</P>
<P>
   Their lineup produced only five hits and went 0-for-11 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   It tantalized general manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Juan Guzman, who pitched eight scoreless innings in
the Blue Jays' 1-0 victory last night at SkyDome, became Melvin's
latest potential acquisition, according to a high-ranking Blue Jays
official.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers joined the Yankees, Indians, Angels and
Orioles as potential suitors interested in acquiring Guzman (6-12,
4.41) before tonight's 11 p.m. trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who last night remained in Toronto, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say \RMelvin\S has not told me that we're close
to making `this' or `that' deal,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said before last night's game, and he receives at least two updates
from the general manager every day.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers assistant general manager Dan O'Brien acknowledged the
organization's discussions regarding White Sox third baseman Robin
Ventura, but he also added ``that has not been a topic of
conversation'' within the last couple of days in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' recent discussions regarding the potential
acquisition of position players, O'Brien said, should not be
interpreted as the end of Melvin's attempts to strengthen the
rotation, which entered last night's game with the league's highest
earned-run average (5.86).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't draw that conclusion,'' O'Brien said. ``Doug is
very cautious and thorough. I think he's trying to explore every
potential opportunity that becomes available.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's most recent acquisition, right-hander Esteban Loaiza,
drew rave reviews from Oates with his performance against the Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who registered a career-high nine strikeouts,
surrendered only one run on four hits and two walks in the fourth
complete-game effort of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was in total command all night,'' Oates said. ``I
like what I see _ hearing the mitt pop and doing it against good
fastball hitters like Jose Canseco and Shawn Green. He had enough
velocity to make them swing and miss, and it didn't just happen
once or twice. That's good stuff right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, whom the Rangers acquired July 17 from the Pirates for
right-hander Todd Van Poppel and minor-league second baseman Warren
Morris, surrendered the game's lone run on a two-out, fifth-inning
single to center fielder Shannon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The play reflected one of the Rangers' defensive limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza's 94-mph fastball on the inner half of the plate broke
Stewart's bat, but the ground ball rolled through the middle of the
infield. Shortstop Kevin Elster, who does not possess great range
at his position, chased the ball behind second base and made a
sliding attempt to prevent it from reaching the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Elster's range failed him, and the ball rolled into center field
on SkyDome's artificial surface. Catcher Darrin Fletcher scored
from second base without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch,'' Loaiza said. ``It might have been an
out or an infield hit on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (0-2, 4.19) responded with an inning-ending strikeout of
left fielder Tony Phillips and retired right fielder Green,
designated hitter Canseco and first baseman Carlos Delgado in order
on strikes during the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman recorded three strikeouts and surrendered only five hits
and three walks during his 106-pitch appearance. The right-hander
expects it to be his final start as a member of the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking that this was my last game here,'' said
Guzman, who owns a 3-4 record during his past eight starts despite
a 2.01 ERA during that period. ``I'm going to miss this place
because, as you can imagine, I've been here eight years. Plus, this
is one of the best organizations there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers might be his next organization.

DATA OVERLOAD EASED BY PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Two months ago, Chan Ho Park was thinking too
much and not winning enough.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Dodgers ace had no confidence after lasting just
21/3 innings May 24 in a loss at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past month, Park has turned it all around. He won his
fifth straight and 10th overall Thursday, allowing two hits and one
run in eight innings in a 3-1 victory over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his best start of the year,'' first baseman Eric
Karros said. ``When you think that we no longer have Ramon
Martinez, Hideo Nomo and Ismael Valdes, three of our opening day
starters, what he is doing is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who tied Nomo last year for the club lead with 14
victories, has allowed just seven runs in 491/3 innings (1.10 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   He says the difference is eliminating the negative thoughts that
distracted him on the mound. He rarely pitched under adversity last
year and got rattled when he did earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everything is positive,'' said Park, who hasn't lost since
June 21. ``I just make sure to keep things simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard time: With left-hander Matt Beech on the mound, the
Dodgers went with right-handed Trenidad Hubbard in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard has three of his four homers against right-handed
pitching, but he came in hitting .417 against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   He was 0 for 2 with a sacrifice fly against Beech, but in the
field, he took extra bases away from Rico Brogna with the bases
loaded in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That catch turned the game around,'' manager Glenn Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed hitting Matt Luke has five homers in his last 11
games, but Hoffman said he would continue to use Hubbard against
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Hubbard at-bats to keep him sharp,'' Hoffman
said. ``And we think Luke is better in this setup as well. Everyone
stays sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd man out is Jim Eisenreich, who has just 10 at-bats since
the All-Star break. Eisenreich had one hit in three pinch at-bats
in this series and received a standing ovation before and after
each plate appearance. Eisenreich played with the Phillies from
1993-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the greatest days of my career,'' said Eisenreich,
who batted .318 in 1993 for the NL-champion Phillies. ``Ever since
I left, the fans have done that for me. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Korean right-hander Jin Ho Cho, demoted to Double-A
Trenton, N.J., by the Boston Red Sox, attended the game to watch
Park. Cho was 0-3 with an 8.20 ERA at Boston. ... Beech struck out
10 after not striking anyone out in his last start.

TV SPORTS: COOPERSTOWN GETS SHORT SHRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ceremony to induct Mike Singletary, Anthony Munoz, Dwight
Stephenson, Paul Krause and Tommy McDonald into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame Saturday will be carried live on ESPN2 from noon to 2
p.m. That's live. For two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the inductions of Don Sutton, Larry Doby and Lee
MacPhail into the Baseball Hall of Fame were carried by ESPN2 on
tape, for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Why such different treatment? Is baseball unworthy? If the
Cooperstown, N.Y., ceremony was renamed the ``ESPY Baseball Hall of
Fame Dudes Show Hosted by Norm McDonald,'' would it air live in
prime time?
</P>
<P>
   ESPN insists the treatment of pro pigskin has nothing to do with
its new deal to spend $600 million annually for National Football
League cable television rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the football season, so the timing is
great as a promotional opportunity,'' said Mike Soltys, an ESPN
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The football ceremony in Canton, Ohio, usually occurs on the
same day as ESPN's first preseason game _ the Green Bay-Kansas City
game will be seen at 10 p.m. Eastern time, from Tokyo _ although
the events did not coincide last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL usually has five players to induct, and it's a good
way to lead into our game,'' Soltys said.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget that ABC, ESPN's corporate cousin, is
showing the Hall of Fame Game between Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay at 7
p.m. Saturday. Boomer Esiason, the new co-host of the Miss America
pageant, will make his debut with his ``Monday Night Football''
colleagues, Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Yet five hours will elapse between the induction ceremony and
ABC's game and eight before ESPN's, during which ESPN will carry
loads of golf and ESPN2 will show a lot of auto and horse racing.
So the Canton fete is less ESPN's lead-in than a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   But if properly programmed, ESPN could have turned the baseball
festivities into a dandy lead-in to Sunday night baseball. It could
have replaced a ``Superbouts'' rerun from 6-7 p.m. and led in to
``SportsCenter,'' the baseball pregame show and the 8 p.m.
Rockies-Cardinals game. It's astonishing that ESPN _a positive
baseball force since 1990 _ hasn't chosen to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has not done as much as possible with the Baseball Hall of
Fame show to make it an event. It has expanded the program to 60
minutes on occasion, depending on the allure of the inductees. But
rarely has it looked like more than a hastily edited rehash, with
hardly a sense of place. And there is no rationale for showing only
84 seconds from Doby, a racial trailblazer, 53 seconds from
MacPhail or nothing from Sam Lacy, the legendary African-American
writer, and Jaime Jarrin, the Spanish-language voice of the
Dodgers, who entered the hall's writers and broadcasters section.
</P>
<P>
   How would ESPN have sliced and diced Mike Webster's emotional
induction speech last year _ and his former Steeler teammate Terry
Bradshaw's madcap accompaniment _ if the football show were wedged
into a 30-minute time slot? If Pete Rose is ever inducted, what
will he get? An hour? On tape?
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Soltys said, the baseball show will very likely
expand to 90 minutes, assuming that Nolan Ryan, George Brett and
Carlton Fisk are the inductees. But it will still be on tape, from
5:30 to 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year both Hall of Fame shows will shift to ESPN
Classic Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's treatment of baseball, in another way, is part of a
dispute that must culminate soon: the shift of ESPN's three Sunday
night baseball games in September to ESPN2 when ESPN televises the
NFL. The conflict never existed when ESPN aired only the second
half of the Sunday night cable package. But when TNT would not pay
outlandishly to keep its half, ESPN bought it all.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has rejected ESPN's settlement entreaties, which
included putting some regular-season games on ESPN2 and trying to
place the September games on the local stations of the teams
playing. It has not offered to push cable systems that don't carry
ESPN2 to add it on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wants nothing less than to keep the games of Sept. 6,
13 and 20 on ESPN, with its 74 million subscribers, and off ESPN2,
with its 57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball insists that staying on ESPN is contractually
guaranteed. ESPN has countered that it has the contractual option
to make the shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games on ESPN2 are a non-starter for us,'' said Paul Beeston,
the president of Major League Baseball, who would not say what
resolution would be satisfactory short of the status quo. ``We're
discussing it internally. It has to be resolved. It has an
end-time. We hope it's sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's Flare-Up
</P>
<P>
   The hearing on Mike Tyson's application for a boxing license in
New Jersey on Wednesday was fascinating viewing. There was silly
and funny stuff from Chuck Wepner and Bobby Czyz, plus incongruous
allusions to Tyson as Christ-like. But the highlight _ Tyson
seething and cursing once _ was not a surprise, though not because
a flare-up from him, at any time, is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself in his seat. Imagine you are being deposed before a
nationwide audience on CNN about a car accident by a tireless
lawyer. After an hour, your nerves might fray. You might cuss. If
there are legal grounds to deny Tyson a license, fine. But to judge
a fighter who engaged us with his fury on a televised profanity is
wrong. It's just a word. Ask George Carlin about it.

KWAN STANDS OUT ON A POOR NIGHT OF SKATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It was the end of July and she was displaying
a bikini tan line, but Michelle Kwan still managed two and a half
minutes of elegance that brought a moment of perfection to an
otherwise clumsy night of figure skating at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Performing for the last time a short program that was judged as
the greatest for any woman ever at the national championships last
January, Kwan skated exquisitely again Thursday night and received
one perfect mark of 6 for presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she needed to be flawless. Simply staying on her feet
would have also put Kwan in first place on a night when only two of
the eight skaters managed clean routines. Of course, simple
competence has never been sufficient for Kwan, the two-time world
champion and Olympic silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
   She has performed this routine to two Rachmaninov piano pieces
nine times this season, and not once has Kwan made a mistake in a
program that is technically challenging, mesmerizing in its
dramatic buildup and sweeping with its changes of speed and mood.
But this is the end of the season, and by the fall, she will need
new costumes, new music, new routines to keep her performances from
becoming overly familiar and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should keep this program until I make a mistake,'' Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Carroll, who coaches the 18-year-old Kwan in Lake
Arrowhead, Calif., said: ``I'm kind of sad to give it up. It's
special, a signature piece for Michelle. There is a very special
feeling it impacts on the audience and judges. It will be difficult
to do something equally as good, but it is our job to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Butyrskaya of Russia finished second Thursday night
despite an awkward short program that left her with her hands down
on her triple-lutz-double-loop combination. A more revelatory
performance came from the third-place finisher, Viktoriya Volchkova
of Russia, who was third at the 1998 world junior championships and
who celebrated her 16th birthday Thursday with a performance of
light wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   The short program counted for one-third of the scoring.
Saturday's long program will count for two-thirds. But Kwan will
need some unforeseen collapse not to defeat this depleted field.
Only Tara Lipinski, the Olympic champion, can challenge Kwan, and
she has decided to turn professional at the doddering old age of
15.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kwan is looking toward the 2002 Winter Games in Salt
Lake City and only injury or her own lack of interest would prevent
her from dominating women's Olympic-style skating in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   The audience of 5,581 at Nassau Coliseum cheered her loudly and
adoringly, extending their applause during her graceful spiral
maneuver, and showering the ice with flowers and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   During warm-ups, Kwan fell on her lutz and then landed the jump
tentatively during her routine, but she quickly gathered herself
and skated confidently and joyously through the remainder of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started off, I knew I was going to do it,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe and imagine yourself performing, it's already
done in your head before you step on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the national championship last January, she received perfect
scores of 6 from seven of the nine judges for presentation in the
short program. Thursday night, the seven judges gave her one 6 and
a bouquet of 5.9's for her farewell performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of my program was the footwork,'' Kwan said.
``That's what I'll miss most. In this program, I was dramatic,
soft, I could be all emotions at the same time.''

STOLLE CRASHES PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandon Stolle expected to spend a quiet, relaxing week in Los
Angeles, watching the Mercedes-Benz Cup. Instead, he's playing in
today's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian was ousted from the qualifying rounds, losing a
tough third-set tiebreaker to Mexico's Alejandro Hernandez. But
when fourth-seeded Thomas Enqvist withdrew with an injury Monday
night, Stolle's name topped the list of possible subs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came over here (to Los Angeles Tennis Center) to do a
cocktail party for Mercedes, and they told me, `You're going to
play tonight.' I had to run back to the hotel and grab my gear,''
Stolle said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to defeat Taylor Dent of Newport Beach on Monday
then advanced to the quarterfinals with Thursday's victory over
fellow Aussie Andrew Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   He had extra incentive to win after his father, former tennis
great Fred Stolle, told him the night before to win one for
countryman and hall-of-famer Rod Laver, who is recovering from a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough thing when someone tells you,'' Stolle said.
``It's like an extra incentive. I really wanted to do it. Now that
I've won, I can say I won it for Rod.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also boosted Stolle's confidence, which suffered as
he struggled in the past couple months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a break this week and got into the tournament,'' he
said. ``Now I've won a few matches. I couldn't be happier. Whatever
happens, it's been a great week for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy crowds: A strong field and heavy advance sales have the
tournament on pace to surpass last year's attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday's matches, the event had drawn 35,647,
including sellouts for the Monday and Tuesday evening sessions,
tournament officials said. With four days and seven sessions to go
(Thursday's figures were available at press time), the tournament
appears a safe beat to beat last year's total attendance of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's initial lineup _ used for early marketing _ was
possibly the best this decade, and it boosted advance sales. That
was before Greg Rusedski withdrew and before Pete Sampras and
Enqvist pulled out at the last minute with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter, Goran Ivanisevic and Tim
Henman provided sufficient star power, and the tournament has had
healthy walk-up sales. Of that group, only Ivanisevic has been
ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy Sampras: Wimbledon champion Sampras is practicing again.
His ``injury'' turned out to be a wart on the bottom of his right
foot. Sampras had it surgically removed July 15, and the lingering
soreness prompted him to withdraw only three days before the
tournament opened.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to play next week at the du Maurier Open in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Fade to black: Wednesday's late doubles match _ pitting
Camarillo twins Bob and Mike Bryan against John Lafnie De Jager and
Robbie Koenig _ was interrupted for 15 minutes when the stadium
lights mysteriously went out with the Bryans trailing 1-6, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig and De Jager did their best to keep the crowd from
leaving, putting on an impromptu dance show and boogeying to
``Disco Inferno'' as officials worked to fix the problem. They went
on to beat the Bryans 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.

RAFTER PLEASED WITH QUARTERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Patrick Rafter is ready to script his own verse to
add to the classic ditty, ``I Love L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   After dispatching his second-round opponent Thursday to advance
to the Mercedes-Benz Cup quarterfinals, the Australian enthused
about his own game and about the host city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. We all love it,'' the No.1 seed said of the
tournament, following his 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 victory over Czech Martin
Damm.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is just a lot of fun to be in for the week we're here.
It's a really popular spot on the tour.... And they spoil us
rotten,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you all these nice gifts. They give you these CDs
and this shampoo in your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Er, shampoo? Isn't that, well, standard?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice shampoo,'' clarified Rafter, wearing his long
tresses up in a Pebbles Flintstone ponytail. ``And when I got to
the hotel, they had a robe for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is apparently good on the ATP Tour. And it's not going too
badly on the court either for the world's fifth-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, preparing to defend his U.S. Open title, advanced to the
quarterfinals at Los Angeles Tennis Center for the second time. He
takes on former UCLA standout Justin Gimelstob in the featured
match this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Against Damm, Rafter looked like he was set to cruise after the
6-3 win in the first set. But Damm, leading 6-5 in the second,
broke Rafter's serve for the first time to take the set. Rafter
lost a key point in the deciding game when he lobbed too deep.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't make the same mistake twice. Rafter broke Damm's
serve on the first game of the third set, denying Damm a single
point and clinching on a deep lob that stayed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy with the performance,'' Rafter said. ``It's
the best I've played in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter is also happy with the state of his left knee, which had
bothered him throughout much of the year. He's been dealing with an
undiagnosed soreness in the knee for several years and it was
particularly troublesome during the clay- court season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite annoying, actually,'' he said. ``Today it felt
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterfinals field was completed Thursday: Fifth-seed Andre
Agassi advanced with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Jan-Michael Gambill of
Spokane, Wash.; Gimelstob advanced when Boca Raton's Vince Spadea,
the eighth seed, retired while trailing 6-3, 6-0, and Australian
Sandon Stolle advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) win over countryman
Andrew Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   In doubles, Wayne Ferreira and Marcos Ondruska of South Africa
upended the second-seeded team of Damm and Tucson's Jim Grabb 7-6
(6-2), 6-3. In the late match, the third-seeded pair of Rafter and
Stolle were scheduled to take on South Africa's Grant Stafford and
Kevin Ullyet.

ANGELS CALL UP GLAUS, ACQUIRE O'BRIEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- While the ``big trade has yet to come, the Angels
made a couple moves Thursday that changed the look of their roster.
</P>
<P>
   They called up third baseman Troy Glaus from triple-A Vancouver
and made a trade with the White Sox for catcher Charlie O'Brien.
Glaus joined the team Thursday but did not start. He'll start
tonight against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, acquired for single-A pitchers Jason Stockstill and
Brian Tokarse, is currently on the disabled list with a broken
right thumb. He has not yet joined the team and is eligible to be
activated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Glaus, who hit 35 home runs between double-A
Midland and triple-A Vancouver this season, means less playing time
for both Dave Hollins and Cecil Fielder. On occassion, Glaus will
start at third in place of Hollins, and there will be times Hollins
moves to first base, putting Fielder on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said this is the time to bring him up, Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``If you're going to bring him up,
bring him up now.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he talked to Hollins and Fielder about how Glaus'
presence affects them, and Fielder responded by saying he'll do
anything to help the team. Hollins wasn't exactly thrilled, and to
make matters worse, he made an error and struck out in the first
inning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he also spoke with catchers Phil Nevin and Matt
Walbeck about the trade for O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what they've done for the team, Collins said. ``They
need an explanation. Some people don't care (to give an
explanation). But Billy (Bavasi, general manager) and I didn't
think that was the thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably all upset with me, but that comes with the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, the Angels' first-round pick (third overall) in last
year's draft, was hitting .306 with 16 homers and 42 RBIs in 59
games for Vancouver when called up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect it, he said. ``I didn't know what was going to
happen. Obviously, I'm pleased it did happen. ... I can't predict
the future but I'd like to be here and stay here. I'll do whatever
I can in any situation they put me in.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make room on the roster for Glaus, the Angels
optioned pitcher Jarrod Washburn to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Brien, the Angels have a catcher they believe will help
them primarily defensively. The Angels have been happy with Nevin's
progress in his first full major league season as a catcher, but
O'Brien's experience should help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys (Walbeck and Nevin) have done a tremendous job,
Collins said. ``We got those guys to fill certain roles and they've
had to play outside those roles (because of Todd Greene's injury).
I think Phil Nevin is going to be an outstanding catcher. But at
this particular time of year veteran help makes us better.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nevin: ``I'd be lying if I said I wasn't mad or (ticked)
off. But some guys never get the opportunity to win a ring. If this
helps us out and it means fewer opportunities but I'm wearing a
World Series ring, I won't complain.
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels sending Washburn to the minors, Allen Watson
gets a spot in the rotation again, and he'll start Saturday against
Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is (starting) is where we can get the most out
of Allen Watson, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, as long as he's still an Angel. His name has come up in
trade talks and it was conspicuously missing from the roster in the
pregame notes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Randy Velarde went 2-for-5, including a double,
RBI and a stolen base in his second rehab game for triple-A
Vancouver Thursday. ... Ken Hill (elbow) threw off the mound for 15
minutes Thursday and reported no problems. ... Todd Greene will
start in left field for Vancouver tonight. He's ready to play for
the Angels now, but they don't have a spot for him.

CARDS  RIGHT TO PUT TRUST IN TRESTMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His mind is on one track. Football, football, football. He
thinks about it day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Marc, when's the last time you shaved? With a self-conscious
smile, he scrubs a hand over his angular face. ``Two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   We are walking through the woods, along a hilly nature trail
between the practice fields where he lives, and a campus dorm where
he sleeps. No time to sit and chat. There's a coaches meeting.
Players meeting. Another practice. Football, football, football.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the shadows of the pines, walking at his pace. Making
small talk, I ask him what he did with his 49ers stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Trestman, the Cardinals new offensive coordinator, says,
``We're still running most of it'' never breaking stride.
</P>
<P>
   No, Marc. Not the 49ers offense. ``Your'' old stuff. You know,
those 49ers caps and T-shirts and Windbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he says, aware the clock is ticking. The new offense has
to be in place by Tuesday. Three days later, the Cardinals play
their first preseason game in Detroit. He shrugs and keeps walking.
``It's in a closet somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman spent two restive seasons in San Francisco. He coached
Steve Young, the NFL's top-rated quarterback and Jerry Rice, who
led the league in receptions. In 1996, under his direction the
49ers ranked second in the NFL in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers twice lost to the Packers in the playoffs.
Trestman took much of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his second season with Bill Walsh looking over his
shoulder as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not an easy situation,'' Trestman says.
</P>
<P>
   An understatement. Everyone in the Bay area has an opinion about
the 49ers offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' Trestman says, ``is an offensive coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   One local sports columnist went on a radio show and offered free
advice about what plays the offense should call inside the
opponents' 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to the radio,'' said George Seifert, then the
head coach, ``and this fellow said we had to throw the ball into
the end zone. What happened was that Eddie (DeBartolo) heard the
program, Eddie our owner. And so Eddie called Carmen (Policy, 49ers
president) and Carmen called me in to tell me that Eddie said I
should tell Bill (Walsh, administrative assistant) that during the
game he should write a note telling Trestman to throw the ball into
the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The day the 49ers announced Seifert's ``resignation,''
management was asked at a news conference whether Trestman would
remain on the staff. The microphone was passed around like a track
baton until DeBartolo finally seized it and said, ``He's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Trestman was in Mobile, Ala., at the Senior Bowl.
The team didn't bother to fire him face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was coming,'' Trestman says, no trace of bitterness
in his voice. That was then. His 49ers stuff is in a closet now.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals play the Lions, they will unveil their new
offense. The so-called ``West Coast'' attack fits the team's time
zone and its personnel. Last year the Cardinals were predictable,
often unimaginative. In Trestman's hands, the offense should be
neither. Quick-rhythm passes. Play action. The plan is to utilize
all their weapons and spread the ball around.
</P>
<P>
   He was a quiet voice at San Francisco. ``Not much bluster in
him,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But this thoughtful 42-year-old former investment banker who
knows something about risk and reward finds himself in a different
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 49ers I didn't express myself in a passionate way
because we had a veteran team. I didn't have to preach concepts to
the players. They already knew what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a new group, his team. Trestman will call the plays,
initially from the sideline. ``The Genius'' won't be handing him
little notes.
</P>
<P>
   He won't say it, but I will. The 49ers loss will prove to be the
Cardinals gain. &QL;

EVANS WANTS ASU TO LURE LOCAL STARS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-EVANS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past four months, two things have kept Arizona State
basketball Coach Rob Evans from going home, kicking off his shoes
and settling into his favorite chair.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't had time, and he hasn't had a home.
</P>
<P>
   Evans has been living out of a hotel since April, when he left
the University of Mississippi for ASU, assuming control of one of
the biggest reclamation projects in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had no intention of emulating Utah's Rick Majerus, who
lives in a Salt Lake City hotel and excited the local tourism
industry when he flirted with the ASU job.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and his wife, Carolyn, will move into a home next month,
and soon after, the Sun Devils coach will step out of the whirlwind
of work to enjoy some peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little bit difficult living out of hotels,'' Evans
said. ``Once we get moved into our home and get adjusted, it's
going to be a little bit easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who replaced interim Coach Don Newman, inherited a
program that he views as a treasure but looked more like a landfill
packed with college basketball's worst garbage: a point-shaving
scandal, player misbehavior, an apathetic public.
</P>
<P>
   Converting that mess into a program that can compete with
Arizona, a perennial power, would be an astounding makeover. That
is Evans' goal, and he has spent the past four months pursuing it.
</P>
<P>
   Any returning players in academic or other trouble were told to
straighten up or find somewhere else to play. Evans and his staff
began recruiting immediately, placing special emphasis on making
contacts with local coaches and identifying local prospects. In
between, Evans made time to help coach the USA Junior World team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob Evans has worked night and day to put his program in place
and headed in the direction wherein we could realize our
objectives, to consistently be in the top three in the Pac-10 and
the top 10 in the NCAA,'' said Kevin White, ASU athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   Evans received help earlier this month, when Wells Fargo agreed
to pay $5 million to become the title sponsor for the arena
formerly known as the University Activity Center. That money will
help fund improvements to a facility that Evans was satisfied with
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have everything you need here to have the opportunity to
be successful,'' Evans said. ``You have nice facilities that will
get nicer. You have a nice city, a good league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is a question mark is that all kids look for
high-profile situations _ TV, the NCAA Tournament, things like
that. We have to do a good job of selling them that we are headed
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans believes a good college program begins at home. You get to
know the coaches and players in your back yard, and you don't let
the good ones get away.
</P>
<P>
   That was one problem during the Bill Frieder area. He never
successfully recruited a local player who made an impact, while
others such as Shadow Mountain's Mike Bibby (Arizona), Tempe Corona
del Sol's Lamont Long (New Mexico) and Moon Valley High's Richard
Jefferson (Arizona) went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Frieder, the state has more high school talent
now than during most of his tenure. Evans has already received a
commitment from Donnell Knight, a 6-foot-8 forward, who is rated by
most scouting services as one of the top 20 seniors in the country.
He also is recruiting forwards Tommy Smith from North and Tanner
Shell from Mesa Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and my staff have been very visible,'' Evans said. ``We hit
the ground running, trying to visit as many of the schools as we
could. We've had a lot of coaches who have told us they appreciate
that we've been coming to their schools and calling them. And you
have to go when people don't have players. Everybody goes when they
have players.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's difficulties under Frieder, who resigned nearly a year
ago, have had little effect on recruiting so far, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight would have considered ASU even if Frieder had stayed,
said his father, Donnell Sr., but the program's problems would have
been difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been more concerned if (the Sun Devils) wouldn't
have wiped the slate clean and started over,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU also is recruiting several players outside the state,
including Brian Wethers, a 6-5 swingman from Georgia, and Jason
Burns, a 6-4 guard from Durham (N.C.) Mount Zion Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the kids know about it (the point-shaving
scandal) until the people recruiting against (ASU) throw it in
their faces,'' said Van Johnson, director of scouting for Game Plan
Sports, a sports consulting and marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   With the commitment of Knight, Evans has the beginning of a
solid recruiting class. While ASU is high on the list of several
prominent players, Evans admits that means little unless those
players sign with the Sun Devils. Frieder, too, was a finalist for
several high-profile players, including Juwan Howard and Ed
O'Bannon, who went to Michigan and UCLA, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a real legitimate shot to get that player, or are
you just one of five?'' Evans said. ``You do have to get the
breakthrough players, but you have to put a high priority on making
sure you get the kids in your area who are quality players and
quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans has a reputation of running a strict program. At
Mississippi, his players were required to drop by his office daily,
and if they didn't fulfill their obligations, they joined his
``Five at Five Club,'' running five miles at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his plan to rebuild ASU's program is not only to win,
but to do it with players who won't embarrass the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a responsibility to these guys that they
not only become good basketball players, but good citizens,'' Evans
said. ``That's the charge that I have, and I'm going to be
unbending on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans is in a honeymoon period now, and with a thin talent base
returning, ASU figures to struggle for at least a season or two.
But fans are more likely to stick with the program if they believe
the players are good citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I won't support something if I don't feel like they are
good folks,'' he said. ``I always tell the players, if you want
people to come see you play, you have to carry yourself a certain
way.'' &QL;

KNIGHT INJURES SHOULDER, WILL NOT PLAY IN SCRIMMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Cardinals starting cornerback Tommy Knight thought
he was over the injury problems of his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Then he suffered a potentially serious shoulder injury in
Thursday's morning practice, the latest blow to an already thin
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how bad it is,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``He
will (miss) more than two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight will miss Saturday's scrimmage at Walkup Skydome and
undergo a magnetic resonance imaging on his left shoulder Monday in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating,'' said Knight, who was slowed by
shoulder and knee injuries his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's backup, J.J. McCleskey, has been starting at strong
safety because Tommy Bennett suffered a hamstring and hip flexor
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide whether to move (McCleskey) to corner or
leave him at safety,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   McCleskey said he has no preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where I play,'' McCleskey said. ``I just want to
make sure we have the four best (defensive backs) out there and
that we win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Also ailing is No. 3 cornerback Ty Howard, who is slowed by
arthritis in his left knee. That left Dell McGee, who missed all of
last season with a shoulder injury, as the starting right
cornerback in Thursday afternoon's practice.
</P>
<P>
   If McCleskey is moved back to corner, the starting strong safety
would be second-year pro Kenny Harris or rookie Corey Chavous, a
second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Pat Tillman, a seventh-round draft pick from Arizona
State, also could be moved there. He is playing free safety. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Second-quarter charges amid otherwise strong
performance sent shares in managed care specialist WellPoint Health
Networks Inc. down sharply Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint ended the day off $7.625, or 10.6 percent, to close at
$64. More than 5.3 million shares traded hands, or 13 times the
issue's six-month average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sell-off to a degree reflected simple
profit-taking by shareholders. Before Thursday, WellPoint stock had
risen 46 percent in six months. ``And it's always easy to sell
something at a profit,'' said Ken Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But WellPoint Chief Executive Leonard Schaeffer said he was
startled by the markets' strong reaction to his firm's earnings
news. ``I think it must have confused some analysts,'' Schaeffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint, which operates in California as Blue Cross of
California, recorded a second-quarter loss of $46.8 million as a
result of one-time charges it took to jettison its stake in a pair
of money-losing ventures. Schaeffer said the moves will leave
WellPoint poised for better performance in coming quarters, but
investors appeared to concentrate more on the here-and-now in
bidding-down the company.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint wrote-off $79.6 million, or $1.11 a share, from the
sale of its workers compensation unit, Unicare Specialty Services
Inc., to Los Angeles-based Fremont General Corp. Fremont agreed to
pay $100 million for the business, which WellPoint acquired in 1994
for $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also, WellPoint took a charge of $29 million, or 42 cents a
share, on the devaluation of 1.5 million FPA Medical Management
Inc. shares it holds. The troubled physician management group filed
for bankruptcy earlier this month, leaving WellPoint's shares in it
virtually worthless. WellPoint inherited the FPA stock when the
physician group last year bought a company WellPoint co-owned.
</P>
<P>
   The charge-related quarterly loss aside, WellPoint said earnings
from continuing operations rose 16 percent. Profit-before-charges
rose to $61.7 million, or 86 cents a share, compared to $53.4
million, or 76 cents in 1997. That growth resulted largely from
increased membership in WellPoint health plans. In California,
membership grew by 16 percent to 4.5 million, while elsewhere in
the country it rose 4.4 percent to 2.3 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer predicted that WellPoint shares would rebound within a
few days as investors have a chance to analyze the company's
position. In the meantime, Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs
each downgraded the company Thursday to ``outperform'' from
recommended status.

STARTERS ON LINE HUNGRY  
 ASU DEFENSIVE COACH TOUTS TALENT, DEPTH

<P>
   If drinking milkshakes at 3 a.m. makes Quincy Yancy a better
player, well, bring 'em on.
</P>
<P>
   With Yancy the likely starter at strong-side defense end this
season, the 6-foot-8 Arizona State sophomore hit the weight room _
and the kitchen _ often. He's up to 255 pounds, 10 more than last
season, thanks, in part, to some strange late-night eating
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milk at 2 a.m., milkshakes at 3,'' he said. ``I'd eat a
minimum of four times a day. It gets expensive, but if that's what
you have to do . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Although defensive coordinator Phil Snow says the line may have
some of the best talent and depth on the team, he also knows it may
take half the season to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Only senior left tackle Albrey Battle is assured a starting job.
Battle, who posted 44 total tackles and three sacks last season,
will miss his running mate, Jeremy Staat, who has moved on to the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The top returning player for the other spot is junior Ryan
Reilly, who the coaches agree probably has made more strides than
anyone in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a lot like (former Sun Devil) Shawn Swayda by
the end of his career,'' Snow said. ``He really understands the
game. He plays blockers well. He's strong, and he's getting better
at rushing the passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's biggest challenge will come from Junior Ioane, a
transfer from Snow College in Utah who recorded 11 sacks last
season. Ioane, along with defensive end Erik Flowers, a transfer
from Trinity Valley Community College in Texas, reported to the
team this week. Both have been surrounded by their fair share of
hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to them, the Derrick Rodgers of the world are far
and few between,'' Snow said. ``We know both guys are athletic, but
I don't think we can expect too much too soon. I think by
midseason, both will be good football players for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both played last year under coaches who were in Division I
programs the previous season and may improve quicker that most
junior college transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers is expected to contend at weak-side end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short time he's been here, he's already showed his
skills on the field,'' Yancy said. ``He's ready to go and is in
solid shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Ford also will try to win the job at Camp Tontozona. He
has been in the program for four years but has played sporadically,
never quite showing the consistency the coaches want.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing player in the end mix is redshirt freshman
Levi Jones, a walk-on from Eloy who weighs 270 and impressed the
staff last season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Malchi Crawford won't be back because his petition
for an extra season of eligibility because of injuries was denied
by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every season there's been a different set of faces, and every
season those faces stepped up and did their jobs,'' Yancy said.
``Last year, people thought we wouldn't be as good, but people
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do it this year, too.'' &QL;

game. He plays blockers well. He's strong, and he's getting better
at rushing the passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's biggest challenge will come from Junior Ioane, a
transfer from Snow College in Utah who recorded 11 sacks last
season. Ioane, along with defensive end Erik Flowers, a transfer
from Trinity Valley Community College in Texas, reported to the
team this week. Both have been surrounded by their fair share of
hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to them, the Derrick Rodgers of the world are far
and few between,'' Snow said. ``We know both guys are athletic, but
I don't think we can expect too much too soon. I think by
midseason, both will be good football players for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both played last year under coaches who were in Division I
programs the previous season and may improve quicker that most
junior college transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers is expected to contend at weak-side end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short time he's been here, he's already showed his
skills on the field,'' Yancy said. ``He's ready to go and is in
solid shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Ford also will try to win the job at Camp Tontozona. He
has been in the program for four years but has played sporadically,
never quite showing the consistency the coaches want.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing player in the end mix is redshirt freshman
Levi Jones, a walk-on from Eloy who weighs 270 and impressed the
staff last season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Malchi Crawford won't be back because his petition
for an extra season of eligibility because of injuries was denied
by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every season there's been a different set of faces, and every
season those faces stepped up and did their jobs,'' Yancy said.
``Last year, people thought we wouldn't be as good, but people
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do it this year, too.'' &QL;

   If drinking milkshakes at 3 a.m. makes Quincy Yancy a better

   With Yancy the likely starter at strong-side defense end this
season, the 6-foot-8 Arizona State sophomore hit the weight room _

TRUTH IS, DODGERS DEAL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ You couldn't make this up, not even on eve of the
major-league trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sixth inning of Thursday's 3-1 victory over
Philadelphia at Veterans Stadium, Dodgers general manager Tom
Lasorda left his box and walked into the dugout. An inning later,
second baseman Wilton Guerrero left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, there were wire reports that Guerrero had
been traded to the Montreal Expos for left-hander Carlos Perez and
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek as part of a three-way deal that would
bring Seattle's Randy Johnson to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem. There was no trade.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda went to the dugout to use the bathroom. Guerrero left
the game with a tender left leg. But with the zany climate of
tonight's trading deadline, everything has gotten blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does this stuff get started?'' said Lasorda, who did speak
to the Expos on Thursday about Perez. ``There is no trade. We never
talked about Grudzielanek or Guerrero.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lasorda is trying to put Antonio Osuna into a deal for
Perez, and the Expos don't want him.
</P>
<P>
   Expos officials would not confirm the three-way deal, saying
only the team that loses out on Johnson would go after Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The night was strange enough with the team heading to New York
to face former Dodgers Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo in a four-game
weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   And after playing horribly Wednesday night, the Dodgers (56-52)
came back with a solid defensive game and moved into a tie with
Philadelphia in the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But Raul Mondesi, who was 4 for 9 in the first two games of the
series, left Thursday's game after straining his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who struck out each of his two at-bats, will be
re-evaluated before tonight's game. But he is not expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good right now,'' said Mondesi, who was taken to New
York by limousine instead of the team bus. ``They say it's day to
day, but we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that appeared status quo was the
performance of Chan Ho Park, who limited the Phillies to two hits
and one run in eight innings to win his 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw pitched a perfect ninth for his 31st save overall and
eighth as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Park (10-5) has five victories and two no-decisions in his past
seven starts. He has a 1.10 ERA during that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his best outing of the year,'' manager Glenn Hoffman
said. ``He has been great for the last six weeks. With all that's
going on, we really need him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored twice in the second inning. Matt Beech (3-7)
struck out 10 but also walked five and threw a wild pitch that
enabled Charles Johnson to score the Dodgers' first run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added an insurance run in the sixth, when Gary
Sheffield singled and Eric Karros doubled him home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Park cruised through the Phillies' order. His only
real problem came in the fourth, when Doug Glanville and Gregg
Jefferies opened with singles.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard, who took over for Mondesi in center, fielded
Jefferies hit and threw to third, enabling Jefferies to take
second.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Rico Brogna
hit a drive to the gap in right-center that could have been
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Hubbard ran it down for the out. He threw back to the
infield and could have started a double play, but Guerrero held the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Karros screamed at Guerrero, but all was forgotten when Kevin
Jordan grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's mental lapses on the field have become more glaring
recently. Wednesday night, he tried to score standing up after
being faked by Phillies catcher Bobby Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's older brother, Vladimir, plays for the Expos. But
Montreal manager Felipe Alou is not a Wilton Guerrero fan.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna is earning $450,000 this season but will make $1.05 next
season. The cost-conscious Expos already have locked in closer
Ugueth Urbina to a three-year, $15 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos want Double-A center fielder Peter Bergeron, who is
batting .316 for San Antonio and is considered a top prospect. He
is from Massachusetts, but the Expos also like his French last
name.

DAAL `V' FOR VICTORY  
 PITCHER BLANKS CUBS WITH COMPLETE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Omar Daal has performed since the Diamondbacks placed
him in the rotation, it's almost a wonder other clubs didn't do the
same with the young Venezuelan left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   At just 26, Daal, who is pictured in the club's media guide with
a disallowed goatee, is on his way to cementing himself quite a
future with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher on the staff,'' Brian Anderson said.
``No doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal delivered a masterful complete game shutout victory, the
first in the brief franchise history, as the Diamondbacks beat the
Chicago Cubs, 4-0, Thursday afternoon in front of a near sellout
crowd at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jorge Fabregas, who called a brilliant game behind the
plate, received high praise from Manager Buck Showalter and Daal,
who said Fabregas played a big role in the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was arguably the best single-game performance by a
Diamondbacks pitcher this season. Daal (5-5, 2.84 ERA) manhandled
the heart of the Cubs' batting order, getting Mark Grace, Sammy
Sosa and Glenallen Hill to combine for two singles in 12 plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daal was the whole game,'' Chicago Manager Jim Riggleman said.
``He was outstanding. We didn't get him. Recently, he's been as
sharp as anyone on their staff. Our advance reports indicated that,
and they weren't wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The three dangerous hitters in the middle of the Cubs' lineup
combined to strike out five times, quite an achievement considering
Daal struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole key is to get those guys with no one on base,'' Daal
said. ``That way you get them to swing at your pitches, not the
other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal faced the minimum three batters in an inning six times,
including in the ninth when he went out having already thrown 114
pitches. But Daal got Sosa, Hill and Kevin Orie in order, the last
two on strikeouts, to close out the Diamondbacks' 39th victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks must win 24 of their remaining 55 games in
order to avoid losing 100 games. With Daal scheduled to start
another 11 times, the club's chances of winning the necessary 63
games suddenly don't seem so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, he can flat-out pitch,'' fellow starter Willie
Blair said. ``He's fun to watch because he knows what he's doing.
He watches the game and studies it. Since he's been in the
rotation, he's been better than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal did the little things so well on this day. He fielded his
position looking an awful lot like Greg Maddux, a multiple Gold
Glove winner who is generally considered the best fielding pitcher
in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   With Sosa on second in the second inning, Daal caught a drive up
the middle and got Sosa into a rundown between second and third
that was basically a textbook example. He also picked off Lance
Johnson off first base later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Omar and some of our pitchers and some of the
things they do,'' Showalter said. ``They hold runners, play their
position, throw strikes and work quickly. If you do those four
things, you don't always have to have a 95 mile-per-hour
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal got all the offensive support he wound up needing in the
second inning when Fabregas and Danny Klassen, who entered the game
a combined 0 for 29, had back-to-back two-out RBI hits.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White, who may have played his last home game as a
Diamondback, added a solo home run and an RBI single to close out
Arizona's scoring. White has been the club's de facto cleanup
hitter since injuries took out Travis Lee and Matt Williams. &QL;

IRVAN WEATHERS RAIN, TAKES BRICKYARD POLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ This is going to hurt, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It never got higher than about 65 degrees Thursday at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, nippy enough to send some shivering
race fans and unprepared media scrambling to souvenir stands for
unplanned purchases of overpriced sweat shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But the chilly day, which included a near four-hour rain delay,
helped Ernie Irvan grab the Brickyard 400 pole position with a
record-scorching lap clocked at 179.394 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, who broke the former mark (177.736 mph) he set a year
ago, was the first driver to qualify after the 2.5-mile oval
finally dried.
</P>
<P>
   He set a standard none could equal. But some gave it a valiant
try, including NASCAR Winston Cup Series points leader Jeff Gordon,
the 47th of 51 drivers to make an attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could only muster a lap of 178.324 mph from his Rick
Hendrick-owned Chevrolet Monte Carlo. That put stock-car racing's
poster boy on the inside of the second row. Dale Jarrett (178.596
mph) will start alongside Irvan on the front row.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan had to wait longer than anyone for the final results,
first weathering a lengthy delay, then having to wait in the wings
for another 90 minutes while the remainder of the field qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Uh, does it rain in Indianapolis in the summertime?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I could have gotten a better lap,'' said
Irvan, who has no top-five finishes, one pole position and is No.
16 in the driver's standings in his first season driving the
Skittles Pontiac. ``We did everything we could do. It handled as
good as it has since we've been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the motorhome (after qualifying) and just sat there
listening to the radio and biting our fingernails. We tried to
figure out who was going to beat us and who wasn't going to beat
us. Obviously, there were some heavy hitters still out there. The
one we were so nervous about was (Gordon).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to figure out a way to win this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan was one of four Pontiac drivers to crack the top 10
starting positions, equaling the Chevy contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an incredible lap Ernie put up there, especially
being the first car out,'' Jarrett said. ``He gets around here
good, and he'll be a guy to contend with here on Saturday. But
we've got a good race car, too. I think we've proved the last three
years we know how to get around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett won two years ago and finished third in 1995 and last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also knows one of the shortcuts to the winner's circle,
having won in 1994 and finishing fourth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our best shot at the pole,'' Gordon said. ``The car
was on the edge, and I didn't see any point in pushing it harder
and taking a chance on wrecking.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable absentees among the top 25 qualifiers were defending
champion Ricky Rudd (27th), Dale Earnhardt (28th) and Jeff Burton
(34th).
</P>
<P>
   Another qualifying session is scheduled today, which will
determine the 43 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan admitted he was a likely beneficiary of the weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, when the racetrack is real green and all the
rubber is washed off, is when it sticks best,'' Irvan said. &QL;

LATEST FREEWAY SHOOTING MAY BE HAVE BEEN RANDOM ACT
</HEADLINE>

BY ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a rash of recent Southern
California freeway shootings, a man driving to work on the Golden
State Freeway near Griffith Park was wounded in what police suspect
was a random attack.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they see no pattern to the four shootings in
the past two weeks, which in itself is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no method to this madness,'' said Detective Bob Lopez
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   The latest shooting victim, 21-year-old Raul Corona, was driving
to work at 5:23 a.m. Thursday when gunshots from another car hit
him in the torso and shoulder, police said. The Los Angeles man was
listed in critical condition Thursday at Los Angeles County/USC
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if this is just a road-rage incident or who
knows,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shots were fired from a green Honda Civic
carrying three Latinos with shaved heads. Both cars were heading
north near the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp when the shooting
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said he was driving on the freeway and all of a sudden
shots rang out,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said police don't believe Corona is a gang member and aren't
aware of any connection between the victim and his assailants.
Corona works at a sales job in the Glendale-Burbank area, Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Corona struggled to drive off the freeway
but his car crashed into a guardrail, at which point he stumbled
out of the car before calling for help, police said. He was
conscious at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police interviewed Corona on Thursday, but he was heavily
medicated and difficult to understand, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Sgt. Ernie Sanchez said investigators
don't see any pattern to the recent shootings.
</P>
<P>
   According to CHP statistics, there were 10 cases last year in
which someone was arrested or convicted for shooting at an occupied
vehicle. That is the average for the past 14 years, from a low of
three such shootings in 1988 to a high of 18 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting comes five days after a man was shot and killed
while changing a tire on the southbound Golden Gate Freeway. Don
Terrell Berry, 29, was shot to death by a gunman who got out of his
truck to fire the shots. Police still have no motive and no
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, a 3-year-old boy was shot in the head on the Pomona
Freeway in Monterey Park. His father, Thomas Simental, 23, also was
wounded. On Thursday, police investigating the shooting arrested
five people on various weapons and narcotics violations.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday whether any of them would be charged in
connection with the boy's shooting, said sheriff's Deputy Joan
Raber.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy narrowly missed being hit by bullets fired
Wednesday by 20-year-old Jesus Orozco and a 17-year-old boy
shooting at cars from their Garden Grove back yard. The two were
arrested for investigation of illegal discharge of a firearm, said
Garden Grove police Lt. John Woods.

</P>
<P>
   SANCTIONS-DEBATE (Washington) _ Congress and the Clinton
administration are rethinking the use of economic sanctions, a
foreign policy tool of choice for decades, as the penalties
increasingly prove ineffective or backfire. But it'll be hard: More
than 75 countries are now under sanctions or the threat of
penalties. By Eric Schmitt.

   MEXICO-ECON (Mexico City) _ Mexico's banking bailout needs a

</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-HMO-REACT (Piqua, Ohio) _ For the elderly and disabled
people of this city, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Medicare
HMO provided exactly the kind of aggressive, benefit-laden and
prevention-oriented care that Congress envisioned when they decided
to open up the 33-year-old Medicare program to HMOs. But Anthem got
over-extended as it hustled to lock up the Medicare market and
recently announced it was discontinuing its Medicare HMO in 19 Ohio
counties. The anger, dislocation and confusion among its elderly
beneficiaries says a lot about the dangers to come as more and more
managed care companies break into the Medicare market. By Peter T.
Kilborn.

   SCI-HOW-LIFE-BEGAN (Undated) _ The idea that life on Earth began
in the furnace-like temperatures of a volcanic environment has
received support from an experiment designed to reconstruct the

and then teamed up with the puppet on one of early television's
most enduring children's shows, died Thursday of cancer at age 80.
By Richard Severo.

<P>
   CALIF-TEARDOWNS (Beverly Hills, Calif.) _ The big Tudor house on
the corner wasn't exactly the old Granville place in ``It's a
Wonderful Life,'' and the man who lived there for nearly 50 years
until he died last summer was named James Stewart, not George
Bailey. But 918 N. Roxbury Drive, with its towering trees, wide
lawn and walled English garden, was a landmark on a leafy street
where the neighbors included Lucille Ball, Jack Benny and Ira
Gershwin. Now the house, which was sold in the spring for $5.6
million, is gone, demolished over the last three weeks by its new
owner to make way for an Italian-style villa twice as big, and all
that remains is a hole in the ground. It is just one of the latest
casualties in that affluent Tinseltown tradition, the ``teardown.''

   OXFORD-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ How low can it go? The stock of
Oxford Health Plans, the troubled managed-care company, was already
down and out, having fallen sharply last year when the company told
investors to expect an enormous loss. But the stock has lost about
half of its value in just the last few weeks. By Reed Abelson.

   THOMPSON-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ Bob Jeffrey describes himself as
someone who ``loves challenges.'' He has certainly come to the

   ALCOHOLISM-DRUG (Undated) _ A drug widely available in Europe
that may reduce the urge to drink is being tested in the United
States, which has 13.7 million alcoholics. Its French maker hopes
to have it on the U.S. market in 2000. Many experts on dependency
say the drug _ acamprosate, which would be sold in the United
States as Campral _ is badly needed. Only two other medications can
treat alcoholism, and both can have unpleasant or potentially
dangerous side effects. But others in the medical community argue
that alcoholics should be treated with counseling alone. By David

   &UR; WEEKEND (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MET-UNICORN (New York) _ The branch of the Metropolitan Museum
known as the Cloisters is, in every sense, one of the high points
of art in New York City. An impressive jumble of Romanesque scraps
and American prewar masonry, and a monument to American
philanthropy, it sits atop a rocky outcrop over the Hudson near the
upper tip of Manhattan. If location is one of the Cloisters'
outstanding attractions, the magnificent trove of medieval art it
houses is another. Burgundian carvings, illuminated manuscripts and
one of the greatest of all early Netherlandish paintings are among
the treasures. But surely the most famous work is the set of
tapestries long known as ``The Hunt of the Unicorn.'' By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-SHAKERS (Undated) _ The peninsula encompassing the
downtown area of Portland, Maine., is a pleasantly compact place,
with neighborhoods that invite strolling and a harbor full of
islands reached by a ferry ride that can feel like a vacation in
itself. The chance to visit such a manageable maritime city and do
a little exploring along the coast nearby lured my wife, Margaret,
and me on a recent weekend. But we also went out of curiosity about
a living link to an unusual chapter in American religious history.
For more than two centuries, a Shaker community has made its home
on a farmstead less than an hour's drive away from Portland, and
the six believers living there now are the last remnant of this
sect in the United States. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-OUTDOOR-DANCE (New York) _ A young girl dressed in a
scalloped tunic and kerchief jumps awkwardly on a makeshift outdoor
stage beneath the Queensborough Bridge in the late 1960s. Seven
shambling young avant-gardists spread the 1970s gospel of
fashionably untutored and untheatrical dance performance on a city
sidewalk. Ballroom dancers spin and fly through countless nights in
the parks of New York City in the 1940s and '50s. Charming
photographs from ``Stepping Out: A Century of Dance in New York
City Parks,'' an exhibition at the Central Park Arsenal Building,
suggest that outdoor dance performances have long been with us. But
those performances have changed a great deal, to judge by the
attractions offered by festivals this summer in the city and
beyond. By Jennifer Dunning.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Hometown favorite  &UR; Kenny Irwin Jr. nearly scaled
the Brickyard 400 mountain Thursday, qualifying fourth-fastest at
178.260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who leads all rookies in the drivers standings, almost
was too nervous to brave an attempt after sitting through a long
rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 20 minutes before I had to go out, I guess I was holding
my breath,'' Irwin said. ``It's such a big deal for me to come to
Indy. It's awesome. It's what you work for your whole career, to
get to a point like this. It's really neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin will start Saturday's race from outside Row 2, one
position ahead of surprising  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green, making only his 10th start of the season, is No. 42 in
the drivers standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to come to a place like this and be this fast,''
Green said. ``It's pretty cool to be able to see the front no
matter where you are.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Hey, cabbie &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; Dale Earnhardt has a cameo role in the movie ``BASEketball,'' which

   Ironically, the scene was filmed one week after Earnhardt ended
a long losing streak by winning February's Daytona 500. &QL;  &QL;

LA'S WOES POSE TEST FOR MERCURY  
 WOOLRIDGE LIKELY TO COACH SPARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the second time in five days, the Mercury face
the prospect of ending its losing streak against a team debuting
under a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Sparks fired Julie Rousseau on Thursday night,
team President Johnny Buss told the ``Los Angeles Times,'' and is
expected to name Sparks assistant and former Laker Orlando
Woolridge as interim coach for the final third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (12-8), trying to snap a four-game losing streak that
includes a 70-68 defeat here eight days ago, will meet the Sparks
(7-13) under the same circumstance it faced in Salt Lake City on
Monday. That night, the Utah Starzz debuted under new Coach Frank
Layden, a former NBA Coach of the Year, and beat the Mercury,
90-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I was saying after Utah, what a firing really does is
gets the players' attention because the onus really falls on their
shoulders,'' Mercury assistant coach Kathy Anderson said. ``They
don't have that excuse (for losing) any more. It makes the players
accountable and focused and excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake we made with Utah was things were easy for us at
the beginning, and we wanted it to be that way the rest of the
game. When Utah woke up, we didn't respond. That's not unique to
the Utah game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Phoenix led Los Angeles, 43-27, with 17:38 remaining on
July 23 and 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie, the WNBA's leading rebounder and
third leading scorer, in street clothes because of injury. But the
Mercury played like the trailing team, rushing its offense and
being burned in transition defense by guards Tamecka Dixon and
Penny Toler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make the adjustment well to how they would play
without Lisa,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie returned Monday in an 83-67 loss at Cleveland, getting in
early foul trouble and finishing with only 12 points in 24 minutes.
She had 13 points and 13 rebounds, her league-high 11th
double-double of the season, in a 77-68 win over expansion
Washington on Wednesday that could not save Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are making their second coaching change in less than
two seasons and the 10-team league's fifth. Rousseau was promoted
from assistant July 16, 1997, when Linda Sharp was fired and was
retained this season on only high school head coaching experience.
Her WNBA record is 17-20.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge, 38, played 13 years in the NBA, including 1988-90
with the Lakers. His comments after a 75-66 Sparks win at the Great
Western Forum late last season were taken as disparaging by Mercury
Coach Cheryl Miller and used as motivation by Phoenix in a
season-ending 73-68 overtime win that clinched the Western
Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dropping five of its past six games, the Mercury remains
a half-game ahead of Cleveland and New York (both 12-9) for the top
wild card playoff berth. The Rockers lost Thursday to Charlotte,
79-64. A Cleveland win would have knocked Phoenix, which won its
first three games and six of its first seven, to its lowest playoff
standing of the season. &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS IN A `SELLING MODE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Diamondbacks do make a trade before tonight's 9 p.m.
(Arizona time) trading deadline, it most likely will be a
last-minute situation, General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of bobbing and weaving going on today,''
Garagiola said. ``We've been in contact with a lot of people. It's
important (baseball) people know we're still in there and in a
selling mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why would somebody make their best offer Thursday when
they have until Friday night?''
</P>
<P>
   Once again Garagiola indicated any deal the Diamondbacks will
make also would have to include a minor league prospect and not be
a simple trade of major league level players. &QL; 
Roster move &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks on Thursday sent starter  &UR; Bob Wolcott, &UR; the
winning pitcher in Tuesday's 7-5 win over the Cubs, back to Tucson
to make room for reliever  &UR; Felix Rodriguez, &UR; who was activated from
the disabled list after missing 31 games with a right hip flexor
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Walcott's departure is that southpaw  &UR; Brian
Anderson, &UR; who missed his last scheduled start Tuesday with a sore
elbow on his throwing arm, got through his first hard workout
Thursday with no problems and should make his next scheduled start
Sunday in Milwaukee. &QL; 
Williams delayed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The return to action of third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams, &UR; who's
missed 13 games with a micro-stress fracture of his left foot, has
been pushed back to Monday when the Diamondbacks open a three-game
set in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was expected to rejoin the team in Milwaukee on Sunday
but will play Friday and Saturday nights with the Tucson
Sidewinders and travel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who worked out with the team Thursday in batting
practice, isn't especially looking forward to his two games in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you just don't have the same adrenaline going,''
Williams said. ``But as long as you know your purpose, it's OK.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Extra bases &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks' reliever  &UR; Alan Embree uses an abnormally small
glove for a pitcher but says he's going to retire it in favor of a
bigger model.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I'm throwing my split-finger change-up more, and I can
conceal the grip better in a bigger glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering into Thursday's series finale against the Cubs,
Diamondbacks reliever
 &UR; Willie Banks had retired 23 of the past 24 men he has faced after
being drilled in a couple appearances earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andy Benes, &UR; today's starter in Milwaukee, flew to brew town a
day earlier Thursday and missed Thursday's game so he would be
rested and ready. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES -- Professional football can return to Los Angeles
only if city and business leaders unite behind a single plan and
raise $1 billion from taxes, fans and investors, an NFL official
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Los Angeles is running behind Houston in the bid to
field a 32nd NFL team, said Jerry Richardson, head of the National
Football League Stadium Committee and keynote speaker at a
conference titled, ``Are You Ready for Football?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the NFL need Los Angeles?'' asked Richardson, owner of
the Carolina Panthers. ``Los Angeles is the nation's second-largest
media market and would be an ideal location for our 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But would I personally want to put a franchise here without
some guarantee it would be a success and sell out games so there is
no local blackout?'' he asked. ``If it was up to me, I would rather
have the games shown here than blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being blacked out is the last thing we want to see,''
Richardson told some 50 people at the event, sponsored by the Los
Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are two competing proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas is heading up the
effort to have a team play in a remodeled Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum. He said he took Richardson's remarks seriously and would
explore ways to meet with the other major contender, Mike Ovitz,
who has been pushing his own stadium proposal for the Carson area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to meet with Mr. Ovitz as soon as possible to see if we
can come to a meeting of the minds,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``It was
made clear we need to come up with one plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas and the New Coliseum Partners group, which
includes developers and Los Angeles Kings co-owners Ed Roski and
Philip Anschutz, have been lobbying the NFL for more than a year
but have run into some resistance over the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, with his show-business connections, was said to have
impressed NFL owners at their last meeting with his concept for a
``hacienda-style'' facility modeled after the California missions.
Ovitz did not attend Thursday's conference.
</P>
<P>
   After its September meeting, the NFL will begin discussing the
efforts by Los Angeles and Houston to try to become the 32nd
franchise city. Houston was far ahead of Los Angeles, having
resolved 95 percent of the issues raised by the league, Richardson
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is set for a franchise, so a 32nd franchise will come
at the earliest after 2001, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the $1 billion needed to get a franchise going could be
raised through the sale of seat licenses and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Garrity of NFL Properties estimated the cost to Cleveland
for a franchise will be $500 million to $600 million with Los
Angeles running much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goren of the Fox Sports Network said his company would
eagerly welcome an NFL franchise in the city, particularly since
the firm also owns KTTV (Channel 11) on which it broadcasts games.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the NFL has to act quickly on Los Angeles or
risk losing a generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that professional football is not here makes it more
difficult to recapture fans,'' Goren said. ``There are just too
many other things out here that people can do.''

EX-PARTY CHIEF IN BEIJING GETS 16 YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a resolution of China's highest-profile case of
political prosecution, state media reported on Friday morning that
a Beijing court sentenced Chen Xitong, a former mayor and party
boss of Beijing, to 16 years in prison for corruption and
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 68, is the most senior Chinese leader to be jailed since
the show trials of the Gang of Four, the leftists who were ousted
from power 20 years ago. Earlier reports had accused Chen of
embezzling state funds, taking bribes and abusing power to support
``a corrupt and decadent life.''
</P>
<P>
   In China today, a vast panorama of corruption has grown out of
flourishing businesses controlled by officials with broad influence
and few checks or balances. Even so, Chen's demise is an
eye-opening tale of seemingly invincible power, spectacular excess
and sudden fall.
</P>
<P>
   As the top man in Beijing's city government, and the man with
final say over building permits during a construction boom in the
early 1990s, Chen personally amassed a fund of $24 million, as well
as an extensive collection of private homes where he had a taste
for entertaining young female television presenters, according to
an internal report on his activities that emerged last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was implicated in a series of far larger financial
schemes that may have totaled as much as $2 billion, although the
sophistication with which officials shield their activities and the
secrecy that guards senior leaders makes an accurate total
impossible to ascertain.
</P>
<P>
   Known for boasting that his power was beyond anyone's reach,
Chen funneled millions of dollars to various acquaintances to start
business ventures. Last year's report said he also gave a
girlfriend and her family a total of nine apartments around
Beijing, at a time when housing was still very tight.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's personal empire only crumbled after a financial scandal
in 1995 implicated one of his closest aides, a deputy mayor named
Wang Baosen, who was soon found on the side of a hill outside
Beijing with a bullet hole in his head. It was officially deemed a
suicide, but secrecy about the exact circumstances of his death
inevitably stirred speculation about its true cause.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's principal mistress was apparently tipped off about Chen's
impending demise by his son and accomplice, and she fled overseas
with an undisclosed amount of money. Another deputy mayor, Zhang
Baifa, said publicly last year that her whereabouts are still
unknown to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's son, Chen Xiaotong, president of a hotel in Beijing, was
sentenced last year to 12 years in prison for taking bribes and
misusing public funds. The senior Chen's personal secretary, Chen
Jian, is serving a 15-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Chen himself was forced to resign in April, 1995. He
has been held under tight security ever since, while party
officials debated his fate in secret.

TIMES SQ. VAGABONDS HURRY HOME WITH NEW SENSE OF GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a gift rarely granted: to walk in another's
shoes, to feel the familiar road suddenly drop away, to know how
sore your feet get after wearing the same wingtips or high heels
for 10 days straight.
</P>
<P>
   For several hundred young professionals, displaced from their
pricey apartments on West 44th Street until Thursday because of the
Times Square construction accident, life over the last week and a
half has offered an eye-opening lesson in the unexpected
discomforts of being adrift in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't go home: It is unexplainable how much that
affects you,'' said Cindy Dupree, who owns an artists management
company and has lived for five years at 130 W. 44th St. After the
scaffolding collapse at the Conde Nast building on July 21, she
moved in with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the streets around the building site were reopened a
week after the accident, which killed one woman and turned Times
Square into an eerily empty canyon devoid of people and cars.
</P>
<P>
   But even after a measure of normality was restored, West 43rd
and West 44th streets between Broadway and the Avenue of the
Americas _ the epicenter of the accident _ remained barricaded. As
of late Wednesday, city emergency management officials were saying
West 44th St. would stay closed until at least Sunday, but they
surprised residents Thursday morning and opened that street.
</P>
<P>
   The word spread quickly among the displaced artists, actors,
students, lawyers and business executives who make up the bulk of
the residential tenants on a block dominated by restaurants, small
businesses and the Lamb's Theater. They came, incredulous at first
and then whooping with pent-up joy as they ran toward their
apartments with lumpy plastic bags in their arms and borrowed
suitcases bumping along behind them.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the temporary vagabonds of West 44th Street, it was
the little indignities that vexed the most _ the homely polyester
underwear bought out of desperation at the corner drugstore, the
separation from a much-loved laptop computer, the empty space in a
wallet where an ATM card should be.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the West 44th Street residents, who pay from $1,300 to
$2,000 a month for one-bedroom apartments, were self-conscious
about making too much of their brief foray into homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of every passionate account of being stepped on in
the middle of the night while sleeping on friends' floors, of
forgetting the answering-machine code needed to get their messages
and of blowing their diets in daily restaurant meals, there was
usually a mention of how petty it must sound in light of the more
serious human cost of the construction accident.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But then the passion reigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggravation I can tolerate, because I know a woman was
killed,'' said Kevin Dean, an administrator at New York University
Medical Center and another involuntary vagabond from 123 W. 44th
St. ``But after a few days, it sinks in that you are homeless and
it becomes demeaning and demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean's own mental state is much agitated. He said that claims
officers at Liberty Mutual, the insurer for the Conde Nast builders
that is providing cash advances for people inconvenienced by the
accident, treated him ``like a criminal'' when he presented them
with receipts this week for ``several thousand dollars' worth'' of
business suits, shirts, ties, belts and a pair of shoes that he
bought at a designer discount store, Century 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an upper-middle-class person who has responsibilities,''
he said. ``Why do I have to be hampered in my ability to fulfill
those responsibilities through the negligence of others? They were
attaching the negative stigma of homelessness to the very people
they are supposed to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual operates an emergency claims office at 1120 Ave.
of the Americas for the displaced and others damaged by the
construction accident and the virtual shutdown it brought to the
Times Square area. As of Thursday, the insurer had paid out
$311,381 to 485 claimants and had registered another 478 claims
over its phone line.
</P>
<P>
   John Cusolito, Liberty Mutual's spokesman, said the special
claims officers were providing people only ``advances based on
preliminary evaluation of their loss.'' He would not comment on
Dean's specific complaint but said reimbursements were based on
``an individual's normal personal expenses and what is reasonable
for the period of time before they're able to return home.''

LITTLE GLAMOROUS IN LIFE OF FILM EXTRA
</HEADLINE>
 - 1stLD-Writethru-LADN (Eds, qualifies annual dues amount with ``minimum.'' 2nd take
unchanged.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every day at 4 a.m., thousands of anonymous
Hollywood actors and actresses drag themselves out of bed to appear
on shows like ``The New Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit the streets early looking for the cryptic, Day-Glo
signs usually posted at freeway off-ramps for directions to the
set. They never speak once the cameras roll, their names never
appear in the credits and they get paid as little as $46 for eight
hours' work.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hollywood isn't the glamorous Hollywood people imagine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the extras, scrambling to make ends meet by playing the
file clerks, homeless people, partygoers and other faces in the
crowd that have made scenes look like real life since Hollywood
began cranking out movies eight decades ago. An estimated 15,000
union members pulled in $63.3 million last year from extra work.
Tens of thousands of non-union members _ who supply the bulk of
bodies when hundreds or thousands are required _ no doubt made even
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's legendary Central Casting is the dominant player in
the extras business, a Goliath to dozens of small, specialized
agencies in the field. But serious competition emerged earlier this
year when several industry veterans created General Casting to
compete head to head with Central as a full-service agency, an Avis
to Central's Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   General executives see a huge opportunity for themselves amid
booming local production. ``Central probably always will be the
largest, but the smaller ones can't handle 30 shows like we can,''
said Central executive casting director Robert Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   A few starry-eyed novices may remind themselves that John Wayne,
Dustin Hoffman, Robert Wagner and Patty Duke all started as extras.
But most are soberly realistic that they're just part of the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a screen test in 1942 and I got the message that I
wasn't going to be another Ann Sheridan,'' said Judy Woodbury, a
veteran of hundreds of extra roles over the last five decades. ``I
really can't complain about it. I'm making good, hard-earned
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other actors, extras often work several other jobs,
like waitressing, data entry, phone solicitation and delivery, that
can be ditched with the simple explanation of ``I've got an acting
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Extras, also known as ``background'' and ``atmosphere,'' work
for the very non-starlike base rate of $90 for eight hours if
they're members of the Screen Actors Guild and $46 if they're not.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, part of the Hollywood myth will come true. A
director will give an extra a speaking part, meaning the actor has
been ``upgraded'' and will receive the standard Screen Actors Guild
day-player salary of $576, plus residuals.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the upgrade artistically and financially satisfying,
it also means the actor or actress is immediately eligible to apply
to become one more of SAG's 90,000 members. Though the guild has
the somewhat daunting initiation fee of $1,152 plus a minimum
annual dues of $42.50, newly eligible are often happy to pay
because membership allows them to compete for a far better class of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, the extras' prime desire is that the
day's schedule go beyond eight hours to time and half, double time
and then into ``golden time,'' which provides the day's base rate
for each hour starting with the 16th hour.
</P>
<P>
   That's why extras don't necessarily mind waking up at 4 a.m. ``I
prefer a call time of 6 a.m. because then you get through the
8-hour base early in the afternoon and you start getting into at
least time and a half on most shoots,'' said Howard Johnson, who
has done the work for the last 15 years. ``By that time, you've
made a nice piece of change.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Johnson's secret to surviving 14-hour days without losing
his mind from boredom? ``I'm a puzzle nut,'' he said. ``I buy
overstocks, usually 40 or 50 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Union membership is required for the first 15 extras on a
prime-time television show and the first 40 on a feature. Stand-in
work _ which means doing little more than standing in one spot,
sometimes for hours at a time, so that cameras and lighting can be
adjusted _ is probably the most desirable not only because the
higher base rate of $115 per day but also because the work can last
for months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job and I'm very grateful,'' says Lonna Montrose,
who has done stand-in work for Lacy Chabert, Jennifer Love Hewitt,
Bette Midler and Dolly Parton. ``It's a lot of fun and not much
responsibility, because I get to dress up and I don't have to
memorize lines at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting directors say finding the right people is tricky. And
the life of an extra is far from glamorous. Most spend a lot of
time on the telephone to snag work for the next day or pay a
service to do it for them; they often have to bring several changes
of clothes to a set; and they often spend much of the day and night
cooped up in holding areas near the set.
</P>
<P>
   Extras can cause major headaches on the set if they make the
wrong move or start whining about not having their own hairstylist.
``I like to look people in the eye so I know that they'll show up
on time and not cause any problems,'' Teitelbaum said. ``If they
make problems, we hear about it right away and we don't ever hire
them again.''

EDITORIAL: A RIVER PARK GROWS IN MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers who fought for 14 years to create a park along the
Hudson River had every reason to throw themselves a party the other
night. They started with what seemed an irresistible vision, to
reclaim the waterfront for New York City's citizens by replacing
two miles of rotting piers and decaying warehouses below 59th
Street with an inviting mix of open space and modest commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
   They encountered endless obstacles, including inert politicians,
but on the last day of the legislative session in Albany in June
they got what they wanted _ a bill officially establishing the
park, defining its borders and setting up an administrative
mechanism to run it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the future of this noble enterprise is not nearly
as fragile as its past. But there is no park yet, and before there
is one there will be other challenges to face, of which three are
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The first is money. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani have pledged $100 million each to make the park happen,
but only a small fraction of that is in the bank. Both must push
for the rest in future budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The second task is to find the right talent. Under the
legislation, the state, which owns the southern half of the park,
and the city, which owns the northern, will lease their land to a a
new Hudson River Park Trust. The governor and mayor will each
appoint five members to the trust's governing board, and the three
neighborhoods affected by the project will appoint one each.
</P>
<P>
   These appointees, particularly the chairman, cannot be political
hacks. They should be people with energy, focus and vision. The
enabling legislation contains very sound guidelines about the
proper mix of open space and commercial enterprise. But there is
still room for an inept or inattentive board to err on the side of
inappropriate development and bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this being New York City, there will inevitably be
lawsuits directed at one or another part of the plan. Some of these
lawsuits may require adjustments, which is fine as long as the
complaints are valid and do not disturb the basic outline of the
project. But some fear that the park could suffer the same fate as
Westway, the proposed superhighway defeated in the mid-1980s by
endless litigation from community activists and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In Westway's case, however, there was no broad consensus for the
project. This time there is. It is also worth noting that the
Hudson River Park's supporters include many of the same people who
beat Westway. There is a very good reason for this. Westway, its
giant landfill and the development associated with it would have
divided the city from the river. The park will unite them.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every day at 4 a.m., thousands of anonymous
Hollywood actors and actresses drag themselves out of bed to appear
on shows like ``The New Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit the streets early looking for the cryptic, Day-Glo
signs usually posted at freeway off-ramps for directions to the
set. They never speak once the cameras roll, their names never
appear in the credits and they get paid as little as $46 for eight
hours' work.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hollywood isn't the glamorous Hollywood people imagine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the extras, scrambling to make ends meet by playing the
file clerks, homeless people, partygoers and other faces in the
crowd that have made scenes look like real life since Hollywood
began cranking out movies eight decades ago. An estimated 15,000
union members pulled in $63.3 million last year from extra work.
Tens of thousands of non-union members _ who supply the bulk of
bodies when hundreds or thousands are required _ no doubt made even
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's legendary Central Casting is the dominant player in
the extras business, a Goliath to dozens of small, specialized
agencies in the field. But serious competition emerged earlier this
year when several industry veterans created General Casting to
compete head to head with Central as a full-service agency, an Avis
to Central's Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   General executives see a huge opportunity for themselves amid
booming local production. ``Central probably always will be the
largest, but the smaller ones can't handle 30 shows like we can,''
said Central executive casting director Robert Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   A few starry-eyed novices may remind themselves that John Wayne,
Dustin Hoffman, Robert Wagner and Patty Duke all started as extras.
But most are soberly realistic that they're just part of the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a screen test in 1942 and I got the message that I
wasn't going to be another Ann Sheridan,'' said Judy Woodbury, a
veteran of hundreds of extra roles over the last five decades. ``I
really can't complain about it. I'm making good, hard-earned
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other actors, extras often work several other jobs,
like waitressing, data entry, phone solicitation and delivery, that
can be ditched with the simple explanation of ``I've got an acting
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Extras, also known as ``background'' and ``atmosphere,'' work
for the very non-starlike base rate of $90 for eight hours if
they're members of the Screen Actors Guild and $46 if they're not.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, part of the Hollywood myth will come true. A
director will give an extra a speaking part, meaning the actor has
been ``upgraded'' and will receive the standard Screen Actors Guild
day-player salary of $576, plus residuals.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the upgrade artistically and financially satisfying,
it also means the actor or actress is immediately eligible to apply
to become one more of SAG's 90,000 members. Though the guild has
the somewhat daunting initiation fee of $1,152 plus a minimum
annual dues of $42.50, newly eligible are often happy to pay
because membership allows them to compete for a far better class of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, the extras' prime desire is that the
day's schedule go beyond eight hours to time and half, double time
and then into ``golden time,'' which provides the day's base rate
for each hour starting with the 16th hour.
</P>
<P>
   That's why extras don't necessarily mind waking up at 4 a.m. ``I
prefer a call time of 6 a.m. because then you get through the
8-hour base early in the afternoon and you start getting into at
least time and a half on most shoots,'' said Howard Johnson, who
has done the work for the last 15 years. ``By that time, you've
made a nice piece of change.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Johnson's secret to surviving 14-hour days without losing
his mind from boredom? ``I'm a puzzle nut,'' he said. ``I buy
overstocks, usually 40 or 50 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Union membership is required for the first 15 extras on a
prime-time television show and the first 40 on a feature. Stand-in
work _ which means doing little more than standing in one spot,
sometimes for hours at a time, so that cameras and lighting can be
adjusted _ is probably the most desirable not only because the
higher base rate of $115 per day but also because the work can last
for months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job and I'm very grateful,'' says Lonna Montrose,
who has done stand-in work for Lacy Chabert, Jennifer Love Hewitt,
Bette Midler and Dolly Parton. ``It's a lot of fun and not much
responsibility, because I get to dress up and I don't have to
memorize lines at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting directors say finding the right people is tricky. And
the life of an extra is far from glamorous. Most spend a lot of
time on the telephone to snag work for the next day or pay a
service to do it for them; they often have to bring several changes
of clothes to a set; and they often spend much of the day and night
cooped up in holding areas near the set.
</P>
<P>
   Extras can cause major headaches on the set if they make the
wrong move or start whining about not having their own hairstylist.
``I like to look people in the eye so I know that they'll show up
on time and not cause any problems,'' Teitelbaum said. ``If they
make problems, we hear about it right away and we don't ever hire
them again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly the beleaguered Kenneth Starr, perhaps the most
detested man in Washington, doesn't seem so beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks the independent counsel has scored a
series of legal victories, and put Bill Clinton and the White House
back on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   First the courts gave Starr permission to question Secret
Service agents about the president, rejecting the claim that this
would significantly compromise the agents' ability to protect their
boss.
</P>
<P>
   Then he won the right to put questions to Clinton's lawyer,
Bruce Lindsey, overturning the argument that the president's
conversations with Lindsey (who is paid by taxpayers) are protected
by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, and dramatically, he at last secured an agreement
with Monica Lewinsky: reportedly, she will tell the truth about her
relationship with the president in return for immunity from
prosecution over any lies she has told about it hitherto.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Lewinsky has agreed to say is a matter of dispute.
All of the unnamed sources briefing the press midweek were
convinced she would admit to a sexual relationship with the
president, which both of them have previously denied in sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sources said that she would also make a more
damaging allegation: that the president and others told her to lie.
This would add suborning perjury and obstruction of justice to mere
lying under oath. Others said she would deny this had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, a lot will turn on which of these accounts is correct.
But, whatever happens next, Clinton's strategy of delay and
non-cooperation with Starr's inquiry seems to be going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel has not faded away or been hounded out
of town quite yet, though for a while it seemed he might be. He is
still there, and his questions still pose a potentially lethal
threat to Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Is that, as most people in Washington appear to think, a
deplorable state of affairs? Received opinion has it that the
charges against Clinton are trivial. Let's say he had an affair
with Monica Lewinsky: so what? Let's say he lied about it: big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Do mere improprieties such as this, it is asked, justify Kenneth
Starr's remarkable project _ a four-year inquiry involving dozens
of lawyers and costing more than $40 million, which has mired the
president and his aides in endless legal process, sapping their
energy and distracting their attention from matters such as running
the country?
</P>
<P>
   It all seems outrageously disproportionate. The opinion polls
sum it up: the president is hugely popular, and Starr is loathed.
Many conclude that a halt should have been called long ago to the
whole preposterous enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is wrong. Suppose the only charge Starr can sustain against
Clinton is that he had an affair with Lewinsky and lied about it,
first under oath (when questioned by lawyers for Paula Jones), and
later when addressing the American public on television.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, it would be amazing if the president were impeached in
this event _ not because of what the law on impeachable acts says
(the rules are vague) but because the public mood would not stand
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Only Congress, ever mindful of public opinion, can impeach a
president. Clinton would have to bungle things badly to turn people
against him if this is all Starr can produce.
</P>
<P>
   All that's needed is a brave recanting, a fulsome apology and
judicious mitigation _ he lied to protect Monica, sweet girl; it's
been a strain, but his marriage is stronger for it; if Hillary can
forgive (bite lip), why can't America? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   In our view, that would be a pity. Public opinion is too
tolerant if it regards with equanimity a president whose friends
are obliged to draw careful distinctions between different kinds of
perjury (as in, perjury in an unsuccessful civil case is all
right).
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, to have exposed Clinton as no worse than a
recklessly immoral man _ something that was pretty well understood
in any case _ would indeed be a meager return on Starr's
expenditure of resources.
</P>
<P>
   But in this event don't just blame Starr for the cost, the delay
and the distraction from bigger things: blame the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel is not a free agent; his actions are
regulated by the courts and open to legal challenge. Clinton and
his team have used this fact at every opportunity to delay the
inquiry, hoping that people would grow bored (as they have, up
until this week) or simply that the presidency would come to an end
before Starr did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being open from the start, the White House has
objected and obstructed at every stage, deliberately dragging
things out. That is one reason why the saga has gone on so long.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason, as the fuss over Lewinsky can lead one to
forget, is that Starr's inquiry has been wide-ranging, and rightly
so. He was first appointed to take over an ongoing investigation
into the Whitewater scandal and related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Received opinion emphasizes that Starr's best efforts have
failed to tie the Clintons to any Whitewater crimes _ so far,
anyway. But nobody could argue that there was no case to
investigate. Crimes were committed; friends of the Clintons have
gone to jail; Whitewater was not just Starr's fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr presents his report on all this to Congress, minds
may change. If he establishes a pattern of corruption and
dishonesty encompassing Whitewater, Lewinsky and points between,
the charge that he has crippled a fine president with a mischievous
investigation will be refuted _ and Clinton will be in the deepest
kind of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Starr fails to tie the threads of his
inquiry together, and has nothing to show for his investigation but
petty embarrassment for the president, expect a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Laws will be proposed to extend and entrench executive
privilege. The powers of the independent counsel will be narrowed,
if the office survives at all. Clinton's embarrassment will be spun
into glorious triumph over narrow zealots and right-wing
conspirators, terrible thought.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are that high, and the game is not over yet. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every Sunday a group of boys from Compton, one of
the bleakest bits of South-Central Los Angeles, team up with a
handful of Irish expatriates to learn the ancient Irish sport of
hurling.
</P>
<P>
   Hurling, a frenetic mixture of lacrosse and hockey, is a hard
game to master if you insist on wearing the ludicrously baggy
clothes of street gangs. Yet the boys seem quite fearless. Hurling
holds few terrors if you grow up in the drive-by shooting capital
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they have learned excellent ball skills from
playing the other game that fills their leisure time: cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for this is Ted Hayes, a lanky black with
flowing dreadlocks and a greying beard. Hayes is Los Angeles's
leading campaigner for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For years he himself lived, voluntarily, on the streets. Then he
built a village of igloo-shaped huts in the shadow of a freeway,
where the homeless can find shelter, give up drugs, and learn
everything from algebra to computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the city's leading campaigner for the spread of
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was introduced to cricket four years ago, when a group of
British expatriates asked him to play. He liked the game so much
that he formed a team of his own consisting of homeless men and
Compton street kids.
</P>
<P>
   His team proved so successful that he led it on a cricket tour
of Britain. This is how hurling came in. Two chance meetings _ one
with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the second with Mo
Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland _
persuaded Hayes that he should include Northern Ireland in his next
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But as he read his Irish history he concluded that cricket had
somewhat divisive connotations in the province. So he added hurling
to his team's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hayes wants to turn Compton's baseball stadium into
America's first professional cricket ground, giving international
teams a pitch in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles. And he
plans to create America's first museum of cricket and hurling. But
all this activity is driven by his passion for ending homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his silver dome under the freeway, a poster of Martin
Luther King above his desk and pictures of Queen Elizabeth and the
Queen Mother above his bed, Hayes expostulates on the evils of
America's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare handouts have reduced the poor to dependence, and
affirmative action has robbed the black community of its best
brains. Many Democrats have no wish to change any of this because
social problems are such useful weapons against the Republicans;
many civil-rights enthusiasts have no wish to change it because
their livelihood depends on the idea that blacks are helpless
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare state, he argues, robs the poor of their
self-respect by teaching them that they have neither choices nor
responsibilities. Restoring a sense of self-respect is at the heart
of Hayes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons sport is a powerful aid in preventing potential gang

contaminated by bigheartedness and commercialism.
</P>

   Cricket, on the other hand, is all about good manners and team
spirit, a point that he underlines by habitually addressing his

has drawn up an ambitious national plan to help the homeless
rediscover a place in society _ and he proposes to organize an
escalating campaign of civil disobedience until his plan is acted

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every Sunday a group of boys from Compton, one of
the bleakest bits of South-Central Los Angeles, team up with a
handful of Irish expatriates to learn the ancient Irish sport of
hurling.
</P>
<P>
   Hurling, a frenetic mixture of lacrosse and hockey, is a hard
game to master if you insist on wearing the ludicrously baggy
clothes of street gangs. Yet the boys seem quite fearless. Hurling
holds few terrors if you grow up in the drive-by shooting capital
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they have learned excellent ball skills from
playing the other game that fills their leisure time: cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for this is Ted Hayes, a lanky black with
flowing dreadlocks and a greying beard. Hayes is Los Angeles's
leading campaigner for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For years he himself lived, voluntarily, on the streets. Then he
built a village of igloo-shaped huts in the shadow of a freeway,
where the homeless can find shelter, give up drugs, and learn
everything from algebra to computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the city's leading campaigner for the spread of
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was introduced to cricket four years ago, when a group of
British expatriates asked him to play. He liked the game so much
that he formed a team of his own consisting of homeless men and
Compton street kids.
</P>
<P>
   His team proved so successful that he led it on a cricket tour
of Britain. This is how hurling came in. Two chance meetings _ one
with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the second with Mo
Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland _
persuaded Hayes that he should include Northern Ireland in his next
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But as he read his Irish history he concluded that cricket had
somewhat divisive connotations in the province. So he added hurling
to his team's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hayes wants to turn Compton's baseball stadium into
America's first professional cricket ground, giving international
teams a pitch in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles. And he
plans to create America's first museum of cricket and hurling. But
all this activity is driven by his passion for ending homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his silver dome under the freeway, a poster of Martin
Luther King above his desk and pictures of Queen Elizabeth and the
Queen Mother above his bed, Hayes expostulates on the evils of
America's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare handouts have reduced the poor to dependence, and
affirmative action has robbed the black community of its best
brains. Many Democrats have no wish to change any of this because
social problems are such useful weapons against the Republicans;
many civil-rights enthusiasts have no wish to change it because
their livelihood depends on the idea that blacks are helpless
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare state, he argues, robs the poor of their
self-respect by teaching them that they have neither choices nor
responsibilities. Restoring a sense of self-respect is at the heart
of Hayes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons sport is a powerful aid in preventing potential gang
members ending up in prison or on the streets, not least because it
introduces them to people who have managed to live beyond the age
of 20. But he thinks that American sports have been too
contaminated by bigheartedness and commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket, on the other hand, is all about good manners and team
spirit, a point that he underlines by habitually addressing his
fellow team members as ``gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   One shaven-headed gentleman admits that he was in a gang called

another shyly confesses that his ambition is to become ``the W.G.
Grace of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   These sporting activities, Hayes insists, could be a valuable
source of income for his various projects. (``You need capitalist
solutions to fight capitalist problems.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Disney company is making a film about his cricket team, and
Hayes himself is shooting a video, in which break-dancers perform
in cricket gear, to promote his son's rap record about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important than the money is the publicity. Hayes

rediscover a place in society _ and he proposes to organize an
escalating campaign of civil disobedience until his plan is acted

   PALACIOS, TEXAS _ Trong Van Nguyen sits cross-legged on the
floor of his shop making a shrimp net. His children sit farther
along, snipping and tying. It is two decades since Nguyen came to
the United States from a refugee camp. He has prospered.
</P>
<P>
   His net shop sits just north of Palacios in a place the locals
call ``Vietnamese village.'' Old women in large conical hats and
Vietnamese clothing sit on the steps of trailer homes, or on the
porches of the brick mansions that richer families have built next
door.
</P>
<P>
   The air is heavy with the smell of rotting fish. The Virgin Mary
and assorted Catholic saints stand outside every front door.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 or so Vietnamese living here are all devoutly Catholic.
Father Joe Pham Duc Trinh is their shepherd. People shuffle into
the Catholic chapel before dawn for his morning Mass, conducted in
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have been with Father Pham Duc Trinh since he was
their parish priest in their fishing village back on the
southernmost tip of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Children cycle around the area with their baseball caps
reversed. The priest sighs. As time goes on, he says, the children
are forgetting Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, healthy they become Texans, but it still hurts us
old folk...We on the outside, they on the inside: we see America,
they live it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when they arrived in Palacios, a sleepy shrimping town
of 4,000 people halfway between Houston and Corpus Christi, the
Vietnamese had nothing except the desire to get back, one day, to a
life of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with they had to make a living in other ways. Men got
construction jobs at a nuclear power station being built on the far
side of Tres Palacios Bay. Women found work in a crab-processing
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Those were tough days. Communication was hard; at first only
Father Pham Duc Trinh spoke English. There was economic tension:
the Vietnamese found steady jobs in an economy that had (and,
amazingly for booming Texas, still has) an unemployment rate of 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some ugly things happened; at places along the Gulf coast,
Vietnamese were beaten to death by white racists. By the early
1980s the Vietnamese in Palacios had saved enough to start building
small shrimp boats. They fished harder than anyone else, even
though by now there were fewer shrimps to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   The competition brought new violence: Vietnamese deckhands got
knifed, and their gear and nets were often sabotaged.
</P>
<P>
   Those days seem a long way off. Now, the harbor's best boats are
mostly Vietnamese-owned. A generation of Vietnamese kids has passed
through Palacios High School. This year, as has become the norm,
both the Valedictorian and the Salutorian of the graduating class
were Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Being Catholics has helped. Vietnamese fishermen are as eager to
have their boats blessed as their Latino neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million Vietnamese came to America after the defeat
of South Vietnam in 1975. Many were middle-class people who made
for the cities (80,000 live in Houston).
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen who staked their claim in Palacios had to struggle
against the odds. But the non-Vietnamese in Palacios no longer ask
who these foreigners are. They say the Vietnamese remind them of
traditional American virtues much of the country is busy
forgetting: family, community, God, a Herculean work ethic, and a
passionate hatred of communism. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinema-goers in America frequently make noisy attempts to
explain the plot to each other. It is a measure of Steven
Spielberg's mastery of his art that his latest film, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' has reduced even the most talkative of audiences to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour epic, released on July 24, has swept to the top
of the box office, taking in $30 million on its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have hailed the film as easily Spielberg's best. It is
also a milestone for DreamWorks SKG, the studio that Spielberg
founded four years ago with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Disney executive
credited with many of that studio's cartoon successes, and David
Geffen, a record mogul known for his close contacts with stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first new studio to be founded in 65 years, DreamWorks
rapidly raised $2.7 billion and promised to rewrite the rules of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much excited talk about ``synergy,'' the founders promised
to produce computer games, records and TV programs as well as
films.
</P>
<P>
   It confirmed a growing belief that the talent could now boss the
suits who run the big entertainment firms, relegating them to being
mere distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that did not happen. Instead, the studios poured money into
special-effects films, not just actors, and Wall Street began to
believe the entertainment conglomerates when they claimed that
content was a mere ingredient; the real value lay in distributing
it. And to cap it all, DreamWorks ran into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   One was that its grandiose plans to set up a new studio on an
expanse of marshland north of Los Angeles International Airport got
into trouble, leaving DreamWorks embroiled in nasty rows with both
environmentalists and developers, and with premises inefficiently
scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a more serious problem was the studio's output. Its first
film, ``The Peacemaker,'' a workmanlike thriller, barely broke
even. An early TV series, ``Ink,'' starring Ted Danson, failed
miserably. And the studio's first record release, George Michael's
``Older,'' did little better.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that ``Amistad,'' Spielberg's first film for his new
studio, opened to a lukewarm reception (and a distracting lawsuit
about intellectual-property rights) at the end of 1997, DreamWorks
was said to have spent nearly $1 billion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began to compare the new studio to United Artists, a
company founded in 1919 by another dream team _ Charlie Chaplin,
Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith _ which ended in
tears and a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' coming as soon as it does after the
DreamWorks team's success with ``Deep Impact,'' an asteroid movie
that has pulled in $138 million, has all but silenced such talk.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks will release two animated films before the end of
this year, ``Antz'' and ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   It now seems safe to say that Spielberg and his colleagues have
proved that you can establish a studio _ albeit one that still
lacks a permanent home _ with little more than your reputations and
your artistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, the suits seem to be in retreat. The
success of ``Titanic,'' the ultimate ``anti-suit'' film (because it
went so far over budget), has given every director the feeling that
he ought to be making three-hour epics costing $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the growing fashion for contracting out
production to small independent companies has further slimmed the
studios: almost 100,000 of the people employed in the business are
now freelance workers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the industry, the huge entertainment firms
look ever more like mere publishers, providing the talent with the
necessary money, advertising and distribution. And now Spielberg
seems to have shown them that he can do all this too.
</P>
<P>
   Two things particularly frighten the suits. The immediate one is
that costs may once again get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Chaplin and his colleagues founded United Artists,
a contemporary jibed that the lunatics had taken over the asylum;
there are some signs of this happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the star of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
will each receive 17.5 cents of every dollar earned on the film.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear is longer-term: that technology, and
particularly the Internet, is taking the skill out of distribution,
making it easier for the talent to control things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Saving Private Ryan'' also shows that the suits still have
some lines of defense. To begin with, the film is a co-production
with Paramount, which has the rights to release the film abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And DreamWorks's distribution system is still less competent
than its filmmaking: a glitch left many cinemas without copies of
the film on the morning of its opening.
</P>
<P>
   But the best argument for the suits continuing to sleep soundly
is, ironically, Spielberg himself. Put simply, he seems to be a
one-off. Of the 16 movies he directed before ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' 13 turned a profit (normally only a third do).
</P>
<P>
   Even more unusually for a talent, Spielberg seems to have a
suitish eye for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' cost only $65 million to make, a
remarkably small amount for such a grandiose epic.
</P>
<P>
   During the making of the film a construction crew mistakenly
built a set so that it was facing straight into the sun. Most
directors would have knocked it down and started again; Spielberg
chose to rely on clever camera angles instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes putting the lunatics in charge of the asylum is the
best way to get them to behave themselves. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinema-goers in America frequently make noisy attempts to
explain the plot to each other. It is a measure of Steven
Spielberg's mastery of his art that his latest film, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' has reduced even the most talkative of audiences to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour epic, released on July 24, has swept to the top
of the box office, taking in $30 million on its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have hailed the film as easily Spielberg's best. It is
also a milestone for DreamWorks SKG, the studio that Spielberg
founded four years ago with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Disney executive
credited with many of that studio's cartoon successes, and David
Geffen, a record mogul known for his close contacts with stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first new studio to be founded in 65 years, DreamWorks
rapidly raised $2.7 billion and promised to rewrite the rules of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much excited talk about ``synergy,'' the founders promised
to produce computer games, records and TV programs as well as
films.
</P>
<P>
   It confirmed a growing belief that the talent could now boss the
suits who run the big entertainment firms, relegating them to being
mere distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that did not happen. Instead, the studios poured money into
special-effects films, not just actors, and Wall Street began to
believe the entertainment conglomerates when they claimed that
content was a mere ingredient; the real value lay in distributing
it. And to cap it all, DreamWorks ran into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   One was that its grandiose plans to set up a new studio on an
expanse of marshland north of Los Angeles International Airport got
into trouble, leaving DreamWorks embroiled in nasty rows with both
environmentalists and developers, and with premises inefficiently
scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a more serious problem was the studio's output. Its first
film, ``The Peacemaker,'' a workmanlike thriller, barely broke
even. An early TV series, ``Ink,'' starring Ted Danson, failed
miserably. And the studio's first record release, George Michael's
``Older,'' did little better.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that ``Amistad,'' Spielberg's first film for his new
studio, opened to a lukewarm reception (and a distracting lawsuit
about intellectual-property rights) at the end of 1997, DreamWorks
was said to have spent nearly $1 billion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began to compare the new studio to United Artists, a
company founded in 1919 by another dream team _ Charlie Chaplin,
Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith _ which ended in
tears and a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' coming as soon as it does after the
DreamWorks team's success with ``Deep Impact,'' an asteroid movie
that has pulled in $138 million, has all but silenced such talk.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks will release two animated films before the end of
this year, ``Antz'' and ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   It now seems safe to say that Spielberg and his colleagues have
proved that you can establish a studio _ albeit one that still
lacks a permanent home _ with little more than your reputations and
your artistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, the suits seem to be in retreat. The
success of ``Titanic,'' the ultimate ``anti-suit'' film (because it
went so far over budget), has given every director the feeling that
he ought to be making three-hour epics costing $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the growing fashion for contracting out
production to small independent companies has further slimmed the
studios: almost 100,000 of the people employed in the business are
now freelance workers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the industry, the huge entertainment firms
look ever more like mere publishers, providing the talent with the
necessary money, advertising and distribution. And now Spielberg
seems to have shown them that he can do all this too.
</P>
<P>
   Two things particularly frighten the suits. The immediate one is
that costs may once again get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Chaplin and his colleagues founded United Artists,
a contemporary jibed that the lunatics had taken over the asylum;
there are some signs of this happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the star of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
will each receive 17.5 cents of every dollar earned on the film.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear is longer-term: that technology, and
particularly the Internet, is taking the skill out of distribution,
making it easier for the talent to control things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Saving Private Ryan'' also shows that the suits still have
some lines of defense. To begin with, the film is a co-production
with Paramount, which has the rights to release the film abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And DreamWorks's distribution system is still less competent
than its filmmaking: a glitch left many cinemas without copies of
the film on the morning of its opening.
</P>
<P>
   But the best argument for the suits continuing to sleep soundly
is, ironically, Spielberg himself. Put simply, he seems to be a
one-off. Of the 16 movies he directed before ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' 13 turned a profit (normally only a third do).
</P>
<P>
   Even more unusually for a talent, Spielberg seems to have a
suitish eye for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' cost only $65 million to make, a
remarkably small amount for such a grandiose epic.
</P>
<P>
   During the making of the film a construction crew mistakenly
built a set so that it was facing straight into the sun. Most
directors would have knocked it down and started again; Spielberg
chose to rely on clever camera angles instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes putting the lunatics in charge of the asylum is the
best way to get them to behave themselves. &QL;

<P>
   Most new head office buildings are designed to impress from the
outside: the soaring tower, the sparkling fountains, and so on. But
the newly opened corporate headquarters of British Airways, five
miles west of London's Heathrow Airport, is radically different.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed to impress the people who work inside it, chiefly
by bringing them into contact with each other as they move around
the space.
</P>
<P>
   BA is the latest company to wake up to the fact that the design
of head offices can have a marked effect on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   When Nortel, a Canadian telecoms company, decided to move from
its central, high-rise premises in Toronto to a converted factory
in the suburbs, it won over reluctant employees by turning its new
base into a self-contained town.
</P>
<P>
   It has streets, cafes, restaurants, indoor parks, even a Zen
garden. And BA is not the first airline to fall in love with indoor
streets: the head office of SAS outside Stockholm also has them,
full of shops and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   When BA decided to abandon its ancient office building beside
Heathrow's runways, Bob Ayling, its boss, made up his mind to
``move the office, change the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling (a former civil servant) has long believed that the
airline retains a bureaucratic hangover from its days in the public
sector. He wants to use the new offices to make a decisive break
with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside BA's front door and you soon understand that things
have changed. After passing the receptionists, lined up like
check-in desks, you walk between two giant wheels from the
undercarriage of a jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   The main corridor linking six small office blocks within the
complex is a village street, complete with cobbles and wayside
trees. The core of the building deliberately tries to ape an
English village square.
</P>
<P>
   Workers arriving from the basement parking lot have to walk
across the square to get to their office space. The aim is to
ensure that people's paths cross, easing informal communications.
</P>
<P>
   John Wood is the airline's director for the Pacific Rim market.
Like other BA employees, he does not have his own office. In the
two weeks a month that he is not traveling he uses a ``touchdown''
area next to the team area where his staff work.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, BA clung to old bureaucratic norms, with bosses on a
floor to themselves far away from their staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling says that when he wants to talk with one of his directors
he is forced to walk through the building, meeting people on the
way and exchanging a few words. ``I learn more in a couple of days
than I used to in a month,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The building is more than a traditional corporate headquarters;
it also houses a training department right by the village square,
complete with a mock-up of a jumbo jet's first-class cabin.
</P>
<P>
   On any day, 500 front-line cabin crew or ground staff are there
on a course. Ayling hopes this too will break down barriers between
head office and staff in the field.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than a world-class architect (in BA's case Niels
Torp) to make such an idea work. BA has invested K10 million ($16
million) in fancy IT; staff wander around with digital cordless
telephones that double as their desk phones. Employees can even
order groceries electronically from a local store and have them
delivered to their car in the garage before they go home.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by technology, companies are beginning to tear down
the walls of the traditional office. Andersen Consulting in Paris
has gone furthest, with its consultants flitting through and
booking space, with no fixed abode of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The price can be seen in the occasional sad cart trundling
around with an absent consultant's personal possessions. But a
revolution is underway. A new report by IDRC, a property research
organization, concludes that companies now realize that ``team
space'' is what is needed, since one-fifth of workers in most
companies operate in teams.
</P>
<P>
   Out go rigid little compartments and vague open plans; in come
team areas, cyber-cafes, and nice places to linger. &QL;

FLAWED DRUG POLICY LED TO TOUR DE FRANCE DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fascinating as is the season-long Mariner
deconstruction, it is, in a larger view, a trifle compared to the
virtual instant collapse of an entire sport.
</P>
<P>
   While professional cycling's premier event, the Tour de France,
is not something that foams the latte of the average slug-hugging
Seattleite, a recent trip to England and its extensive media
coverage of the race was an eye-opener to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   Now that most of the field has been investigated, searched,
arrested, jailed or deported, and the remainder has protested, quit
or is holding its breath in a corner of the Alps, the Tour
qualifies as perhaps the most self-destructive event in modern
sports history.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't kept up, the convulsions began July 17 when a
masseur for a prominent team, Festina, was busted for having
illegal performance-enhancing substances in his car. The guy
subsequently confessed, as did several racers, the team was thrown
out and hell was shaken loose.
</P>
<P>
   Police began multiple investigations, TV crews sifted racers'
garbage, cyclists staged sit-downs and slow-downs, and hysteria
turned the Continent into one giant Jerry Springer show.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable developments of the scandal is that
racers are being busted almost daily, despite the intense scrutiny
and legal carnage. The first thing learned by most American college
kids is that when a hard knock is heard on the door, rush headlong
to the head to make a watery deposit of any substances that might
be confused with, uh, performance enhancers.
</P>
<P>
   But most cyclists have so long used these goodies, which have
become a big part of many international endurance sports, that they
can't imagine going on without them. The familiarity makes them
oblivious to the most startling image of the controversy from the
outside:
</P>
<P>
   The angry athletes virtually shut down their Super Bowl because
their own rules and rulemakers are attempting to stop them from
continuing to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame, no embarrassment. They know they've been
ignoring sports law _ and in some cases criminal law _ but have
been willing to throw away France's biggest athletic event if they
aren't allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   However, the departure from most known conventions of civilized
behavior isn't quite as naked as it seems. The heart of the scandal
is not actually a drug, but a natural hormone called erythropoetin,
or EPO, which is viewed by athletes and some doctors as far less
sinister than steroids, speed and other provocative juices of an
earlier generation of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is produced naturally by the kidneys to promote production
of red blood cells, which are crucial in carrying oxygen throughout
the body. Since 1983, EPO has been produced in labs to fight anemia
for victims of kidney failure and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In athletes, EPO increases aerobic endurance and helps recovery.
Although there is some medical evidence suggesting abuse leads to
high blood pressure, seizures, diarrhea and nausea, the Tour racers
have so institutionalized its use that they claim to have managed
away the risk.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest and confession, the Festina team manager said,
``The objective was to maximize the riders' performance under
strict medical control to prevent them from obtaining drugs for
themselves in ways that could seriously affect their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument resonated this week in another way, when
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
called for a reduction in the list of banned substances at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This departure from the usual Olympic rhetoric of
test-and-arrest-for-everything is not just an acknowledgment that
the users are so far ahead of the detectives that justice is
improbable. It's also a recognition that naturally occurring
substances such as EPO, over-the-counter nutritional supplements
such as creatine, and ordinary medications such as antihistamines,
may not be harmful in controlled use.
</P>
<P>
   While they may help performances, the natural stuff is generally
undetectable by urine testing. Blood testing can work, but it is an
invasive, occasionally troublesome procedure. Most athletes tend to
be fussy about giving up valuable fluids before or after races.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, stopping doping with the conventional morality
and methods is flat impossible. Something must change, as the Tour
implosion fairly screams.
</P>
<P>
   The growing sentiment is towards acceptance instead of
enforcement. And the likeliest way is the creation of two classes
of international sport _ pure and open.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, competitors in the pure division must submit to
blood, urine and other tests to prove their chemical virginity. The
open competitors can drop the pretenses in exchange for listing
enhancers and subjecting themselves to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics would be a mess, but the new deal at least would
have the virtue of honesty, informed choice and public disclosure
that is utterly absent from the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no mystery prevails as to which division would
get all the media coverage, sponsorship and prize money. But at
least the quibbling over what sport is would end, and we would be
down to arguing price.

   Most new head office buildings are designed to impress from the
outside: the soaring tower, the sparkling fountains, and so on. But
the newly opened corporate headquarters of British Airways, five
miles west of London's Heathrow Airport, is radically different.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed to impress the people who work inside it, chiefly
by bringing them into contact with each other as they move around
the space.
</P>
<P>
   BA is the latest company to wake up to the fact that the design
of head offices can have a marked effect on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   When Nortel, a Canadian telecoms company, decided to move from
its central, high-rise premises in Toronto to a converted factory
in the suburbs, it won over reluctant employees by turning its new
base into a self-contained town.
</P>
<P>
   It has streets, cafes, restaurants, indoor parks, even a Zen
garden. And BA is not the first airline to fall in love with indoor
streets: the head office of SAS outside Stockholm also has them,
full of shops and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   When BA decided to abandon its ancient office building beside
Heathrow's runways, Bob Ayling, its boss, made up his mind to
``move the office, change the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling (a former civil servant) has long believed that the
airline retains a bureaucratic hangover from its days in the public
sector. He wants to use the new offices to make a decisive break
with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside BA's front door and you soon understand that things
have changed. After passing the receptionists, lined up like
check-in desks, you walk between two giant wheels from the
undercarriage of a jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   The main corridor linking six small office blocks within the
complex is a village street, complete with cobbles and wayside
trees. The core of the building deliberately tries to ape an
English village square.
</P>
<P>
   Workers arriving from the basement parking lot have to walk
across the square to get to their office space. The aim is to
ensure that people's paths cross, easing informal communications.
</P>
<P>
   John Wood is the airline's director for the Pacific Rim market.
Like other BA employees, he does not have his own office. In the
two weeks a month that he is not traveling he uses a ``touchdown''
area next to the team area where his staff work.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, BA clung to old bureaucratic norms, with bosses on a
floor to themselves far away from their staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling says that when he wants to talk with one of his directors
he is forced to walk through the building, meeting people on the
way and exchanging a few words. ``I learn more in a couple of days
than I used to in a month,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The building is more than a traditional corporate headquarters;
it also houses a training department right by the village square,
complete with a mock-up of a jumbo jet's first-class cabin.
</P>
<P>
   On any day, 500 front-line cabin crew or ground staff are there
on a course. Ayling hopes this too will break down barriers between
head office and staff in the field.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than a world-class architect (in BA's case Niels
Torp) to make such an idea work. BA has invested K10 million ($16
million) in fancy IT; staff wander around with digital cordless
telephones that double as their desk phones. Employees can even
order groceries electronically from a local store and have them
delivered to their car in the garage before they go home.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by technology, companies are beginning to tear down
the walls of the traditional office. Andersen Consulting in Paris
has gone furthest, with its consultants flitting through and
booking space, with no fixed abode of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The price can be seen in the occasional sad cart trundling
around with an absent consultant's personal possessions. But a
revolution is underway. A new report by IDRC, a property research
organization, concludes that companies now realize that ``team
space'' is what is needed, since one-fifth of workers in most
companies operate in teams.
</P>
<P>
   Out go rigid little compartments and vague open plans; in come
team areas, cyber-cafes, and nice places to linger. &QL;

FOR SEAHAWKS, IMPACT OF ALLEN'S LARGESSE SHOULD BE EVIDENT VS.
DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Friday night's preseason opener provides a first chance
to see what an offseason shaped by Paul Allen's money and Randy
Mueller's moxie has done for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   There's the new-look offense, with five-time Pro Bowl back Ricky
Watters, signed as a free agent, running behind a line that has
been bolstered by free-agent additions Brian Habib at guard and
Kevin Glover at center.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been a needed infusion of speed at linebacker,
with free agent Darrin Smith stepping into the starting lineup and
draft choices Anthony Simmons and DeShone Myles expected to improve
what were the NFL's worst special teams last season.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the vice president of football operations, sold those
players on playing for the Seahawks or selected them in the draft _
using the billionaire-deep pockets of Allen, still in his first
year as owner.
</P>
<P>
   But strong safety Jay Bellamy has another suggestion for
must-see TV when the Seahawks meet the Dallas Cowboys at Texas
Stadium at 6 p.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check the rookies' eyes after the opening kickoff,'' said
Bellamy, who made the club as a rookie free agent in 1994 because
of his special-teams efforts and is now a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be this big,'' he said, forming a circle in front of
his face with the index fingers and thumbs of both hands. ``The
rookies don't know what they're about to experience. They don't
realize how fast this game is played at this level, just the tempo
and explosiveness in a game as compared to practice or the college
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in for a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason to watch the opening kickoff, and each
special-teams play that follows on a field where the temperature is
expected to reach 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change on a Seahawks team that has been in constant
change since Dennis Erickson became the coach in 1995 is the
emphasis being placed on the kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rodriguez, considered the best special-teams coach in the
league, was hired from the Washington Redskins to right the units
that did so much wrong in costing the Seahawks at least four
victories during last year's late-season slide to an 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   He's not just coaching the special teams; Rodriguez is teaching
the players how to play special teams.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of running back Ahman Green, a third-round pick, will
be used on kickoff returns. The speed and tackling prowess of
Simmons, the first-round pick, and Myles, a fourth-rounder, will
come into play on punt and kickoff coverage. Wide receiver Joey
Galloway and cornerback Shawn Springs, both starters, will return
punts. Free safety Darryl Williams, a Pro Bowl selection last
season, and linebacker Chad Brown, a Pro Bowl selection the year
before, also will be key players in the kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   Drastic moves were made where drastic change was needed.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rodriguez isn't expecting a lot just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I want to do is make sure we get 11 guys on
the field for every special-teams play,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   As the circle of reporters standing around Rodriguez laughed, he
responded with an I'm-not-kidding glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You laugh, but that really is my No. 1 goal,'' Rodriguez said.
``With 80 guys on the sideline, it's chaos. Some guys are only
going to play a short time before they're standing there without
their pads on. So guys who aren't used to going in are going to
have to go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, it's chaos.''

SEAHAWKS REFUSE TO BUDGE ON OFFER TO WARREN MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Warren Moon can threaten to retire, but the veteran
quarterback can't force the Seahawks to budge from their position
on renegotiating his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a report that Moon said he will retire if the Seahawks
do not increase their one-year, $2 million offer, club vice
president Randy Mueller said Thursday it is up to Moon to either
accept the deal or settle on another option _ such as continuing
his holdout or ending his 20-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be too bad if he retired, but that's always been an
option for him,'' Mueller said. ``Does this change our position at
all? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are holding to their offer that includes a $1.3
million raise from the $550,000 base salary Moon was scheduled to
make, plus a $150,000 roster bonus he already has been paid. The
club also is offering $1.6 million in incentives that Moon and his
agent, Leigh Steinberg, consider laughable because they would be
difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given it a lot of thought, and if the situation doesn't
change, I'll retire,'' Moon told the Houston Chronicle in a story
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Moon said he was not even thinking about retiring and
Steinberg said it was ridiculous to consider retirement an option
for Moon, who will be 42 in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I'd ask for my release, but I don't think they'd give
it to me,'' Moon said in the Chronicle. ``Then, yes, I'll just
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said the club will not release Moon, who signed a
two-year contract last year to be the backup to John Friesz but
became the starter when Friesz suffered an injury in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, who has returned to his offseason home in Houston, could
not be reached for comment Thursday and Steinberg was not at his
Newport Beach, Calif., office.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller has not talked with Moon's agents since July 19. The
last time they communicated was early last week, when Mueller and
Steinberg exchanged faxed letters that restated their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without having talked to Warren, I don't know what I can say
about it,'' Mueller said, just before boarding a bus at the team's
Eastern Washington University training camp in Cheney, the first
leg of the club's trip to Dallas for Friday night's preseason
opener against the Dallas Cowboys. ``I don't know where he's coming
from or what their posturing is on this. I don't know what Warren
is thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's holdout reached 12 days Thursday. His teammates had a
45-minute walk-through at their training camp before flying to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him here. I don't want him to retire. I think he's a
real key for us,'' coach Dennis Erickson said. ``But if he decides
to retire we go with either of the Johns (John Friesz or Jon
Kitna), and I'm happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon mentioned Wednesday settling for the same two-year deal
that he first raised in interviews with Seattle-area reporters last
week, a deal that would pay him $3.5 million to $4.5 million this
year as part of a $7-8 million package.
</P>
<P>
   But the only proposal the club has is Moon's original request
for a three-year, $15 million deal that includes a $6 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't want to give me a two-year deal because
they're afraid I won't play next year,'' Moon said. ``They're
afraid I'll retire after one season and they'll have that portion
of my prorated signing bonus count against the 1999 (salary) cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon considered retiring after last season because of the
uncertainty over who might be coaching the team. But he reiterated
to the Chronicle that he is willing to sign an agreement that he'll
play the second year.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'' -- EXCERPTS FROM CRISTINA
SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  North American English-language print rights. 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the
world--Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to
the top of the publishing world, then switched to television to
create the ``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual, Cristina became well-known to English-speakers when
she began broadcasting her show for CBS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, told in three 1200-word parts, will inspire anyone to
do more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina
lost it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's
revolution. She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will
to work and to believe in her own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission in this book is to show her readers how to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERIES IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN SPANISH, slugged
BC-CRISTINA-SPANISH-BOOK-EXCERPT-NYTSF) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. She
lays down rules of disciplined goal-setting and shows her readers
how to follow them to success.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila
of Miami Sound Machine, of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior, and
finally of how he led her to become more successful than even she
had dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the longs and
grueling pace, the seductions of fame and influence. She also
counters her critics who say the show is too sexy, and tells for
the first time why she chose not to renew her English-language deal
with CBS.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'' -- EXCERPTS FROM CRISTINA
SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Spanish translation available 
 North American English-language print rights. 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't easy to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
</P>
<P>
   I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
</P>
<P>
   My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
</P>
<P>
   That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I divide my goals into categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Begin right now.

SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time--one of life's little coincidences--another
friend, a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he
was organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and
he wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
</P>
<P>
   One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos; I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
</P>
<P>
   But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered, and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
</P>
<P>
   One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emtable but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight--with razor blades--over
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
</P>
<P>
   That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
</P>
<P>
   We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
</P>
<P>
   I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
</P>
<P>
   That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth painting my toenails.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
</P>
<P>
   All I could do was laugh!
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Spanish translation available

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair--my entire
appearance--along with everything I had grown used to during the
past 20 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat and low sugar, and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
</P>
<P>
   Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blond and blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
blonde) to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
</P>
<P>
   Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no--ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races--Asian, African American or Hispanic--underwent to
alter their features to make them look ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathan Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
</P>
<P>
   So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   What I never understood, though, and what I never will
understand, is how it was reported in the trade publications again
and again that our show had failed and that we were canceled
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my Iife? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
</P>
<P>
   I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
</P>
<P>
   I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
</P>
<P>
   I did all these things! I completed those cycles.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

   Laser equipped battleships to combat nukes
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Stanley
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ High-flying laser ``battleships'' could be America's
best means of stopping a regional nuclear war before it started,
the chief technical advisor to Secretary of Defense says.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Mark, also a former chancellor for the University of Texas
System, said an early 21st-century fleet of the Boeing 747-400s
armed with high-power lasers that can shoot down nuclear-tipped
missiles could help stop regional nuclear wars and prevent others
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, who the U.S. Senate confirmed in June as the chief
technical advisor to Defense Secretary William Cohen, revealed the
Airborne Laser strategy while he was in Austin this week. The jet
could become a key part of the Clinton administration's plans to
deal with the spread of nuclear weapons as nations such as India
and Pakistan, which have fought each other in the past, acquire and
test them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force plans call for the first Airborne Laser, at an
estimated cost of $1.1 billion, to be delivered in 2003, followed
by a publicized shoot-down of a missile over the Pacific Ocean off
the coast of California. If Congress approves, the service hopes to
acquire six more of the planes by 2006. The planes are not intended
to combat intercontinental ballistic missiles, the subject of the
controversial, Reagan-era Star Wars missile defense program. Those
missiles rise into the fringes of space before plunging back to
their targets. The Airborne Laser would only engage
intermediate-range and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be similar to the AWACS (Airborne Warning and
Control System radar surveillance planes) and deployable in very
critical situations,'' Mark said. ``AWACS is there to manage the
air battle. The Airborne Laser will be there to handle the missile
threat over a large area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark said the Airborne Laser, under development for more than 20
years, would be a deterrent to a nuclear war by threatening
destruction of the country that tried to start one. Circling about
200 miles away from, say, a warring Iran and Iraq, the
steel-cutting laser could cripple nuclear-tipped missiles soon
enough in their flights for the warheads to fall back on the
country that launched them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 69, who still lives in Austin and commutes to the
Pentagon, was at his old office at UT briefly this week enroute to
California to watch the latest test of the new laser the jets would
carry. He has been on a leave of absence from his UT professorship
in aerospace engineering since May, when President Clinton
nominated him for the defense post, director of Defense Research
and Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He said he took the defense job to offer his 40 years of
defense-related technology research, in government and
universities, to help combat the spread of nuclear arms, as well as
chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A former secretary of the Air Force (1979-81) and former deputy
director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(1981-84), Mark said he hopes to diminish the need for the Airborne
Laser by helping find new, classified technical means of
discovering a country's nuclear weapon preparations, as the U.S.
did with Iraq, before the warheads are ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the means would be continued reliance on spy
satellites, the latest generations of which carry radars capable of
seeing through clouds, soil, sand and snow. As director of the
then-secret National Reconnaissance Office in the late 1970s, Mark
presided over some changes to the satellites that are still in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is classified but the fact that we're using it
is not,'' Mark said. ``We really want to know what the North
Koreans and the Iranians are doing when they test a rocket capable
of carrying a nuclear weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversial new prohibitions on the export of computers and
other technologies that could be useful for the development of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons also may be needed, Mark
said, as well as tighter controls over the distribution of
plutonium and other nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal job is to flag the things that ought to be
examined,'' Mark said. ``But this is clearly an issue over which
men of goodwill might differ.'' Mark is convinced, however, of the
Airborne Laser's ability to protect civilian populations and
military assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was introduced to the concept, which nuclear
physicist Edward Teller dubbed the ``aerial battleship,'' in 1967
when Mark became a member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory
Board. He has been following its progress ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Low-power lasers are commonly used in hospitals and clinics for
surgery and other medical procedures. The chemical oxygen-iodine
laser the 747s would carry is suitable for industrial applications.
Its concentrated beam, focused with the aid of telescope mirrors,
can cut stainless steel, titanium and other metals and is being
considered for such civilian uses as mining and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, the laser and its targeting optics are being
developed by the Air Force in cooperation with Boeing, TRW and
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force scenario for the planes calls for their crews to
detect and track missiles in less than two minutes and focus their
lasers on them for the five seconds it would take to disable them.
One problem the Air Force still is working on is gathering
worldwide data on air turbulence, which affects the laser's ability
to focus on a target.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said his job is to use his expertise to tell the defense
secretary what will work and what won't. And one thing he is
convinced will not work, in its present form, is the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. President Clinton signed the treaty,
which was drawn up by the United Nations, but the Senate has balked
at ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty should be revised, Mark said, to allow the U.S. to
conduct at least one or two underground nuclear tests each year to
ensure the workability of its nuclear arsenal, after completion of
the ongoing drawdown by treaty with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Without such testing, Mark said, America's enemies, such as
Libya's Moammar Kadafi, would know that its remaining nuclear arms
were suspect, since the radioactive components of nuclear weapons
have a limited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy for the world,'' Mark said, ``if Kadafi
had (working) nuclear weapons and we didn't.''

 &HT;    Here are some bad jokes to tell to others
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is a treasure trove of bad puns and one liners,
most of which seem to end up in my e-mailbox, courtesy of far-off
friends who obviously
</P>
<P>
   don't have enough to do at work. Here are a few selections I've
culled over the past few weeks:
</P>
<P>
   -- What do you get when you toss a hand grenade into a kitchen
in France? Linoleum blownapart.
</P>
<P>
   -- A city in Alaska passed a law outlawing all dogs. It became
known as Dogless Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Which famous golfer loves to drink wine? Litre Vino
</P>
<P>
   -- A man goes to a dermatologist with a rare skin disease. The
doctor says, ``Try a milk bath.'' So the guy goes to the grocery
store and tells the dairy
</P>
<P>
   manager he needs enough milk to take a bath. The dairy guys ask
``You want that pasteurized?'' ``Nah, the man replied, ``Up to my
chin should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- What's the difference between an angry circus owner and a

 &HT;    Raunchy comic Carrington `bad boy of Nashville'
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HBO wants to talk about a sitcom. Album sales are climbing.
Comedy club gigs have him rolling in the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Carrington can feel it. He's on the verge of something
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel a rumble,'' says Carrington. ``I just need that one
big thing to push me over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a plan,'' he says with a mischievous smirk. ``I want a
million people to like me and pay me $10 a year for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he probably won't get paradise in an installment plan.
But it might not take that much for Carrington to be comedy's next
big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years of touring have built a loyal following for the
28-year-old married father of two boys from Tulsa, Okla. Comedy
club audiences are now shouting requests for their favorite bits of
his raunchy brand of guitar-slingin', good ol' boy humor. Millions
have heard him perform songs during regular spots on radio's
syndicated Bob and Tom Show. He's done segments on A&AMP;E's Evening at
the Improv and NBC's Friday Night Videos. And his new album,
Hangin' With Rodney, has sold almost 20,000 copies in less than two
months _ impressive numbers for any debut comedy album that doesn't
have a huge promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, since at least half of his best material is strictly
for adults. Jokes about bodily functions, anatomically correct
snowmen, sexually transmitted diseases. That sort of thing. This
ain't your father's Jeff Foxworthy or Jerry Clower album. Think
instead of a raw, countryfied Redd Foxx in a cowboy hat and a Texas
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington does have less raunchy material, but even then it
tends to be hilariously scatological. Such as this bit about his
infrequent churchgoing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with going to church once a year is you got all
those righteous people who go every day lookin' at you like, `What
are you doing here? Feeling guilty about something? You can't just
make it up in one day!' Get off my case, lady, I'm just here for
the wine and bread, for god sakes. And the preacher, he always
wants to point you out, don't he? (As the preacher) `WE GOT SOME
NEW PEOPLE HERE TODAY WITH US!' We ain't new, mister, we were here
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a little dismayed about the parental advisory sticker on
the front of the CD. The way he figures it, the stuff he talks
about is the way most people think but rarely speak of in mixed
company. You can hear audible gasps on the album at the beginning,
before audience members buy into the concept. He dutifully chides
them: ``Comedy club, chuckle chuckle, y'all. Don't get all bent out
of shape!'' It helps break the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you don't offend people in some shape or form, you
haven't really done your job or your aren't doing it right,''
Carrington said. ``I like a little shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville never had an album with a (parental advisory)
sticker on it,'' Carrington says. ``Country music and Nashville are
about family values, but behind the scenes those people are as
regular as I am. My humor is what makes me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been those who have advised Carrington to tone
it down in order to make the big push into TV and widespread
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to clean it up,'' he said. ``I want to do what it
is that I do. If I become known as the bad boy of comedy in
Nashville, well, I'm not sure I want that, but if so, so be it.''

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ The initial phase of the telecom technology
upgrade, known as local number portability (LNP), should be in
place in the nation's top 100 markets by the end of the year. In
due course, number portability should expand from current
capabilities _ to keep a number when you change local providers _
to span services in any of the 50 states. (Glass, Cox News Service)
MOVED 7/30.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Even after the Capitol shootings, Congress does
not wonder whether it might knit up a seamless system to care for,
and about, the mentally ill. And it insists upon a slovenliness in
firearms management that makes it no trick for a man who has been
delusional for years to pick up a gun and go hunting his devils.
(Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ When the states, citing reform, washed
their hands of responsibility for the mental health system, the
federal government declined to step in. Those decisions caught up
with us the other day at the Capitol when two cops were gunned down
by an abuse posing as a reform. A grateful Congress is naming a
door for the cops. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ A recent New York Times review of the Richard
Ellis book ``Imagining Atlantis'' caught my attention. What the
author and reviewer fail to recognize, in their literary efforts to
be academically correct, is that Atlantis does exist in the minds
of every adventurer and dreamer who ever lived. (Kleinberg, Cox

and one liners, most of which seem to end up in my e-mailbox,
courtesy of far-off friends who obviously don't have enough to do
at work. Here are a few selections I've culled over the past few
weeks: (list of really bad jokes follows). (Borders, Nacogdoches

 &HT;    Ely's coming: Texan bringing his spicy blues mix to Kravis
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 25 years on the road, Joe Ely has performed his rich blend of
Tex-Mex country music at plenty of weird gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a biker bar in Norway once, inside the Arctic
Circle,'' the 51-year-old native of Amarillo, Texas, remembered.
``By the second song, everyone had their clothes off and were
making love on the floor. The guys in the band were looking at
their instruments and saying, like, `Hey, don't mind us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me started about weird gigs . . . Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Joe. Whatever you say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played another show, another biker gig where everyone had a
gun sticking out of the front of their pants. We were out in the
field on a cotton farm in the middle of west Texas, about 300
people. There was this big feud between two rival groups. Sort of
the opposite from the Norway thing. Maybe we should have told them
to just take off their guns and make love, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, cheap stunts won't be necessary to entertain his
audience. All Ely needs is to peel open his song book from more
than a dozen albums and let the menagerie of characters romp
through his gritty landscape. It's a place where gamblers, cowboys,
murderous women and rowdy diners feel nice and comfy. A place where
Christmas lights stay up all year, and desperadoes ride high on the
ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of his latest album, ``Twistin' in the Wind.''
Released in May, the dozen tracks, all written or co-written by
Ely, feature such tales as the waitress who takes no guff from a
band of thirsty cowboys in ``Nacho Mama'' or a heartbroken
Louisiana gravel-pit worker in ``Workin' for the Man.'' Then,
there's the raucous and funny ``If I Could Teach My Chihuahua to
Sing,'' in which a destitute hombre brainstorms about how to make a
little dinero:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could teach my chihuahua to sing/What a wonderful world
it would be/I could take her to the border/And teach her how to
order/margaritas and fajitas, senoritas would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Such songs have been his style since his solo debut album in
1977. A spicy mix of folk, rock, country and Texas blues has
flavored his tales of busted dreams, romantic woe and more than a
few rough characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always fashioned a song around how it feels, not around a
certain style,'' Ely said Monday from his hotel room in Myrtle
Beach, S.C., where he was playing a gig. ``All the musicians on the
album have a pretty wide palette of instruments, from flamenco to
steel guitar, and I trust them to know what to do. The song itself
tells me how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His past few albums have leaned heavily on a cross between
country and flamenco flavors, a style Ely wryly dubs as
``flamenco-billy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ely, it's a sound that Nashville and country
radio treat like the plague, a style heard only in watered-down
tones in an occasional George Strait song.
</P>
<P>
   His most high-profile effort of late was his reunion with
longtime pals Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock for the song
``South Wind of Summer'' on ``The Horse Whisperer'' soundtrack. The
three musicians formed the core of the Flatlanders, a legendary
group that released only one album on eight-track in 1972, but
which influenced many of the groups that emerged out of the Austin,
Texas, club scene.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of commercial acceptance of his solo efforts is a
reality Ely accepts. Huge album sales have never been part of his
career, although critics have praised his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either been a good thing or bad thing that I never really
listened to country throughout my life,'' he said. ``I know how
Nashville works and how everyone jumps on the bandwagon of what
works. That's something I can't do. I wouldn't know what to do with
a lot of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ely has a fondness for the ``soul of country music and
the tradition of telling stories'' fostered by such artists as Lyle
Lovett, Steve Earle, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom T. Hall told me one time that some people go around the
world and don't see a thing, while some go around the block and see
the whole world,'' he said. ``I like to think I fit in the latter
category.''

 &HT;    McCain riding high off first top 40 hit
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let the title of his current album fool you: There's
nothing misguided about Edwin McCain's career these days.
</P>
<P>
   After years of working his way through the Southeastern club
circuit and seeing his debut album, ``Honor Among Thieves,'' sell a
respectable but hardly earth-shattering 400,000 copies, the South
Carolina singer-songwriter seemed destined for a life of modest
success. A slow initial response to his second album, ``Misguided
Roses,'' released in July 1997, confirmed the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the producers of the TV teen sensation ``Dawson's Creek''
took notice of one of ``Misguided's'' cuts, a tortured romantic
ballad called ``I'll Be.'' It aired on the series' season finale on
May 19. Within weeks, McCain, who will appear at the Carefree
Theatre in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Aug. 2, had a breakthrough hit
_ with the song still holding onto the No. 9 spot on Billboard's
Adult Top 40 charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible feeling of relief,'' McCain, 28, says of
his recent good fortune, speaking by phone during a tour break. ``A
sense of `Whew. . . . I don't have to get my pizza (delivery) job
back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for the song, already a staple at summer weddings, McCain
says there's more to it than the heartbreak on the surface. ``It is
a love song, and it was written for someone, but the content is not
romantically charged,'' he explains. ``The metaphor of a
relationship is there, but this song is more of a
pull-myself-up-by-my-bootstraps situation, where I was really
burned out after the first record and a little disillusioned and
jaded.''
</P>
<P>
   That McCain should have had such a tough road is a mystery,
given his potent combination of earthy vocals and sensitive
songmanship: Think James Taylor with a few beers under his belt.
McCain also had the benefit of being part of the Southeast's
band-rich scene: Hootie and the Blowfish's Darius Rucker even did a
guest solo on his first album.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McCain sees much of a musical link among the region's
many acts. ``I don't think it's necessarily a defined sound as it
is more about good songwriting,'' he says. ``Whether it's Matchbox
20 writing good alternative songs or me and the Hootie guys writing
good pop songs or folk songs or whatever you want to call them.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain seems a little confused about his musical identity,
it's only because ``I'll Be'' has crossed so many radio formats.
``All of a sudden, I'm in pop land, playing next to Shania Twain
and the Backstreet Boys,'' he kids.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is no stranger to Palm Beach County, having come here
with his band for a SunFest gig a few years ago. He returned to the
festival this past spring, when he sang lead vocals with Frogwings,
an all-star jam band put together by Allman Brothers Band drummer
(and Jupiter resident) Butch Trucks. ``Butch is such a big brother
and friend to me . . . he worries about me and my career,'' McCain
says.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's own band hardly fits the jam mold _ and he makes no
apologies for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not into 20-minute improvisations,'' he concludes.
``We're about songs.''
</P>

 &HT;    WOODWORKING COLUMN:
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always good to see people who jump right into a woodworking
project, but the frustrations that can result are often sad.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of woeful plaints off the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make a frame for my record album, and since I
can't find a perfect square frame, I have to make my own. I'm using
four equal pieces of quarter molding for the sides. So, I've
routered everything, sanded, etc. But when I try to nail two pieces
together at the corners with a congrouvated nail (is that the right
word?), the pieces move, because the underside is round. I get
someone to hold the pieces in a right-angled box for support, but
when I hammer the metal in, it still slips. Does anyone know how to
fix this? Thanks! Brandon B.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me for not fixing the ``congrouvated nail,'' but it's too
priceless to tamper with. Brandon's chief problem, of course, is
that it's virtually impossible to put together a frame without a
frame clamp of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   One assumes, although he doesn't say, that he's mitering the
ends of the frame pieces. This has to be done with great accuracy.
Then, to do a really nice job, the ends ought to be covered with
glue _ not too much _ and the glue allowed to seep into the end
grain and dry. Then the ends should be glued again and the whole
thing placed in a frame clamp.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of different frame clamps on the market, but
since it appears that Brandon wants to make just one frame, a
fabric band clamp may be his cheapest solution. The type with hard
corners that run on threaded rods is better, but the last time I
looked, one of those runs about $20.
</P>
<P>
   With the fabric band clamp, you have to make sure the frame is
square before the glue sets. To do this, take two small sticks,
hold them together side by side, put them inside the frame, then
expand them until one end of each meets in an opposite corner of
the frame. Holding this position firmly so their combined length
doesn't change, pull them out and put them back in the frame the
other way, touching the other two opposing corners. If the sticks
are too long to go in that way, or if they fit poorly, nudge the
pieces around a little. When the same stick length fits perfectly
both ways, the frame is square. People who build lots of frames
generally build a permanent jig like this to test their frames.
</P>
<P>
   When the glue is dry, take the frame out of the frame clamp.
Using bar clamps or C-clamps, secure one corner to a work surface
and with a wire bit, drill a starter hole for a brad of the
appropriate length at a 90-degree angle on the outside of one side
of the corner. Tap the brad into place. There are inexpensive
devices made for seating these brads without hammering if you're
going to make more than one frame. Do this on each corner.
</P>
<P>
   That should be sufficient for the average frame, if it isn't
going to hold anything especially heavy. One does have to wonder,
however, where Brandon has been looking for ready-made frames.
</P>
<P>
   Next, from someone who doesn't sign a name, comes this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is cedar difficult to resaw? I've cut fir, pine and mahogany
with perfect results using a Suffolk blade(in a bandsaw), but cedar
cuts with a bow in it top to bottom and jams the saw.''
</P>
<P>
   What this individual has never cut before, obviously, is wet
wood. Cedar is an extremely soft wood and when dry it will cut like
butter. However, any wood when thick and wet will close up on a
bandsaw blade and hold it in a death grip. I've had to cut several
blades off my bandsaw and throw them _ and the piece of wood _ into
the trash, with many a good-natured laugh and a merry whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid a disaster like this is to immediately jam
something like a screwdriver blade into the kerf before the binding
starts. If the cut is a long one, that may not suffice, either.
Unless Anonymous is a woodturner, he'll do well to let his cedar
dry before he resaws it. If he's a turner, best to use a chain saw.

 &HT;    Stamp helps stamp out breast cancer
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What better way to help stamp out breast cancer than a breast
cancer stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A new first-class stamp that will provide money for breast
cancer research went on sale Thursday, July 30, in the Miami Valley
and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp, which sells for 40 cents, costs 8 cents more than a
first-class letter stamp. The additional 8 cents will be divided 70
percent-30 percent between the National Institutes of Health and
the Department of Defense's Medical Research Program for breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the U.S. Postal Service has issued a
``semipostal,'' a first-class stamp with added cost. About 200
million of the stamps will be printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' says Judy Frost, 54, a five-year
breast cancer survivor from Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to find a cure in my lifetime and I believe
research is very important,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Jones, a postal clerk in downtown Dayton, says
customers began asking for the stamp Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She believes many Americans will be willing to spend the
additional 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women for sure, and some men that have wives or relatives or
friends (who've had breast cancer) and know what they've gone
through,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp, in green, blue, yellow and orange, features a drawing
of a woman with the slogan ``Fund the Fight, Find A Cure.'' It was
designed by cancer survivor Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, Md., and
illustrated by Whitney Sherman of Baltimore. CONTACT Meredith Moss

 &HT;    Student pilot pursues dream: Flying for Jesus
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Martin wants to be a missionary, but he says he can't
preach.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Hobe Sound resident plans to be a bush pilot for God.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 23, dreams of flying small, single-engine planes to
nearly inaccessible areas in forgotten parts of the world to serve
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to landing on make-shift airstrips in
unpredictable weather to bring Bibles, medicine and supplies to
missionaries in the field.
</P>
<P>
   He wants his plane to be an air ambulance when someone is sick,
a water wagon in times of drought and always a welcome link to the
outside world. A 20-minute flight could save a trek of days or
weeks hauling supplies over mountains and through jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the isolated destinations have no control tower, weather
service or repair facilities. Martin must be able to gauge the
wind, fix his own aircraft, make spare parts from whatever
materials are available and take off unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hopes to become one of only about 500 men and women
who serve in a specialized air force that flies in the name of
Christ to hard-to-reach places others rarely go.
</P>
<P>
   They are the pilots, mechanics and electronic technicians who
work for missionary airlines and bring supplies to isolated
Christian missionaries and their flocks all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin is now in training to fulfill his dream. He attends
what some call the Top Gun school for missionary aviators at Moody
Missionary Aviation Training school in Elizabethton, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be in a jungle setting in Africa or South
America,'' Martin said. ``The main role is supporting missionaries
who are there. I might be in a large town, but I would be flying
into remote areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is a second-year student at Moody and has completed the
required course to be certified as an aircraft maintenance
technician.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he will work in the school's shop to
gain maintenance experience and learn to fly the school's Cessna
aircraft. Upon graduation, Martin will earn licenses in
single-engine private, instrument and commercial flying. And he
learns more than how to fly a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``His training prepares him not only to be a professional pilot
but his own skilled mechanic, weather service, navigator, control
tower, airstrip construction contractor and airline manager,'' said
Ed Robinson, 57, the director of the school and son of the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Moody Aviation is a ministry of Moody Bible Institute, a Chicago
missionary school founded in 1886. The flight school began in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robinson was a Moody graduate and a World War II pilot but
was declared too old to be a missionary pilot. So, he decided to
train others to do the vital work. The institute agreed. The school
was started.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school trains more than half the world's missionary
pilots, according to Ed Robinson. Others come from a couple of
small flight programs at Bible colleges, some are retired military
pilots and still others take flight training on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moody is the oldest school of its kind and, many think, the
best. There are 80 students, a faculty of 23 and 17 aircraft. The
three-year pilot mechanic course costs more than $40,000, plus
living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And most students complete two years of Bible study at the
Chicago institute before coming to flight school. Others must
complete at least 15 hours of college level biblical studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you read about us is technical,'' Robinson said.
``But aviation is just a platform for people representing Jesus
Christ to be with people who don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   The school accepts both men and women, but the student body is
overwhelmingly male. There are three areas of aviation study.
</P>
<P>
   All students take a year of aircraft maintenance. Maintenance
specialists have a second year working on aircraft and then
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Avionics technicians study electronics and communications
systems for two additional years. And a pilot-mechanic spends two
years flying, fixing planes and learning related skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Moody does in three years is really ridiculous,'' Martin
said in awe. ``They really pack it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduates far exceed FAA standards and are in great demand,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could double in size, and our graduates would still have
pretty good job security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni generally fly for one of several Protestant
nondenominational missionary agencies that provide flight services
for countless missionary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The largest one is the Mission Aviation Fellowship based in
Redlands, Calif. That group has more than 115 pilots, as well as
mechanics and avionics technicians serving at 34 bases in 27
countries. They fly more than 4 million miles a year, according to
Donna Sharp from the fellowship's communications office. The agency
has 89 aircraft, of which 79 are single-engine Cessnas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest Cessna fleet in the world,'' Sharp said.
``We fly more hours than most airlines. The pilots fly in and out
of the jungle on landing strips that are not the most wonderful.
These guys are really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Roman Catholic priests fly planes in mission areas, but the
church does not have missionary flight agencies, according to Cathy
McDonald, a spokeswoman for the Maryknoll Fathers Catholic Foreign
Missionary Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   Missionary Flights International is a small nondenominational
ministry based in West Palm Beach. They have nine pilots who fly
DC-3s to support missionary work in Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hopes to fly with one of the missionary airlines. His
interest in missions began at the Hobe Sound Bible Church, where he
has worshipped all his life. Summer missionary trips were exciting
and convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Honduras and felt that God would have me work in
missions,'' Martin said. ``I know I am not a preacher and I like to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He majored in missions at the Hobe Sound Bible College, married
Kayla Laird, 24, from Hobe Sound and applied to Moody Aviation.
Kayla plans to be a nurse and happily anticipates going to the
mission field, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and most missionary pilots pay for the privilege of
serving God: They must raise money for their own salary and part of
the cost of flight operations from friends and churches.
Missionaries who use the air service pay only a fraction of the
cost. Pilots and mechanics find the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the world around me, making a lot of money is
great,'' Martin said. ``But when you die, you can't take it with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he worried about money, school work and supporting a
family in the mission field, as well as living out of this country
away from family for years at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He prayed that God might put him at ease with all of that or
take away his desire to fly. Soon, he found a Bible verse,
Philippians 1:6, to remind him that God finishes what he starts:
</P>
<P>
   I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among
you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was God telling me to relax,'' Martin said. ``Ever since
I trusted God, he's really helped things.''

 &HT;    Smugglers used elaborate scheme, law officers say
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It began with a few stolen pickup trucks and Chevrolet
Suburbans along Interstate 35 in North Austin last year.
</P>
<P>
   A few soon became a few hundred. And when some of the same
stolen Austin trucks began showing up abandoned by the border near
Eagle Pass, detectives launched an investigation that would uncover
an elaborate illegal- immigrant smuggling ring involving 200 stolen
vehicles and thousands of undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Working together under the Austin Violent Crime Task Force, the
FBI and Austin police uncovered a scheme that used the stolen
vehicles to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States.
After being brought to Austin, the immigrants were sometimes held
against their will in apartments until they paid their captors an
$800 ``transport'' fee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the smugglers may also be responsible for the
deaths of four immigrants who drowned attempting to cross a swollen
Rio Grande, said Stan Knee, Austin police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were dealing in human misery,'' Knee said
Thursday in announcing the results of the yearlong investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, FBI agents and police officers have arrested
22 men and one woman in ``Operation Coyote,'' named because coyote
is a common nickname for immigrant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McCormick, FBI supervisory special agent, said these kinds
of smuggling schemes are common and becoming moreso. ``It's
something we can expect to see more of in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crime ring's scheme was relatively straightforward, said
Nancy Wright Hohengarten, assistant district attorney for Travis
County. The smugglers paid Austin gang members to steal pickups and
Suburbans, offering about $200 to $300 a vehicle. The smugglers
would drive the stolen trucks to Eagle Pass, where they crammed
undocumented immigrants, sometimes by the dozens, into the truck
beds and onto the Suburban seats.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Austin, the smugglers would demand the $800 transport
fee. Those who paid were set free. Those who couldn't were kept
locked in several Austin apartments until relatives or friends
could send money, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation is continuing and several crime ring
suspects remain at large, officials were not releasing the location
of the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Hohengarten said several immigrants escaped their captors, and
more than 40 of the immigrants were caught and deported by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Hohengarten said the smugglers avoided being caught at various
checkpoints along the highway to Austin by using separate rental
cars as decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (rental cars) would travel in front or behind the stolen
truck, and if the police pulled over the truck, then the car would
do something like speed or distract the officer long enough for the
truck to drive away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers recovered a third of the stolen pickups
and Suburbans, or about $600,000 worth of the $2 million in stolen
vehicles used in the smuggling scheme. Some were recovered in Eagle
Pass, where they were parked awaiting drivers or passengers,
according to officials. Others were recovered on the road to Eagle
Pass, while some were recovered in Austin, where they were
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were connected to the ring _ many of them
Austin gang members recruited by the smugglers to steal cars. Six
of the suspects, including the alleged ring leader, Cesar Labra
Gonzalez, 36, remained at large with warrants out for their arrest,
authorities said. The other five at-large suspects were identified
in court records as Jacinto Benitez, 35; Manuel Dominguez, 26;
Mario Perez, 32; Juan Gabriel Domingue, 22; and Leudi Sanchez, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the people suspected of being in the ring were indicted
this month on federal charges related to alien smuggling. The rest
face state charges of conspiracy to commit auto theft of more than
$200,000, which carries penalties ranging from five to 99 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Coyote is the latest in several collaborations
involving federal and local law enforcement officials and other
agencies since the joint task force was formed in 1995. In January,
the task force arrested 15 members of one of Austin's most violent
gangs, Big Dawg, in a continuing effort to curb gang activity in
Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Involving federal agents and prosecuting criminals under federal
laws often lead to tougher sentences for convicted criminals
without the possibility of parole.

 &HT;    Report: Church did nothing about bishop's sex abuse
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Catholic church officials removed J. Keith
Symons as bishop of the Palm Beach diocese in June and said their
swift, decisive action was evidence of a new attitude toward sexual
abusers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, only a few weeks were needed to force Symons to
resign after he admitted molesting altar boys during the 1950s and
'60s, church leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lynch, the St. Petersburg bishop who replaced Symons,
praised Pope John Paul II's quick approval of the resignation,
citing it as further proof the church was policing itself better.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, records released by the Pinellas-Pasco State
Attorney's Office told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators' reports show that one of Symons' victims
complained about him to a Pensacola bishop four years ago, and the
church did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Symons admitted being a molester then but was allowed to remain
in office until the 53-year-old victim came forward a second time
and complained more vocally to church officials last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch released a statement Thursday saying he first heard of the
man's original complaint a few days before Symons' departure. He
said he has approached a retired judge in Palm Beach County and
asked him to investigate how the church handled the initial
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge agreed to perform the investigation if the state's
attorney agreed,'' Lynch said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office nor Lynch
would identify the judge or comment on the likelihood of his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hope that the judge will be able to conduct a thorough
investigation of the 1995 meeting, and make recommendations for the
future which I will share with the Holy See and with other
bishops,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinellas-Pasco state attorney began investigating
allegations against Symons, 65, after he admitted molesting five
altar boys decades before and stepped down. Prosecutors determined
too much time had passed to file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators' records show that the 53-year-old victim who
ultimately forced Symons' ouster went to John M. Smith, then-bishop
of the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee, after telling his
counselor and wife of the abuse, which began when he was a
13-year-old altar boy. The man, whose name has been withheld by
investigators, said Smith arranged for him to meet with Symons and
Smith in Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   Symons admitted at that meeting that he had molested the man but
claimed he had stopped his abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Symons) admitted and stated that (the victim) was the only
one he had ever touched, and there had been no once since,'' the
investigators' report says. ``The meeting ended with Symons
agreeing to get counseling but to remain in his present position as
bishop of (the) Palm Beach area.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few months ago, troubled by a well-publicized sexual abuse
case involving another priest, the victim complained to Smith's
successor, Bishop John H. Ricard.
</P>
<P>
   ``After speaking with Bishop Ricard,'' the report said, ``Ricard
told him he would make sure Symons was removed from his office.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now a bishop in Trenton, N.J., would not comment about
whether he told anyone else in the church about the first
complaint. But he released this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, I was asked by a gentleman in his early 50s to set up
a meeting between himself and Bishop Symons to effect a spiritual
reconciliation relating to a sexual abuse matter in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responding to his request, I arranged for such a face-to-face
meeting. The gentleman was satisfied with the meeting and was
grateful to me for bringing the parties together. I do not think it
is appropriate for me to comment any further because this was a
pastoral outreach for healing and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim became outraged when another case involving sexual
molestation by a priest became public and a church official called
it ``an isolated incident,'' according to the investigators'
report. The victim, who is undergoing counseling at the church's
expense, then asked to meet with Ricard and told him about Symons.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney's file contained statements from another
unidentified man, now 52, who said Symons also molested him in the
late 1950s and early 1960s. He never reported the abuse to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Both victims told similar stories. The 53-year-old said Symons
began to molest him when he was a 13-year-old altar boy. He said
Symons, then a young priest, took him to dinners after Mass and
then on overnight trips and stays in motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he recalled waking up and finding Symons in bed
with him, lying on top of him, fondling him or trying to rape him.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old victim told investigators the first person he
told about the molestation was his wife in 1980. He later
confronted his father, believing he had knowledge of the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says his father just looked at the ground and would not
answer him,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Symons served in each of the state's seven dioceses, with more
than half of his 40-year career spent in the St. Petersburg area.
The church says he is undergoing psychiatric treatment at an
undisclosed site.

   Laser equipped battleships to combat nukes
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Stanley
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ High-flying laser ``battleships'' could be America's
best means of stopping a regional nuclear war before it started,
the chief technical advisor to Secretary of Defense says.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Mark, also a former chancellor for the University of Texas
System, said an early 21st-century fleet of the Boeing 747-400s
armed with high-power lasers that can shoot down nuclear-tipped
missiles could help stop regional nuclear wars and prevent others
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, who the U.S. Senate confirmed in June as the chief
technical advisor to Defense Secretary William Cohen, revealed the
Airborne Laser strategy while he was in Austin this week. The jet
could become a key part of the Clinton administration's plans to
deal with the spread of nuclear weapons as nations such as India
and Pakistan, which have fought each other in the past, acquire and
test them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force plans call for the first Airborne Laser, at an
estimated cost of $1.1 billion, to be delivered in 2003, followed
by a publicized shoot-down of a missile over the Pacific Ocean off
the coast of California. If Congress approves, the service hopes to
acquire six more of the planes by 2006. The planes are not intended
to combat intercontinental ballistic missiles, the subject of the
controversial, Reagan-era Star Wars missile defense program. Those
missiles rise into the fringes of space before plunging back to
their targets. The Airborne Laser would only engage
intermediate-range and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be similar to the AWACS (Airborne Warning and
Control System radar surveillance planes) and deployable in very
critical situations,'' Mark said. ``AWACS is there to manage the
air battle. The Airborne Laser will be there to handle the missile
threat over a large area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark said the Airborne Laser, under development for more than 20
years, would be a deterrent to a nuclear war by threatening
destruction of the country that tried to start one. Circling about
200 miles away from, say, a warring Iran and Iraq, the
steel-cutting laser could cripple nuclear-tipped missiles soon
enough in their flights for the warheads to fall back on the
country that launched them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 69, who still lives in Austin and commutes to the
Pentagon, was at his old office at UT briefly this week enroute to
California to watch the latest test of the new laser the jets would
carry. He has been on a leave of absence from his UT professorship
in aerospace engineering since May, when President Clinton
nominated him for the defense post, director of Defense Research
and Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He said he took the defense job to offer his 40 years of
defense-related technology research, in government and
universities, to help combat the spread of nuclear arms, as well as
chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A former secretary of the Air Force (1979-81) and former deputy
director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(1981-84), Mark said he hopes to diminish the need for the Airborne
Laser by helping find new, classified technical means of
discovering a country's nuclear weapon preparations, as the U.S.
did with Iraq, before the warheads are ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the means would be continued reliance on spy
satellites, the latest generations of which carry radars capable of
seeing through clouds, soil, sand and snow. As director of the
then-secret National Reconnaissance Office in the late 1970s, Mark
presided over some changes to the satellites that are still in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is classified but the fact that we're using it
is not,'' Mark said. ``We really want to know what the North
Koreans and the Iranians are doing when they test a rocket capable
of carrying a nuclear weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversial new prohibitions on the export of computers and
other technologies that could be useful for the development of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons also may be needed, Mark
said, as well as tighter controls over the distribution of
plutonium and other nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal job is to flag the things that ought to be
examined,'' Mark said. ``But this is clearly an issue over which
men of goodwill might differ.'' Mark is convinced, however, of the
Airborne Laser's ability to protect civilian populations and
military assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was introduced to the concept, which nuclear
physicist Edward Teller dubbed the ``aerial battleship,'' in 1967
when Mark became a member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory
Board. He has been following its progress ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Low-power lasers are commonly used in hospitals and clinics for
surgery and other medical procedures. The chemical oxygen-iodine
laser the 747s would carry is suitable for industrial applications.
Its concentrated beam, focused with the aid of telescope mirrors,
can cut stainless steel, titanium and other metals and is being
considered for such civilian uses as mining and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, the laser and its targeting optics are being
developed by the Air Force in cooperation with Boeing, TRW and
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force scenario for the planes calls for their crews to
detect and track missiles in less than two minutes and focus their
lasers on them for the five seconds it would take to disable them.
One problem the Air Force still is working on is gathering
worldwide data on air turbulence, which affects the laser's ability
to focus on a target.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said his job is to use his expertise to tell the defense
secretary what will work and what won't. And one thing he is
convinced will not work, in its present form, is the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. President Clinton signed the treaty,
which was drawn up by the United Nations, but the Senate has balked
at ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty should be revised, Mark said, to allow the U.S. to
conduct at least one or two underground nuclear tests each year to
ensure the workability of its nuclear arsenal, after completion of
the ongoing drawdown by treaty with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Without such testing, Mark said, America's enemies, such as
Libya's Moammar Kadafi, would know that its remaining nuclear arms
were suspect, since the radioactive components of nuclear weapons
have a limited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy for the world,'' Mark said, ``if Kadafi
had (working) nuclear weapons and we didn't.''

   GLASS-COLUMN _ The initial phase of the telecom technology
upgrade, known as local number portability (LNP), should be in
place in the nation's top 100 markets by the end of the year. In
due course, number portability should expand from current
capabilities _ to keep a number when you change local providers _
to span services in any of the 50 states. (Glass, Cox News Service)
MOVED 7/30.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Even after the Capitol shootings, Congress does
not wonder whether it might knit up a seamless system to care for,
and about, the mentally ill. And it insists upon a slovenliness in
firearms management that makes it no trick for a man who has been
delusional for years to pick up a gun and go hunting his devils.
(Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ When the states, citing reform, washed
their hands of responsibility for the mental health system, the
federal government declined to step in. Those decisions caught up
with us the other day at the Capitol when two cops were gunned down
by an abuse posing as a reform. A grateful Congress is naming a
door for the cops. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ A recent New York Times review of the Richard
Ellis book ``Imagining Atlantis'' caught my attention. What the
author and reviewer fail to recognize, in their literary efforts to
be academically correct, is that Atlantis does exist in the minds
of every adventurer and dreamer who ever lived. (Kleinberg, Cox
News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ Editor's Note: Cox News Service columnist Joe
Murray is on assignment. Here is one of his favorite columns from
his archives. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ The Internet is a treasure trove of bad puns
and one liners, most of which seem to end up in my e-mailbox,
courtesy of far-off friends who obviously don't have enough to do
at work. Here are a few selections I've culled over the past few
weeks: (list of really bad jokes follows). (Borders, Nacogdoches
Daily Sentinel) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ One of my grandsons is getting married to a
darling, dark-haired, bookish young girl, and I've brooded over how
to help with the celebration and what to give them. (Sibley,

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ``I'm trying to make a frame for my record
album, and since I can't find a perfect square frame, I have to
make my own. I'm using four equal pieces of quarter molding for the
sides. So, I've routered everything, sanded, etc. But when I try to
nail two pieces together at the corners with a congrouvated nail
(is that the right word?), the pieces move, because the underside
is round. I get someone to hold the pieces in a right-angled box
for support, but when I hammer the metal in, it still slips. Does
anyone know how to fix this? Thanks! Brandon B.'' Pardon me for not
fixing the ``congrouvated nail,'' but it's too priceless to tamper
with. Brandon's chief problem, of course, is that it's virtually
impossible to put together a frame withrame clamp of some
sort. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   MCCAIN _ Don't let the title of his current album fool you:
There's nothing misguided about Edwin McCain's career these days.
After years of working his way through the Southeastern club
circuit and seeing his debut album, ``Honor Among Thieves,'' sell a
respectable but hardly earth-shattering 400,000 copies, the South
Carolina singer-songwriter seemed destined for a life of modest
success. A slow initial response to his second album, ``Misguided
Roses,'' released in July 1997, confirmed the forecast. (Passy,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JOE-ELY _ In 25 years on the road, Joe Ely has performed his
rich blend of Tex-Mex country music at plenty of weird gigs. ``I
played a biker bar in Norway once, inside the Arctic Circle,'' the
51-year-old native of Amarillo, Texas, remembered. ``By the second
song, everyone had their clothes off and were making love on the
floor. The guys in the band were looking at their instruments and
saying, like, `Hey, don't mind us.' ``Don't get me started about
weird gigs . . . Wow.'' (Houck, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   COMIC-CARRINGTON _ HBO wants to talk about a sitcom. Album sales

   CANCER-STAMP _ What better way to help stamp out breast cancer
than a breast cancer stamp? A new first-class stamp that will
provide money for breast cancer research went on sale Thursday,
July 30, in the Miami Valley and across the country. The stamp,
which sells for 40 cents, costs 8 cents more than a first-class
letter stamp. The additional 8 cents will be divided 70 percent-30
percent between the National Institutes of Health and the
Department of Defense's Medical Research Program for breast cancer
research. (Moss, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   Eds: The stories with the BELIEF prefix below are part of a
final package of stories by the Atlanta Journal-C onstitution on
What Southerners Believe. Pages, photos and iluustrations with the
package are posted in the Religion folder.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEF-DEVIL _ Southerners look to God and organized religion
for help in explaining many of life's mysteries. And their beliefs
are not lightly held; they run deep. Much more than in other parts
of the country, Southerners believe there is a God (88%) and that
God answers prayers (90%). In Dixie, people may be less likely to
buy into alien visitation, UFO's or psychic healing, but they
absolutely believe in devil possession, and that some souls go to
heaven while others go to Hell. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   WITH BELIEF-BOXES _ Topic by topic, we do a short text block
(3'') with a smallish chart about the traditional belief questions
and about who does and doesn't buy in, ie. question on devil
possession might note that minorities in the South are far more
likely than any other demographic subset to believe in devil
possession. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEF-LIFEFORCE _ A small but noteworthy portion of the people
we polled would not say they believed in God, but affirmed their
belief in a ``life force.'' Nearly 10 percent of Souterhners and 17
percent of non-Southerners fell into this category. We talk to some
of them about what they mean and how a life force is different than
a traditional Jewish-Muslim-Christian view of God. We look at the
possible Eastern influences. And, for the 87 percent of Southerners
who believe in God (compared to 68 percent of non-South), we
discuss how they view him/her as judge, redeemer, etc. (White,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEF-DATING _ Men and women have been looking for ways to meet
one another since that first moment when Adam spotted Eve. Tired of
the singles scene, many people are falling back on the Church to
help them find the perfect match. In recent years, dating services
with a decidely religious character have entered the market and
joined Jewish matchmakers as alternative ways for people to meet
others with similar values. (BLAKE, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   SYMONS _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Catholic church officials removed J.
Keith Symons as bishop of the Palm Beach diocese in June and said
their swift, decisive action was evidence of a new attitude toward
sexual abusers. But recently, records released by the
Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office told a different story.
Investigators' reports show that one of Symons' victims complained
about him to a Pensacola bishop four years ago, and the church did
nothing. (Moffett, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   It isn't easy to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
</P>
<P>
   I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
</P>
<P>
   My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
</P>
<P>
   That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I divide my goals into categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Begin right now.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time--one of life's little coincidences--another
friend, a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he
was organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and
he wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
</P>
<P>
   One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos; I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
</P>
<P>
   But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered, and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
</P>
<P>
   One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight--with razor blades--over
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
</P>
<P>
   That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
</P>
<P>
   We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
</P>
<P>
   I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
</P>
<P>
   That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth painting my toenails.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
</P>
<P>
   All I could do was laugh!
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair--my entire
appearance--along with everything I had grown used to during the
past 20 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat and low sugar, and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
</P>
<P>
   Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blond and blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
blonde) to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
</P>
<P>
   Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no--ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races--Asian, African American or Hispanic--underwent to
alter their features to make them look ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathan Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
</P>
<P>
   So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   What I never understood, though, and what I never will
understand, is how it was reported in the trade publications again
and again that our show had failed and that we were canceled
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my Iife? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
</P>
<P>
   I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
</P>
<P>
   I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
</P>
<P>
   I did all these things! I completed those cycles.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

<P>
   Es dificil ser rico.
</P>
<P>
   Todo el mundo quiere que las personas que lleguen arriba hayan
empezado desde abajo. Yo no empece desde abajo, debo admitirlo.
</P>
<P>
   Mi abuelo era millonario. En Cuba le llamaban ``el zar del
papel'', porque era copropietario de las revistas Bohemia, Carteles
y Vanidades, que fueron las mas importantes de la isla, ademas de
tener el monopolio absoluto de la venta de todo el papel para
publicaciones en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Naci en Miramar, un suburbio idilico y ricachon de
</P>
<P>
   La Habana. Alli creci hasta que nos vimos obligados a emigrar a
Miami (Estados Unidos), en 1960, poco despues de haber triunfado la
revolucion de Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Pero yo no provengo directamente de los tropicos ni de la islita
paradisiaca de las palmeras, del tabaco y del ron; mi familla es
solamente una segunda generacion de cubanos. En verdad somos vascos
por los cuatro costados, y aunque yo me aferro a mi cubania, no hay
duda que herede los genes y el caracter de mi casta.
</P>
<P>
   Ser vasco es, de por si, controvertido, complicado,
singular...Es una sociedad a la inversa, donde los hombres cocinan
platos gourmet en sociedades gastronomicas, las mujeres son tercas
y duras como las piedras, y donde todo el mundo--hasta las vacas y
las ovejas--sobrevive a base de obstinacion y pura tenacidad. Con
esa herencia vasca naci en el Caribe y vine a radicar en la
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   El impacto mas grande que experimente fue escuchar la palabra
``spic'' aplicada a los hispanos como termino peyorativo. No
entendia por que me llamaban spic, hasta que alguien me explico que
la pa- labra era derivada de la forma en que el hispano pronuncia
el verbo ``to speak,'' acortando el sonido de la vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Especificamente, no entendia por que me decian, ``Spic, por que
no regresas al pais de donde viniste?'', cuando ninguno de los
antepasados de aquellos ``nativos'' eran de aqui tampoco.
</P>
<P>
   Me matricule en la Universidad de Miami, estudiando
comunicaciones. Durante el ultimo ano de estudios, la universidad
requeria un internado en alguna publicacion: yo quise hacerlo en
Vanidades, porque mis lazos sentimentales eran muy pro- fundos con
la revista, naturalmente. Mi familia se la acababa de vender en
aquellos momentos a Miguel Angel Capriles y a su socio, Armando de
Armas, quienes habian sido sus distribudores en Venezuela durante
la epoca de mi abuelo, en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a redactar todo tipo de articulos, desde temas de
belleza y modas, hasta noticias internacionales. Considero que mi
mayor logro durante esa etapa fue la adquisicion de un vocabulario
panamericano, que fue lo que mas me sirvio para conseguir el
trabajo que ahora desempeno en la television.
</P>
<P>
   (En 1973) Frank Calderon, quien era el director de Buenhogar,
obtuvo la posicion de director de Cosmopolitan en Espanol, y lo
primero que hizo fue llevarse a Mati Saralegui de Vanidades como su
primera redactora.
</P>
<P>
   Como buena Chica Cosmo, decidi mudarme de mi casa en Key
Biscayne a los veintiseis anos para instalarme en un pequeno
apartamento, con mi hermana menor, Maria Eugenia. El hecho de que
se le fueran dos de sus hijas de la casa--sin casarse, como
``aventureras''--le causo un gran trauma a mi padre.
</P>
<P>
   En aquellos momentos estaba arruinado, despues de una aventura
financiera en Arabia Saudita, y trataba de vender la mansion de Key
Biscayne para recortar el presupuesto. Pero antes de que eso
sucediera, para independizarme y no convertirme en una carga para
ellos, me mude.
</P>
<P>
   Empece a darme cuenta de que mi vida era muy vacia. Fue,
sencillaniente, que me tope con el vacio. Me di cuenta de que tenia
que controlar el aspecto personal de mi vida para dedicarle toda
esa energia que desbordaba a mi trabajo, y seguir adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los muchachos con quienes estaba saliendo se llamaba Tony
Menendez. ``Necesito tranquilizarme y tener un hijo. Este es un
buen hombre y se que sera un buen padre.'' Y, friamente, lo
calcule.
</P>
<P>
   Me case con el, y un ano despues tuve mi primera hija, Cristina
Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, a los veintintieve anos de edad.
</P>
<P>
   Estaba locamente enamorada de mi bebita, Titi, pero no de mi
esposo. Era un hombre bueno y yo lo queria, pero no estaba
enamorada de el. A medida que pasaba el tiempo, y mientras que
transcurria mi ano de domesticidad, me daba cuenta de que mi
marido, aunque trabaja todos los dias del ano (y que conste que
todos los dias encasquetaba su saco y su cuello y corbata y
trabajaba) sencillamente no vendia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvinios que mudarnos para el apartamiento de tres cuartos de mi
padre. Un dia mi esposo me dijo, ``Tienes que trabajar y
ayudarme.'' Yo le mire a los ojos y le respondi: ``Yo deje mi
carrera para empezar una familia contigo. Si tu me pides que
regrese al trabajo, tienes que entender el lio en que te vas a
meter.''
</P>
<P>
   Me dirigi a Cosmopolitan y regrese a la oficin de mi ex jefe,
Frank Calderon. ``Lo siento'', me respodio.
</P>
<P>
   Saliendo del edificio, y tratando de pensar que iba a hacer en
mi desesperacion, di media vuelta y me dirigi hacia la oficina de
Elvira Mendoza, a quien habia dejado plantada en Vanidades para
irme a Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Fui sincera con ella y le confese que necesitaba trabajo. Su
respuesta fue inmediata: ``Si, como no, yo se lo doy''.
</P>
<P>
   Y asi regrese, circulo completo, al punto donde habia comenza-
do, porque me pagaba casi el mismo sueldo que ganaba al princi-
pio, el salario mas infimo que me podia asignar.
</P>
<P>
   Trabajaba a todas horas, en lo que me mandaran. Y hacia lo que
fuera necesarlo con tal de ganarme mi dinerito.
</P>
<P>
   Fue entonces que el dueno de la empresa me propuso, como trabajo
adicional, ser coordinadora editorial para una revista de formato:
Intimidades. Basicamente era una revista de educacion sexual, y
como en Vanidades ganaba tan poquito dinero, lo acepte.
</P>
<P>
   Pasaba el dia entero trabajando en Vanidades, redactando.
Entonces, a las cinco de la tarde, me montaba en mi carro, me comia
un sandwich por el camino, iba a recoger a mi bebita, la metia en
una canasta, y la llevaba a casa de mi suegra Marieta, una santa
que trabajaba en una fabrica de manufacturar ropa de baile.
</P>
<P>
   Yo corria nuevamente para mi oficina y abriamos Intimidades.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidades resulto un exito a nivel internacional, y la segui
dirigiendo. Hasta que un dia, Frank Calderon, por razones que aun
desconozco, que dio un tanganazo con su miquina de escribir contra
un buro, y se marcho repentinamente. La gerencia me ofrecio su
posicion como directora de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora permitanme hacer un aparte, como recapitulacion de toda
esta experiencia. Muchas veces las mujeres profesionales me piden
consejo sobre como coordinar el trabajo y los hijos. Pero tambien
me dicen: ``Ja! Para ti es facil, porque tu tienes sirvientas,
servicio en la casa, tu no tienes que cocinar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pero eso es ahora. Que poquito se acuerde nadie de los tiempos
dificiles. A nadie se le ocurre pensar que para llegar a la
posicion que hoy ocupo, he tenido que atravesar una serie de
etapas. Nadie se aparecio, en mi camino, con una varita magica para
decirme: ``Puff! De ahora en lo adelante tu seras Cristina, la de
la television''.
</P>
<P>
   El triunfo tiene muy poco que ver con la suerte.

<P>
   Como el mundo editorial en que me desenvolvia estaba tan rela-
cionado con las companias disqueras, en una ocasion me llamo un
representante de la CBS para pedirme un favor con estas palabras
profeticas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Acabamos de firmar a un conjunto local, que se llama el Miami
Sound Machine. Los vamos a llevar a la discoteca Regine's en Nueva
York para lanzarlos como nuevos artistas de la compania, y
necesitamos que tu nos apoyes editorialmente con ellos''.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo--casualidades de la vida!--me habia llamado otro
amigo periodista de Puerto Rico, que estaba organizando un festival
de musica caribena en Cancun, Mexico, para pedirme que le
recomendara a un grupo que representara la musica latina que mas
estaba sonando en los Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Sin pensarlo dos veces, le recomende al Miami Sound Machine. Y
fue en el avion que nos llevo hacia el festival, donde por primera
vez conoci a Emilio y Gloria Estefan, y (casualmente!) a Marcos
Avila, el bajista de la banda.
</P>
<P>
   Durante ese viaje Emilio y Gloria fueron muy agradables, y
rapidamente entablamos amistad, tan espontanea y sincera que poco
despues Tony (mi esposo) y yo comenzamos a salir con ellos como
parejas.
</P>
<P>
   Viendolos a ellos, percibiendo la felicidad en su matrimonio, me
di cuenta de lo infeliz que yo era. Empece a darme cuenta que tenia
que cambiar las circunstancias en que me hallaba con el ejemplo de
ellos: trabajar juntos, echar para adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Un dia Emilio me dijo: ``Me voy a Peru con Gloria y con la
banda. Ya te estas divorciando. Ya tus problemas no tienen arreglo.
Por que no me dejas invitarte y te pasas diez dias alla, con
nosotros?''.
</P>
<P>
   Era mi destino encontrarme con mi destino.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, que es muy bromista, empezo a venderme a Marcos, no se
ni por que. Me repetia: ``Marcos Avila es mi mano derecha. Es un
muchacho muy serio... por que no se empatan?''.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos hoy me cuenta que durante todas sus experiencias con
Emilio, este siempre ha tenido este tipo de vision, presentimientos
que han llegado a convertirse en realidad. Ahora pienso que tal vez
Emilio presintio la reaccion quimica entre Marcos y yo antes de que
transcurriera todo lo que voy a contarles.
</P>
<P>
   Pero en aquel momento yo escuchaba sus palabras, y pensaba:
``Marcos es bajito, es gordito, tiene malas pulgas, es callado. Y
es casado! A mi me encantan los hombres altos, los guapos, los
lindos. Tambien tengo malas pulgas. Seria una combi- nacion
espantosa!''.
</P>
<P>
   Una noche fuimos todos a una discoteca. Yo estaba en la mesa de
Gloria y Emilio, y fui al bano. De repente veo que una mujer negra
y una mujer blanca comienzan a fajarse, con una navaja, por un
musico.
</P>
<P>
   Y el musico era Marcos! Me paralice. Hice lo que tenia que hacer
en piloto automatico, sin siquiera echarle un vistazo a las
rivales. Sali despavorida de aquel bano. Y al salir, Marcos se me
acerco para decirme: ``Quieres bailar?''
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``Ni loca!''. Y me regrese a la mesa para ver como
se desarrollaba el resto de aquella situacion.
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche Marcos me explico que estaba atravesando esa etapa
caotica de inestabilidad total que precede a un divorcio. A veces
dejaba su hogar para refugiarse en casa de su abuela, donde se
escondia por un par de semanas antes de regresar a su propia casa y
visitar a su bebita.
</P>
<P>
   Por mi parte, mi ex marido y yo estabamos separados, con pape-
les y todo.
</P>
<P>
   Con Marcos fue todo como el caso clasico de ``un clavo saca a
otro clavo''. Nos apoyamos el uno al otro, o la gordura se apoyo en
la hinchazon. Fuimos dos almas desgraciadas que se encontraron,
como dos desamparados bajo el puente.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de uno de los conciertos nos reunimos todos en una suite
y formamos tremenda fiesta. Al terminar la diversion, el se ofrecio
a acompanarme de regreso a mi habitacion. Entro conmi- go, se sento
en mi cama, me empezo a dar masajes en la espalda, y me dijo: ``Si
tu y yo hacemos el amor...''.
</P>
<P>
   De repente se corrigio:''No. Cuando tu y yo hagamos el amor, tu
vas a ver lo que es un hombre de verdad''.
</P>
<P>
   Yo me hice la que no lo habia oido; le dije good-bye bien
rapidito, le di un besito tonto, y se fue. Pero me quede pensando,
y con aquella promesa por dentro. Al dia siguiente me levante a las
seis de la manana, y me arregle hasta las unas de los pies!
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche volvio, y todas sus promesas se quedaron cortas.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de aquella experiencia, nunca mas nos separamos. Fue
como hacer el amor con alguien para quien te habian predisenado con
ese unico proposito y fin. Despues de tantos anos de infelicidad
conyugal, encontrarme con alguien hecho a la medida de mi cuerpo y
alma fue como un bofeton de proporciones karmicas.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos tiene once anos menos que yo. En aquel momento tenia una
cola de caballo como Miguel Bose, hasta la mitad de la espal- da;
en el frente, estaba rapado. Ademas, llevaba una argolla en una
oreja. En fin, el era un musico.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres estaban completamente opuestos a la relacion. Aparte
de que Titi, mi nina, era tremenda! Recuerdo que el primer dia que
Marcos llego a casa, Titi tenia unas esposas de policia plasticas
de juguete, y lo amarro a la escalera de metal de la casa, lo dejo
ahi, y boto la llave... para que el no pudiera estar conmigo.
Tuvimos que romper las esposas.
</P>
<P>
   Ante aquella situacion, le adverti a el: ``Tienes que primera
mente conquistarla a ella, porque yo no me voy a casar si ella no
quiere que me case.
</P>
<P>
   Al cabo de nuestro primer ano juntos, la nina habia llegado a
tenerle tanto carino a Marcos que un dia me dijo: ``Mami, el nos
quiere. El es bueno. Por que no nos casamos con el?''.
</P>
<P>
   No pude menos que reirme!
</P>
<P>
   Para la boda me puse un vestido blanco de algodon que habia
comprado en Mexico, y Titi llevaba uno exacto; compre unas
florecitas blancas para el pelo, y otras a ella. Entonces ella se
paro a mi lado, con su vestidito exacto al mio, y las dos nos
casamos con Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Mas tarde, a pesar de su exito y del dinero que estaba ganando,
y despues de doce anos consecutivos con el Miami Sound machine,
decidio irse del grupo. ``Ya tuve las fans, y las limosinas y ``The
Johnny Carson Show,'' fueron sus palabars exactas. ``Ahora quiero
tener una familia.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos abrio una compania de relaciones publicas: MagikCity
Media, la cual aun mantiene. Y una vez que el comprobo que a el le
estaba yendo bien, empezo a lavarme el cerebro para que yo me fuera
de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Mi reaction: ``Tu estas loco?''
</P>
<P>
   No obstante, Marcos me convencio de que lo que yo estaba
haciendo en aquella empresa era vender mi tiempo en vez de mi
talento.
</P>
<P>
   Y recuerden bien todos los que esten leyendo este libro ese
consejo tan importante, a cualquier nivel de vida en que se
encuentren en estos momentos.

<P>
   Para nadar en el mundo de la television, nada fue facil.
Empezando porque tuve que despojarme, como una serpiente, del
cuerpo, la cara, el pelo y mi apariencia completa... y de todo a lo
que estaba acostumbrada durante los ultimos 20 anos de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Habia sido escritora y directora de revistas, trabajaba en un
buro como una esclava, y cuando me tomaba un receso, me daba por
devorar todo lo que habia en las maquinas de alimentos, lo cual me
hacia engordar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando hoy miro los videos del primer ano del ``Show de
Cristina,'' me horrorizo. Me veo fea, ridicula, gritona y como un
caballito en rifa, llena de gangarrias, cadenas, pulseras, aretes
de tres pisos, con todo colgando y haciendo ruido con el microfono.
</P>
<P>
   El cambio fue paulatino. Poco a poco fuimos puliendo mi imagen,
y prestando atencion a la reaccion del publico. Me costo mucho
trabajo encontrar mi estilo. Ahora conservo el cabello liso,
cortado en una sola capa, y me gusta el maquillaje tenue y la ropa
sencilla.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a comer sin grasa y sin azucar, y pequenas cantidades de
proteina cada tres horas, para mantener mi energia estable y poder
funcionar mejor durante todo el dia. El resultado fue que por
primera vez me veia regia en la television, y por primera vez en mi
vida entendi lo que era ser una mujer atrac- tiva porque cuando
llegaba a cualquier lugar, la gente se volteaba a mirarme aunque no
supieran quien era. Eso jamas me habia pasado... y tenia 41 anos!
</P>
<P>
   Otro factor en mi apariencia era ser tan blanca, tan rubia y con
los ojos claros. Cuando el show fue lanzado al aire, llovian las
cartas de mis hermanos hispanos en todos los Estados Unidos, en las
cuales mencionaban que yo era ``demaslado blanca'' y ``guera''
(rubia para los mexicanos) para representar a las hispanas, cuando
brown era beautiful ...y yo no era brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hasta que comprendieron que lo que me estaban haciendo a mi era
tan racista como lo que les estaban haciendo los anglos a ellos...
y las criticas cesaron. Pero el proceso torno seis meses de cartas
del publico en las que me decian que me pusiera mis ruborizador.
</P>
<P>
   Una vez se me acerco una senora de edad avanzada y me reprocho:
``Ay, usted nada mas que habla de sexo, Cristina''.
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``No senora, yo hablo de todo! Desde platillos
voladores hasta el cancer del seno. Usted solamente recuerda los
programas de sexo.''
</P>
<P>
   Presento temas de sexo porque aparte de la enorme necesidad que
hay de informar sobre la materia, cada vez que incluyo algo de
sexo, en el programa los ratings se van por las nubes, y los
numeros desplazan la hipocresia.
</P>
<P>
   Por que en vez de criticar un programa llamado a una emisora de
radio o escribiendo cartas airadas no apagan los televisores cuando
hay algo de sexo? Pero...Noo! Al reves. Se prenden mas y mas
televisores.
</P>
<P>
   Es evidente que muchas personas no tienen la menor idea de lo
que es la sexualidad humana, y alguien les tiene que explicar la
verdad. Obviamiente sus padres no han asumido la responsabilidad de
hacerlo, porque la responsabilidad de educar sexualmente a nuestros
hijos, igual que moralmente, es de nosotros los padres.
</P>
<P>
   Mi primer viaje con ``El Show de Cristina'' a Mexico fue muy
importante en el desarrollo del programa. Tuvimos una fastuosa
conferencia de prensa, seguida de un almuerzo, durante el cual me
presentaron a la prensa mexicana para que les explicara el concepto
del programa. Fue una experiencia agradable y alentadora.
</P>
<P>
   La debacle que se avecinaba se comenzo a fraguar cuando
``Cristina'' comenzo a trasmitirse en el horario de las cuatro de
la tarde (igual que en los Estados Unidos) y reemplazando la pro-
gramacion infantil que existia previamente a esa hora.
</P>
<P>
   Es decir, que en un pais tan tradicional como Mexico, eligieron
para un programa polemico y controversial como el mio, un horario
en que quienes veian la television eran principalmente los ninos.
</P>
<P>
   A partir de ese momento comenzaron las quejas de algunas
asociaciones de padres de familia, y del publico en general, contra
el programa y, especialmente, contra el horario del programa.
</P>
<P>
   Un poco despues cambiron el programa al horario de las once de
la noche, y yo, inocentemente ajena a esta caceria de brujas que se
estaba produciendo, viaje a Mexico con mi equipo para grabar por
primera vez.
</P>
<P>
   Al llegar al estudio, todo fue de maravilla. El foro tenia
capacidad para 500 espectaclores y estaba siempre abarrotado de
personas que esperaban el dia entero para poder entrar.
</P>
<P>
   Pero una vez que todas estas asociaciones, que mientras tanto me
estaban atacando, se enteraron que yo estaba grabando en la Ciudad
de Mexico, enviaron un sequito de periodistas para entre- vistarme.
Excepto que no me hacian las preguntas normales, como los
periodistas en otras partes. Aquello era un ataque frontal, verbal
y luego escrito. Yo me preguntaba: Dios mio, pero por que este
rencor? No entendia lo que estaba sucediendo!
</P>
<P>
   ``Bodas Homosexuales,'' el programa el mas controversial hasta
la fecha, me hizo cuestionar hasta que punto se puede correr el
riesgo de poner en peligro la estabilidad de la familla, y de seres
quendos a un nivel personal, por cuestiones de principlos.
</P>
<P>
   El programa fue lanzado al aire el 4 de enero de 1996, y aunque
fue conducido con decoro y respeto, se suscito una campana de odio
muy intensa en Miami que desato una desagradable corriente de
intolerancia.
</P>
<P>
   Todo esto culmino en una manifestacion frente a los estudios de
Univision en Miami, donde aproximadamente 1,500 personas acudieron
con pancartas que decian: ``ABAJO CRISTINA!'', ``N0 A `EL SHOW DE
CRISTNA,' SI A CRISTO!''.
</P>
<P>
   Mi papa va a misa todos los dias. A raiz de este incidente,
estaba en la iglesia, y como hacia frio, llevaba puesto una
chaqueta del programal que dice ``Cristina'' en la parte de atras.
</P>
<P>
   El sacerdote estaba diciendo tantos horrores de nosotros en el
pulpito que mi papa, para no causar otro incidente, se quito la
chaqueta y la doblo, para que no se viera el nombre de su hija.
</P>
<P>
   Mi hijo que entonces tenia 10 anos aparentemente se entero de
los ataques en su colegio parroquial, ya que un dia llego a la casa
y me pregunto muy consternado: ``Mami, estamos teniendo
problemas?''.
</P>
<P>
   Estos incidentes desafortunados me hicieron suffir las criticas
en carne propia.
</P>
<P>
   Surgio la consabida pregunta: no me parecia mal que los ninos
vieran una boda de homosexuales en la television, a las cuatro de
la tarde? Si me hubiera parecido mal, no lo habria presentado.
</P>
<P>
   Me parecen aun mas alarmantes las cifras de ninas prostitutas,
de abuso sexual infantil, de drogadiccion y alcoholismo entre los
adolescentes.
</P>
<P>
   Pero aunque me alarme y me aterre--dada la profesion que escogi,
y la suerte que Dios me ha dado de tener un programa como
este--tengo el deber y el compromiso de informar, y el compromiso
de reflejar la realidad que existe en el mundo en que vivimos.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres emigraron de Cuba para que yo creciera en una
sociedad donde no hubiera censura. Y si los ataques personales eran
el precio que yo tenia que pagar--no solo el precio personal, sino
el de mi familla--estaba mas que nunca dispuesta a pagarlo por el
resto de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Gracias a Dios, ellos piensan igual que yo, especialmente mis
tres hijos.

<P>
   As no doubt you know, astronomers are worried about run-amok
asteroids striking the Earth and wiping out civilization, to say
nothing of the new TV season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (And I intend to say nothing about the new TV season, except
that the list of shows I'm determined never to see grows longer
every day.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly how many asteroids, comets, minor planets
and other space objects are dancing around in the cosmos, thinking
about smacking Earth upside the head. But the Planetary Society in
Pasadena, Calif., which purports to know a lot about this subject,
says there may be 100 million of them larger than 100 meters
across. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I myself am not quite two meters tall, and if you took 50 of me
you'd, uh, be a lot braver than my sisters, who can barely stand
one of me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far only about 300 of these dangerous space things have been
discovered. Which means there's a lot of discovery work yet to be
done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Planetary Society, which calls these things Near-Earth
Objects, is so worried about Earth getting whacked by an NEO that
it's offering to pay even amateur observers to look for them and,
when one is found, to shout ``Eureka!!'' or some such. (What do we
do once warned? Cry, perhaps?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Planetary Society paid out more than $35,000 for
this work, which seems paltry compared with what the Pentagon
spends on hammers and toilet seats. But no doubt the money helped
keep food on the tables of several amateur astronomers who, like
amateur columnists, tend to get so wrapped up in their work they
forget to earn grocery money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although no exact amount of money has been designated for the
NEO-hunt project this year, a Planetary Society official says it
probably will be about the same as last year. But you won't get
even a penny of it if you don't submit an application. And the
deadline is Aug. 15, which, speaking of spacey things, is the
anniversary of the 1969 opening of the Woodstock Music and Art Fair
on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, N.Y., where, as far as I know, no
asteroid has ever landed. (Though who in 1969 would have noticed?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get an application, go the this Web site _
http:/planetary.org _ or ask for one by e-mail at
tps.br &LR; mars.planetary.org. And if you don't know what any of that
means you probably shouldn't be outside watching for falling
objects anyway. Or, for that matter, inside playing with sharp
objects. Just go lie down and wait for help to come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I certainly don't wish to alarm you about the possibility of not
making it through this week without an asteroid blowing up Earth.
Movies such as ``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'' already have done
that work for me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary
Society, complains that ``we spend far more on entertainment about
dangerous near-Earth objects than we spend on actually locating
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But you may recall that this past March we were treated to a
scary false alarm. One day astronomers said there was a strong
possibility that at 12:30 p.m. (CST) on Oct. 26, 2028, a mile-wide
asteroid known as 1997 XF11 would plow into Earth at 17,000 mph and
pretty much make the whole planet look like downtown Detroit. The
next day, after some recalculation, they said never mind. The thing
would miss us by enough that we didn't need to worry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has Earth ever been hit by any of these things? Oh, you bet.
Scientists say the huge crater off the Yucatan coast was created by
a meteor 65 million years ago and that the impact may have led to
the extinction of the dinosaurs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, to give us all enough warning to tell our friends farewell,
you need to help find these NEOs. Well, unless they're simply small
TV-studio-seeking NEOs. In which case just let them come. &QL;

ICELAND'S OPEN-DOOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ The approach to the president's house is an
easy one, taking you along an open and uncrowded road, through a
bird sanctuary and right up to the entrance of the gleaming white
house with its red-tiled roof.
</P>
<P>
   The housekeeper opens the front door and standing right inside,
at the entry to his office, is the welcoming president, Olafur
Ragnar Grimsson. Just the housekeeper and the president _ no
security checks, no bodyguards, no handlers. The tall, white-haired
leader smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see ... there is no security, and it's a very true
reflection of how open and truly democratic Iceland is,'' says
Grimmson, 55, who two years ago was elected the country's fifth
president since it gained independence from Denmark in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes say to my foreign friends that perhaps one of the
great contributions Iceland can make to the world is that we are a
living demonstration that the theories of an open, democratic
society can work. You have a functioning society which has this
peaceful tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The tiny island nation of about 270,000 people, located
just below the Arctic Circle, is virtually crime free. It has no
army. The nation's economy, built largely around a flourishing
fishing industry, is robust. With few natural recources, most goods
are imported and the cost of living is therefore high, but
Icelanders enjoy universal health care and publicly financed
education through college.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the century we were a nation of poor
farmers and fishermen,'' Grimsson said during an interview at his
home last week. ``Now at the end of the century we can show the
world almost a laboratory case of what an actual, prosperous
society looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year is Iceland's summer, featuring nearly 22 hours
of daylight and a kind of lightness of being, as increasing numbers
of tourists come to mingle in the sophisticated capital city that
is home to a majority of the nation's population. Or they venture
out into the wide open, mostly treeless country, with active
volcanoes alongside glaciers and geysers, with grassy lowlands
along the southern coastline and, inland, vast deserts of black
sand.
</P>
<P>
   The president's house, built in the 12th century and elegantly
restored, sits at the tip of a peninsula on the outskirts of
Reykjavik and features a sweeping view of the city skyline and,
beyond it, the peaks of a faraway mountain range. The air is crisp,
with temperatures reaching into the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsson is a veteran of Icelandic politics, a former member of
Parliament and the country's finance minister from 1988 to 1991.
Previously a professor of political science, he studied at
Britain's Manchester University and is regarded as an
internationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he succeeded the world's first popularly elected
female head of state, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, who served four terms.
In an interview, the erect and bespectacled Grimsson comes off more
like a political philosopher than a hard-boiled politician, talking
about the time he spends pondering ``the core question of what it
means to be an Icelander in this changing global world.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what it means to be an Icelander is that they give great
summits. This is the Reykjavik that was made famous for hosting the
summit between President Reagan and Russian leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, says Grimsson, some of the key
participants say that the lack of security apparatus that usually
accompanies such summits _ the guards were Icelandic Boy Scouts _
affected the mindsets of Reagan and Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan has said he never felt more secure in all his
presidency as he did here,'' said Grimsson. ``The atmosphere of the
country, its openness, contributed to the openness that suddenly
took place. For the first time in 30 years, the leaders of America
and the Soviet Union started to speak to each other like ordinary
human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this is the country's season of light, for Grimsson and
his wife and twin daughters the year has been a difficult one. His
wife, Gudrun Katrin Thorbergsdottir, was diagnosed with leukemia
and this summer she underwent a bone marrow transplant. Grimsson
has been spending most of his time with her in Seattle, where she
had the transplant in July, and he returned to Iceland recently for
a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult journey,'' Grimsson said about his
wife's illness and treatment before turning the discussion away
from the personal back to the national.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsson preferred to stress ``the special kinship'' between his
country and the United States. Noting that Viking explorer Leif
Ericson, who was born in west Iceland, sailed to America in 1000,
Grimsson said, ``our two countries share a unique historical
heritage of discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Icelanders admire Americans in many ways, because I think we
sense, basically, that America, like Iceland, is a nation created
by settlers,'' he says. But there is much about the United States _
the violence and crime rates, for example _ that Icelanders find
puzzling. ``We find it disappointing, maybe a little bit tragic,
that this splendid democratic nation, America, is burdened with all
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean why cannot America, in its entirety today, be more
civilized?'' asks Grimsson. ``But, on the other hand, we recognize
the great creativity that does takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsson last year traveled to the United States and met with
President Clinton, and the two agreed to develop plans to jointly
celebrate the millennium, not just to look back to celebrate the
past, the 1,000 years since Ericson's trip to America, but also to
look ahead ``to extend the importance of the culture of discovery
into the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stress our shared Viking heritage to impress young
people, to train them, in the mindset of the culture of discovery
and exploration, and the willingness to go into unknown
territories,'' says Grimsson.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are underway to reenact Viking voyages to America. ``I
think this is very important for America, because it shows in a
very dramatic way that the American history is perhaps much older
than the official emphasis on the past 350 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly extends the history of America, and it brings to
life the fact that America _ 1,000 years ago _ was an integral part
of a democratic culture of discovery.''

SHOWTIME'S `RUDE' IS JUST NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
RUDE AWAKENING 
Starring: Sherilynn Fenn, Lynn Redgrave, Richard Lewis 
Created by: Claudia Lonow 
On: Showtime 
Time: Saturday at 11 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of dreck need no longer rummage around in
``Veronica's Closet'' for squalid, witless humor, because an even
worse sitcom premieres Saturday: howtime's ``Rude Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a show so wretched that its stars should pray that no
one will watch it, because their careers might never recover. Then
again, that might be fit punishment for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Awakening'' tries to wring laughs from the travails of
Billie Frank, an alcoholic played by Sherilyn Fenn of ``Twin
Peaks'' semi-fame. Billie's career and her life have bottomed out,
and all she really wants is another drink.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually more promising sitcom terrain than it might
appear; remember the edgily brilliant ``John Larroquette Show,''
featuring a recovering drunk who ran a bus station in St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   Well, take away the bus station and the wit, replace them with
an utterly unlikable lead character and the most noxious supporting
cast in recent memory, and you're left with ``Rude Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   In chronicling Billie's days of whine and poses, ``Rude
Awakening'' aims for dark humor, but it's dark to the point of
invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   Once the star of a nighttime soap opera, Billie now has bottomed
out so abjectly that she's working as a secretary to a scuzzy
B-movie producer (Richard Lewis) who keeps putting the moves on
her. Even worse, she keeps getting so drunk that she falls into bed
with guys whose names she can't remember in the morning. ``Bad
genitals! Bad!'' she admonishes her private parts after one such
amorous encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Get the idea of the comedy heights we're scaling here? This is a
show whose idea of yuks is to have Billie tell a guy that she was
voted ``girl most likely to vomit'' in high school. Other gems: ``I
would love to change my mind, but they won't take it back.'' ``In
my culture, throwing up is a sign of great happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   For a show that is chiefly notable for its own emetic qualities,
is it really wise to keep harping on this subject?
</P>
<P>
   Billie can't decide whether she really wants to stop drinking.
Given the repellent family and friends who surround her, including
Lynn Redgrave as her mother, it's hard to blame Billie for
constantly falling off the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime has scheduled this loser for the late-night hour of 11
p.m. Note to Showtime programmers: When it comes to ``Rude
Awakening,'' better never than late.

EAST MEETS WEST ON FASHION STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the midst of tony Madison Avenue in New York,
among the Versaces and Pradas and Ralphs and Calvins there is now a
Tang.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai Tang.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been to Hong Kong, you already know about David Tang's
fashion and gift emporium, where traditional Chinese clothing is
given a modern spin by designer Gemma Choi. You like Mandarin
collars? They'll give you Mandarin collars that will make your neck
look improbably long. You think the traditional cheung sam or
``Suzi Wong'' dress is a sexy look? You can have one made to order
out of fabric the likes of which you've never seen.
</P>
<P>
   If you go for color, as I do, you'll flip for the vivacity of
traditional Chinese hues like fuchsia, lime, scarlet and orange.
</P>
<P>
   Choi was a featured designer recently during the S.F. Design
Center's Summer Market. Her clothing and her company were part of
``Under the Spell: The Fusion of East/West Design'' program that
included American-born architect Gordon Deere and interior designer
Barbara Allen (a Kansan with a Japanese mother and an American
father, married to a British banker and residing in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia), who decorates the palaces of the Sultan of Brunei. Talk
about your East-West fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Choi's clothing, shown very briefly, is colorful, body-conscious
and arrestingly bright.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration for the designer comes from provincial Chinese
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible,'' she says, ``to exhaust the sources
for my designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The embroidered, light-as-a-feather silk brocades are done in
elaborate patterns using traditional Chinese elements like the
chrysanthemum, dragon and lotus. Color combinations are festive: A
navy ground with gold, silver, red and green; oranges, fuchsias,
pinks and golds woven together in a blaze of iridescence.
</P>
<P>
   Choi has worked her brocade fabrics into modern Western designs
like the flat-front skinny pant and the sleeveless, Mao-necked
architectural top cropped to show some tummy. A staple of her work
is the chi pao, which Westerners have come to know as the cheung
sam (the difference: Chi pao is Mandarin; cheung sam is Cantonese
for the same garment). Her show opened with short, form-fitting
satin versions worked up in lime and fuchsia.
</P>
<P>
   For men: The traditional Chinese robe rendered in breathtaking
velvets and gilt-woven satins and brocades in a rusty imperial
gold. In addition, ``New York men are wearing my velvet jacket
instead of tuxedos,'' she says of the traditional men's cheung sam,
a boxy jacket with frog-closings down the front and a low Mao
collar designed to show the white silk brocade shirt underneath.
The extra-long sleeves are designed to roll back to reveal the
lining of the coat, usually in a contrasting color.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Shanghai Tang head to the West Coast, probably Los
Angeles first. ``They understand color down there,'' laughs Choi.
Short of running to Hong Kong (where the store is in the Pedder
Building, 12 Pedder St., phone: 011-852-2525-7333), you can stroll
Madison Avenue and pick up a T-shirt or two or have something
gorgeous made to order. Prices for ready-to-wear from $300 up;
custom work starts at $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Madison Avenue: The Vera Wang wedding gown boutique,
which grew out of designer Wang's frustration when she married
nearly 10 years ago at the age of 40. She found that everything on
the market looked like sugar confection. The frou-frou bride at the
top of the wedding cake. Too much lace; too many beads; too many
layers, buttons, textures and weight. So when she opened her
boutique in 1991, her gowns were simple in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   They still are simply beautiful, but there is modernity in the
simplicity. While the bouffant skirts hark back to the mythic
Bianchi gowns of the late '50s, the dropped waists and
skin-revealing tops (also a reference to the Sabrina necklines of
Givenchy for Audrey Hepburn) are at once daring (very low backs on
some gowns), yet tasteful, feminine and youthful.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that a majority of brides are in the
20-to-30-something age group when their bodies are great and their
hopes are the highest, Wang's gowns suit the pared-down eye of the
practical modern woman. Celeb clients who have floated down the
aisle in a Wang creation include Uma Thurman (very preggers),
Sharon Stone, Karina Gore (the veep's daughter) and Chynna
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's wedding gowns do not come cheap. While the Luxe line
(which is made to order with more fine detail) prices out at $5,000
to $10,000, most of the less decorated gowns run between $2,500 and
$3,500.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real glamour is also at the heart of Lily Samii evening wear.
Unforgiving styles like the slip dress are called ageist and
bodyist by Lily Samii's resident designer, Jacques Pantazes, who
designed for the French couture house of Jean Patou. ``Nobody who
isn't perfect should wear it. If they're not a size 2 and 20 years
old, I try to talk my clients out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantazes's fall line for Samii is architectural, structured and
elegant, particularly a strapless stunner created from Ziberline, a
complex-woven silk and wool with a spring in it. Color-blocked
vertically in deep red and black, the dress has a stand-away top
over a black velvet bustier with nipped waist. The skirt has some
heft and falls in graceful cloverleafs. It's a major ball gown at a
competitive price ($2,595).
</P>
<P>
   Samii's atelier at 260 Stockton St., fourth floor, in San
Francisco is full of mother-of-the-bride clothes that tend to be
more conservative. But there is nothing stuffy or dated about the
six or seven ensembles created for the opera crowd, particularly a
sculptural black gown with beaded lingerie straps and a sweetheart
decolletage (lined inside with saffron silk charmeuse) worn with a
major saffron charmeuse and black organza shawl trimmed with jet
beads. Gorgeous and sexy, they have an extra fillip: Each piece is
created like couture, right on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sizes don't matter here,'' Jacques says.

   AMHERST, Mass. _ To the teachers, the success of this week's
Junior Classics League convention, the largest in 30 years, was its
``synergy'' _ a Greek-derived word, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the 1,700 junior high and high school students here
could probably easily cite the roots of that word: ``syn,'' Greek
for ``together,'' and ``ergon,'' meaning ``to work.''
</P>
<P>
   While the national gathering of students of Greek and Latin
included language exams, contests, and workshops, just as important
to the students was their chance to be part of a 1990s-style
bacchanalia, although a tame one: making outrageous costumes,
attending dances, staying up all night, and ordering pizza with new
friends. Thursday, they strolled around in togas accessorized with
sunglasses, eyebrow rings, and Adidas flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   The week was a triumph for the Classics League, which drew more
students to the annual convention than at any time since 1968, when
classical studies by young people started a steep decline,
organizers say. Student interest in Latin and Greek has been
steadily on the rise in the 1990s, say league students and
teachers. And the crowds of rowdy and enthusiastic students who
gathered at UMass-Amherst, including about 130 from Massachusetts,
appeared proof that, even in the computer age, interest in the
ancient remains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We don't have enough teachers for all the jobs out there,''
said Sherwin Little, a Latin teacher from Cincinnati who is an
adviser at the convention. ``There are lots of cutesy books out now
that tell you how to insult someone in Latin, or how to ask for a
date. The kids think it's hysterical. And we believe in whatever
works.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask these teenagers, ancient and modern definitely work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old David Wilson of Amarillo, Texas, said sure,
he's a dedicated student of Latin but what he really wants to do at
the convention, which ends today, is make a statement about the
Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Texas kids have better costumes, he insisted Thursday, which
was designated a ``day in old Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, in a tunic, was armed with a plastic sword and
inflatable spiked iron ball. On his cowboy hat was the button,
``oscula me'' _ ``kiss me'' in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The cutthroat state-against-state competition that is part of
the gathering includes traditional tests, Jeopardy-style games,
``Olympika'' sports events, and an art contest. Most of the winners
were to be announced late last night. Boston Latin Academy, the
Massachusetts Latin champions in state competition, did not make
the finals of the Certamen language and history competition here.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not dampen the enthusiasm of the Massachusetts
delegation in the biggest event, the daily ``spirit'' contest, in
which each state tries to outdo the others with costumes and chants
such as, ``We're number one. You're number two. We'll kick the
Latin right out of you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have spirit, you're not going to want to win,''
said Amanda Marcellino, 14, of Boston Latin Academy, explaining how
screaming, shouting, and waving banners is tied to sober study.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the levity, students conceded that learning classics makes
them better readers and writers. They also say it boosts scores on
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed Latin, but I'm just starting to appreciate
it,'' said Sarah Ramer, 17, of Wayne, N.J. ``When we read `Paradise
Lost' in English, I understood the long, complicated sentences
because they were just like Latin. And I got the references _ so I
didn't even need to read the footnotes.''
</P>
<P>
   High school Latin teacher Robin Boots-Ebenfield of New Jersey
said enthusiasm by students for the classics must be almost
entirely cultivated by good teachers: ``The successful teachers are
the salesmen and the `rah-rah' types.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even charismatic teachers may not be able to mainstream
the classics with teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our school, all the weirdos take Latin,'' said Cynthia
Keeler of Aurora, Col. ``But that's OK. They're interesting, and
they have a lot of spirit for Latin.''

THE KARMA CHAMELEON'S NEXT LIFE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy George has grown up. Yes, that is not a misprint. The
singer, flamboyant personality, and outre leader of '80s British
band Culture Club has been through a post-breakup malaise, drugs,
therapy, and various other side trips to emerge a thoughtful, still
outspoken, '90s revival story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually had a very easy time in Culture Club,'' George says
today. ``In terms of career, it took off really quickly. I made a
lot of money and I didn't really have to do much for myself. So,
when you come out the other end of that, you're pretty (messed up).
You have to start thinking for yourself and being a bit more
grown-up. And I guess that's what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunited Culture Club _ with George, Roy Hay, Mikey Craig,
and Jon Moss (all the original members) _ is headlining an '80s
package tour this summer with Human League and Howard Jones. George
&AMP; Co. reprise ``Karma Chameleon,'' ``Do You Really Want to Hurt
Me,'' ``I'll Tumble 4 Ya,'' and other hits. These appear on a new
double CD _ one a ``Greatest Hits'' record, the other an excellent
live disc taken from a recent ``Storytellers'' show on cable
station VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how you can discover your own music years
later,'' says George (born George Dowd 37 years ago), adding that
many of the tunes were not the sugary ditties they were thought to
be at that teen-idol time, but were really ``personal stories''
connected to his now-defunct love affair with drummer Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the relationship problems, the drugs, and whatever, now
give a real edge, because people know that the songs were about
something,'' says George. ``They were kind of the soundtrack of my
despair, if you like. And I think singing them now, and not being
involved with Jon, is very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Culture Club broke up in 1986. George was in the midst of a
raging, three-year heroin addiction, which he kicked in 1987. Since
then, he's released three solo albums (which have been far more
successful overseas than in America), been a dance club DJ, run a
record label, and for the last few years, written a weekly
newspaper column in London's Sunday Express. What about? ``Gay
politics and a bit of bitching about this or that person,'' says
George. ``But mainly issues that affect gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other members: Moss, his former lover, is now married
with a child and has had a home studio and done some live gigs; Hay
is living in Los Angeles and working on soundtracks with Grammy
nominee Hans Zimmer; and Craig is raising five children and has
been involved in a London dance club.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a Culture Club reunion came from VH1, George says.
``I thought, yeah, that could be interesting. It wasn't like I sat
down and said, OK, I got nothing else going on in my life, what
next? It wasn't a desperate move. It was more like the idea came up
and I thought, why not? It scared me a bit, which is a good thing.
Because I think if anything frightens you, even in a small way, it
represents a kind of challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect the Culture Club members to unburden
themselves to one another like new age converts. This is not the
Fleetwood Mac reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk about
what went on in the past,'' says George. ``People joke about it and
references are made constantly, but it's really not the British way
to sit down and analyze things. In that respect, I'm not typically
a British person, because I do analyze things. I also accept that I
come from a culture that doesn't do that, so it's a bit like
there's a rhinoceros in the room but nobody mentions it. Everyone
gets on very well, but maybe we'll have one night on tour where we
get really drunk and it all turns into a `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'
That could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Culture Club attempted a reunion in 1990 and
even started to make a new album, but George found it to be
``old-fashioned'' and bowed out. ``I'd been dabbling in dance music
and gone off in a totally different direction, yet there we were
making almost an '80s pastiche album. It just wasn't interesting to
me, so I caused a scene and left.''
</P>
<P>
   George realizes that this summer's return is a ``nostalgia
tour,'' but believes Culture Club will make a progressive new album
within the next year. ``To be honest with you, I really wouldn't be
doing this if there wasn't something else to come from it. What we
do next is the interesting bit, because I'm not interested in being
Gerry &AMP; the Pacemakers. For me, this tour is a means to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The new double CD has one new single, ``I Just Want to Be
Loved,'' which sounds like a traditional, roots-reggae tune.
``Everybody says that, but I think that's a good sign,'' says
George. ``But it is an original song.''
</P>
<P>
   Culture Club recently kicked off its tour by playing three
nights in Monte Carlo. ``That was very laid-back. It was
millionaires and their very young girlfriends,'' says George. ``But
it's going to be nice when we get out to play for real people _
people that know your songs.''
</P>
<P>
   George is excited about the triple bill with Human League and
Howard Jones. ``Originally it was going to be Duran Duran and
UB40,'' he says. ``But Duran Duran aren't speaking anymore; and
UB40, I don't think they could do it. So we just went for a list of
different bands. I love the Human League, so that was one of the
early choices. At the end of the day, it's got to work _ and I
think this is a very good lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Before George goes, he's asked to comment on the current state
of gay entertainers in this country. As expected, he has a quick
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people I know that are intelligent will say, `I think
this gay thing has gotten out of hand.' I'll say, `What the heck to
you mean?' They'll say, `You know, it's just gotten out of hand.'
And I'll go, `Oh, I see. We're allowed to exist, but we should just
keep our mouths shut.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my theory is that the world hasn't changed that much
in terms of gay issues or racism,'' says George. ``I think what
happens is that you change. I think the gay community, like the
black community, has gotten stronger. They have a sense of their
own power. They have a sense of pride. And they kind of orchestrate
the changes, just because of their own attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still not pleased, however, with the way gay artists are
portrayed on TV or the movies. ``I think it's always cliched. We're
always the kind of eyeliner on the one-liner. You're either
inoffensive, or you're a dork character. And I find that
frustrating. But then, I think that's true of all minorities. You
know, you have black guys who are the villains, South Americans who
are the thieves, and fat people who are funny. I just think it's
true of all minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the end of the day, it's about you. That's the one
thing that I've learned in the last few years. It's that you change
the attitude to yourself. Therefore, other people change their
attitude to you. Not all people, but enough of them.''

A HEARTY JOKE, NOT QUITE IN FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
POLISH WEDDING 
Directed and written by: Theresa Connelly 
Starring: Claire Danes, Lena Olin, Gabriel Byrne, Adam Trese, Mili
Avital, Daniel LaPaine, Rade Serbedzkija 
Running time: 101 minutes 
Rated: PG-13  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you make a film called ``Polish Wedding'' and not have it
turn into a Polish joke? That's the question facing first-time
writer-director Theresa Connelly, who knows the territory _
specifically, Hamtramck, the Polish-American enclave surrounded by
Detroit _ but hasn't the finesse to avoid having her film crumble
into self-conscious clunkiness as it overpitches the personality
clashes among its family named Pzoniak. It's dominated by that
earthiest of earth mothers, Lena Olin, as Jadzia, who declares
herself queen of her unruly clan _ a claim nobody is inclined to
dispute, especially her long-suffering husband, dour Bolek, a baker
who, as played by Gabriel Byrne, is submerged in denial as he
shuffles between hearth and home.
</P>
<P>
   Olin's smoldering matriarch seeks extramarital satisfaction in
the office building where she works as part of the cleaning crew.
What nobody seems to notice is that her DNA is very much present in
her daughter, Claire Danes, who hits a sympathetic level of edgy
agitation as she drives the neighborhood guys nuts. All that keeps
the locals away except for one smitten young cop (Adam Trese) are
the protective noises made by her strapping brothers, who crash
around the house like pieces of heavy construction equipment and
seem almost relieved to have their lives filled with purpose when
their mother orders them to get to work painting the outside and
washing the windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Olin and Danes and the others can carry the one-note
material only so far. Connelly does capture the sense of place
she's after, and the heartiness pervading the Pzoniak household,
seething with dissatisfaction though it is, feels like the real
thing. It can have been no easy feat to get a Hamtramck-based film
greenlit. But the fact that the richly textured flavor of life
there has never been adequately captured on film makes one wish
Connelly had done a few more rewrites and carried the Pzoniaks past
stereotype and sitcom hyperactivity and served up their cheatin' _
and vigorously beatin' _ hearts with more insight.

HAROLD RUSSELL'S BEST YEARS NEVER ENDED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Russell has to be the happiest double amputee in North
America, maybe the world. It's not that he wouldn't like his hands
back (blown off in a training accident stateside, ironically on
D-day), it's just that life is good. Sixty-five years ago, he
graduated from Rindge Technical School in the middle of the Great
Depression. Sixty years ago he was a meat cutter for a First
National Store in Cambridge, Mass. Fifty-five years ago he was a
paratrooper and instructor in explosives. And then something
happened. Fifty years ago he was the toast of the movie business,
promoting his 1946 Oscar-winning role as the sailor with no hands
in ``The Best Years of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, his movie made the short list of 100 greatest
American films, and Russell, a Hyannis, Mass. resident, was back in
the news. ``I've sort of inherited `Best Years','' he said
reflectively. ``I'm the last guy left. That's what happens when you
live to 84.''
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch the other guys were: Fredric March (Oscar for best
actor), Dana Andrews, William Wyler (Oscar for directing), and Sam
Goldwyn (Oscar for best picture). The film also pulled down Oscars
for screenplay, score, and editing. The quirkiest prize belongs to
Russell: At the beginning of the 1946 Academy Awards, they passed
out the ``special contributions'' Oscars and Russell got one,
presented by Shirley Temple. (It wasn't bad company. Laurence
Olivier got one for making Shakespeare's ``Henry V'' as a
morale-building epic for the British.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my award for special contributions,'' Russell recalled,
``and I'm hanging around backstage. I found out months later that
when I was nominated for supporting actor, they figured I didn't
have a chance, the other guys had too much background.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an understatement. The other nominees were Charles
Coburn (``The Green Years''), William Demarest (``The Jolson
Story''), Claude Rains (``Notorious''), and Clifton Webb (``The
Razor's Edge'').
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get to supporting actor,'' Russell continued, ``they
had to practically throw me out on the stage.'' That makes Russell
the answer to the trivia question: ``Who ever got two Oscars for
the same role?'' And another, more painful one: ``What actor ever
sold an Oscar statue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' Russell explained. ``My first wife was
dying, heart disease, and I didn't have the money. It caused a
stink. The academy was all upset, and the Screen Actors Guild, too.
Karl Malden was the academy president, and he must have called me
five or six times, mad as hell, and they offered me $20,000 not to
sell it. Well, it auctioned for $60,000 and I got $50,000 after the
auction house got its cut, and I needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, when they had the reunion of all the Oscar winners,
I see Malden, and I'm worrying about what he's gonna do, and he
comes up to me, and says, `Hi, Harold, delighted to see you here.'
So that's that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Harold Russell is an experience and has been since the
1940s, when he became chairman of the President's Commission on
Hiring the Handicapped (now the ``disabled'' or ``physically
challenged''). You get within reach of Russell for the first time
and he's got the hook out to shake your hand. ``That's something I
learned a long time ago,'' he said. ``You got to break the ice, get
over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   How Russell got the role in ``Best Years'' is a story in itself,
and one that says a lot about a happy man who can shake hooks with
the best of them. It starts in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an instructor in the parachute corps,'' he explained,
``joined up the day after Pearl Harbor and in 1944, I'm still an
instructor. I'll never forget how I got into airborne. I was
getting $21 a month in the Army, which was a hell of a shock. One
day these real sharp-looking guys show up, and they're recruiting
for the paratroops. And one of them says, `By the way, you get $50
a month extra.' I still remember that first $71 paycheck. I didn't
want to be an instructor _ that's what happens if you're good, you
get stuck instructing. I wanted to go overseas. I'm not bragging, I
just wanted to get in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I get out of the training command and into a new
outfit, the 13th Airborne Division, and, naturally, they make me an
instructor again, while we're waiting to go overseas. I'm an
explosives instructor. I don't know much about explosives, but I
like them, and I learn,'' he reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, June 6, 1944, we get called to a briefing. It's a
chaplain and a couple of officers, and they tell us about D-day.
Usually a briefing is less than an hour, but this one, with all the
questions, goes more than two hours. When it's over, we've still
got about a thousand troops to run through a live-ammo,
live-explosives obstacle course. So I started helping the guys make
up explosive charges. It's not my job, I'm supposed to be the boss,
but it's late in the day and we have to hurry it up. What I didn't
realize was those blasting caps had been sitting out in the sun, on
a blanket, for two hours, and they were touchy. I put one in a
quarter-pound of nitro-starch and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, it's the summer of 1944, and Russell is in Walter Reed
Hospital near Washington, D.C., getting fixed up with his hooks.
``I was one sorry sack,'' he reminded himself as much as the
listener, ``and if I'd had the guts, I would have killed myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed us this little short movie one day: `Meet
McGonegal.' He's a World War I vet with no hands. Turns out he's
also a millionaire, made it all selling real estate in Southern
California after the war, and he was smart enough to cash it all in
before the crash in '29.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I hear McGonegal is coming to Walter Reed to talk to
the vets, and I tell the doctor, `I have to meet that man, this is
like Santa Claus coming.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I ask him? I say, `Charlie, this a personal question
and I want a truthful answer. How do you live with those damn
hooks?' And I never forgot what he said: `It's not what you lost
that's important, it's what you do with what you have left.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was great. He told me that the reason he was such a success
as a salesman was that no one ever forgot him. They might not buy
something the first time, but he never had to introduce himself
again. They remembered. And he's the one that taught me to put the
hook out and shake hands, break the ice, get it over with. If
people can't cope, you're better off finding out right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Russell went back to the rehab room and started to learn
how to use the hooks. A few months later, a very Hollywood thing
happened. The government wanted Hollywood to make an educational
film about handicapped veterans. Someone remembered the old silent
film ``Meet McGonegal.'' And Hollywood called Walter Reed and asked
if they had a vet with no hands. In their Hollywood way, they were
playing it safe and making a sequel. This one was called ``Diary of
a Sergeant.'' Russell was the sergeant, someone did the voiceover,
he never said a word on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Then the plot thickens, or at least meanders. Out in Hollywood,
Sam Goldwyn wanted to make a film about the problems of disabled
veterans. He had William Wyler under contract for one more film,
and he ordered Wyler to do it. They got a screenplay from MacKinley
Cantor, who in a fit of something-or-other, turned in a blank-verse
novella. Goldwyn hired Robert Sherwood (then a popular playright)
to do a treatment in regular English. And they tried to cast the
movie. The most disabled character is a sailor with neurological
damage that has made him spastic. A dozen actors tried and couldn't
manage acting spastic, including Farley Granger, a consummate
screen actor. So they killed the project for a while, shelved it,
left it in the limbo of unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now here's what happened,'' Russell said, picking up the
narrative again: ``My life is a series of things that just happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're having one last war bond drive, I mean the war's over,
this is the last one to pay off the last stuff, and they decide to
include `Diary of a Sergeant' on the program. And somebody drags
Willie Wyler to this war bond thing. He couldn't give a crap about
war bonds. But he sees `Diary' and the light bulb goes on. He says,
`Hey, we can make the spastic a double amputee!' And that's how you
win an Oscar.'' Russell is being modest. He may be the best actor
on the screen, utterly natural, perfectly believable. But for that,
he credits Wyler's directorial skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had a beef with Willy,'' Russell recalled. ``He was
always doing 10, a dozen takes. And this one scene, all I do is
come into my little sister's bedroom, she's asleep, and I take the
hooks and move the blanket up over her and tuck her in. I must have
done it 25 times, and I say: `Willy, what the hell do you want me
to do?' And he says: `I don't know, but when I see it, I'll
know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has very fond memories of all his co-stars:
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy March, he was a great guy. He had one beef with me,
we're shooting the first scene in the barroom, and he comes over
and says: ``Hey, Russell, when I speak my lines, keep those damn
hooks out of sight.' Well, we're supposed to be in a barroom,
right? And what do you do when you shut up and let the other guy
talk? You take a sip of your beer, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoagy Carmichael was terrific. He's my uncle in the movie. We
have this great scene where I play the piano with him, and I keep
screwing him up, wrong note, wrong time, and he's very kind, very
generous, just great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dana Andrews, he didn't hang around the set, you didn't know
him. He does his scene, he's gone. One time _ he used to drink, you
know, he ended up making public service announcements about booze _
he finishes, calls a cab, and they find him and the cab driver in
San Francisco two days later. They dry him out and we go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it out there. One day I stopped by Wyler's office and
said: `Willy, I've got a contract with Mr. Goldwyn for three more
pictures. What should I do? I want the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is what he says: `You're not gonna like this, Harold,
but there aren't that many parts for a guy with no hands. You
should go back to college (Boston University), get your degree.'
Which I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And Harold Russell got a life, working for every president from
Harry Truman to George Bush, traveling to every state and many
foreign countries, lobbying for disabled veterans and other
handicapped people. He says it all just happened, which is maybe
true, as long as, like Russell, you ask people to tell you the
truth, they do, and you listen.

RATING WRIGHT AND WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Granted, Ben Wright was never convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   His mistake occurred in 1995, when the Wilmington News Journal
quoted the television golf analyst explaining his views on the
LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbians in the sport hurt women's golf,'' Wright said. Women
golfers, he added, ``are handicapped by having boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite naturally, as Mr. Sensitive told Sports Illustrated,
unnamed CBS officials told him to deny making the statements. So
Wright said he was misquoted, and CBS in turn stood by its
prize-winning guy, re-signing him to a four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the ink had dried on the deal, CBS suspended
the Briton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so bloody stupid; stupid, naive, and weak,'' Wright told
Sports Illustrated. ``The most stupid thing I did was remain
silent. I should have come out and said, `Hey, I said all these
dumb things, and they were wrong ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Wright is now 65 years old, and he is probably really sorry
about making those statements.
</P>
<P>
   But what is particularly disgusting about the television
industry these days is the use of disgraced announcers to boost
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Charles, executive producer of T.J. Sports Television, is
the latest fraud. He decided to bring Wright back to do commentary
for a syndicated show.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to what Charles told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for all the publicity I can get on this show _
good, bad, or indifferent,'' he said. ``My personal opinion was
that Ben got a raw deal. But we'd still have gone after him because
he's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of the show is unimportant; it's lame, anyway, largely
because shameless hucksters like Charles are willing to do anything
to get a speck of a rating.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden Network president Dave Checketts pulled
the same stunt with Marv Albert.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after pleading guilty to a misdeamenor charge
of assault, Albert was hired back to do radio play-by-play for the
New York Knicks and to host a 30-minute sports news show on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy the Greek never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosities sell. No telling what Marv might do or Wright might
say.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Wright will not be on live. His two-minute
segments are taped.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CBS out of race
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TNN will air the NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400 Oct. 17. CBS was
scheduled to show the race July 4, but fires near Daytona
International Speedway forced a cancellation of what would have
been the first live network telecast of a night race. CBS Sports
was unable to fit the race into its October programming, so it was
shifted to TNN Motorsports, which CBS owns. CBS plans to air the
race in 1999 ... On Sunday, TNN will show the NASCAR Pennzoil/VIP
Discount Auto Center 200 Craftsman Truck series race live from New
Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon ... ESPN2 plans to
televise as many as five US games at the World Basketball
Championships in Athens. If the US makes it past the first round,
ESPN2 will air two second-round games _ Monday at midight and
Tuesday at 9 p.m. The remaining telecasts would be next Friday at 4
p.m. (quarterfinal), Aug. 8 at 5 (semifinal), and Aug. 9 at 1
(championship) ... HBO's ``Boxing After Dark'' will televise the
Goodwill Games boxing semifinals and final. The broadcasts air
tonight and tomorrow nights at 11, with Jim Lampley, Larry
Merchant, and Roy Jones Jr. calling the action from ringside ...
CBS has announced its NFL broadcast teams for the upcoming season.
Greg Gumbel, Phil Simms, and Armen Keteyian will be the No. 1 team,
followed by Verne Lundquist, Randy Cross, and Michele Tafoya; Kevin
Harlan and Sam Wyche; Gus Johnson and Steve Tasker; Ian Eagle and
Mark May; Don Criqui and Beasley Reece; and Craig Bolerjack or Bill
Macatee and John Dockery. The ``NFL Today'' team is composed of Jim
Nantz, Marcus Allen, Brent Jones, and George Seifert.

A PENETRATING WAR OF THE WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WAR AND CIVILIZATION 
Produced by: Bruce Eadie 
Directed by: Tony Bulley 
On: TLC (The Learning Channel) 
Date: Sunday-Wednesday, 9-11 p.m.begins august 2 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given that there's no human record of a century without war,
what does the future hold, especially now that civilization has
perfected means to annihilate itself?
</P>
<P>
   That's the dreadful question hovering over the ambitious ``War
and Civilization,'' an eight-hour, eight-episode survey of warfare
through the ages produced for the Learning Channel. Two aging
eminences _ Walter Cronkite, who narrates, and John Keegan, whose
acclaimed work in military studies informs the documentary _
provide intellectual ballast and an air of gravity. If it all
sounds a bit leaden, well, it's not, at least based on the four
episodes I saw, including the engaging introductory hour and the
concluding episode, which is the most opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   ``War and Civilization'' is quite right to ask large
philosophical questions, although Keegan's answers are simplistic
and sometimes contradictory. For example, he submits that actions
like those by the United States in the Gulf War are ``absolutely
necessary'' to restrain rogue states. Then he goes on to speculate
that wars have perhaps become too humanly and materially costly to
prosecute at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Keegan's large-caliber ideas aren't vital to the overall
success of ``War and Civilization,'' which is enlivened and
distinguished by fascinating details. This well-researched
information is often embedded in exciting mini-chronicles of
pivotal battles and campaigns that keep one's attention glued to
the program. (Two episodes air nightly, Sunday through Wednesday, 9
to 11 and again midnight to 2 a.m.)
</P>
<P>
   The Western way of war was born 3,000 years ago, we learn in the
first episode, with Greek warriors known as Hoplites deployed in
phalanx formations bristling with long spears. Their aim was that
of subsequent armies, to act quickly and decisively. They bore 70
pounds of armor and weapons, just as today's US infantry soldiers
carry roughly 70 pounds of gear. The more things change, the more,
intriguingly, they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed radically, of course, is mankind's killing
efficiency and power. Some 3.5 million troops were involved at
Stalingrad during World War II, the biggest battle in history, in
which 1.1 million Soviet soldiers were killed. More than 100
million people have perished in 20th-century warfare, more than all
the lives lost in the previous history of warfare, according to the
final hour, ``The Price of War.'' Rules governing warfare
essentially vanished in the mid-20th century, just as the atom bomb
made its horrifying impact.
</P>
<P>
   Facts and such staggering figures as these rarely are divorced
from a rich context that often relates warfare to other human
endeavors. For example, we see the ways war tears economies apart:
Many European cities went bankrupt building a new wave of
fortifications designed to withstand cannon fire. As another
example, we learn that the advent of gunpowder ushered in medical
advances as physicians began treating the complex internal wounds
inflicted by gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in ``War and Civilization'' is more curious than another
story related in episode 4,``Gunpowder.'' Although Japanese
warlords fought with guns in the late 16th century, these weapons
soon vanished from the island nation because of its ancient
reverence for the sword. For 250 years, the Japanese confined
themselves to the sacred blade in combat. The sharpness of
lovingly, painstakingly crafted new swords was tested, by the way,
on the corpses of executed criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the important actions ``War and Civilization'' skillfully
and grippingly distills are the battles at Salamis between Greek
and Persian vessels; of the Battle of Crecy, where English longbows
overwhelmed the French; and of Waterloo, where 190,000 troops
clashed on a tiny battlefield and 40,000 men were left dead or
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The production hardly moves at the pace of MTV, but the series'
well-staged reenactments, crisp editing, and canny use of sound
effects invigorates the battle scenes, helping the viewer sense the
horror and, sometimes, the strange pageantry of mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   If Keegan's overarching ideas aren't original, some of his
geopolitical hypotheses seem fresh, and certainly provocative.
Take, for instance, his notion that although the United States was
finally driven out of Vietnam by a cause-inspired enemy, our long
and aggressive presence there was ``decisive'' in bringing an end
to the Cold War because of the impression it left on the USSR.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, flaws and peculiarities in a production
this broad and ambitious. One little oddity it's impossible to
forget are long shots of historian Keegan filmed, it appears,
leaning on a bridge in London, and looking like he's from another
century wearing formal white gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes I saw vary considerably in their narrative
coherence, but all are well-written and have a great deal to offer,
as I strongly suspect the others do, too.

 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is a lonely sight in the Prudential Center: stacks
of T-shirts bearing the golden ``Cheers'' emblem, a television
blaring an episode from 1984, shoppers strolling indifferently past
images of the prudish waitress with winged hair.
</P>
<P>
   One man glances at the vending cart, then moves on. A salesman
from St. Louis ponders a coffee cup and two mugs. The vendor says
business is usually better, but five years after the last episode
of the sitcom, even she prays for the fate of Boston's most famous
fictional bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one girl come and buy a T-shirt, and then she said,
`What is Cheers?''' said Tracy Wright, 24. ``Somebody else asked me
if Cheers was a kind of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still, to some outsiders, a symbol of this city. Tourists
still buy Cheers keychains, though vendors say sales are dropping;
commercial ``Cheers bars'' now pepper airports around the globe,
though even the logo seems as antiquated as flowery Coca-Cola
script. In Boston, the Bull &AMP; Finch pub, credited with inspiring
the Hollywood set, sticks name tags on diners _ still making it, as
the theme song goes, the bar where ``everybody knows your name.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is: who will remember it?
</P>
<P>
   Off the air except for reruns since the famous ``Last Call''
episode in 1993, ``Cheers'' appears, understandably, to have lost
its luster among tourists. And Boston seems to be drifting away
from one important part of its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as hot as it was in its heyday, but I think there
still will be a curiosity factor,'' said Peggy Davis-Mullen,
chairwoman of the City Council's committee on tourism. ``That will
change as we all get older. My generation, we're the same age as
some of those folks, so we could identify. But as the viewing
audience gets older and as the hip stuff gets younger, then you'll
see an even greater impact.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the tangible evidence: Attendance at the Bull &AMP; Finch,
the Beacon Hill watering hole that became the model for the Cheers
bar, dropped by 200,000 in the first year after the show went off
the air, according to a survey by the Boston Business Journal. More
than half a dozen local concierges say requests for directions are
now infrequent. Even Stan Novack, vice president of Host Marriott,
which runs the restaurant chain, says merchandise sales have
dropped off over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the anecdotal evidence, the stories from local
tourism experts that suggest the television show no longer
symbolizes Boston to the rest of the nation _ and that Cheers
character Diane Chambers now has a rival as the female icon of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get an Ally McBeal bar,'' Davis-Mullen said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Cheers logo has become its own
nationwide tourist phenomenon, akin to Planet Hollywood or the Hard
Rock Cafe. Just last week, a new Cheers bar opened in Omaha; last
month, another debuted in Kuala Lumpur, Novack said. But the
approximately $30 million revenue the food chain brings in each
year is related more to the convenience of the restaurant than the
television show or its home port, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken on a life of its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Kershaw, owner of the original Bull &AMP; Finch, insists
the same is true in Boston. But unlike an interview in 1994, when
he boasted $4.5 million in merchandise revenue alone, Kershaw last
week refused to divulge the revenues or even number of guests over
the last four years because it is a ``privately held company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is that business is still good,'' he said. ``If
I gave numbers at one point, that's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Concierges at local hotels tell a different story, one that
centers on classic Boston institutions along the Freedom Trail.
While there are some requests for directions to ``the Cheers
place'' _ and even fewer for the two Cheers bars at Logan airport _
the television lure hardly compares to the two longtime favorites:
Faneuil Hall and the USS Constitution, concierges said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a place people ask for,'' said Alain Morel, concierge
at the Ritz-Carlton on Arlington Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they don't know about it. We recommend it
anyway,'' said Betty Salemme, of the Seaport Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And of the tourists interviewed last week, more than a few
admitted to having left Cheers off their lists. Adam Jacobs, 32,
and Carri Martino, 27, of San Francisco, happened by the Beacon
Street bar ``by mistake'' and kept walking because it is
``touristy.'' Erin Keane, 15, of New Jersey, made it to the Freedom
Trail, the Aquarium, Quincy Market, the Titanic show, the USS
Constitution, and the Museum of Fine Arts gift shop. But not the
Bull &AMP; Finch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to,'' she shrugged. ``But we didn't get to it.''

   Peter Moore is a student of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for the ``why'' when events don't happen the way
they're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for example, did Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. increase its market
share when it reduced the number of hair-care products on store
shelves by 50 percent?
</P>
<P>
   Why will people who won't spend $1 on a fast-food hamburger
spend $3 on a cup of coffee?
</P>
<P>
   Why are people leaving good jobs for high-risk opportunities,
even when they're being offered more money to stay?
</P>
<P>
   Studying such social and economic anomalies can help
corporations chart the hidden forces that are driving customer and
employee behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need to understand the forces motivating individuals
if they expect to survive and prosper in the future, he says in the
just-released ``The Caterpillar Doesn't Know; How Personal Change
Is Creating Organizational Change'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998, $30).
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his co-author, Kenneth Hey, are managing partners at
Inferential Focus, a New York-based market-intelligence company. He
was in Seattle this week consulting with clients, including
Microsoft Corp., on how corporate strategies can respond to the
shifting values and priorities of employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   People are spending money differently from the way they used to,
he said. They relate to their employers differently.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, people made whatever sacrifices necessary to attain
their economic goals, he said. ``People are not willing to give you
80 to 90 hours per week anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they want different things from their life and work.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a sea change in people's attitudes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being motivated by wealth and achievement, more
people today value balance and control.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, massive layoffs, encroaching
terrorism, excesses on Wall Street, even random events, such as the
1986 space shuttle explosion, have combined to give people the
sense the world was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   That caused a large-scale rethinking of what really mattered in
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   And the result has been behavior that doesn't appear to make
sense when viewed through the old lens of how the world worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of big companies are finding is it's increasingly
harder and harder to not only recruit, but retain good people,'' he
said. Employees want more time for themselves, and they want more
entrepreneurial opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But companies are slow to pick up on that message, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends a ``horse whisperer'' approach to coping with the
social changes under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step is to let go,'' he said. ``Companies have to
realize they don't control the terms of engagement with employees
and customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they need to figure out what employees and customers
want and find ways to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees have a desire for learning,'' he said. ``They have a
desire for decision-making support and help trying to find this
balance and control in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble recognized that shift. The company decided that
providing more hair products wasn't serving customers, who were
already struggling with too many choices. That's why streamlining
its hair-care line plumped up its sales, instead of causing them to
go limp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a counterintuitive move at the time, Moore said. But it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to let go of the corporate mantra ``more, better,
faster,'' he said. But consumers were saying, ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're saying enough is enough at work, too, he said.
Companies need to find ways to give employees time for reflection,
to think about their work, without frantically having to try to
keep on top of the avalanche of information _ e-mail, memos, phone
calls and faxes _ that flows over their desks each day.
</P>
<P>
   Companies need to provide employees opportunities to learn, too,
he said. More employees are viewing their careers like a
curriculum. They want to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have spent fortunes reorganizing themselves, he said.
But unless they're taking into account the changes in individual
priorities, such reorganizing won't necessarily help the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition of a changed individual should underlie the entire
process of changing the organization,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason, leaders need to think of consumers and
employees as the same people in different roles and must work to
develop an organization that brings those two elements into
harmony.''

IN THE WEST WING, ALL REMAINS QUIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven times during a daily briefing with reporters
this week, White House press secretary Michael McCurry pleaded
ignorance to questions on the Monica S. Lewinsky case and the
president's strategy in addressing the allegations. And that was
just in the first two minutes of the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   His professed ignorance has become routine around the West Wing,
where the most senior, most trusted political aides say they have
no input in or knowledge of Clinton's legal maneuvers and the
decisions that could affect the course of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, prominent Clinton allies outside the White
House now say that the president's failure to publicly address the
charges and his inability to adopt a coherent public relations
strategy has created the impression _ rightly or wrongly _ of an
administration in utter disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the ``war room'' mentality that carried Clinton through
allegations of marital infidelity in New Hampshire in 1992, the
campaign-finance charges in 1997, and the first weeks of the
Lewinsky investigation earlier this year. It has been replaced,
according to one administration official, by an ``exhaustion
mentality,'' with weary officials either tendering their
resignations, as McCurry has done, or actively seeking to know as
little as possible about Clinton's plight for fear of being
subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disquieting, discomforting part of all this is that
ignorance is bliss,'' said one administration official. ``People in
the White House just don't want to know anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: public relations disasters, like the weekend refusal
by White House officials to even acknowledge the fact that Clinton
received a subpoena from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr _ a
first for a president. In private, McCurry seemed angered by the
lack of communication between Clinton's lawyers and policy
advisers. The White House still did not even acknowledge that it
had received the subpoena until Starr withdrew it in a deal for
Clinton's testimony on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Clinton has remained engaged in his policy
agenda, and has maintained his public schedule. He was in North
Carolina Thursday for an environmental event and is heading to the
Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y., this weekend for a round of fund
raising with some of the party's biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in to see the president this morning, and he looked
up and said, `We should be saying more about technology,''' Ann
Lewis, the White House communications director, said of a midweek
encounter. Lewis said the president then began adding things to a
speech on education, and described him as ``focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other aides privately told of a distracted president
spending an increasing amount of time behind closed doors with
lawyers Robert Bennett, David Kendall, Mickey Kantor, and White
House counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   They also reported growing frustrations with a policy agenda
that appeared to stall the day the Lewinsky story splashed across
the front page of the Washington Post in January.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning and evening, White House political strategists
like Doug Sosnik, a Clinton counselor, and Rahm Emanuel, Clinton's
chief adviser, gather in Ruff's office to discuss the day's news.
At each meeting, Ruff tells the rest of the staff virtually nothing
about the legal matters Clinton faces, and faces a dwindling number
of questions from a staff beaten down by a lack of answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the state of the White House,''
said one adviser with intimate knowledge. ``There is a tremendous
amount of disarray and lack of a message. There was that silliness
of not confirming the serving of a subpoena, the lack of any
message team. There is literally a total vacuum of political and
press strategy in the White House. Everyone has taken a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Many White House aides were buoyed by news reports that Lewinsky
told Starr's prosecutors that she herself had typed up the
``talking points'' document given to her former friend Linda R.
Tripp. McCurry scolded reporters for printing and broadcasting
stories that insinuated Clinton confidant and White House Deputy
Counsel Bruce Lindsey was the author. But even that victory seemed
to fade away in the other news of the week, the arrangements made
by Lewinsky and Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the case is resolved, many in the West Wing expect
to no longer be part of the Clinton circle. McCurry has announced
he will depart in October. Chief of staff Erskine Bowles has sent
strong signals that he will leave by year's end. Thursday, he
uncharacteristically gave two speeches during a Clinton trip to
North Carolina, in what appeared to be a dry run for a possible
gubernatorial bid. And Emanuel has long been rumored to be leaving
the White House for his native Chicago.

GUTHRIE COMES ALIVE THROUGH THE MUSIC OF BRAGG, WILCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   English protest singer and former punk rocker Billy Bragg
discovered American folk legend Woody Guthrie at age 15 _ through
the Guthrie-style ballads of Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a cassette of Guthrie's music, but to be perfectly
honest I found it rather difficult to listen to,'' Bragg, 41, said
in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sensibilities were not attuned. Punk had not opened my eyes
to that kind of music. So I really didn't think much more about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the years passed and Bragg's own music evolved from punk
to protest music, he began to appreciate the legacy of such songs
as ``This Land Is Your Land,'' ``Bound for Glory'' and ``Pastures
of Plenty.'' Bragg realized he had a lot in common with Guthrie,
though the two musicians were separated by a couple generations and
an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Woody had pretty different experiences _ he in the
1930s and '40s and me in the '70s and '80s _ but I think we came to
similar conclusions,'' Bragg said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bragg was invited to perform at a memorial concert
celebrating what would have been Guthrie's 80th birthday at New
York's Central Park. (Guthrie died in 1967 of Huntington's chorea,
a degenerative disorder of the nervous system.) It was there that
Bragg met Guthrie's daughter, Nora Guthrie, who was establishing an
archive of her father's music.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a similarity between Bragg's music and her father's,
Nora Guthrie gave Bragg photocopies of several of Woody Guthrie's
songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were typed and some were handwritten,'' Bragg
said. ``(Guthrie) took a correspondence course in typing as a
teenager and he was a very fast typist. The lyrics for `Bound for
Glory' were typed without punctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nora Guthrie's encouragement, Bragg's interpretations of
Guthrie's songs led to the creation of Bragg's new album, ``Mermaid
Avenue,'' named for the Coney Island street where Guthrie and his
family lived the late 1940s and early '50s. The extraordinary album
features 15 previously unrecorded Guthrie songs, among them ``Way
Over Yonder in the Minor Key,'' ``Hoodoo Voodoo'' and ``Christ for
President,'' brought to life by Bragg and roots-rock band Wilco,
with guest vocals on two songs by Natalie Merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all complete songs,'' Bragg said of the Guthrie tunes
on the album. ``But the music was not written down, it was carried
in his head. There is no musical notation whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bragg and Wilco had little difficulty imagining what
Guthrie may have had in mind when he wrote the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a songwriter, I sweat over my lyrics more than anything. So
much of the effort goes into writing the lyrics and making them
articulate something,'' Bragg said. ``But the music just flows. I
hear the music as I write the words. So all I had to do with
Woody's lyrics was sit down and feel the tunes. And if the music
didn't fit, I'd try another song.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Guthrie, as if speaking from the afterlife, gave
Bragg little clues.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg was startled to discover a song Guthrie had written in the
early '50s titled ``My Flying Saucer.'' To Bragg, the song was
evidence Guthrie was ahead of his time, forging sounds that would
later reach the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not expect Woody Guthrie to write a song that might
end up on `The X-Files,' '' Bragg said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising, Guthrie had written the words ``supersonic
boogie'' in the upper left hand corner of the page, where he often
indicated a song's tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by the uncharacteristic phrase, Bragg was inspired to
try something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the little guy's voice whispering in my ear, and he
said, `Go on, Bill, I dare you. I dare you to take one of the
sacred texts of St. Woody Guthrie and play it to a supersonic
boogie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, All right, Woody boy, I'll take you up on it. You
wrote these two little words, almost 50 years ago, for me to pick
up on. And I'm going to run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg said he was encouraged by the response the album has
received from those who were close to Guthrie, including folk
musician Fred Hellerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are very, very concerned, but also very,
very old,'' Bragg said. ``And they want to know that this legacy is
going to be passed on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg said he is often asked if Guthrie is relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Beck that question,'' he said. ``Who else is more cutting
edge than Beck? And there he is quoting Woody Guthrie, copping
licks off Woody, talking about Woody in interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg is still chuckling over a recent magazine article in which
Beck said Guthrie was sexy but folk veteran Pete Seeger, whose
friendship with Guthrie began in the '30s, was not.
</P>
<P>
   The subject came up later at the Woody Guthrie archive, located
at the New York office of talent manager Harold Leventhal, who also
represents Seeger. Leventhal's wife, Natalie, offered a
recollection of Guthrie's sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and I were standing by the copy machine and she said, `You
didn't know Woody, did you?' And I said, `No, Natalie, no I
didn't.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, she sort of looked off into the distance and
said, `Well, you know, Woody was a scrawny little guy with a big
nose and sort of black fuzzy hair . . . But, by God, he was sexy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stuff is just priceless. You can't get that from
an archive.''

TUATARA'S ECLECTIC SOUND FLOWS FROM ITS DIVERSITY OF MUSICAL
TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Named for a reptile once common in New Zealand, Seattle band
Tuatara sounds ancient yet modern.
</P>
<P>
   Formed by drummer-percussionist Barrett Martin of Screaming
Trees, bassist Justin Harwood of Luna, saxophonist Skerik of
Critters Buggin' and guitarist, mandolinist Peter Buck of R.E.M.,
Tuatara is a collaborative group that has grown to about 10
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Its first album, ``Breaking the Ethers'' (Epic Records), offered
a rhythmic, exotic blend of musical styles played on sitar,
saxophone, steel drums, marimba, vibraphone, acoustic bass,
didgeridoo and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading With the Enemy,'' the group's follow-up album (also on
Epic), released last month, was recorded in Seattle at the Ironwood
and Jupiter studios. It's more accessible than the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first album was more ambient and atmospheric, whereas the
second has more songs, more compositions,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Though Martin and Harwood are listed as co-producers, everyone
contributed to the new album's creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because Barrett and I are founding members and it's
sort of our project conceptually, everyone looks to us for a nod,''
Harwood said. ``But that's about as far as it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Martin, Harwood, Skerik and Buck, Tuatara currently
includes saxophonist Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, guitarist Scott
McCaughey of The Minus 5 and the Young Fresh Fellows, percussionist
Elizabeth Pupo-Walker, multi-instrumentalist Mike Stone and horn
players Christopher Littlefield and Craig Flory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can get much bigger,'' Harwood said. ``We've
got most of the bases covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuatara's sound evolved over many jam sessions, where shared
ideas were massaged into songs. Martin's collection of hundreds of
instruments from around the world insured that each session would
be unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring an instrument into the studio and put it over in the
corner and someone will always go over and try it,'' Harwood said.
``And within five minutes, they've come up with a riff _ maybe the
only one they've been able to play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first to admit that you're not going to master an
instrument that's not indigenous to your culture,'' Martin added.
``That's best left to the masters. But if you can get a cool sound
out of it, it's worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs on the new album are diverse. ``Smuggler's Cove,''
which Stone contributed, has a film noir feel. ``Koto Song,''
written by McCaughey, recalls the Polynesia-inspired vintage lounge
music of Martin Denny.
</P>
<P>
   The atmospheric ``Wormwood'' was written late at night, using
vibraphone and upright bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the only time when I've actually turned the
lights down in order to get a vibe going,'' Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Buck provided the basic riffs for the tongue-in-cheek
``L'Espionage Pomme de Terre'' (Espionage of the Potato), based on
incident in which Buck was arrested while on an African safari for
taking photos at an airport. The airport, situated in a town named
for the local potato, turned out to be a military base.

POWERBALL'S `LUCKY' 13? DON'T BET ON IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What intrigued America most this week was not anything bubbling
out of the swamp in D.C.: Out here, we're talking Powerball, the
fantasy of striking it fabulously rich with a one-dollar pass
through a lottery terminal.
</P>
<P>
   And terminal, alas, are the hopes of millions of us who tossed
greenbacks onto the bonfire of illusory dreams. Psychiatrists warn
of post-Powerball withdrawal, triggering depression or worse among
vulnerable bettors who shoved too much of their already fragile
self-esteem into the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   You're more likely to be hit by lightning than to beat the
one-in-80-million lottery odds. Let's hear it for the winners, 13
people from an Ohio machine shop who sent to Indiana for the
fateful purchase. That gang will split up a pre-tax lump sum of
$160-odd million, the fattest prize anywhere, ever. We wish them
well.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a downside to winning. Not that fear of winning
prevented me from handing a ten-spot to my friend who put a little
pool together. Winning fantastic wealth means you solve a bunch of
your existing problems _ and inherit a swath of new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're one of the Lucky 13 from the machine shop, and you
get a one-13th share of the lump sum, $12.4 million before taxes,
$9 million after. You now have a whole new set of problems. People
think you are filthy rich, and so they treat you differently.
Everyone close to you knows your bottom line just improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn to say `no,''' was the advice of the new lawyer for the
Ohio 13. You'll get a lot of practice using the ``N'' word. At
home, at work, if you continue to work, in church, everyone will
have their hand out.
</P>
<P>
   You are doomed to a lifetime of either overtipping or being
called a cheapskate behind your back. You will not be able to enter
your neighborhood coffee shop, convenience store, or gas station
without someone hollering out unsolicited advice or making some
kind of snide crack. You'll develop a sinking sensation that your
life has changed, permanently, in ways you never anticipated, and
do not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   You'll become shyer around strangers, waiting for a flicker of
recognition, some double-take, some acknowledgment of your
perceived good luck, and their same-old-same-old bad luck. And that
will get tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Jordan or Leonardo DiCaprio, you'll be unable to
eat out without waiting for someone to clap you on the shoulder
while your fork is just passing under your nose. I once sat at a
fancy dinner next to a stunningly beautiful movie star. She had no
problem sticking to her diet, because persistently intrusive fans
kept interrupting her for a hello, a snapshot, an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Most lottery winners drift back into anonymity with the general
public _ but not with their immediate circle. Quitting your job,
swapping friendly colleagues for beady-eyed money managers who bill
you by the minute, becoming suspicious of every approach, wary that
every Little Leaguer high school yearbook salesman is waiting to
pounce; all this is not fun.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I long assumed that with just ten grand more a
year, everything would be fine. But there's never enough money.
It's always ten more, and ten more on top of that ten. A pal who
calls himself ``the old Southie sage'' listens to the laments of
the retired gents who hang out around Castle Island. ``What do you
do tomorrow? Nothing? Nothing is hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about all the people in our society who achieve the
highest prizes and the grief they frequently encounter. Bill
Clinton? His privacy is destroyed, his conduct widely questioned,
his personal morality impugned, his enemies in full cry. Would you
swap places with Bill? Or with, say, Mike Tyson? A psychological
basket case, unable to control himself, a cartoonish parody of a
self-confident heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana? Was she lucky? Pick one of dozens of movie
stars, rock musicians, athletic icons, weigh what you know of their
lives, and ask: Was what they gained worth what they lost? Jack
Kennedy? Marilyn Monroe? Do you see a pattern here? Achieving a
goal means ending a dream. And then you need a new dream to replace
the old one that brought you as far as you already got.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the ranks of the newly rich can be jarring. ``Let me
tell you about the very rich,'' wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald. ``They
are different from you and me ... They think, deep in their hearts,
that they are better than we are. They are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of all rich people inherited their money. The top one
percent of American households was worth an average of about $8
million three years ago, economist Edward Wolff told the Christian
Science Monitor. The rich are getting younger, and their ranks
include more Asians, Hispanics, and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The richest 10 percent of Americans own 88 percent of all stocks
and mutual funds. So they've been getting richer. But happier?
That's another story. Ten years from now, I'll bet some of those 13
Ohio machine shop winners will wish their number had never come up.

CRUDE `BASEKETBALL' FAILS TO SCORE LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Baseketball is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

BASEKETBALL 
Directed by: David Zucker 
Written by: David Zucker and Robert LoCash 
Starring: Matt Stone, Trey Parker, Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy,
Robert Vaughn, Dian Bachar 
Running time: 104 minutes 
Rated: R (If it's objectionable or offensive, you'll find it here) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the guys who made anal probes and
talking excrement funny.
</P>
<P>
   They are the creators of Comedy Central's ``South Park,'' the
``It'' show of the moment, a devastatingly crude animated series
which suggests how the ``Peanuts'' gang might have turned out if
they'd feasted on a steady diet of Quentin Tarantino, Marilyn
Manson, and the Playboy Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone who has ever watched the TV-M rated foibles of
Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in their fictional Colorado town
knows, a little dab of ``South Park'' will do you just fine for a
good long time, unless you have a serious jones for bodily fluids
and gross-out humor.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, ``Baseketball,'' may be the film for you.
</P>
<P>
   Lowbrow doesn't even begin to explain this comedy, which stars
Parker and Stone as lifelong friends and losers who hit it big when
they create a new sport, a combination of baseball and basketball.
If it's offensive or objectionable, director David Zucker of
``Airplane'' and ``Naked Gun'' fame, who co-wrote the script with
Robert LoCash, finds a way to get it in the movie:
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old liver patient doing tequila shots? Yup!
</P>
<P>
   A man saying ``Got Milk,'' then squirting the aforementioned
liquid from his nipples? Check!
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Borgnine doing a strip tease and singing Right Said
Fred's ``I'm Too Sexy''? You betcha!
</P>
<P>
   This film is crass, coarse, vulgar, and uncouth. But its biggest
sin is that it's rarely funny. Crude and rude is fine, but the
point should be to make 'em laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the film has its moments. It gets off to a
great start when young Joe Cooper, sitting in Yankee Stadium,
catches the third home run hit by Reggie Jackson in the deciding
game of the 1977 World Series, It is a pure spiritual sports
moment, but ever since professional sports have been corrupted, a
narrator tells us. Athletes are more interested in end zone dances
than sportsmanship, evidenced by a ``Riverdance''-style celebration
after a football team scores.
</P>
<P>
   Teams test the loyalty of fans by moving from one locale to the
next. Says the narrator, ``The Minnesota Lakers moved to Los
Angeles where there are no lakes; The Houston Oilers moved to
Tennesee where there is no oil. The New Orleans Jazz moved to Utah
where they don't allow music.'' Endless expansion has watered down
the talent pool, forcing teams to recruit players from ``prisons,
mental institutions, and Texas.'' The incessant commercialization
of sports has given rise to such facilities as Preparation H Arena
and Maxi Tampon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This is the film's prologue, and it's very funny because it
smacks of truth. But nothing else even comes close once Cooper
(Parker) and his best friend, Doug Remer (Stone) grow up to be
bums, who stumble upon the game which goes from backyard curiosity
to national obsession. There are vague plotlines about Coop's
desire to keep the game free of commercialism, Remer's easy nod
toward the temptation of clothing contracts and such, and Coop's
budding romance with a shapely young thing, Jenna (Yasmine Bleeth)
who runs the Dream Come True foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In between there's dominatrix cheerleaders, gay jokes, lots of
mangled animals, gay jokes, snaps on Robert Downey Jr. and
Christian Slater, gay jokes, and prosthetic devices which would
have made Mark Wahlberg weep in ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention there are gay jokes?
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone are OK, but they shouldn't quit those day jobs.
Then again, Konstantin Stanislavsky couldn't have done much with a
script which asked him to pretend to sip a bag of fat sucked out of
Marlon Brando's hindparts. There are also appearances by real
sportscasters, Bob Costas, Al Michaels, Dan Patrick, and Kenny
Mayne.
</P>
<P>
   This being a Zucker project, he employs his usual
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink style _ if you don't laugh at one
gag, wait a split second, there's another on the way. It's not a
comedy, it's an endless drive-by with Uzis, except most of the
shots are misfires.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker and company should have taken a few cues from ``There's
Something About Mary,'' the summer's other crude and rude comedy.
There are just as many body fluids a-flowin', but the laughs are
rich and plentiful. ``Baseketball'' plays like a rookie who has a
great April, only to fizzle in the dog days of the pennant race.
Come back, Chris Farley. All is forgiven!

NEW VINE NOVEL HAS ALL THE HALLMARKS

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER'S BOY 
By Barbara Vine 
Harmony Books, 344 pp., $24 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After best-selling novelist Gerald Candless dies at age 71 of a
heart attack, his browbeaten wife Ursula and their two smug
daughters, Hope and Sarah, try to piece together the facts of his
life. He was a difficult man, especially to his wife, whom he
bullied in life and cruelly mocked in his novels. But he smothered
his daughters with love and they adored him.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah, who teaches women's studies at the University of London,
decides to write her father's biography and soon discovers that his
life was a carefully constructed lie, that Gerald Candless wasn't
even Gerald Candless. He'd stolen his name from a dead child.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth non-mystery novel by the acclaimed and
prolific mystery writer Ruth Rendell, writing under the name
Barbara Vine. Fans of any or all of the seven previous books will
recognize in this novel many of the elements that make the Vine
books so engrossing. In ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy,'' the past
haunts the present, neuroses abound, obsession flourishes, shameful
secrets unfold, suspense hovers overs the plot like the mist that
rolls over the Candlesses' isolated home on a cliff high above the
sea. There is a creepy, claustrophobic feel to this novel,
symbolized by an image from Candless's recurring dream, in which
he's trapped alone inside a tube of stone deep inside the earth,
its ends sealed with cement ``covered with fan-shaped prints where
hard hands had pressed it in _ from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy'' explores the uncertain territory
that separates a writer's life from his fiction. The truth about
Gerald Candless lies in his books. He mined his own life for
material and wove his secrets into his plots. Sarah doggedly sets
about analyzing her father's work and interviewing people from his
past.
</P>
<P>
   One important clue to the mystery of Candless's identity turns
out to be a particular moth he chose as the logo for his books, one
with the Latin name Epichnopterix plumella, commonly known as the
chimney sweeper's boy, a small insect unusual in that it abstains
from sexual activity. Sarah is reminded that in Greek mythology the
butterfly or moth symbolized ``the spirit of man liberated from the
impurities of the flesh.'' By the time the moth wings its way into
the plot, and maybe even before, readers will have guessed that
Candless was homosexual, but that's only part of the secret that
compelled him to re-invent himself so elaborately.
</P>
<P>
   As Sarah digs into her father's past, Ursula mulls over her
memories of a long, unhappy marriage to a man who despised her. As
she recalls various incidents she begins to accept the truth about
her late husband, a truth that would have been obvious had she not
been blinded, at first by love, later by an indifference born of
pain. Candless has left his mark on his daughters, too. His
crushing, controlling love gave them strength to succeed in the
world, but crippled them emotionally. Both daughters are heavy
drinkers who have difficult relationships with men. There's plenty
of angst and suffering in this novel before it reaches its
not-exactly-happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's relentless investigating brings her to the brink of the
truth, but the big question remains: ``What she didn't know is why
... he had taken on that new identity.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to reveal the answer, or the circumstances
under which the answer comes to light, and anyway, the revelation
is a bit of a disappointment. The real surprise of the book is that
Candless, who's portrayed as a perfectly awful human being, turns
out to have had a secret streak of kindness and decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy'' is about the process of writing
fiction, among other things. It's interesting to see Rendell
writing as Vine writing about a novelist who assumes another
identity, although just what it revels about Rendell, if anything,
remains a mystery.

 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is a lonely sight in the Prudential Center: stacks
of T-shirts bearing the golden ``Cheers'' emblem, a television
blaring an episode from 1984, shoppers strolling indifferently past
images of the prudish waitress with winged hair.
</P>
<P>
   One man glances at the vending cart, then moves on. A salesman
from St. Louis ponders a coffee cup and two mugs. The vendor says
business is usually better, but five years after the last episode
of the sitcom, even she prays for the fate of Boston's most famous
fictional bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one girl come and buy a T-shirt, and then she said,
`What is Cheers?''' said Tracy Wright, 24. ``Somebody else asked me
if Cheers was a kind of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still, to some outsiders, a symbol of this city. Tourists
still buy Cheers keychains, though vendors say sales are dropping;
commercial ``Cheers bars'' now pepper airports around the globe,
though even the logo seems as antiquated as flowery Coca-Cola
script. In Boston, the Bull &AMP; Finch pub, credited with inspiring
the Hollywood set, sticks name tags on diners _ still making it, as
the theme song goes, the bar where ``everybody knows your name.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is: who will remember it?
</P>
<P>
   Off the air except for reruns since the famous ``Last Call''
episode in 1993, ``Cheers'' appears, understandably, to have lost
its luster among tourists. And Boston seems to be drifting away
from one important part of its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as hot as it was in its heyday, but I think there
still will be a curiosity factor,'' said Peggy Davis-Mullen,
chairwoman of the City Council's committee on tourism. ``That will
change as we all get older. My generation, we're the same age as
some of those folks, so we could identify. But as the viewing
audience gets older and as the hip stuff gets younger, then you'll
see an even greater impact.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the tangible evidence: Attendance at the Bull &AMP; Finch,
the Beacon Hill watering hole that became the model for the Cheers
bar, dropped by 200,000 in the first year after the show went off
the air, according to a survey by the Boston Business Journal. More
than half a dozen local concierges say requests for directions are
now infrequent. Even Stan Novack, vice president of Host Marriott,
which runs the restaurant chain, says merchandise sales have
dropped off over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the anecdotal evidence, the stories from local
tourism experts that suggest the television show no longer
symbolizes Boston to the rest of the nation _ and that Cheers
character Diane Chambers now has a rival as the female icon of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get an Ally McBeal bar,'' Davis-Mullen said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Cheers logo has become its own
nationwide tourist phenomenon, akin to Planet Hollywood or the Hard
Rock Cafe. Just last week, a new Cheers bar opened in Omaha; last
month, another debuted in Kuala Lumpur, Novack said. But the
approximately $30 million revenue the food chain brings in each
year is related more to the convenience of the restaurant than the
television show or its home port, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken on a life of its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Kershaw, owner of the original Bull &AMP; Finch, insists
the same is true in Boston. But unlike an interview in 1994, when
he boasted $4.5 million in merchandise revenue alone, Kershaw last
week refused to divulge the revenues or even number of guests over
the last four years because it is a ``privately held company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is that business is still good,'' he said. ``If
I gave numbers at one point, that's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Concierges at local hotels tell a different story, one that
centers on classic Boston institutions along the Freedom Trail.
While there are some requests for directions to ``the Cheers
place'' _ and even fewer for the two Cheers bars at Logan airport _
the television lure hardly compares to the two longtime favorites:
Faneuil Hall and the USS Constitution, concierges said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a place people ask for,'' said Alain Morel, concierge
at the Ritz-Carlton on Arlington Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they don't know about it. We recommend it
anyway,'' said Betty Salemme, of the Seaport Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And of the tourists interviewed last week, more than a few
admitted to having left Cheers off their lists. Adam Jacobs, 32,
and Carri Martino, 27, of San Francisco, happened by the Beacon
Street bar ``by mistake'' and kept walking because it is
``touristy.'' Erin Keane, 15, of New Jersey, made it to the Freedom
Trail, the Aquarium, Quincy Market, the Titanic show, the USS
Constitution, and the Museum of Fine Arts gift shop. But not the
Bull &AMP; Finch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to,'' she shrugged. ``But we didn't get to it.''

HARRIS SALUTES PARSONS WITH NEW `SPYBOY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny how the best-laid plans for a sabbatical can go up in
smoke. Emmylou Harris had thought of pulling back to write some new
songs, but admits with a knowing laugh, ``This year didn't
translate to actual time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it translated to another Lilith Fair appearance and to
a live album, ``Spyboy,'' which condenses and celebrates a 25-year
career. It's a career that spills across country, rock, bluegrass,
and the ambient soul of her previous album, ``Wrecking Ball,''
recorded with New Orleans producer-mystic Daniel Lanois. The album
won a Grammy last year for best contemporary folk performance, even
though Harris is as much rock and country as she is folk.
</P>
<P>
   The live record ``Spyboy'' (a New Orleans term for the person
who scouts out the route of the parade) is not just a retrospective
of her career, but a gem of execution, which shouldn't be
surprising given her reputation for standout concerts. Recorded at
the end of a European tour (and due for release Aug. 11), it
features guitarist Buddy Miller (who opened a bunch of dates for
Steve Earle this year) and a New Orleans rhythm section of drummer
Brady Blake and bassist Daryl Johnson. They normally tour with
Lanois.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had thought of just recording a previously uncut Lanois
tune, ``The Maker,'' but one thing led to another and the live
album was born. It also serves as a mini-tribute to her '70s mentor
(and former Harvard student) Gram Parsons, since Harris sings his
picaresque ``Wheels'' and aching ``Love Hurts,'' which was written
by Boudleaux Bryant but stamped with definitive, blue-eyed soul by
Parsons. (Other exemplary tracks include ``Tulsa Queen'' and
``Boulder to Birmingham.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gram gave me musically was such a gift,'' says the
Alabama-born Harris, who was discovered singing in a Washington,
D.C., club by Parsons. He then sang and toured with her for just
under two years before dying from a heroin overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume we were personally involved,'' says Harris.
``But we were just involved as friends and collaborators.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Harris is also coordinating a tribute album to
Parsons, whose country twang echoed Hank Williams and also
influenced the Rolling Stones. Such acts as Sheryl Crow, Elvis
Costello, Beck, Chrissie Hynde, and the Cowboy Junkies are all
slated to appear on the tribute, which will be issued next year.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also has been singing on Willie Nelson's next record,
which is produced by Lanois. ``I'm on 11 tracks,'' she says. ``I
had to wing it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also pleased to be on the Lilith Fair tour again. ``If it
ain't broke, don't fix it,'' she says of the fair. ``The only thing
we have in common is double-X chromosomes. Otherwise, the cross
section of music is incredible. This year I'm playing a 50-minute
set. Last year I played 35. So, I got a raise!''

   Corgan unleashed: Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, who
play the Orpheum tonight, made some very valid points when asked
during a Globe interview last week whether he'd seen the new ``Kurt
&AMP; Courtney'' documentary, about the late Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain
and his widow. ``No, I haven't seen it,'' Corgan said, ``but put it
this way: The culture of the dead is disgusting. I think everybody
who is out there printing illegal Kurt Cobain T-shirts and trying
to feed off the carcass is disgusting. I think it's bad karma for
those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of the dead just sickens me _ and the fascination
with death sends such a bad message to kids. Like, one of the most
offensive things I've seen in the past year was Biggy Smalls as
artist of the year in Spin. I think that just sends such a horrible
message to kids. And it's such irresponsible journalism. People
have no idea the kind of impact that plays upon a 15-year-old mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Cobain was a great artist and his music will endure for a
long time and that's the best part about it. But the fascination
and the glorification of his death just sends all the wrong
messages. It says that this is ultimately cooler than actually
living and trying and even failing.''

   Ryan remembered: Sha Na Na bassist/singer David-Allen Ryan died
Sunday at age 50. Nicknamed Chico, he was one of the most
contagiously upbeat bassists in the business. I recall seeing Sha
Na Na at the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset, Mass., where
Ryan was the epitome of nonstop energy. Fans with long memories
with also recall that Sha Na Na played Suffolk Downs in East Boston
in 1973, with Aerosmith opening. Ryan became a friend of Aerosmith
singer Steven Tyler, who was known to sleep on Ryan's couch on
occasion. Before his Sha Na Na tenure, Ryan played with the Rockin'
Ramrods, a Boston group who toured with the Rolling Stones.

   Bits and pieces: Uh oh. Get ready for the soundtrack sequel to
``Titanic.'' ``Back to Titanic,'' due Aug. 25, is supposed to
feature music that wasn't on the first, mega-selling release, but
it again includes Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On.'' Sometimes
the music industry has no shame ... The Beastie Boys' new album
``Hello Nasty'' just sold 681,000 copies its first week _ the
biggest opening week sales of the year ... Nanci Griffith, Lucinda
Williams, Greg Brown, and Utah Phillips are among the artists
singing Kate Wolf songs on a tribute album called ``Treasures Left
Behind: Remembering Kate Wolf,'' due Aug. 18 on Red House Records
... Cleveland's Rock Hall of Fame recently had its 2 millionth
visitor. It opens an Elvis Presley exhibit next month _ and will
have a rap/hip-hop exhibit next year. A rap/hip-hop exhibit at the
Rock Hall of Fame? ``We're trying to keep a contemporary edge and
not just be a reserve for baby boomers,'' says curator James Henke.

SYMPATHETIC SKETCH OF FRENCH `FAMILLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
UN AIR DE FAMILLE 
Directed by: Cedric Klapisch 
Screenplay by: Agnes Jaoui, Jean-Pierre Bacri, Klapisch 
Starring: Jaoui, Bacri, Jean-Pierre Daroussin, Catherine Frot,
Claire Maurier, Wladimir Yordanoff 
Running time: 107 minutes; subtitles 
Rating: Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bittersweet dramas about family dysfunction either get more
bitter or more sweet as they unload their recrimination-filled
baggage. Cedric Klapisch's ``Un Air de Famille'' moves in the
direction of sweetness. Not, however, sentimentally or with any
intention of providing any glib resolutions. Rather, as Klapisch
trains his camera on the unhappy members of a French brood gathered
for an after-hours birthday celebration in the family-owned
restaurant, the film moves to embrace its characters. They're
messed up in the usual ways, but Klapisch never makes the mistake
of letting himself or his film slide into contempt for the banality
of their shortcomings. ``Un Air de Famille'' likes its characters
and you will, too.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the film's origin as a one-set play, although
Klapisch boldly fights claustrophobia by employing Cinemascope,
which means the characters always share the frame with something
else in the down-at-heels cafe _ a window, a jukebox, each other.
The family _ overbearing mom, rebel daughter, favorite son,
scapegoat son, and their respective spouses _ has lived in a state
of uneasy coexistence for years and you just know the fragile truce
is about to be shattered when they gather to celebrate the birthday
of the successful son's sweet but bullied wife.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the place is Le Pere Tranquille, a piece of black
humor since the clan's father is dead. He was regarded as an
amiable loser by his ambitious wife, who left him. But as seen in
flashback romping with the kids in bed after they pour into their
parents' bedroom, you can easily believe that the heart went out of
the family when the modestly regarded tranquil dad did. Although no
world-beater, he obviously made a go of the restaurant and
generated a degree of family happiness that has been harder and
harder to come by since the kids have grown older. Klapisch plays
the warm-hearted dad in flashback, and he becomes a character, too,
whose absence is felt.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Maurier's matriarch, callous and cruel, bludgeons
everybody into line and has guaranteed bad blood between her sons
by favoring one and downgrading the other. Wladimir Yordanoff's
Philippe is the businessman who works for a computer company, but
only, as his wife keeps reminding him, as the number four man in
the pecking order. He has just appeared on local television and
makes the mistake of fishing for compliments. It's a misstep for
which he pays quickly as his sister observes that he stuttered once
and his mother finds fault with his choice in neckties.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's lifelong favoritism has turned him into an
egocentric monster, whose sweet wife is only able to enjoy herself
on the rare occasions when she has a drink. Tonight is one such
occasion, and Catherine Frot expertly lets us imagine her life of
benign incarceration by the way she comes to life for a few minutes
when the waiter dances with her when her husband will not. He at
least still has his wife, which is more than Jean-Pierre Bacri's
glum proprietor can say. None of them are exactly bursting with
people skills, including Agnes Jaoui's sister. She tries to make
her lack of prospects at the age of 30 seem a triumphant rejection
of bourgeois shallowness, but she comes off as more lonely and
worried than she cares to show.
</P>
<P>
   The leads _ including Jean-Pierre Darroussin's clear-eyed
waiter, the whistle-blower on excess _ played their roles on stage
many times. Jaoui and Bacri wrote the play and have worked out with
Klapisch exactly how to reveal the corrosive family dynamic without
getting too explicit. The important things here are revealed in
facial expressions or small behavioral gestures, never in clumsily
expository dialogue. Klapisch's decision not to open up the drama
in the ways films usually open up plays was the right one. In the
end, the members of this neurotic family seem boxed in not by the
film's stage origins, but by their own but ironclad patterns. ``Un
Air de Famille'' is affecting because it seems wise and rueful, yet
compassionate and hopeful.

FAR RIGHT USING GAYS FOR TARGET PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Until this week Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., was
known nationally as a big supporter of swabbing pepper spray in the
eyes of chained young women.
</P>
<P>
   I call that very, very kinky for a guy who claims to be a
defender of morals and an enemy of coercion. The women were chained
to a stump in his office as part of a protest against his
pro-logging policies. Riggs said it was ``probably an appropriate
use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Riggs has become known as the guy who wants to stick it in
the eye of San Francisco. He tacked an amendment on a Housing and
Urban Development spending bill that would prevent San Francisco
from using federal housing money in requiring contractors to
provide benefits for domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   I call that very, very perverted for a Republican who claims to
believe in local autonomy and decreasing the power of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there is one principle that overrides the Republican
belief in small government: Bash gays in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats crafted a bill aimed specifically at punishing a
Republican district, they'd never hear the end of outrage from an
alleged small-government Gingrichite like Riggs. Riggs represents a
swath of Northern California that includes Mendocino, Sonoma and
Napa counties. If Democrats in the House wanted to make a surgical
strike on his district alone, they could ban federal funding
supporting the cloning of grapevines.
</P>
<P>
   It might pass. The sheeplike public hates cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we'd lose the wines that help us get through the
political news. Cloned vines resist the phylloxera that has ravaged
vineyards. We'd be cutting off our nose and bouquet to spite our
face.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Riggs is leaving California when his term runs out in
November. This anti-gay amendment is his way of saying goodbye,
like a finger waved from a U-Haul.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs will live in Virginia, where he already has a house. Rumor
has it that he wants to be a lobbyist, but after attacking
America's favorite city (according to three surveys this year)
he'll have to be a lobbyist for the pepper spray industry.
</P>
<P>
   When the House aims legislation at a specific city, it's usually
to give it some goodies, like nuclear submarine contracts to New
London, Conn. When it's intended to take something away from a
city, it's usually aimed at Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But then Congress has a traditional role as ruler of Washington.
Now Congress is going to tell San Francisco what to do? We don't
listen to Washington politicians. They listen to us if they want to
raise money here.
</P>
<P>
   The state of California can't even tell San Francisco what to do
when it comes to marijuana, bilingual education and affirmative
action. Gov. Pete Wilson and Attorney General Dan Lungren, both
Republicans, aren't even allowed across the bridges without white
flags.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno thinks the Riggs provision
can be removed before the HUD bill passes the Senate, but he still
finds it unsettling, and not just because San Francisco could lose
up to $200 million in housing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is part of a coordinated effort,'' he said. ``We're
at war. The target once again is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno means gays, and everyone from Trent Lott to Reggie White to
Frank Riggs has been taking shots. It's a pretty transparent effort
to mobilize hard-core right-wing voters for the November election,
so the Republicans can keep their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   It's not democracy in action. It's demonization in action.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago Bill Clinton's advisers kept saying, ``It's the
economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the economy is pretty good, and someone seems to be telling
Republicans, ``It's the gays, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Scapegoats have been useful in politics in the past, but at the
cost of hurting a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a good time to have a Democratic president with a
partners problem of his own. Riggs said Americans ``want leaders
who respect and support, rather than dishonor, the sanctity of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely he wasn't just attacking gay marriages, but had one
particular heterosexual marriage in mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Leno says, ``It's all a big chess game. They make one move on
this side of the board, and then a move on the other side of the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Starr side of the board is reaching endgame, but the
Republicans aren't doing quite as well on the side of the board
where gays are being used as pawns.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Riggs is a total amateur when it comes to crafting
legislation aimed at a specific city. The master is right here in
San Francisco's City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When Mayor Willie Brown was speaker of the California Assembly
he was always figuring out ways to tailor bills so benefits only
went to cities that were also counties _ meaning one city, San
Francisco. Those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can invent a special tax for Republican congressmen
coming here on vacation. He could call it a user's fee.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Riggs and his ilk are doing right now. They're using
us.

`EVER AFTER': A TOUGHER, BRAVER CINDERELLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
EVER AFTER 
Directed by: Andy Tennant 
Screenplay by: Susannah Grant, Tennant, Rick Parks 
Starring: Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Dougray Scott, Patrick
Godfrey, Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey, Timothy West, Judy Parfitt,
Jeroen Krabbe, Lee Ingleby, Jeanne Moreau 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (momentary strong language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let the fairytale look of ``Ever After'' fool you. Beneath
its 16th century costumes and medieval walled chateau shimmering in
the Dordogne, there's a decidedly modern sensibility to this
richly-textured but tough-minded retelling of the Cinderella story.
Soft, pure and beautiful as Drew Barrymore looks beneath her pale
soot-covered skin, she's no passive victim. Part of the fun of
watching the tongue-in-cheek modernity comes from watching her
rescue the prince who comes to rescue her, then handily take on the
job of extricating herself from danger a second time as he arrives
breathless on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of the myth are there, and so is the romance,
but they've been rejiggered and rearranged around the feminist
spirit of Barrymore's Danielle, as the girl behind the legend is
called. Although she has been relegated to servant status after he
father dies and her upwardly mobile stepmother takes over, she's no
docile drudge. She was educated by her lordly and loving father
(Jeroen Krabbe), who literally dies with his boots on shortly after
introducing Danielle to her new stepmother and stepsisters, but not
before teaching her swordsmanship and giving her the run of his
library. At a key juncture, she quotes nimbly _ and appropriately _
from Thomas More's ``Utopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougray Scott's prince, meanwhile, is a bit of a rebel himself,
and is attracted to the spunky Danielle _ who beans him with an
apple when she catches him stealing a horse from her family's
stable as he flees an arranged marriage. Not that things go that
swimmingly for them. If the French countrified Cinderella can do
with a status makeover, the prince, hobbled by a few snobbish bad
habits, needs a soul makeover. Nor does Barrymore's do-it-yourself
Cinderella rely on magic dispensed by a fairy godmother. This a
real-world Cinderella _ or at least as realistic as a glossy
Hollywood feminist costume romance can get.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while not operating from much of a power base, Danielle
is not without allies. She gets aid and sympathy from an amusing
addition to the legend, Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), who
knows quality when he sees it, previews the Mona Lisa for the
prince, comes close to literally walking on water, then springs
Danielle from a dungeon. The final piece of the picture, brightly
put in place under Andy Tennant's direction, involves Anjelica
Huston's gratifyingly faceted stepmother, rescued from campy
cliche. The stepsisters _ Megan Dodd's icy-hearted, beautiful,
spoiled favorite and Melanie Lynskey's chunkier, kinder,
second-class-citizen sibling are another plus. ``Ever After'' is
fresh and surprising and sympathetic, even in places you don't
expect it to be. In a formula-laden summer, its gorgeousness and,
even more important, its rethinkings, are a delight.

MYSTERY AND MADNESS FILL `THE WELL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WELL 
Directed by: Samantha Lang 
Screenplay by: Laura Jones (novel: Elizabeth Jolley) 
Starring: Miranda Otto, Pamela Rabe, Paul Chubb, Frank Wilson,
Steve Jacobs, Genevieve Lemon 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychosexual and geographical eeriness intersect seductively and
intriguingly in ``The Well,'' a highly charged debut film from
Australia's Samantha Lang. It's a steadily involving pas de deux
between a gaunt spinster played by Pamela Rabe and a nymphet played
by Miranda Otto. Each woman is needy, each is intense. The playing
out of their gravitational attraction against the dislocating
effects of a remote Australian outback setting is expressed in a
remarkable combination of the spare, the rugged, and the
otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.333l &LR;  Pale and contained, Otto's Katherine doesn't look
like much as she slinks into the isolated farm to which she has
been sent from the latest of a long string of correctional
institutions. But she's not as passive and retrograde as she seems.
She's just being cautious. It doesn't take her long to notice that
she has freed something long repressed in Rabe's lonely middle-aged
woman living with her difficult aged father. After hiring
Katherine, Rabe's Hester takes a shine to her and decides she wants
her around permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Bribing Katherine with gifts, and not seeming to notice or care
that the housework goes increasingly undone, Hester sells the farm
for cash after her father dies, moves them into a small house on
the edge of the property, and plans trips to Europe and New York.
She's again oblivious to the shifts in Katherine's moods and
expressions as the younger woman shuttles between naivete and
cunning and the onset of power plays designed to see just how much
she can get from Hester.
</P>
<P>
   After Katherine insists on some breathing room and the chance to
pursue some social life away from Hester, an accident involving a
stranger changes things. Katherine and Hester move from sharing a
concealed relationship to harboring a secret that could plunge them
both into serious trouble. What had been the onset of erotic
stirrings becomes colored by new complications and pressures. The
mood turns from playful and enticingly suggestive to something
darker as their haven suddenly seems less safe and stable than it
did.
</P>
<P>
   Having been drawn together, the women draw apart, retreat into
separate realities. Simple seduction is replaced by manipulation
and desperation. The atmosphere becomes threatening. Shimmer is
replaced by harshness, the line between mystery and madness blurs
as the film takes the metaphorical plunge suggested by its title.
The film's taut contours and subliminal rumblings will invoke
comparisons to early Jane Campion, but Lang is a gifted and
immensely promising filmmaker who can stand on her own as she
tightens the screws and draws us into the febrile duet between two
riveting actresses.

QUID PRO QUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Massachusetts' legislative session rushes to its close,
housing activist Thomas Callahan checks daily on the status of the
insurance tax cut bill. On every visit, he bumps into industry
lobbyists doing the same thing: ``It was scary. It was really
scary,'' he says of the lobbyists' constant presence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be even scarier for the lobbyists to keep running into
Callahan. Because of the tenacity of activists like him, state
legislators appear on the verge of approving a law requiring
insurance companies to make a significant contribution to a
community reinvestment fund in exchange for significant tax relief.
The law is believed to be precedent-setting nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday around noon, conference committee members shook hands
on this deal: To get some $50 million in tax relief, life insurance
firms, as well as property and casualty firms, must invest a total
of $200 million _ or $100 million from each industry sector _ in
direct loans for affordable housing in low- and moderate-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Senate Ways and Means Chairman Stanley C. Rosenberg,
(D-Amherst), who participated in conference committee
deliberations, said he is optimistic the agreement would become
law.
</P>
<P>
   However, state Representative Peter Larkin (D-Pittsfield), who
cochairs the joint legislative Taxation Committee and also took
part in the conference committee, was more cautious, saying ``there
are still bumps in the road.'' The conference committee reconvened
to smooth them out.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the House worked to lower the dollar amount of
the industry commitment. The activists got as far as they did
because the Senate was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Rosenberg, that includes Senate President Thomas
Birmingham; state Senator Warren Tolman (D-Watertown), who cochairs
the joint legislative Taxation Committee; and state Senator Dianne
Wilkerson (D-Boston), who chaired the Insurance Committee until she
was removed from her leadership position after pleading guilty last
year to failure to file tax returns. (Despite personal problems,
Wilkerson hung in to support the community investment piece of the
bill.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is, the insurance companies are making a significant
investment in communities across Massachusetts. In return, we'll be
levelling the playing field for in-state and out-of-state
insurers,'' says Tolman.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, Massachusetts-based insurance companies
have been angling for a tax cut. Finally, their turn at bat came
up.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the industry wanted to pony up community investment
money in return for a tax cut. But after shrewdly calculating the
politics, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. chairman Stephen
L. Brown decided to play ball with activists like Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   That created a rift with the property and casualty firms, which
wanted to bully past the community folks. But ultimately, Brown's
willingness to apply finesse, not muscle, seems to have paved the
way for the long-awaited industry tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Hancock is not acting on pure altruism. On the
national front, there have been rumblings about bringing other
financial services, besides banks, into the community reinvestment
realm.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry wants no part of a law that might link
any company acquisitions to community reinvestment requirements.
So, working out a deal with local community activists became the
preferred scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The community investment commitment makes business sense, as
well as social policy sense. The insurance companies know how to
make pooled investments. This way, they are all in it together.
When the fine print of the bill's final version is analyzed, some
companies could be bigger winners than others.
</P>
<P>
   But as Callahan sees it: ``If this bill passes with at least a
couple hundred million dollars in new investment, this will be the
beginning of a new relationship between community organizations in
this state and the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it would signal the start of a relationship,
(itals)period(unitals). And that is win-win for everyone.

 AT CZAR NICHOLAS' BURIAL: THE COFFIN TABLE COLLAPSES, AN AIRPORT
`WELCOME' SIGN COMES DOWN and `THE BOSS' SHOWS UP

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The state earmarked 5 million rubles
for the farewell ceremony. In Russia nowadays, that's neither big
nor small money. But it wasn't placed in the account of the city
administration until word came that President Boris Yeltsin was
going to St. Petersburg after all.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the remains were to arrive, those making
arrangements for the ceremony saw to their consternation a
``Welcome'' sign on top of the Pulkovo airport building. They
hastily daubed the sign over with white paint, pinned black ribbons
on the Russian flags displayed along the route of the motorcade and
had traffic policemen don smart uniforms, gray at the bottom and
white at the top. That ended the dressing-up phase of preparations
for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The special flight from Yekaterinburg carrying the Czar and his
family and servants arrived 90 minutes late on July 16. In the
meantime, the ceremony's organizers and journalists learned that
Yeltsin had decided to attend the burial. Too weary of waiting, or
maybe overcome by the stunning news, the table draped in black and
prepared for the coffins collapsed. While attendants were putting
the table back on its feet, the plane landed and the festivities
proceeded as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's heraldry chief Georgi Vilinbakhov reported to the St.
Petersburg mayor that the coffins with the remains had been
delivered to St. Petersburg soil. Nine oak coffins were loaded onto
black hearses and the procession moved solemnly past the Bronze
Horseman and Winter Palace and on toward the SS Peter and Paul
Fortress.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were finally set on a black podium in the main hall
of the cathedral inside the fortress. The journalists who had
already managed to take pictures of the emotional faces of members
of the Romanov House _ more than 60 of them, who now live around
the world, now on hand in St. Petersburg _ were briefly admitted.
Honor guards were posted around the coffins where they stayed in
the cathedral through the night, changing every hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, people of St. Petersburg turned out by the
thousands to station themselves on all sides of Zayachy Island, on
which the fortress stands. There was not much argument on whether
the remains were genuine, they were mainly discussing the
president's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he is not coming at all?'' someone ventured a guess,
and the crowd before the bridge to the fortress sealed off by the
security service buzzed. ``What do you mean, he is not coming? Did
he come yet? He's on his way?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the impact of the crowd, a security officer, who must have
momentarily forgotten that he was a military man and should stay
cool, absolutely assured the agitated people: ``The boss will
appear at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was right. Yeltsin appeared on the scene three minutes
before noon, July 17. He entered the cathedral through a side door
bypassing the TV cameras. As the clock struck 12, a cannon fired,
the bells started ringing again and the frightened birds shot from
the cathedral's chapel and began to wheel above the square in a
black swarm.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included Boris Nemtsov, Natalia Dementeva, Mstislav
Rastropovich, Galina Vishnevskaya, Eduard Radzinsky, Nikita
Mikhalkov, Andrei Petrov, Dmitriy Likhachev, Galina Starovoitova,
Grigori Yavlinsky, Alexei Mitrofanov and Lyudmila Narusova. At the
last moment Alexander Lebed joined them, sailing over the police
barrier behind which journalists were languishing.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin never turned his head. He was already standing on the
pedestal preparing to deliver his address. ``It is our duty to
complete the century, which has proved for Russia a century of
blood and lawlessness, by repentance and reconciliation regardless
of (our) political views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity though that the president was reading the words of
repentance from a prepared text. More than that, pressing his hand
to his heart and bowing low to the coffins with royal remains,
Yeltsin never uttered the names of the Romanovs murdered by the
Bolsheviks, diplomatically substituting for them with the
patriarch's formula _ ``those slain without guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the service for the dead conducted by the dean of the SS
Peter and Paul Cathedral, Archpriest Boris Glebov, the names of the
dead were not mentioned either, making a reference to God _ ``Their
names are known to our Lord Himself.'' Thus the question ``Are they
the right bones?'' that hovered around the Yekaterinburg graveside
find throughout recent years remained unanswered even at the time
of the interment.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who mentioned the emperor, his consort, their
daughters and the servants who remained loyal to the end was St.
Petersburg's Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev. He kept his promise to do his
utmost to prevent the burial ceremony turning into a political
show, reacting with restraint to the daily wavering moods of the
well-known Russian politicians and colleagues in the Federation
Council _ ``let everyone make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were put in three tiers in the crypt of the St.
Catherine side chapel _ the servants' remains, at the bottom; those
of the daughters, in the second tier; and those of the emperor and
empress, at the top. The black and yellow royal standards that
covered the coffins during the two days of the burial ceremony were
removed and handed as a gift to the city history museum. A Russian
officer sword _ an exact replica of the 1909 weapon made by St.
Petersburg armorers _ was put into the crypt next to the coffin of
Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   The moment the emperor's coffin was being buried there was a
19-gun salute. Everyone present in the Cathedral threw a handful of
river sand from containers set nearby on tripods. The crypt was
covered with concrete slabs, a temporary timber pedestal was
erected with a canopy supported by four pillars which will be
replaced a year from now with marble ones. A long string of
mourners filed past the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing for the last time before the tomb, Yeltsin went to the
head of the House of Romanov, Nikolai Romanovich Romanov. True, the
prince was so excited at that moment that he could not later answer
what precisely the president said to him without any official
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember. I was holding his hand in my hands and I did
not even believe that this was really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsins walked past the tomb, followed by members of
official delegations. And there came an embarrassment the
organizers could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an era in which etiquette was taught only at the
Foreign Relations Institute and all Christian customs were
discouraged, nearly all of Russia's VIPs were making the sign of
the cross, not always sure about the sequence, and stealing glances
at what their counterparts were doing. They were handing each other
funeral tapers over the heads of the people standing next to them
and lighting them as they would cigarettes from one another's
light.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the burial ceremony, Culture Minister
Natalia Dementeva wore a trouser-suit to the church, and on the day
of the burial forgot to wear a black suit, or at least wear a black
veil over her head. Thus, the culture minister's fair hair looked
especially conspicuous against the backdrop of the black hats of
the Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, head of the state burial commission, was rather
pleased: ``It went off excellently, I feared it would be worse. So,
one more commission bit the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The relations and officials boarded the violet-colored buses and
left for the Ethnographic Museum for the funeral repast.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine, Peter the Great vodka, with snacks whose names sounded
inappropriately amusing for the occasion, could not make the repast
mournful. Quite the opposite, as the head of the Romanovs admitted,
some joyful animation prevailed. The toasts to the dead were
followed by those to the successful completion of the event, the
dignified and conscientious organization of the burial, to the wise
decision of the president and political restraint of the St.
Petersburg governor.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, July 18, the SS Peter and Paul Cathedral was open
to the public. Despite the pouring rain, the line extended almost
around the entire Zayachy Island. Foreign tourists waited in their
buses for the rain to end and eagerly bought the freshly painted
nests of dolls made in the likeness of Boris Yeltsin and Nicholas
II.
</P>
<P>
   The important state event, solemn but without pomp and
circumstance, was a great success.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.
 &HT;    Advocates of direct democracy, such as Robert Wiebe, the
political historian and theorist, oppose ``government by experts,''
and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington ``know-it-alls'' who
could not pass his ``Elroy test'' (what his little hometown knows
is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on
experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning.
 &HT;    One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare ``the
new paternalism,'' frankly telling people what is good for them.
Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude,
despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
 &HT;    I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some
constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has
some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. (``Don't be a wimp.'')
With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that both his parents were teachers and his
wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as
``street talk'' in rural Wisconsin _ ``setting'' for sitting,
``oncommon'' for uncommon, ``secatary'' for secretary.
 &HT;    He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: ``I'm the
only one still talking devolution.'' The Republican Congress is
``as bad as the president.'' He feels that he has the spirit of
Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive _ except that
La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of
big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's
projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his
encirclement by foes.
 &HT;    To get a ``top down'' view of the states' new activism, I
interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a
Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the
policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when
aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the
states'-rights activism a healthy development.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Clinton does not see the states shoving the
federal government off the scene so much as interacting with it in
new ways. But Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state
initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed
mandates.
 &HT;    ``I don't agree with a lot of those votes,'' he said, ``but I
think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as
they don't contravene a federal statute or the Constitution.
Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are
designed to address. Either representative government is going to
have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is
on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the
progressive populists are going to have to put their own
counterproposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this
movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say
on public issues.''
 &HT;    We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the governor and
the president, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail
on the future of states' rights. The president is well disposed
toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy.
Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude
on his master strategy.
 &HT;    Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in
turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think
he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The
president himself considered the Republican bill he signed too
sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring
food stamps and child-care provisions.
 &HT;    I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in
their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when
economic reverses come.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for
children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of
reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
 &HT;    ``Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule
for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in
Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states
had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms,
considerably lower, than they had been in the early '70s, because
they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I
came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states
anyway. Now the states are responsible.
 &HT;    ``In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the
welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a
work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility
around. They could say that 'in our state the federal government
has all these rules _ and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the
county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with
the states will be more positive than negative.''
 &HT;    It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the
president. ``President Clinton has done everything he possibly can
to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin.''
 &HT;    He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human
Services. ``I could get matching grants'' for new programs,
Thompson complains _ but the government will not turn over the
money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help
from the federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states
have to observe federal conditions if they accept federal money.
 &HT;    So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the
governor has kept on top of things. When I suggest that federal
oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other
states, he is dismissive.
 &HT;    ``They're always saying that, that the states were going to be
having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may
have happened in the '40s and '50s. But right now you've got
governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that
they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a
governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very
competitive.'''
 &HT;    But the states are vulnerable to national forces too. Clinton
ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic
and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel
softening of the division between state and national life, not just
in government but in every sphere.
 &HT;    This does not mean that states are not better at handling some
things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national
scale.
 &HT;    There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction,
dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment
fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the
Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for ``good old
days'' that were not all that good.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the
toilet reading a newspaper. ``They're kind of like any guy next
door _ just with a whole lot of talent,'' she says. ``We try to
battle each other to see who can talk the most disgusting. They're
so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.
``They have all that cachet because they're the authors of `South
Park.' People are already set to cheer for them. But they're
behind-the-scenes guys.''
 &HT;    Shortly before the release of `Baseketball,' I ask Stone if he's
looking forward to becoming a movie star. ``I'm totally
unprepared,'' he says. ``I hate the fact that I can't walk down the
street already without people looking at me. I went to this cheesy
bar last night and no 21-year-old Hollywood person was coming up
and going: `Heeey! Matt Stone!' I had the best time just sinking
into obscurity again, which is especially hard to do in LA.'' He
heaves a big sigh. ``We're going to Las Vegas this weekend, and I
know it's just going to be awful, walking around with everyone
yelling: `Hey! South Park! Can we get a picture?'''
 &HT;    No one could ever have guessed that ``South Park'' _ a crude,
funny, disturbing, adorable, obnoxious little cartoon on a cable
channel that millions of Americans still can't get _ would become
so huge so fast. What made the success of ``South Park'' different
from that of other adult animated series like ``The Simpsons'' and
``Beavis and Butthead'' is that it happened all at once.
 &HT;    The show made its debut last August and by December it was the
highest-rated show ever, by far, on Comedy Central _ as well as the
inspiration for the top-selling T-shirt in America. Parker and
Stone employ scatological humor fairly regularly; last year's
Christmas special, for example, featured a piece of talking,
singing feces named Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.
 &HT;    The most striking thing about ``South Park,'' which centers on a
group of boys in third grade, however, is its ability to pluck the
strings of fear and hatred in a surprisingly serious way. The show
plays with phobias in lines such as, ``Your mom's a Jew,'' ``Could
we get rid of all the Mexicans?'' and ``Asian culture has plagued
our fragile earth for many years. We must end it.''
 &HT;    These lines _ usually spoken by Parker and Stone and coming out
of the mouths of cartoon children _ are truly subversive. And yet,
nestled amid all the carnage (the same character dies a bloody
death in every episode) and hate speech, there is always a moral _
often of the touchy-feely, can't-we-all-just-get-along variety.
 &HT;    One of their best shows _ and Parker and Stone's favorite _ is
titled ''Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,'' and features the
exaggerated, lisping character known as Big Gay Al. Stan, one of
the third-grade characters on the show, finds out that his dog is
gay and suffers endless mortification at the hands of his friends,
who shout, ``Stan's dog's a homo!''
 &HT;    Eventually, Stan learns about tolerance from Big Gay Al, and in
the end, all is well in South Park. What often keeps the show from
being offensive is this kind of sweetness _ and that it's funny.
 &HT;    In a recent, dicier episode, the four main characters travel to
China for a dodge-ball tournament. The Chinese announcers are drawn
in what can only be described as cartoon yellowface, while their
voices mock Asians speaking bad English. The twist is that the
Chinese announcers are making fun of American accents and ``big
eyes.'' It's a tricky game Parker and Stone are playing, and it
doesn't always work. ``That was a deep one,'' Stone says.
 &HT;    ``It's totally offensive. But we did it in a way to make a
point: turning it around. So it's us doing Chinese accents, making
fun of the Chinese, who are doing accents making fun of Americans.
It's just to say, `Who cares?'''
 &HT;    Good question, though a more precise inquiry might be: Does
everyone get it? Are some of the ``South Park'' fans simply
laughing at Jew jokes or goofy Chinese accents or gay stereotypes,
without the layers of irony that exist at the point of creation?
Probably. As with all comedy that dares to articulate the things
that people don't for fear of sounding mean or hateful, there's
always a chance that it might be dangerously misinterpreted _ or
misused.
 &HT;    Or, as they say, What about the children? Stone, who is Jewish,
says that people do get it, especially children _ who technically
aren't supposed to be watching. (The show comes on at 10 p.m.) He
cites, for example, a child who wrote to him that when he and his
classmates reenacted the Rosa Parks story in school, they imagined
the bus driver to be Cartman, the character on the show who says
the most horrible things.
 &HT;    Point: Kids know that Cartman is not be emulated, even though
repeating Cartman's offensive lines for laughs in school the next
day has become an adolescent pastime.
 &HT;    In some ways, it's like the Howard Stern debate of a few years
back: If Howard Stern is a good guy _ not the racist, sexist
homophobe his radio character so often is _ isn't it OK for him to
pretend that he's a terrible person? Just for laughs? The
difference, Parker and Stone would argue, is that their jokes have
context, where Stern's don't.
 &HT;    ``It comes back to telling a story,'' Stone says. ``The
combination of sweetness and real emotion and this totally bizarre
post-politically correct kind of brutality. Without one, you can't
have the other. That's how you suck people in _ with character and
story and emotion. We take a totally weird idea and try to mold it
into an afterschool-special kind of story.''
 &HT;    He mentions a scene that takes place at a football game. ``We
had the announcer say, 'Oh, I haven't seen a Jew run like that
since 1938.' Just a horrible thing to say. But there's a history of
sports announcers getting busted for things like that. The other
announcer says: `Dude! You can't say that! That's not cool!' If you
did that in the wrong way it would be very offensive. But I think
it's obvious when you watch `South Park' that we're saying we know
this is a stereotype and we're messing with that. When you don't
wink at the audience you really are guilty of perpetrating
something.''
 &HT;    One reason it is hard to be offended by the Parker-Stone
sensibility is that they are so earnest.
 &HT;    ``As bizarre as it is,'' says Parker of the show, ``there's this
overlying sweetness to it all. Like: `Hey, you know what? The
world's all right.' And I think that's because Matt and I are
really very happy and optimistic. It wouldn't work if we were
really dark, coffee-drinking, leather-jacket-wearing guys. It would
just be us making all these crass remarks about the world and it
would get old.''
 &HT;    Because ``Baseketball'' is the first Parker-Stone enterprise to
hit the street since ``South Park,'' there is intense excitement
among the show's legion of fans.
 &HT;    ``I haven't laughed that hard (intentionally) during a movie
since I saw `Airplane!' for the first time,'' wrote one young
critic on the Internet who saw an early test screening in
California. ``The movie was not (expletive) P.C.!!!!!! . . . This
movie is incredibly offensive. Many will hate it and will want it
banned.''
 &HT;    Part of what appeals about Parker and Stone is their spirit of
youthful rebellion, their desire, as Stone puts it, ``to flip off
the Man.''
 &HT;    Doug Herzog, the president and CEO of Comedy Central and the
person responsible for putting the show on the air, has given this
a lot of thought.
 &HT;    ``One of my late-night theories,'' he says, ``is that Matt and
Trey grew up on MTV, David Letterman - they're cool. But they've
been programmed to be cool. What they've never really had, because
their coolness is sort of marketed to them, is something to rebel
against. They don't get it in their rock music. I think you could
probably make the argument that `South Park' is rebellious. It's
something that your parents might not understand.''
 &HT;    Parker and Stone are members of a group of enlightened young
white guys who grew up being sensitive as a matter of course. Part
of what it means to be a New Young White Guy is to be assiduously
not racist, sexist or homophobic _ which is why Parker and Stone
give themselves permission to make insensitive jokes: They know
they're kidding. What they're rebelling against is being told to be
sensitive.
 &HT;    But where Herzog sees healthy rebellion, many critics see
immaturity. And while there is an undeniable intelligence at work,
the most disturbing thing about ``South Park'' isn't so much the
show itself as the horse it rode in on, what you might call Creep
Culture.
 &HT;    ``The Howard Stern Show,'' ''Beavis and Butthead,'' ``Dumb and
Dumber'' and ``South Park'' are all populated by jerks who say mean
things and treat people badly. You get the sense that the creative
minds behind these ventures were all picked on as children and _
deep down _ learned to identify with their tormentors. Only now, as
adults, hidden behind the characters they invent, can they get back
at the bully.
 &HT;    What pushes ``South Park'' above the fray is that the characters
Parker and Stone have invented are third-grade boys _ a group for
whom such obnoxious behavior is to be expected, perhaps even
forgiven.

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the
toilet reading a newspaper. ``They're kind of like any guy next
door _ just with a whole lot of talent,'' she says. ``We try to
battle each other to see who can talk the most disgusting. They're
so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.
``They have all that cachet because they're the authors of `South
Park.' People are already set to cheer for them. But they're
behind-the-scenes guys.''
 &HT;    Shortly before the release of `Baseketball,' I ask Stone if he's
looking forward to becoming a movie star. ``I'm totally
unprepared,'' he says. ``I hate the fact that I can't walk down the

heaves a big sigh. ``We're going to Las Vegas this weekend, and I

 By MICHAEL SPECTER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As one of the few remaining people with frequent access to the
increasingly volcanic president of Russia, Valentin Yumashev knows
when to step lightly.
 &HT;    So it was with careful planning _ and a slightly queasy stomach
_ that the Kremlin chief of staff decided to present an important
document to Boris Yeltsin one day this spring.
 &HT;    It happened to be a thick budget plan, chock-full of graphs,
income statistics and other data that would have sent Bill Clinton,
Al Gore and the rest of the C-Span crowd into spasms of geeky
delight. But Yeltsin is not that kind of guy. He sees himself as a
man of history. Budgetsbore him. So do spreadsheets, meetings and
three-point plans.
 &HT;    Yumashev knew all that, and so he wasn't terribly surprised the
next day when he saw the packet sitting, unread, in Yeltsin's
outbox. He was, however, taken aback when he found out why.
 &HT;    ``Silver paper clips,'' Yumashev later muttered to a friend in
Moscow's financial community. ``The president won't read any
document unless it is held together with a gold paper clip. I used
silver.''
 &HT;    As Russia's economy once again veers desperately toward the
precipice, you have to wonder what on earth happened to this man.
How did the father of Russian democracy become an autocrat who
refuses even to glance at essential documents unless they are
fastened together with the right color metal? The parallels to
capricious czars and senile Soviets are too obvious to ignore.
Yeltsin has dismissed more than 30 senior officials in the past
five years. Often he fires them, denounces them, hires them back
into better jobs and then fires them again (with even greater
gusto).
 &HT;    The 67-year-old president has been largely absent _ addled
repeatedly by mysterious respiratory infections _ while a small
group of predatory capitalists have done their best to plunder his
nation. Yet in March, just days before his country's economy
entered its most recent crisis, Yeltsin found time to assure an
Internet chat group that he was ``taking care'' of his thick white
hair.
 &HT;    Yeltsin has always thrived on his ability to confound his
enemies and keep his allies off balance. But lately his behavior
comes across simply as bizarre. As a result, the man who destroyed
communism in Russia, helped vanquish the Soviet Union and pushed
the century's great totalitarian monolith toward the free market
has become a joke, abroad and at home. Recently on the Russian TV
satire ``Kukly'' _ which is a cross between ``60 Minutes'' and
``Saturday Night Live'' _ he was depicted as a senile and
incontinent hospital patient, begging the nurses to give him a
second chance to remain on the ward.
 &HT;    Still, he remains a hard man to ignore. Yeltsin rules through
contradiction, confusion, subversion. As a leader, he has two great
desires, and you can watch them at war with each other nearly every
day.
 &HT;    First, he wants to bring Russia into the league of Western
nations, to be taken seriously, to be embraced by the organizations
_ NATO, the European Union, the G7 (which he alone refers to as the
Big 8) _ that were largely invented to keep his country out. So his
speeches are laden with cliches about his love of democracy and his
lack of patience for fools who don't love it too.
 &HT;    Yeltsin's second desire often cancels out the first. Clinging to
the notion of Russia as a great power, he wants somehow to rescue
his nation from its well-deserved place in the Third World and to
restore its imperial greatness. But that requires him to pander to
a different crowd completely: the many powerful nationalists at
home.
 &HT;    Like the Soviet leaders he so defiantly replaced, Yeltsin
believes in carrying a very big stick. Most world leaders are
besieged by contradictions. But as Russia flirts yet again with
social chaos and economic disaster, it is reasonable to ask some
pointed questions about the country's first freely elected
president. Is the man who led Russia away from communism now
dragging it toward the abyss? Has Yeltsin become so reckless that
he is destined to bankrupt the country he saved? Perhaps most
important of all, does he now represent any cause but his own?
 -0- 
 &HT;    I arrived in the Moscow bureau of The New York Times in 1994,
not long after Yeltsin resolved an impasse with the petulant and
reactionary Russian Parliament by pounding it for days with
machine-gun and mortar fire _ and then locking up the leaders of
the revolt and trying to close the opposition press. He then forced
through a Constitution that allocated real power almost solely to
himself.
 &HT;    I also lived in Russia while the president waged a useless war
in Chechnya that killed tens of thousands of his own citizens,
savaged a beautiful region, humiliated his once-great army and
resolved nothing. Having witnessed all that _ and then watched in
1996 as he won re-election through lies, payoffs and the sheer luck
of running against a doctrinaire Communist who was tone deaf to the
changing mood of the Russian people _ I may not be the most
objective judge of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    To me he will always be a selfish, arrogant bully who believes
the only good advice is advice he gives. I once watched him lecture
the bosses at a metal plant in southern Russia _ in front of about
1,000 of their employees. Times were tough, so he told them to
raise wages and provide better pensions. And to do it today. His
economic advisers cowered hopelessly in the background.
 &HT;    It hardly mattered that this cheap promise _ and many others
like it _ would help drive Russia into its current financial black
hole. Nor did it matter to Yeltsin that every one of his advisers
told him that.
 &HT;    He did not always seem so arrogant. An earlier generation of
correspondents compared Yeltsin favorably with the repugnant and
brutal leaders of the Soviet Union. He was different, of course,
and better. People often stood in awe of his genuine courage. Many
will always remember Yeltsin as the man who climbed to the top of a
tank in 1991 _ truly one of the most powerful political gestures of
recent times _ to banish the Communist past with a wave of his
meaty arms.
 &HT;    My colleagues and I, however, tend to remember the man who
appeared on television one grim morning in December 1994 to
announce that his air force had stopped bombing the citizens of
Grozny for good _ the first of many times he lied openly to the
world about wanting to end the carnage. Later that day, I saw the
results when a squadron of unchallenged Su-27 bombers destroyed
Chechnya's biggest orphanage. I remember the leader who took one
quick trip to Chechnya during a 21-month war. He spent three hours
on a highly protected air base and told the dazed, starved and
defeated soldiers there that they ``had won the war'' that they
knew they had lost. Then he got on his plane and flew back to
Moscow.
 &HT;    ``Boris Yeltsin is so obsessed with being one of the Western
leaders it's pathetic,'' said Aleksandr Prokhanov, the philosopher
of the extreme anti-Western old guard. ``But you know what? He acts
like a Soviet. He always has. He knows what people want to hear,
but he couldn't care less about democracy.''
 &HT;    Americans can't accept that simple fact. We love to see Yeltsin
as the savior of a savage land. Hey, if he's a little rough around
the edges _ as a senior White House official once suggested to me _
then George Washington was too. American leaders are so invested in
believing in the good Boris that they are willing to say anything
to support him, as long as Yeltsin continues to believe in the
stock market and to refer to Clinton as ``my friend Bill.''
 &HT;    That is why Clinton could put on his most earnest expression in
1996, appear at a news conference in Moscow and say with a straight
face that the brutal slaughter in Chechnya was similar to ``a civil
war in our own country'' and that Yeltsin's merciless assault on
the Chechen people reminded him of Abraham Lincoln's efforts to
keep the United States from falling apart in the 19th century.
 &HT;    If a Soviet leader had acted with such clear aggression, any
American president would have led an international call for
sanctions. But Yeltsin is our guy. And people like Clinton are so
relieved about it that they let him get away with almost anything.
And he clearly knows that.
 &HT;    Recently Yeltsin met with Michel Camdessus, the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, which is trying to
help Russia cure itself of its fiscal ills. The IMF is seen _ with
some justification _ as a Western control agency, and nobody in
Russia gets much pleasure in remembering that their country is weak
and the West is not.
 &HT;    Yeltsin's aides and those of Camdessus dreaded what might have
come from this encounter: The rectitude of the IMF chief in direct
conflict with the raging ego of a Russian ruler who needs the
support of the West. The possibility for confrontation was
enormous.
 &HT;    As usual, Yeltsin was crafty and surprising. He started off by
admitting his sins: Russia hadn't always tightened the belt when it
should have, Yeltsin said. And he was now going to take an interest
in the details, not just the landscape. Then he grew
conspiratorial.
 &HT;    ``They even say I'm too sick to run this country,'' one of the
meeting's participants recalls a grinning Yeltsin telling an
astonished Camdessus. ``Maybe it's not such a bad idea if people
think I am too sick to do my job sometimes. Maybe it keeps people
guessing.''
 &HT;    In the end, that's what Yeltsin _ so desperate to retain power _
cares about more than anything: keeping people guessing. Like many
successful politicians, he is a human mood ring, a man whose
ideology changes with the seasons, with the country he is visiting,
with the phases of the moon.
 &HT;    Such tactics work in Russia, which has never really decided
whether it belongs in Europe or Asia. The debate has lasted for
more than 200 years _ Dostoyevsky railed against what he considered
the false pull toward the West _ and nobody milks that ambivalence
like Yeltsin. Who else could sell nuclear technology to Iran, seek
to moderate world opinion about Serbian war criminals and lecture
his own Parliament about the need for currency reforms and open
markets?
 &HT;    Yeltsin resembles no one more than Nikita Khrushchev, who also
wanted to make Russia more acceptable to the West _ and didn't mind
resorting to some earthy theatrics to get the job done.
 &HT;    In late March _ acting after a few words placed in his ear by
his daughter Tanya, who has become singularly powerful within the
cloistered walls of the Kremlin _ Yeltsin decided to dismiss his
government. He did it mostly so he could get rid of its slavishly
loyal leader, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who after five years of
dedicated service was starting to look a bit too much like a leader
to suit the first freely elected president of Russia.
 &HT;    So one morning, Yeltsin went on television and told an
astonished nation that his prime minister would have to go.
 &HT;    At first, he tried to appoint himself as acting prime minister.
When his lawyers sheepishly told him that such an action was
against the law that Yeltsin himself had created, he turned
reluctantly to an untested young reform politician who had only
spoken with the president once and who heard about his new job
while eating breakfast that morning.
 &HT;    By creating a political crisis, Yeltsin was back where he loves
to be: unquestionably and single-handedly in charge of his country.
 &HT;    ``It now seems pretty clear that the most primitive and vulgar
explanation for all that was true,'' says Tanya Malkina, a
well-known political journalist in Moscow who has followed
Yeltsin's career through nearly every one of its many tortuous
turnings. ``Boris Yeltsin cannot stand for anyone to share power or
even think about sharing power. He must have all the limelight.''
 &HT;    Even so, Yeltsin's most recent explosion with Chernomyrdin may
turn out to have made more sense than most people think. Sure,
firing Chernomydin was the work of a disloyal, selfish egomaniac.
Commentators were shocked when Yeltsin essentially offered to buy
off Parliament with better cars and apartments if they would
confirm Sergei Kiryenko, his new prime minister.
 &HT;    Yeltsin offered to ``solve the outstanding problems'' of
parliamentary officials who needed nice summer places. ``They know
what it's all about,'' Yeltsin said just before Kiriyenko was
confirmed. Do what I want, and I'll give you a nice big car and a
pretty little dacha.
 &HT;    So Yeltsin is corrupt, venal and has little regard for Robert's
Rules of Order. That's no surprise. But by getting rid of his
stolid old retainer, Yeltsin actually made the most decisive step
he has ever taken toward the road of reform.
 &HT;    Nothing got done when Chernomyrdin ran the government. He had a
magical ability to seek consensus in a Parliament whose most famous
members have been known to pull one another's hair or fling orange
juice in one another's faces during debate. He made the Communists
feel comfortable, and he made the reformers feel as if he was at
least on their side. The result was an endless stalemate.
 &HT;    For all its boorishness, then, Yeltsin's decision was ultimately
good for his country. And yet is that why he fired Chernomyrdin? Or
was it because _ as Kremlin insiders whispered _ he was upset as he
watched him at a meeting with Vice President Gore?
 &HT;    ``He looked like he was enjoying it,'' says one former Yeltsin
aide about Chernomyrdin's brief moment in the sun. ``And that was
really the end of him.''
 &HT;    There is supposed to be an election in the year 2000 _ an
election without Boris Yeltsin. It will be the president's ultimate
test. If he manufactures some reason to run again (nobody else is
ready; he alone can lead Russia through these troubling times), he
will have thrown away his last weak claim to greatness. He will
become the man who took Russia from communism to autocracy.
 &HT;    If Yeltsin becomes the first Russian leader to walk away from
the Kremlin without a push or a gun at his head, it will say a lot
about what kind of country he wants to see emerge in the 21st
century.
 &HT;    A few months ago, he announced that he would not run for a third
term. But he has said that before only to dance back into the ring.
Don't hold your breath this time either. Giving up power has never
been one of Yeltsin's strong suits.
 &HT;    He appointed Kiriyenko because he wants to rule unchallenged and
because he wants to move Russia toward markets and the West. After
all, if he doesn't succeed, how will history remember him?
 &HT;    Getting rid of communism is not a bad line on a resume. Turning
your country over to a bunch of greedy thugs, however, is.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    I never hung out with Yeltsin. By the time I got to Moscow,
Western reporters had gone from being good props in his campaign
for exposure to political poison. But I once watched him bound out
of his black Zil and wade into an angry Moscow crowd.
 &HT;    ``Boris Nikolayevich, we live worse than we did under
Brezhnev!'' they screamed. It was the most savage possible insult.
 &HT;    ``It's a Western plot,'' an old woman screamed. ``They are
driving us to ruin.''
 &HT;    Yeltsin took it all in. His eyes said, I feel your pain. Then he
responded with a quick, vulgar joke. I must admit I hardly caught a
word he said _ and no one would repeat it. But when I sidled up to
the old lady who attacked him and asked what she thought of the
president now, she broke into a smile as big as Siberia.
 &HT;    ``He's a muzhik,'' she said, using a term that describes a tough
peasant, a man of the people. ``I don't think you have those where
you're from.''

 By GERALDINE BROOKS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some sons bond with their fathers through baseball, some through
fishing. But for Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert, there has
only ever been the Business.
 &HT;    As a child in London, Lachlan remembers his mother waking him
for pre-dawn breakfasts before his father jetted off. As a
schoolboy in Manhattan, he recalls nights up late, listening to his
father at the dinner table hashing out strategies with famous
guests.
 &HT;    In 1990, when he was 19 years old, and a student at Princeton,
his father summoned him to London to stand at his side as scores of
lawyers haggled over the merger that created British Sky
Broadcasting.
 &HT;    Walking home afterward at 1 a.m. on a deserted Fleet Street,
Lachlan wondered why his father seemed so stressed and dispirited.
He didn't know that The News Corporation Ltd. _ the global giant
Rupert created out of an Australian newspaper _ had nearly
disintegrated under a crushing debt load.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to put my arms around him and hold him up,'' says
Lachlan Murdoch, running a long-fingered hand through gel-spiked
hair. In the weeks that followed, News Corp. successfully rolled
over its loans and went on growing, and Lachlan never again spoke
to his father of that moment.
 &HT;    ``We are a family that doesn't look back, always ahead,'' he
says, forming the long hands into an arrow-shaped probe and almost
lunging off the sofa of his Sydney office.
 &HT;    Ahead, for him, may be the job of running his father's empire _
if the decisions he makes as chief of News Ltd., the company's
Australian arm, are the right ones. A year ago Rupert Murdoch, 67,
called his children together in New York to put an end to the
speculation over who would succeed him. He said Lachlan, 26, the
third of his four children and his eldest son, would be the one to
eventually run a business that includes the 20th Century Fox film
studio, HarperCollins Publishers, The Times of London, the Los
Angeles Dodgers and Star TV, Asia's leading satellite broadcaster.
 &HT;    Public companies with revenues of $13 billion don't usually
operate like feudal fiefs, but the Murdochs, by keeping more than
30 percent of News Corp. stock under tight family control, have
tried to ensure that theirs can. Neither the recent, sudden
separation of Rupert and his wife Anna, after 31 years of marriage,
nor an upcoming public offering in News Corp.'s film, TV and sports
stock is likely to affect the succession.
 &HT;    For now, Lachlan runs the company's Australian outpost from a
drab office building at the shabby edge of Sydney's garment
district. When he enters the windowless conference room for a
meeting on a new printing plant, he is the youngest person at the
table by about two decades. The new plant gives the company a
long-awaited chance to break the grip of the printers' union. The
assembled executives, crusty newspapermen with years of labor
battles behind them, are gleeful at the prospect of a final
showdown.
 &HT;    But Lachlan is wary. Like his father, he is no fan of unions.
But unlike his father, who waged legendary wars with British
printers, he recoils from confrontation.
 &HT;    ``Roll up our sleeves and crash through _ that was the way we
used to do it,'' he tells the executives. ``But now we're talking
about a change of culture for both sides. You've got to convince
them they don't need the protection of the union. And the only way
you can convince them is if it's true. I don't want any more bully
boys and gorillas on the gates.''
 &HT;    When Rupert Murdoch stalked these Sydney headquarters back in
the 1960s, rolled-up shirt-sleeves were his trademark. He was just
21 when he inherited his father's Adelaide newspaper; employees
called him the Boy Publisher.
 &HT;    When the new Boy Publisher arrived in 1995 after a brief stint
running the company's Queensland newspapers, he too wore his
sleeves pushed up. But his rolled sleeves expose a serpentine
tattoo _ a chic circlet of blue-black swirls encompassing a
muscular forearm.
 &HT;    One Sydney executive remembers an early public unveiling of the
tattoo, at a corporate dinner just after Lachlan took over. ``It
was black-tie, average age of guests around 50, and Lachlan took
off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. I thought it was quite
odd _ a young thing to do, as if he was with a bunch of 20-year-old
blokes at the pub.''
 &HT;    The executive, whose company is aligned with News Ltd., has
since had a chance to observe Lachlan closely. ``His business
instincts are terrifically honed. Here's this person who looks like
the copy boy _ when you first walk into a room you wouldn't pick
him as dominant. But within three minutes you're in no doubt who's
the boss.''
 &HT;    That dominance was too much for some of the company's most
senior managers. ``The first thing Lachlan did was knock the empire
down around him,'' says the executive, who watched with alarm as
the body count mounted.
 &HT;    The chairman, a lifelong Murdoch loyalist, unexpectedly took
early retirement. The chief operating officer defected to News'
Australian rival, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. Marketing executives,
the corporate spokeswoman and a number of senior editors also
either jumped or were pushed overboard.
 &HT;    ``It's hard when proprietors' sons turn up, clomping around in
size 11 shoes and breaking all the porcelain,'' one former
executive says.
 &HT;    But unlike his father, Lachlan has a light touch. ``He chatted
about football for 20 minutes before he got around to telling me
I'd been replaced _ I probably finished the sentence for him,''
says Malcolm Schmidtke, former editor of The Australian, the only
general-interest national daily. Now an editor at Fairfax,
Schmidtke, 49, praises Lachlan's conduct in editorial meetings and
thinks he's unlikely to play politics with the papers the way his
father has.
 &HT;    The 49-year-old Schmidtke says Lachlan's youth, underlined by
stylistic flourishes such as shaving his head, created tension
among some older staffers. ``Your first reaction is to say, `Why is
this very young man intruding on my space?'''
 &HT;    Schmidtke let that attitude show in a disagreement over
Lachlan's desire to hire copy editors from England. ``He said the
ones here were no good,'' Schmidtke recalls. ``I told him I'd been
in this business more than 26 years, that I'd seen that idea tried
before, and that the Brits had turned out to be no better than the
locals. He got very angry with me.''
 &HT;    He thinks Lachlan probably would have accepted a contrary point
of view more easily from a younger person.
 &HT;    Lachlan has only tactful praise for the departed executives. But
he says the younger people now filling those positions are more
willing to experiment and try new things. One, Peter Macourt, the
chief financial officer, worked with Rupert Murdoch as part of the
company's debt-restructuring team. ``You can sit with Lachlan for
hours in meetings and think, well, he's nothing like his father.
Completely different style, manner. And then suddenly he'll say or
do something and, my God, it could be Rupert.''
 &HT;    In social settings, Lachlan has a graceful manner that friends
say he inherits from his mother. Lachlan is famous for paying
attention to the least prominent person in the room, sitting with
employees' spouses and making polite chat about their children.
 &HT;    ``He has the lovely manners that Australian men don't have _ you
think of him as the young prince,'' says Caroline Morgan, whose
husband, Ian Frykberg, is more familiar with the prince's
Machiavellian side.
 &HT;    Frykberg quit News Corp. in London after a conflict over the
tabloidization of TV news. Lachlan rehired him to stanch losses
from the company's move into Super League, a rival to the more
established Australian Rugby League. ``The first time he
demonstrates his toughness it's a surprise to most people,''
Frykberg says. ``But he only has to do it once.''
 &HT;    Lachlan is fond of the family networking that can make News
Corp. seem like a mom-and-pop business. ``We're a private family.
We don't talk about our personal affairs,'' Lachlan says. ``But we
can talk about business forever.''
 &HT;    After one weekend of whirlwind work and travel, it was 2 a.m.
before he reached his father. In between, he called his other
consigliere, his sister, Elisabeth, 29, the general manager of the
company's satellite-broadcast business in Britain. His younger
brother, James, 25, recently appointed deputy publisher of The New
York Post, is a further sounding board.
 &HT;    James also remembers the early breakfasts with their father:
``Pop had precious little time to spend with us, so the breakfasts
were crucial. Of course,'' he adds, ``when we'd get to breakfast,
everybody would read the papers. There's still this incredible
jockeying for the papers whenever we get together.''
 &HT;    James dismisses talk of tension in the family over Lachlan's
ascendance, adding that none of them see the succession as a done
deal. (Elisabeth Murdoch didn't respond to a request for comment.)
``Pop's going to be around a long time and we're all very young,''
he says. ``News Corp. is a big public company with big shareholders
who'll ultimately decide.''
 &HT;    In recent months, as News Corp.'s stock has lagged behind that
of rivals such as Time-Warner and Disney, some of those
shareholders have become impatient, and have expressed unease at
the young man's ascension. The stock offering, in which News Corp.
will offer investors a chance to buy into the company's attractive
assets, such as Fox Television and 20th Century Fox, while avoiding
money-losers such as Star TV and HarperCollins, has eased some of
the pressure. Lachlan acknowledges that he will have to earn the
confidence of investors, and agrees that his father's decision is
``always open for review.''
 &HT;    In Sydney, Lachlan lives alone in the bohemian harborside
neighborhood of Elizabeth Bay, where the tiny old apartments of
artists and writers rub up against gracious mansions. His
multimillion-dollar house is shaded by palms, its veranda looking
down on his swimming pool and the glistening harbor beyond. In his
spacious garage, he has built a Fiberglas climbing structure over
the walls so that he can stay in shape for one of his favorite
pastimes, rock climbing.
 &HT;    At any public gathering in Sydney, you can always find Lachlan
Murdoch by following the flashes of photographers. His youth, good
looks and extreme eligibility make him paparazzi fodder, as does
his propensity for adding tattoos and subtracting hair.
 &HT;    ``He is media grist,'' says the director Baz Luhrmann, who
became a close friend after making ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP;
Juliet'' for Fox. ``He's in the press every day, like JFK Jr.'' His
dates also tend to be exceptionally photogenic. The latest, the
Wonderbra model Sarah O'Hare, was his escort at the Oscars _ a big
night for News Corp., given the triumph of Fox's ``Titanic,'' in
which Fox had a major stake. But O'Hare is based in New York, and
when Lachlan is at home his one constant companion is Grace, his
Rhodesian ridgeback.
 &HT;    Australia wasn't an obvious choice for Lachlan. Born in London,
educated at Trinity School in Manhattan, Aspen Country Day School
and Princeton, he had been to Australia only on vacations, taking
summer jobs cleaning presses in Sydney or mustering sheep on the
company's spread in outback New South Wales.
 &HT;    ``Australia is the home of this company,'' he says. ``Not only
is all my family Australian,'' (news, perhaps, to Washington, which
made citizens of his father in 1985, his mother in 1989 and Lachlan
in 1993) ``but so are many of the executives in the company. It's
understood that there's a sort of egalitarian Australian culture
we've managed to keep.''
 &HT;    Lachlan is well advised to stress this Aussie-ness: News Corp.,
which dominates the Australian newspaper market, doesn't want to be
perceived as an alien force. The strategy, writes a Sydney media
critic, David Bowman, is to establish Lachlan ``as a sort of
honorary Australian.''
 &HT;    Lachlan, says his friend Luhrmann, finds this argument
disturbing. ``The idea that he's not dealt with as part of
Australian culture is upsetting to him. He chose where he wanted to
be, and he chose Australia.''
 &HT;    Every time he refers to his father, it is simply as ``my dad.''
He ends their frequent phone calls with ``Love you, Dad,'' no
matter who is in the room.
 &HT;    When I ask him what it is like to love someone who is so widely
hated, he leans forward on the sofa and clenches his rock-climber's
hands into tight fists.
 &HT;    ``When you know someone, when you know the truth about them _
what's good and right and true vs. what's misrepresented _ you
quickly learn to ignore it or shut it out. What the criticism in
Britain is about is an upper-class elite being scared of the
masses. In our papers they see a reflection of society that's not
Oxford or Cambridge and they don't like it. There's a fear of
democracy. My dad's Australian and that's where they sent everyone
they didn't want.''
 &HT;    Unlike most of his Princeton peers, Lachlan read three
newspapers a day in college: The Wall Street Journal (``a great
brand for its readership''), The New York Times (``a chore'') and
his father's New York Post (``a great sense of the energy of New
York'').
 &HT;    He has a simple explanation for the low numbers of young
newspaper readers in the United States: ``I don't think papers in
the United States are very good.'' He prefers the British press,
where he worked as a copy editor on the racy and often reckless
tabloid, The Sun.
 &HT;    Lachlan describes his political leanings as ``economically
conservative but libertarian on people's individual rights.'' Asked
for an illustration of his libertarianism, he talks about
cigarettes.
 &HT;    ``I don't smoke,'' he says. ``But I think taxes on cigarettes
are the most outrageous example of the Nanny State. It would be one
thing if every penny went to researching lung cancer, but in fact
it's greedy politicians using the money to pork-barrel roads or put
into the welfare state. People who want to smoke shouldn't be
burdened because of the political correctness of our times.''
 &HT;    Lachlan wasn't in charge of News Ltd. during Australia's last
round of Parliamentary elections. The next, expected later this
year, is likely to be one of the most divisive in history, with
racial issues such as Aboriginal land rights at the forefront.
 &HT;    While the temptation to meddle will be strong _ a friendly
government could do a lot for News Ltd. _ Lachlan insists it will
be up to his editors to report the election as they see it. In
fact, he adds, two of his papers are already at odds on Aboriginal
legislation. ``It's flattering to say I have a lot of power. But
the reality is, I don't.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the evening of Feb. 20, 1998, less than a week after the
much-heralded publication of her first novel in more than 20 years,
Gayl Jones, 48, was handcuffed and removed from her Lexington, Ky.,
home by the local police.
 &HT;    Inside the two-bedroom bungalow, her husband lay bleeding from a
self-inflicted knife wound.
 &HT;    The confrontation began just after 6 p.m., when police officers
knocked on the door at 440 Locust Ave., to serve a 15-year-old
warrant for the arrest of Bob Higgins, also known as Bob Jones. The
man opened the door a crack, but after a brief exchange with the
cops, he slammed it shut, ran to the rear of the house and
reappeared, holding two knives to his throat.
 &HT;    ``Don't come in,'' he screamed. ``I'll kill myself if you come
in here.''
 &HT;    At 8:45, the SWAT team arrived. The couple had barricaded
themselves inside, and Jones was calling 911. She insisted that she
too would kill herself if the police stormed the house, and then
she announced that they had turned on the gas.
 &HT;    Whether the couple intended to asphyxiate themselves or blow up
the neighborhood, SWAT members couldn't be sure. Having evacuated
surrounding residents to the end of the block, they decided to go
in. Two members of the five-man rapid-entry team managed to throw
themselves across Jones, who was on the couch less than 10 feet
from the door.
 &HT;    But the two assigned to Higgins did not get to him in time. He
thrust one of the knives into his throat with such force that it
lodged in his spine. A geyser of blood sprayed across the room.
 &HT;    Over the next month the outpouring of news articles predictably
focused on the brilliant black writer whose comeback had been
blasted by her husband's death _ and the hideous irony that it was
a flattering full-page article about Jones and her new novel, ``The
Healing,'' in Newsweek that had led the police to discover Higgins'
fugitive status.
 &HT;    Yet beyond the explanation that Jones was simply another victim
of an abusive, controlling husband was a more complex reality, and
the violence surrounding the couple was in fact the culmination of
the legacies that had wedded Gayl and Bob to each other.
 &HT;    If the question was why a woman as smart as Jones could be swept
away by a man like Higgins, then the answer lay not only in her own
lifetime but also in her collective past, in the blood of
generations that coursed through her writing. It was not just life
imitating art; it was that Jones and Higgins were united in the
conviction that a racist society had doomed them to repeat the
violent history of their forebears.
 &HT;    As she wrote in ``Wild Figs and Secret Places,'' a 1983 poem,
``Memory is a mosquito/pregnant again/and out for blood.''
 &HT;    Born Nov. 23, 1949, to Franklin and Lucille Jones, Gayl grew up
in a cramped, dilapidated house with no indoor toilet in Speigle
Heights, one of Lexington's more turbulent black neighborhoods. Her
father worked late hours as a restaurant cook, while her mother, an
aspiring writer, stayed home with Gayl and her younger brother,
Franklin Jr.
 &HT;    Most weekends Lucille took the children to visit her mother, who
lived on a small farm outside town. There the grandmother and
mother shared old family tales in the oral tradition of rural
blacks throughout Kentucky.
 &HT;    In the mid-'60s, the Jones children would have attended the
black high school, but Lucille made sure that Gayl and her brother
were among the handful of African-Americans enrolling at Henry
Clay, the white school known for its academic excellence. Painfully
shy to the point of muteness, Gayl seemed almost invisible to other
students, although several teachers took note of her.
 &HT;    Her Spanish teacher, Anna Dodd, who usually kept her distance
from students, often lent Gayl books and talked to her about her
adventures among the Paris expatriates in the '20s and '30s. Just
as she soaked up her grandmother's and mother's reminiscences, Gayl
absorbed Dodd's.
 &HT;    ``I want to write like Henry James,'' she told Sue Ann Allen,
her junior-year English teacher, and the final story she turned in
was, indeed, written in a Jamesian style.
 &HT;    But when she went to Connecticut College on a scholarship
arranged with the assistance of Dodd's friend Elizabeth Hardwick,
the writer and a Lexington native, Jones discovered a literary
legacy that was more her own.
 &HT;    The disparity between her background and that of white
classmates had been painfully evident in segregated Lexington.
 &HT;    ``She grew up in a town with two statues of Confederate generals
on the courthouse lawn,'' says Don Edwards, a veteran columnist at
The Lexington Herald-Leader who can trace his family to slave
owners. ``And then to go from that to the North, Gayl must have
felt like an astronaut shot into space.''
 &HT;    Connecticut College, then a small, elite women's school, was
another world entirely. Jones landed there during the turbulent
'60s, but while other African-American students were demonstrating
for more minority admissions and an all-black dormitory, she
remained on the periphery, quiet and withdrawn. At the same time,
she became engrossed in African-American literature and studied
with Robert Hayden, the esteemed black poet and literary historian
then visiting from the University of Michigan.
 &HT;    Her reading seemed as much a way of defining herself as protests
were for others, and when she returned home from college the summer
after her freshman year she told her former English teacher of a
new project. ``She said she was starting a `generational novel'
based on her family history,'' Sue Ann Allen says.
 &HT;    Graduating with a stellar record, Jones was accepted in 1971 to
Brown University's graduate writing program. By the end of four
years she had all but completed the manuscripts for two novels,
several collections of short stories and poetry and a play. And she
had been listening to the blues, which now became an affirmation of
her heritage as a black woman.
 &HT;    At Brown, Jones attracted another mentor: Prof. Michael S.
Harper, a prominent African-American poet and critic. Harper had
long been influenced by jazz and the blues and thus had a unique
appreciation of what Jones was attempting in her writing.
 &HT;    When Harper brought Jones' work to the attention of Toni
Morrison, then an editor at Random House, she signed Jones to a
book contract. With the publication of her first novel in mid-1975,
Jones was heralded as a significant, major new author.
 &HT;    In 1975, Jones became a visiting lecturer in English at the
University of Michigan and a year later was hired as an assistant
professor. Jones was the only African-American woman among the
department's 70 or so faculty members (two black female
predecessors had not been tenured), and Hayden, the
African-American poet whom she had met at Connecticut College, was
near retirement.
 &HT;    With her isolation and watchful alienation, she was, apparently,
altogether ripe for the picking by the time Bob Higgins, an
attractive, well-dressed African-American, happened into her life.
She was first seen around campus with him in the late '70s, about
the time of the publication of ``White Rat,'' which had followed
hard on the heels of her second novel, ``Eva's Man.''
 &HT;    Born in Cleveland in 1947, Higgins brought his own legacy of
racism and family suffering to the relationship. Having been
abandoned at a young age by his mother (who eventually died
homeless, a fatality of mental illness and alcoholism), he was
reared by relatives in Detroit as well as by several foster
families, including that of George Breitman, a leading Socialist
and a supporter of black nationalism.
 &HT;    Although he later earned a degree at the University of Michigan,
Higgins hung out in Detroit at Wayne State University, which in the
mid-'60s and early '70s was a hotbed of black activism, even more
so than Berkeley. He routinely proclaimed his own brilliance,
calling himself ``a true Hegelian'' and ``a math genius'' who
should be on the university's faculty. He was also writing a column
for Wayne State's student paper under the byline ``A. Violence.''
 &HT;    Higgins had already been married and divorced when, around 1970,
he began a relationship with Carolyn Ramsey that was a blueprint
for what happened with Jones. ``As a young black woman, I was
totally smitten,'' Ramsey says. ``I felt that he was misunderstood
by everybody but me.''
 &HT;    When his treatise on Hegel was turned down by publishers and
received an unfavorable reading from Breitman, Higgins, then living
on Staten Island, went bananas and sparked a police standoff at his
apartment. When the cops lobbed tear gas inside, Higgins took a
suicidal leap out the window, landing on the frozen ground six
floors below.
 &HT;    Miraculously, he survived and though he was to be sent to
Ypsilanti, Mich., for psychiatric treatment, his case fell through
the cracks, and in 1975 he showed up in Ann Arbor instead. There,
he announced to old acquaintances that his survival was evidence of
his ``godliness,'' even proof that he was the new Messiah.
 &HT;    Many who knew the couple were perplexed by Jones' infatuation
with a man who, by the early '80s, was no longer a Marxist and
black nationalist but was cloaking himself in capitalist dreams and
messianic religiosity. In addition to dressing in silk suits and
driving expensive cars, Higgins opened two Ann Arbor investment
businesses and took over as Jones' agent, which instigated the
withdrawal of Morrison as Jones' editor.
 &HT;    Still, Jones continued to progress in both her academic and
literary careers, and she was rewarded with tenure in 1982. She had
earlier contacted Naomi Long Madgett, a poet and the publisher and
editor of Lotus Press, the small Detroit house known for publishing
African-American poets.
 &HT;    Madgett eventually accepted three of Jones' collections, the
first of which was ``Song for Anninho,'' a rendering in verse of
the plot of her unpublished novel ``Palmares,'' in which two
enslaved lovers escape to northeastern Brazil. Jones' only requests
were that no author's photograph appear on the book cover and that
she not do readings to help sales.
 &HT;    The two communicated by letter or phone except for one brief
meeting in 1980. But after the publication of ``Song for Anninho''
in 1981 and ``The Hermit-Woman'' in 1983, the editor heard almost
nothing from Jones for about two years after the couple abruptly
fled Ann Arbor.
 &HT;    The precipitating event was a gay-rights parade at which Higgins
railed that he was God and that AIDS was a form of divine
punishment. One of the marchers, a woman, had punched him, and the
police refused to file an assault complaint; he returned to the
march with a shotgun and was arrested for felonious assault, a
charge that carried a potential sentence of four years in jail.
 &HT;    Neither Jones nor Higgins appeared in the courtroom to answer
the charges. Two days earlier, Jones had resigned from the
university and given vent to her long-seething rage: ``I reject
your lying racist (expletive), and I call upon God. Do what you
want. God is with Bob and I'm with him.''
 &HT;    Higgins was found guilty in absentia, and a bench warrant was
issued for his arrest.
 &HT;    Although in 1992 Jones emerged for a rare and successful public
reading and discussion of her work at the University of Kentucky,
for the most part the couple remained hidden from the world.
Higgins, in his escalating megalomania, was creating Web sites to
spread a new spiritualism, and by late 1996 Jones had completed
``The Healing'' and was almost finished with a draft of
``Mosquito.''
 &HT;    Professional as ever, in early 1997 she contacted Beacon Press
about reclaiming the paperback rights to ``Corregidora'' and
``Eva's Man,'' which the small Boston-based publisher bought from
Random House in the mid-'80s. To Helene Atwan, Beacon's director,
the novels were backlist gems, and she offered an additional
advance to keep them.
 &HT;    At first Jones refused, explaining that she didn't want those
books to be her only novels in print, presumably because of their
portrayal of black men as violent and abusive, a subject of heated
literary debate then. When Atwan asked if Beacon could publish her
latest writing, Jones seemed less adamant and soon gave Atwan
instructions for downloading the manuscripts of ``The Healing'' and
``Mosquito'' from a Web site.
 &HT;    The contract negotiations by e-mail went smoothly, although
Atwan sometimes suspected that it was Jones' agent, identified by
one of Higgins' many aliases, who was corresponding under Jones'
name.
 &HT;    At the same time, Higgins was taking ever greater risks for a
man dodging a felony warrant. Even though he had been going by the
name Bob Jones, clues to his identity were everywhere in his
cyberspace publishing. With the diagnosis of his mother-in-law
Lucille's throat cancer, he became even more convinced of his
omnipotence. He not only took control of her medical treatment but
used it as the occasion for a full-bore assault on the white
establishment.
 &HT;    During January and February 1997, Jones accompanied her mother
to radiation treatments at the Markey Cancer Center at the
University of Kentucky. On Monday, Feb. 24, 1997, with Lucille's
weight at 68 pounds, the attending physician hospitalized her and
recommended inserting a stomach feeding tube. Higgins objected to
the procedure, and because Lucille seemed so confused, the hospital
ordered a psychiatric evaluation and concluded that she was
``unduly and inappropriately manipulated by family _ especially
son-in-law.''
 &HT;    Banned from visiting, Jones and Higgins were ordered to leave;
when they refused, hospital security was called, and with Higgins'
further resistance, the campus police arrived and charged him with
disorderly conduct.
 &HT;    Higgins and Jones then e-mailed a document entitled
``Kidnapped/Held Incommunicado'' to the national press, and on
Monday morning, March 3, 1997, copies were faxed to the university
and federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies as well as to
President Clinton, the first lady and Vice President Gore.
 &HT;    The next day, Lucille indicated that she wanted to go home, and
again her doctors advised against it. Instead she was transferred
to Central Baptist Hospital, where Higgins and Jones agreed to the
surgery. Sent home on March 13, Lucille developed respiratory
problems and died on March 20.
 &HT;    Higgins' campaign against the medical center then went into high
gear. Jones had been keeping a low profile, but now her name
appeared on a 10-page communique on the Internet listing 50
``changes'' in Lucille after ``one week of U.K. kidnapping.'' The
document described the closeness between the mother and daughter _
undoubtedly Jones' sentiments _ yet the rambling prose was
obviously not hers.
 &HT;    Higgins' onslaught continued with more faxes, phone calls and
mailings to the university. Even Lexington's police chief, Larry
Walsh, had been receiving four or five calls a day, and by early
summer he noticed an increasingly menacing tone.
 &HT;    The police were especially concerned by his Feb. 20, 1998,
letter to the University of Kentucky's president, Charles T.
Wethington Jr.: a reference to ``checking out all the pipes and
fixtures in your system'' implied a bomb threat. Finally figuring
out after the Newsweek article that Bob Jones was Bob Higgins, the
cops had a legal basis for bringing him in.
 &HT;    With the SWAT team surrounding the house and Higgins threatening
to kill himself, Jones called 911. On the tape, she speaks quickly,
with uncharacteristic volume, her voice surprisingly firm.
 &HT;    Gayl Jones: My name is Gayl Jones and I am an author. ... You
killed my mother, Lucille Jones, and now you are trying to kill my
husband.. . .
 &HT;    Police: Ma'am, just try and relax, OK?
 &HT;    Finally, when the police took Jones out of the house, she was
barefoot and wearing sweatpants. Led to the next-door neighbor's
porch, she stood staring at the floor, whispering to herself.
 &HT;    At her side, Sgt. Joan Root asked, ``Who are you talking to?''
 &HT;    ``I'm talking to the spirit of my mother,'' Jones replied, her
eyes vacant and unfocused.
 &HT;    When the paramedics carried Higgins to the ambulance, the knife
still protruding from his neck, Jones lifted her eyes and watched.
She made no move to go to him but asked the policewoman where he
was being taken. When told the University of Kentucky Hospital, she
shook her head, moaning: ``Oh, no. They're going to kill him too.
That's what this is all about. Oh, no, no, no. Don't take him to
U.K.''
 &HT;    In fact, there was nothing that could be done to save him, and
he was pronounced dead later that evening. Jones was committed to
the state mental hospital for 72 hours of observation. Her
confinement was then extended until March 9, when it was deemed
that she was no longer a danger to herself.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Higgins was buried with only four people
present: two reporters, Jones' cousin Cynthia Gentry, and another
woman. Jones sent a eulogy.
 &HT;    Since her release, Jones, who refused several requests to be
interviewed for this article, has spoken only to family members, a
lawyer and Michael Harper, her mentor from Brown, who has managed
to stay her friend despite Higgins' attempt to cut off her ties to
him. Alone in the house, she has remained behind drawn blinds; it
is only at night that neighbors can see her vague form illuminated
by a flickering TV.

GRAND WIN FOR ARNOLD VW ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, critics converge on the south of France to salute the
year's best movies at the famous Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In late June and early July, it's the advertising industry's
turn, and this year, one of the judges at the 45th International
Advertising Festival was Ron Lawner, a managing partner and chief
creative officer at Arnold Communications of Boston, New England's
largest ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   As one of 23 judges, and the only American on the panel, it was
Lawner's job to sort through 7,000 entries. The goal was to honor
the best print advertising in the world.
</P>
<P>
   (A separate panel of judges reviewed TV ads.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gruelling work at first,'' says Lawner, who conceded
that he later relieved the stresses of judging by tooling along the
Riviera in a rented Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, though, Lawner sat in a room by himself as he
sifted through large bound portfolios of ads.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the thousands of ads was marked with a bar code, much
like a box of Cheerios at a supermarket, and Lawner was equipped
with a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Lawner would review each ad, sweep over the page with his
scanner, and then punch in a score from 1 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of working alone, the judges were brought
together to compare notes and pick finalists in such categories as
car, clothing, and computer ads.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing thousands of print ads, Lawner noted several
trends. In a global economy, the sight gag has become the Esperanto
of marketing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of words and text, the lingua franca of the pitch is
fast becoming a visual vernacular _ a simple, humorous image that
can be instantly understood whether viewed in Hong Kong, Hollywood,
or Holliston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the message right away,'' Lawner says.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite ads was for Jaguar, the British luxury car.
The company is promoting a new model with a souped-up V-8 engine,
and a print ad from Ogilvy &AMP; Mather shows an enlarged photo of the
silver jaguar that serves as the car's hood ornament; in the ad,
the jaguar is straining at a chain leash.
</P>
<P>
   An ad for Burger King's ``fiery fries'' that ran in Singapore
also got high marks from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Devised by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a graphic shows a french fry
standing vertically with one end daubed in ketchup. The effect is
to evoke the image of a match catching fire.
</P>
<P>
   ```Keep it simple' should absolutely be the first rule of
advertising,'' Lawner says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawner applied that rule when he helped create print ads to
launch the new version of the Volkswagen Beetle this spring.
</P>
<P>
   One ad shows a yellow Beetle and the message, ``If you sold your
soul in the '80s, here's your chance to buy it back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Less flower, more power,'' says another Beetle ad.
</P>
<P>
   These ads were among those reviewed by the Cannes judges, though
Lawner recused himself from voting on his own work.
</P>
<P>
   Over several days, thousands of ads were winnowed to two
finalists for a Grand Prix, the festival's award for the finest
print advertising of the year. (A Grand Prix was also awarded to
the best TV ad campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   In print, the finalists were Arnold's ads for VW and ads for
Apple Computer Inc. Created by TBWA Chiat/Day of California, the
Apple ads feature photos of celebrities such as Picasso, Gandhi,
and Bob Dylan. The tag line: ``Think different.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first face off between Arnold and Chiat/Day.
Not long ago, the agencies were the two finalists in the
competition for Apple's advertising account.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lawner, Arnold was Apple's choice until Apple
founder Steve Jobs stepped in, overruled the decision of his aides,
and gave the business to Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Chiat/Day created a Super Bowl ad for Apple
that is widely regarded as one of the best TV ads ever, and perhaps
Jobs gave the account to Chiat/Day out of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   (In that old Apple ad, the ambiance is heavy with sinister
conformity and 1984 menace. As drones watch, a Big Brother figure
intones his new world order over a huge TV screen. A woman athlete
revolts and in a blow for individualism, she hurls a hammer,
shattering the TV screen and Big Brother's world.)
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent rivalry between the two agencies, Lawner says
of the Grand Prix showdown at Cannes, ``I sure didn't want to lose
to Chiat/Day.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. The Grand Prix now sits near the door
of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Of his summer vacation in Cannes, Lawner says it would be hard
to top his experience: ``First-time festival. First-time judge.
First-time Grand Prix. I'm not going back.''

   While she was the former Soviet Union's first lady, Raisa
Gorbachev was often villified in the press, both at home and
abroad. A strong, intelligent, stylish, articulate woman, she was
frequently criticized for her hemlines, her shoes, her sunglasses,
her ``willfulness,'' her opinions, her lack of a traditional female
demeanor _ and for having ``too much control'' over her husband,
Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton, in
fact, the Gorbachevs' longlasting relationship has been notably
egalitarian. Gorbachev himself once revealed in an NBC-TV interview
with Tom Brokaw that he ``discussed everything'' with his wife _
igniting a storm of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Only after becoming a sixtysomething grandmother _ and keeping a
high profile through activism in issues concerning women, children
and families _ has Raisa Gorbachev come to rank high in Russian
public-opinion polls. Today she is one of the most admired women in
her troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hillary Clinton, on reaching 50 and packing her
healthy daughter Chelsea off to college _ while keeping a heavy
schedule of activities on behalf of women, children and families _
suddenly began to rank high in U.S. public-approval surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mrs. Gorbachev regards with almost motherly empathy the
trials of other first ladies in the spotlight, including those of
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted in June at the elegant Copley Plaza
Hotel in Boston, after Mrs. Gorbachev had received an honorary
degree from Northeastern University, where The Gorbachev
Foundation, a political, social and environmental think tank, has
its North American headquarters.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.

PAIN OF JAPAN'S RECESSION FOUND IN TENTS, LEAN-TOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For anyone familiar with Japan's glistening, seemingly
uniform prosperity, or with the care this rich nation pays to
promoting income equality, it is hard to believe the encampments of
the homeless along the Sumida River exist.
</P>
<P>
   But as countless unwitting commuters whizz along the elevated
Capital Highway, hundreds of destitute people live almost invisibly
underneath, in neatly lined-up cardboard boxes wrapped in
waterproof blue tarpaulins. Their numbers are echoed by thousands
more _ mostly older, jobless men _ scattered imperceptibly in a
handful of Tokyo's train stations, underpasses, and parks.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless problem is not new here, but it is growing and
claiming some unexpected victims. The homeless in Tokyo doubled in
the first half of this decade with the fizzling of Japan's
``bubble'' economy, to an estimated 10,000, and their ranks are
growing faster now as unemployment hits post-war records.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most extreme victims of Japan's worst recession in
23 years, and because of the huge value this society places on work
and group belonging, the suffering they endure can be as much
psychological as it is physical.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have recently found a few ``salarymen'' still wearing
their company pins camped out on park benches. But most of the
homeless are blue-collar workers over age 50 who came here years
ago when jobs were plentiful. In the 1990s, manual work dried up,
and what is left is being offered to younger men.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Tokyo's homeless is a window into two serious
problems underlying Japan's current economic malaise: the decline
of its once-dominant construction and manufacturing industries and
the rapid graying of its population. Unless the country is able to
restructure flailing industries while at the same time finding
resources to better serve its laid-off and elderly, it could face
mounting homelessness and other Western-style social problems that
it has long prided itself on avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is perhaps nowhere more evident than along a grim,
gray stretch of the Sumida riverbank, across from a gas refinery
and nondescript warehouses, in the Sanya district of Tokyo once
famous for day labor opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, welfare workers say, there was no cardboard community
here; today, an estimated 500 refrigerator cartons, lean-to tarps,
and plywood cubes serve as homes. To a Western eye, they may be
striking in their orderliness; brooms, umbrellas and clean
undershirts hang from clotheslines, water bottles for drinking and
washing are tied to the tarps, single-burner gas cookers are
common, and shoes are left outside boxes so as not to sully
mattresses inside.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants are mostly clean-shaven and polite men, such as
Kazuo Yamada, 56, who said he was laid off without a pension last
year from a job making car bodies for Mitsubishi. He has lived in a
blue nylon tent between two men in cartons for seven months, ever
since he ran out of money to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, this is the first time I've been unemployed,''
confided Yamada. ``I can't find anything. That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamada's story is not surprising given that Japan lost 630,000
manufacturing jobs from 1990 to 1997, and retraining is not highly
developed here.
</P>
<P>
   Government policy toward the displaced has been spotty at best.
Starting in 1993, the government spent millions of dollars to build
temporary apartments for the homeless to get them off the streets
in winter but tore down the buildings in spring because no
community wanted a year-round shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There are places, such as the government-run Johoku Fukushi
Social Welfare Center in Sanya, that give out vouchers for cheap
motels. But director Kunio Nozaki says the vouchers are a band-aid;
jobs are the only long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if this recession ends, these people won't be able to get
jobs because of their age and lack of other skills,'' said a
dispirited Nozaki.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the bubble economy in 1988-89, the welfare center
had three times as many daily construction jobs on offer as
applicants. Since 1991, with the drop in property prices, building
has dropped off and machines have replaced people at work sites.
The center has seen a 20 percent jump in jobseekers this year but
will have only 11,000 jobs for 90,000 hopefuls in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nozaki wants the government to create more jobs for the
displaced, such as cleaning up parks and cemeteries. But he
realizes that will not solve the underlying problem of an economy
in the doldrums. Since 1991, 110,000 small firms have shut down,
and many of their castoffs have settled here too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the jobless do not apply for assistance. Single
mothers and children get cash benefits, but single laborers do not,
and many never worked at one place long enough to qualify for
national health or social security. Meanwhile, public and private
pensions are running out of funds; last year alone, 14 private
pension plans went broke.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 percent of Japanese are on welfare, Nozaki says.
Most men in Sanya ``are still hoping they can get a job. They still
have pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that almost half of Sanya's residents are now
working fewer than 10 days a month. Nozaki gestures out the window
at several old men sleeping on the pavement or weaving down the
alley, drunk on cheap rice wine, or ``sake,'' that is sold from
streetside vending machines. ``They have given up. This feeling
permeates everything here,'' he said. ``They're lonely, they have
no jobs, and they are getting desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Police Agency, unemployment and
bankruptcy are the causes of one in three suicides.
</P>
<P>
   For now, homelessness affects only a fraction of the population
and is isolated to a few areas. It is still nearly impossible to
find a panhandler in Tokyo. But these streets that were once noisy
with construction trucks begging for day laborers are now bereft of
activity. Sanya appears to be populated solely by slow-moving old
men.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's population is rapidly aging and birth rates are so low
that it is unclear who will support the elderly. Today, 21 percent
of Japan's population is over the age of 60. By 2020, that figure
is expected to jump to nearly one in three, versus 19 percent in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese families have more elderly to care for than
children, and with the fracturing of extended families, more senior
citizens are finding themselves alone. In Tokyo, 14,000 people are
on waiting lists for public nursing homes. Others, like Sanya's
homeless, aren't even seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   A clean-cut, 65-year-old homeless man named Nakayama who was too
embarrassed to give his first name survives on food he scavenges
from the garbage. ``I go to the jobs center and I look on the
street for jobs, but I can't get any because of my age. I have a
dream of getting a job, but I don't think that dream will come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakayama, who owned his own construction company before it went
bankrupt several years ago, has been living for 2 1/2 years in a
plywood shack. Carefully stacked on shelves he built are bread
loaves from volunteers, fruit and books rescued from a Dumpster and
cheap cooking pots. His tiny area reeks of rotting garbage, but he
keeps it clean with scouring powder and steel wool.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other men here, Nakayama has no interest in the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party choice for the new prime minister, Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, because he can't see how it will affect his
life. ``Japanese politicians never do anything good for us, so I
don't care anymore,'' he said. ``Even with a new prime minister,
nothing will change.''

FOR TIM FLOYD, LOOKS ARE DECEIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The older man sat to the left of the dais, nodding his
approval as Tim Floyd gave his first United Center press
conference. Camera flashes lit the room like fireworks. There was
plenty of noise: turning notebook pages, clicking minirecorders,
and the constant murmur of a whispering crowd. And then you looked
at the older man, Don Haskins. He was watching and, most important,
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is a complex man, certainly. But if you could give themes
to humans as if they were feature films, the essence of Floyd's
story would be: how to trust what you hear over what you see.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins learned that lesson in 1977. While many have scoffed at
the idea of Floyd _ a career college coach _ taking over for Phil
Jackson as coach of the six-time NBA champion Bulls, Haskins coolly
leaned back at last week's press conference _ where Floyd was
introduced as the Bulls' director of basketball operations and,
assuming Jackson sticks to his retirement plans, next coach _ and
heard Floyd thank him for ``giving me a chance when I probably
wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year-old Floyd certainly wasn't ready to be teaching any
courses on legibility. He had just finished his career at Louisiana
Tech. He was looking for a job as a graduate assistant, so he wrote
the legendary Haskins at the University of Texas-El Paso. When he
was 12, Floyd's father told him that Haskins was someone to follow
if he ever wanted to know how to coach. Floyd wrote Haskins at
UTEP. Haskins saw the letter and nearly crumpled it so he could
dunk it in a trash can. The handwriting was terrible, so bad that
Haskins would say later he thought Floyd was a little, well, dim
intellectually. But the coach read what the young man had to say,
and it made sense. He also noticed that Tim Floyd was the son of
the late Lee Floyd, former coach at Southern Mississippi. A chance
was given. For the next nine seasons, UTEP basketball would not be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Trust what you hear over what you see. And not how you hear it,
either. Floyd has a thick accent, shaped by Hattiesburg, Miss., and
refined by Louisiana, Texas, Idaho, and Iowa. He may talk ball with
a drawl, but don't let his quirky dialect fool you. He knows his
subject. The Celtics know that better than most teams, many of them
skeptical of this 44-year-old man who is known to be a fishing
buddy of Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to evaluating college players and evaluating
them for the NBA, I find that he's one of the best guys to talk
to,'' Celtics general manager Chris Wallace said. ``He's always on
the mark when I ask him about players. I can't think of a time when
he hasn't come up with an accurate assessment of a guy. I think he
is a very bright person, and not just in the sense of basketball
and the strategic points of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his travels have something to do with that. Wallace calls
him a ``by-the-bootstraps guy.'' That's because Floyd quickly
became Haskins's top recruiter at a place where drawing local
talent is not always easy. ``Kids are not going to be in the local
barber shop talking about how they want to play at UTEP,'' Wallace
said. Floyd realized that, too. So he hit the road, tapping into
Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years of being Haskins's top man at UTEP _ Tim
Hardaway and Greg Foster passed through town while he was there _
Floyd moved on to Idaho for two seasons as head coach. And the
University of New Orleans after that.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it should be clear that Floyd never fell into the
path illuminated by television lights and automatic exposure. While
he was in New Orleans, word had traveled around campus that he was
looking for players. One day a lanky kid who had been packing
groceries showed up at his office. The name: Ervin Johnson. The
history (abridged version): He went from a novice at New Orleans to
a millionaire with the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year,'' Krause said of Floyd, ``I watched his team win
even though he didn't have a player over 6-5.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Floyd got to Iowa State, his reputation had grown
among college coaches. He was good, the new guy in Ames. How good?
They would find out later when his Iowa State Cyclones won the
school's first postseason tournament title. You know that the
Celtics wanted to hire Kansas coach Roy Williams when they thought
Rick Pitino wasn't interested in the job. What you may not know is
that many observers of the Big Eight and later the Big 12 thought
Floyd was the best coach in that league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Floyd and Haskins and Krause and Wallace all have to know
that the critics will have a ``but ...'' for this. Ames, Iowa, is
not Chicago. There's a big difference at shooting guard between
former Cyclone Fred Hoiberg and current Bull Michael Jordan _ who
has said he will play for no one other than Jackson. Floyd has been
annoyed with television and newspapers in Iowa; wait until he feels
the heat of two major dailies in Chicago, a couple of all-sports
radio stations, and a crowd of TV and radio outlets as well as
suburban publications. And, really, will Jordan play for him? If
not, Floyd may have to deal with a different theme in 1998-99: How
to replace a legend?
</P>
<P>
   ``If all their players don't come back, he's really not dealing
with the champion Chicago Bulls,'' Pitino said. ``If they don't
come back, he's like any other coach coming in to rebuild a
program. I know Tim Floyd and I respect him. He is a very good
judge of talent. He has to come in and carve his own niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Stern doesn't want to hear this, but there is a
chance Jordan liked what he heard about and/or from Floyd. Teams
are not supposed to communicate with their players during the
lockout, but Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf was seen leaving
Jordan's Chicago office the day before Floyd was hired. There's a
chance Reinsdorf spoke to Jordan about Floyd's positives and that
Jordan listened. Listening. A very important part of Floyd's next
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Kentucky, it was different because I was the
Knick coach going to Kentucky,'' Pitino said. ``This is the coach
at Iowa State coming to the Bulls. He has already done a good thing
by saying he didn't want to change that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was referring to Floyd's assertion that he would like to
employ the triangle offense. Defense? Not a problem. In a land of
88-79 NBA scores, Floyd will fit in. A Haskins disciple is always
taught defense first.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs from day one that some were willing to give
Floyd a chance. He was speaking late in his press conference when a
reporter identified herself as a proud Iowa Hawkeye, the antithesis
of an Iowa State Cyclone. Floyd said he wouldn't hold her alma
mater against her and then cracked, ``But I may have to speak a
little slower for you.'' Laughter all around. The older man was
chuckling, too. This was progress, because a room full of people
were simply responding to what they heard, not what they saw.

CHIEF GROWS MAINE BANK FAR FROM THE BIG CITY'S GLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big city doesn't do much for banker Bill Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has quietly built Peoples Heritage Financial Group into New
England's fourth-largest banking company, growing business in the
region's suburban and rural areas and striking very friendly merger
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples, based in Portland, Maine, has grown to become a big
fish in smaller New England banking ponds: Maine and New Hampshire.
When it hit Massachusetts two years ago, the point of entry was
Haverhill.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples made one of its biggest deals of all this month,
acquiring Springfield Institution for Savings for $428 million to
spread into Western Massachusetts. The acquisition will boost
Peoples's assets, just $4.3 billion at the end of 1996, to about
$12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done this well in that people view us as a bank
that cares about being a community bank,'' said Ryan, who left a
quickly deteriorating Bank of New England in 1989 to become the
heir apparent at Peoples.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make Peoples any threat to Fleet Financial Group or
BankBoston Corp. Even the $20 billion of assets at number three
Citizens Financial Group would cast a large shadow over the
company. But People's has managed to grow quickly in part by posing
as the hometown banking alternative in a lot of places.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples touts its community bank sensibilities as the big
competitive advantage in rural and small city markets. But it's
mergers that has given the company its real bulk. Before its deal
in Springfield, Peoples had bought CFX Corp. of Keene, N.H., for
$627 million in April. It acquired Maine's largest insurance agency
and another Portland bank last year. In 1996, it acquired Family
Bancorp in Haverhill and Bank of New Hampshire Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has been a persuasive buyer because he can pay in the hot
currency of Peoples stock and allows the sellers to keep their
institution's name and local presence. Better than that, top
executives keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception on the part of the borrower is that they are
doing business with a local bank,'' said analyst Tucker Anthony
analyst James Ackor, based in Portland, Maine. ``They've eaten
Fleet's and Keycorp's lunch up here because they are the local
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that local presence and executive employment means
Peoples can't cover takeover premiums by slashing so deeply into
the expenses of newly acquired banks. The typical cost savings in a
Peoples deal is targeted at 25 percent, well below reductions of up
to 40 percent or more in the most brutal consoldiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to consolidate back office operations but we always
leave the face-to-face customer people intact,'' said Ryan. Chief
executives almost always count as customer people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of optimum cost savings, Peoples pushes its ability to
quickly push more business through its newly acquired franchises.
Usually Peoples can add some services such as trust offerings,
business lending and third-party auto credit.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a risky propostion, pushing hard to increase business
in a hot economy. But Ryan insists the products and services being
pushed are low- or no-risk compared to the commercial real estate
loans that came crashing down around similar ``earn-out''
strategies in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said there are no blanket expectations for fast ``revenue
enhancements'' and did not dislose targets for individual banks he
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Peoples has estimated it can boost business in
Springfield by $2.3 million after taxes next year and by $4.7
million in 2000. The target at CFX is $5.1 million, after taxes,
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples may own a big piece of the northern New England banking
market today, but it was just another little struggling thrift in
the early 1990s. Peoples stock, which finished Thursday at 23 1/16,
traded as low as a split-adjusted 1 1/8 in the depths of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It recovered slowly and later got into other business lines. The
development of small business commercial lending helped diversify
business and commanded higher loan interest rates than consumer
products.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Peoples had a chance to expand aggressively throughout
the small cities and rural areas of the north because a larger and
more powerful bank that had been following exactly that strategy
did an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Keycorp of Albany, N.Y., took a big-bank tact and merged with
Society Corp. of Cleveland, where the combined institution is now
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he has no particular merger ambitions today, but few
people expect him to sit still. The best possible merger fits may
be one of two Vermont banks, Chittenden Corp. or BankNorth Group
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks are based in Burlington but have branches in central
Massachusetts, an area between Springfield and Haverhill that
Peoples would eventually need to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see him near Boston. Analysts, competitors and
Ryan himself agree the People's plan won't do nearly as well in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan insists he doesn't have any end-game plan in mind to sell
Peoples. But a moment later he leaves the door wide open to
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the strategy of community banking will still have a
niche in the near future,'' he said. ``But with all the
consoldiation in banking, only time will tell. If a giant bank from
somewhere consolidates the rest of New England, will there sitll be
a need for community banking. I think it's an unanswered
question.''

COLLONS NOT STARTING TO TAKE JOB FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ One of Pete Carroll's assets as a coach is
his ability to convince veterans like Ferric Collons that they're
in a dogfight for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they might not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want guys getting complacent and comfortable with
what's going on,'' said the Patriots coach. ``I wouldn't mind them
not knowing what's going on. What I'm pleased with is that we're
creating great competition. You see it everywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   He's getting it at receiver, where Vincent Brisby and Shawn
Jefferson are battling for the spot opposite Terry Glenn. He's
getting it further down on the receiver depth chart, where Anthony
Ladd, Tony Simmons, and Tony Gaiter are all battling for a spot.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting it at fullback, where Tony Carter, who had been on
the sidelines with a sprained left foot, came back to practice
because rookie Chris Floyd was looking so good on film.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting it at running back, where Sedrick Shaw and Robert
Edwards are battling for the No. 1 job and Harold Shaw is in a
fight with Derrick Cullors and Robert Green for work as the
third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting it at cornerback, where Tebucky Jones, Chris Canty,
and Mark Tate are all trying to put their best foot forward.
</P>
<P>
   He's also getting it at defensive tackle, where Chad Eaton is
battling Mark Wheeler and Henry Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   And now he says he's getting it at defensive end, where Boston
College's Chris Sullivan is battling Collons for the starting left
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferric is starting in this game (the exhibition opener at San
Francisco Sunday) and he comes into the camp as a starter having
lost out through injury,'' said Carroll. ``But Chris has worked
with the first unit a lot in the past couple of days. We'll let
that competition play out. Nobody likes somebody looking over their
shoulder and being right behind, and that's what Chris is doing
right now, so I hope it means we're seeing the best of both guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons understands this perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Sullivan stepped in last year and he played his ass
off,'' said Collons. ``That's put me in a tough position because
now you have basically two starters. I got hurt and I was gone. If
it didn't happen that way ... we could speculate a thousand times,
but it did. And you can't say there was a drop-off. In fact, they
played so well at the end of the year that I'm fighting for my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch, 300-pound Collons is the Patriots' biggest
starting lineman. On a team that lacks size up front, Collons is a
big presence who is considered an excellent run-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about things I can't control,'' said Collons, a
University of California product. ``I let the chips fall where they
fall. I don't think being a professional, you need anything to
motivate you. You just line up and play. That's motivation enough.
But there's definitely a competition. There's no two ways about it.
You have two guys who started for this team in the same season.
It's kind of a weird situation, but that's the way it went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons tore his left pectoral muscle in a freak accident during
drills following the Patriots' humiliating loss to the Denver
Broncos in 1997. He underwent surgery and was out for the season.
At first, the Patriots missed his run-stopping ability, but
Sullivan came on and filled a big void.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough break for Collons, who had signed a two-year deal
after the Patriots decided to match a two-year, $3 million offer
sheet by the Philadelphia Eagles when he was a restricted free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I signed that contract, it left my mind,'' said
Collons. ``I didn't think about it twice. All that concerns me is
the New England Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons left his offseason healing in the hands of team
physician Bert Zarins and trainer Ron O'Neil, even though his wife
is an orthopedic surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 100 percent,'' said Collons. ``Dr. Z and Ronnie O did a
great job briging me along slow and steady. We never really pushed
it. It was absolutely miserable during the healing process. Now I
don't even feel it. The only reminder is this scar on my
shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons didn't take part in the strength and conditioning
program two years ago because of family commitments. But he never
left Foxborough after his injury, knowing he not only needed to get
healthy but also stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give myself the best possible chance to play
football,'' said Collons. ``The rehab was an ongoing process. Now I
just want to stay healthy, compete, play first and second down ...
whatever it is I can do, I want to do it. That's the great thing
about our group _ we have a very eclectic group of guys on the
D-line. There's not a mold for this unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons
</P>
<P>
   moved around a lot early in his career. In 1995, he played for
four teams. He was signed by the Los Angeles Raiders as a rookie
free agent in 1992 and spent time on their practice squad. After
being released by LA, he was one of the first 10 players signed by
the Jacksonville Jaguars when they entered the NFL in '95, then was
claimed on waivers by the Atlanta Falcons, who in turn traded him
to Green Bay. The Packers traded him to New England April 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Collons doesn't want to be moving again, and the likelihood is
he won't be. Carroll just wants to light little fires in hopes
there'll be a big one at the end of the season.

AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTION: TWO SIDES OF A COIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 02, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, we consider automotive transportation sublime and
ridiculous, sublime as in the pricey Jaguar XK8 Convertible, an
automobile that offers style, luxury, performance _ and a touch of
the ridiculous if you think of it as family transport. For
ridiculous, consider the Kia Sportage, an alleged sport/utility
which at first glance would seem virtuous in that a well-equipped
4WD version is available for under $20,000, almost a budget car
these days. It may well be competent traversing a mudhole, but for
everyday driving, it's no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The XK8 is sublime revisited, and it hasn't changed since our
last visit in October 1997; it is still a vision of luxury with
leather and expensive wood inside, and this time around something
akin to plum coloring on the outside _ nice, I thought. But, then,
what do I know, being color-perception impaired?
</P>
<P>
   The radio controls still need work, the air conditioning still
accommodates those of us who like deep chill behind the wheel or
milder interior climes _ but both at once is pushing it. At a base
sticker of $70,480 delivered, I still think the buyer deserves a
top that disappears completely under a body panel rather than one
that, after a magnificent mechanical ballet, merely falls limp
behind the back seat like a dancer exhausted after the performance.
And, as far as this columnist is concerned, the stylish boot that
snaps in place over it can stay in the trunk _ or home in the
closet, if it were mine.
</P>
<P>
   The 290-horsepower V-8 offers very quick, quiet acceleration,
whisper-quiet touring at any speed, and the Jaguar's handling and
road manners equal or surpass in grace its elegant styling. Tooling
along at turnpike speeds, one may still hold a normal conversation
or listen to the radio. Mileage this time around was 19.73 miles
per gallon overall on an abbreviated tour. I would have kept it
longer had there been significant change _ so many cars, so little
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now for something completely different. That phrase, you may
recall, was a standard exclamation on televsion's ``Monty Python
Show.'' The Kia Sportage, I think, would have been right at home
with the Python posse.
</P>
<P>
   This was my third encounter with the Sportage, this after a
meeting with a platoon of Kia people assuring me that the car was
``much improved'' _ they said ``you'll love it.'' Love? This isn't
even close to ``like.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two encounters were at Pocono Raceway in the eastern
mountains of Pennsylvania under the auspices of the International
Motor Press Association and its annual test day at the track. On
the track, the Sportage was the pits; on the off-road course
provided, it wasn't much better. Since then, Kia has been fighting
to survive in bankruptcy and playing ``Lets Make a Deal'' with
customers _ you want a Kia, call the company and haggle. But why
would you want a Sportage when for less money you could have much
better, a Honda CR-V or a Toyota RAV4?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the interior of the tested model, a 4WD EX with
4-speed manual gearbox that lists for $18,495 plus $450 delivery,
was not exactly a welcome wagon. The emergency brake handle between
the front seats is partially blocked by an annoying sliding armrest
that covers a small bin. The radio controls are the worst thing
since the Hummer's, which was designed, I'm sure, in Hell.
Match-head-sized buttons, little rockers, all marked with quaint
codes, make tuning an aggravating chore.
</P>
<P>
   Once tuned, the FM snappedd, crackled, and popped persistently;
the AM simply faded out at every bridge, dip in the road, or overly
large tree.
</P>
<P>
   The 4WD tranfer case control lever is on the floor, close to
your leg _ not exactly convenient. Small glove box, door bins, coin
holder, and bin to the left of the wheel make up the front interior
storage.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear, entry is tight _ smallish door with large
wheel-well intrusion. Once aboard, you haven't much room for your
knees.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. On the road, the Sportage feels like a rollover
looking for a place to happen. The body leans, sways _ this may be
a safety feature. Maybe the Koreans did this to make us slow down
on the turns, to give us a physical warning of impending doom. And
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they really believe Americans use these things in the
boonies and designed a lot of travel into the suspension for
maximum benefit on the Rubicon Trail. And maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe _ my take on it _ it's an inferior car with a sloppy
suspension, sloppy handling. The nominal 2.0-liter, four-cylinder
engine (1.998 liters, to be exact) is somewhat anemic, given to
poor acceleration, a bit noisy. The five-speed manual was so-so,
and you had to work the poor thing to a frazzle to keep the engine
revving at a level where you might wrest anything like reasonable
performance from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kia starts as a four-door, 2WD model for around $15,000 and
offers eight variations in steps up to the 4WD EX with automatic
for around $20,000. Fuel mileage amounted to 20.3 miles per gallon,
but that's not based on protracted experience. I got out of Kia
rather quickly; I found it a thoroughly unlikable vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you must buy Korean, try Daewoo for reasonable transport at
reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   For what you get, KIa Sportage is overpriced. And, frankly, it's
not a car I'd want to see in the hands of new or inexperienced
drivers. Thumbs down!

SIMPLE FILLER STRIP WILL FIX WINDOW GAP

<P>
   Q. When I had a new window put in my bathroom to replace one
that was hopelessly sticky, I discovered the new sash is thinner
than the old, so there is a gap between the sash and the inside
sill when the window is closed. How can I fill it? The contractor
said he would weatherstrip the bottom of the sash for airtightness
and trim the sill to fit. Will that work?
</P>
<P>
   TOM O'NEAL, North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sure will, and the contractor should have done that
without being told. You could do it yourself, slipping in a narrow
piece of trim and nailing it to the sill. The window will be tight
and no one will know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You wrote about a windowless or portable air conditioner
recently, but I can't find any. I have looked at various places,
including Home Depot, which said it never heard of such an air
conditioner. Where can I find one and what brands are they?
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL CALLERS, from all over
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One brand of the portable air conditioner is Toshiba, quite
expensive (about $1,000), with a duct that must be inserted
outdoors. It and other brands are sold in appliance stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our house was built two years ago. The exterior is unpainted
gray/black/white/red brick. We have mud stains on the brick 18 to
24 inches from the ground. The builder has been of no help. How can
I get rid of those stains?
</P>
<P>
   GRACE REA, Greenfield, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The contractor could have at least suggested ways to remove
the stains and keep them from coming back. Obviously, the water
running off the roof is spilling onto the earth below and splashing
back up against the brick. So, try this: Scrub the mud stains with
a stiff bristle (not wire) brush and plenty of water. Or, have the
stains power-washed. If you can't find a power washing company, you
can rent a power washer at a rental store. A garden hose might be
strong enough to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that mud splashing in the future, dig a small trench 18
inches wide and 3 to 6 inches deep along the wall, and fill it with
crushed stone. You may get splashing, but it will be cleaner water,
and a lot less splashing because of the softness of the stone.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique is to install a concrete apron along the wall,
18 inches deep and 6 inches thick, slightly sloped for drainage.
The depth of the trench or the apron depends on how wide your roof
overhang is. If the roof overhang is 18 inches, then make the
trench or apron at least 24 to 30 inches deep; by deep I mean from
the wall outward.
</P>
<P>
   Plant foundation plantings around the house, but not under the
drip line.
</P>
<P>
   Since you are getting those mud stains, you may not have gutters
on the house. While I do not like gutters in most cases, gutters on
your house might help prevent water cascading over the roof edge
from falling on the ground below and causing the stains. If
possible, avoid gutters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We were told by the builder to put a sealer on our beautiful
new deck. We did, and a painter suggested putting on a second coat,
which we did. It was a mistake. The second sealer did not
penetrate, and we had a sticky mess. We were told to use a sealer
remover to take everything off, but now it is a patchy, sticky
mess. What can we do?
</P>
<P>
   ROSEMARY RAGSDALE, Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yep, it'll happen every time: Two coats of a sealer will
result in a sticky mess, just as a coat of linseed oil left on
without wiping off will stay sticky forever. Obviously, the painter
who suggested a second coat was wrong. The sealer remover (whatever
that is!) also didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   What to do, what to do? Remove everything with chemical paint
remover, either the methylene chloride remover such as Stripeeze,
or 5F5, or a citrus-based remover such as Citristrip. The Stripeeze
or 5F5 may do a better job, but I think, in case of the sealer, the
Citristrip will be effective and safer to use.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is sanding, which is OK if the deck floor is not
pressure-treated boards.
</P>
<P>
   With everything off, you could leave the deck alone, if it is of
pressure-treated wood. Or, pressure-treated or not, apply one coat
of sealer; it will have to be renewed every year or two. Sealers
are way over-touted; sellers of such sealers never say you have to
renew every year or two; another maintenance job.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, in my opinion, apply one coat of semitransparent
stain. This will give good color (of your choice) for two to five
years. When it begins to wear off, apply another coat, but if the
second coat tends to bead up or not penetrate, stop, and wait for
the first coat to wear off more.
</P>
<P>
   Do not use paint or a solid-color stain, or a so-called deck
stain. The latter is new on the market, with great claims and
promises, but it, too, does not work because it will peel.
Semitransparent will not peel.

BALANCE IMPORTANT IN BUILDING FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 02, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You recently recommend a portfolio of three bond funds --
Vanguard Short-Term Bond, Vanguard GNMA, and Vanguard High-Yield
Corporate Bond funds, estimating an annual yield of about 7.1
percent. What are your thoughts about replacing the Short-Term Bond
fund in this portfolio with Vanguard's Long-Term Treasury of
perhaps Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury funds? Based on some of
my old Vanguard information, these funds have higher average annual
total returns than the Short-Term fund. This year I will be 69 and
my wife 67. Our portfolio at this point is entirely within the
Vanguard family, consisting of $596,341, of which $362,642 is in
fixed-income funds and the balance spread between Windsor II and
Primecap As you know, those two stock funds have not kept pace
lately. Should we make a change?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Atlantic Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The selection of the fixed-income portfolios in the previous
column was designed with as much regard to risk as yield. The idea
was to balance the high-risk Vanguard High-Yield Bond fund with the
conservative Vanguard Short-Term Bond fund. Certainly you could get
a higher-yield by eliminating the conservative Short-Term Bond fund
in favor of a bolder fund, but the at this point you can't do it
with one of Vanguard's Treasury funds -- all of them now have lower
yields than the Short-Term fund. The Short-Term fund has a 30-day
yield of 5.93 percent as this is written, according to Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   The best-yielding of the Treasury funds is 5.64 percent for the
Long-Term U.S. Treasury fund, and the others spiral downward. You
could look to Vanguard's Long-Term Corporate Bond fund, with a
yield of 6.31 percent, or to its Long-Term Bond Index, with a 6.07
percent yield, but neither produces a very significant margin of
improved yield.
</P>
<P>
   But when you go from a short-term fund to a long-term one, you
add a significant amount of risk. To demonstrate this, I'll go back
to 1994, the current benchmark as a headache year for bond fund
owners. That year Vanguard's Short-Term Bond fund had a negative
total return of .08 percent; Vanguard Intermediate-Term U.S.
Treasury fund lost 4.33 percent, and the Long-Term U. S. Treasury
lost 7.04 percent. See why I wanted the conservative end of the
portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Now, the market usually compensates investors in long-term bonds
handsomely, providing a significantly higher yield. But I don't
think the current difference in yields is sufficient to warrant the
risk -- you get 38 basis points higher yield for holding the Long-
Term Corporate fund's portfolio of 20-year maturity bonds, compared
to an average weighted maturity of one to three years for the
Short-Term fund.
</P>
<P>
   So my feeling is that if you wanted to sweeten the yield on the
portfolio I suggested, you could do it better by reducing the
Short-Term position and adding to either the GNMA or High-Yield
Corporate holdings, depending on how much you're willing to crank
up the risk. But remember the basic adage: when you go for higher
yield, higher risk is going to come along with the package.
</P>
<P>
   As for your own portfolio, I calculate 60.8 percent is in
fixed-income holdings, which means you are holding a little bit
more stock than most people your age chose to. But I think you're
being a little unfair to the Windsor II fund. Perhaps you're not
taking the nature of the beast into consideration. This is a
value-oriented fund, and while it hasn't come anywhere near beating
the growth-oriented funds in the current bull market, it's still
near the head of the class among its peers, and has done very
nicely on any basis. So far this year its 13.3 percent total return
puts it in the top quartile of its peer group, where the average
return was 8.8 percent. Over a longer term, Windsor II's three-year
average annual total return of 28.9 percent compares to a 22.7
percent peer-group average.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Primecap hasn't done particularly well, even
among its large-cap blend peers. Its 11.9 percent year-to-date
total return of 11.9 percent compares to a peer average of 16.2
percent, and the three-year record also trails the average, 23.7
percent to 25.7 percent. You might decide to move some of this
money to Vanguard's Index 500 fund, and perhaps, depending on how
happy you are with the current market and how content you are to
have nearly 41 percent of your money in stocks, moving a little of
the Primecap money onto the fixed-income side, perhaps reducing
stocks to 35 percent of the total portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to invest $1,000 for my grandchild for his education
or to help him when he is 21 years old. I just received a package
from the Stein Roe Young Investors Fund, and I am thinking of
investing $1,000 there. I also plan to invest a further $1,000 in a
conservative fund. Is Stein Roe Young Investor a good fund, and
where should I put the other $1,000? My grandchild is one year old.
</P>
<P>
   H.A., Ramona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Stein Roe Young Investor's fund is an excellent offering,
building a top-flight record in less than five years of existence.
True, it's a growth fund, and accordingly it offers a portfolio
that will be vulnerable to market reversals. But whether your
grandchild uses the money for education in about 17 years or waits
until he's 21 years old, this is a long-term investment, and during
those many years the market's gains should far outweigh the
inevitable market corrections.
</P>
<P>
   A second plus for this fund, as you probably know from the
information they sent you, is that it caters its portfolio to
companies that can be readily understood by youngsters, and in
addition to the boilerplate reports required by the SEC, it also
sends admirable reports designed to be read and understood by
investors of tender years. And although the fund normally has a
$2,500 minimum initial investment, it is reduced to $1,000 for
uniform gift to minors accounts.
</P>
<P>
   My first instinct was to suggest you stick the entire $2,000 in
this fund -- figuring that the long investment time period should
outweigh the risk. But if you're convinced you want another
offering with a less aggressive approach, I suggest Vanguard's
Balanced Index fund, which holds 60 percent of its assets in stocks
and the rest in bonds. If you wanted to simplify paperwork by
operating within a single fund family, you could look at Stein
Roe's Balanced and Asset Allocation funds -- but when you're
looking you'll probably notice that the Vanguard offering has
significantly better returns and thus should be worth the extra
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd still rather see you put the entire $2,000 in Stein Roe
Young Investors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an elderly relative in a nursing home and I have his
power of attorney. His cash has run out, and we are now selling his
home and expect to receive about $365,000 from the sale. My
question is this: how best to invest this money to maximize income
with minimum risk? What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   P.J., Rockport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My first instinct was to suggest the kind of investment
portfolio I usually urge for people needing a steady income stream
-- dominated by a steady Ginnie Mae fund.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. Ginnie Mae funds work best for
people who are in for the long ride, and whose withdrawals will be
more or less in line with the actual yield of the fund. In the case
of your elderly relative, his money is probably going to run out at
some point between seven and eight years from now -- no matter what
you do. Moreover, since his withdrawals would represent more than
twice the actual yield, an investment in such a fund would put him
prey to the bumpy near-term market course that's common among such
funds. Finally, since the sequence of withdrawals will be so
substantial, in the long run the question of one conservative
investment over another is fairly unimportant. For that reason, I
suggest you put $100,000 of the money in a five-year CD, on which
the best rates are currently running at slightly better than 6.30
percent, and the balance in a sequence of shorter CDs, putting
about $130,000 in a two-year CD, on which the best yields are in
excess of 6 percent, $60,000 in a one-year CD, $30,000 in a
six-month CD, and the final $30,000 in a mutual fund money market
account. (Don't use a bank money market account, which usually
yields about half of what mutual fund money markets offer.) It's
not a particularly sexy portfolio, but it's one you won't have to
worry about, and there's no way you can invest this money
conservatively that will make a great deal of difference.

A `WAR' ON DRUGS, BUT ONLY A MURMUR ON BOOZE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HILARY ABRAMSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After football star Don Rogers and college
basketball sensation Len Bias died within a week of each other a
decade ago from cocaine overdoses, the president of the United
States declared ``war'' on illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Later Congress OK'd an unprecedented taxpayer-funded advertising
campaign to discourage minors from using pot, smack, crack and
other illegal drugs through a $1 billion, five-year media blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, in the wake of seven publicized college
binge-drinking deaths last year, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala didn't declare war on booze. Instead, she
asked the governing board of college athletics to adopt voluntary
restrictions on college alcohol advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To public health advocates, it's just politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol industry political action committees have already given
members of Congress $1 million in the past (off-election) year. It
is hardly a surprise that alcohol will receive mere public service
announcement status in the illegal drug media campaign, although
alcohol is more dangerous and costly to society than illegal drugs:
Every day, on average, 11,318 American young people (12 to 20 years
of age) try alcohol for the first time, 6,488 try marijuana for the
first time, 2,786 try cocaine for the first time and 386 try heroin
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is a factor in three leading causes of death for those
15 to 24 years old. Two to three times as many teen-agers and young
adults die in alcohol-related traffic crashes as they do from
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   While 2 percent of high school students used heroin last year,
31 percent of 12th-graders admitted to having been intoxicated one
or more times in the month before the annual University of Michigan
``Monitoring the Future'' study. Binge drinking (consuming five or
more drinks in a row) was reported by 31.3 percent of high school
seniors, 25.1 percent of 10th-graders, and 14.5 percent of
eighth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal drugs kill about 14,000 people a year at an annual cost
to taxpayers of about $70 billion. Three-quarters of the expense is
related to crime and law enforcement; one-quarter is
health-related.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol kills about 100,000 people annually at a cost to
taxpayers of about $99 billion a year. Eighty percent of this cost
is health-related. Nearly 2,000 Americans were killed by teen-age
drunken drivers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership for a Drug-Free America is the advertising
agency group that originally took Big Tobacco and Big Booze money
and failed to produce one ad to discourage children from smoking or
drinking. It is a partner in producing free anti-drug ads scheduled
for prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign architects contend they have negotiated with stations
to broadcast public service announcements against underage
drinking. But bets are off on how many will appear in prime time
with the showbiz production quality of the illegal drug ads.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress had to fund this experiment, it should have centered
on kids' first drug of choice _ alcohol _ and been based on
research. Demonizing the illegal drugs and glamorizing the legal
drug is wasting taxpayer money. What good do a few public service
announcements do when shown against a backdrop of beer ads
celebrating the wonders of alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   In one year, the beer industry spends three times more on TV
advertising than the White House drug policy coordinator, Barry
McCaffrey, has to spend on all media.
</P>
<P>
   Social marketing can work, but research shows that a media
campaign should tie in with community-based activities. This one
doesn't (and the federal government has cut its support of local
prevention work). At the core of the drug-war campaign are parents
talking to kids about drugs. That may feel good, but research
doesn't support it as a successful prevention strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCaffrey kicked off the test phase of the campaign
in Denver by saying, ``The most dangerous person in the United
States is a 12-year-old smoking marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   It hardly helps to learn from a recent Adweek interview that he
is basing this taxpayer gamble on his ``gut feeling'' that
advertising works _ because it worked for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;

inflation and an abundance of jobs, helped offset fallout from the
Asian crisis and the GM strike. Gross domestic product expanded at

quarter's pace of 5.5 percent, it was considerably above the gain
of only 0.2 percent expected by analysts. Consumer spending rose at
a 5.8 percent annual rate. Industrial production stalled, though,

percent. By Richard W. Stevenson.

alive the process is of sorting out Europe's aviation and defense
industries. By John Tagliabue.

<HEADLINE>
SAN FRANCISCO BLUES FEST STILL WAILING AFTER 26 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first San Francisco Blues Festival was held
in 1973 in a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Fuller was a headliner, along with Charlie Musselwhite,
Jimmy McCracklin, Luther Tucker and L.C. ``Good Rockin''' Robinson.
This September the festival will celebrate its 26th time around,
each new program put together by producer Tom Mazzolini in a dream
of strum and holler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, thousands of people showed up. Thousands,''
Mazzolini said. ``We had to put speakers up outside. It was
absolutely chaotic, but two things came into focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, that all the blues musicians in the Bay Area were ready
for something like this, and second, the response for the festival
was overwhelming. ... We could definitely do No.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did I know that years later we would be at No. 26,''
said Mazzolini, putting the final touches on this year's festival,
to be held at the Great Meadow at Fort Mason Sept. 19-20.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 version will be headlined by the Robert Cray Band;
Mavis Staples; Taj Mahal; Ramblin' Jack Elliott; the trio of Irma
Thomas, Marcia Ball and Tracy Nelson; and, coming full circle, the
Jimmy McCracklin Revue.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also will boast Shana Morrison, daughter of Van
Morrison; Sugar Pie DeSanto, who has shared top billing with Etta
James; Roy Rogers and the Delta Rhythm Kings; the Fedora Blues
Allstars; local blues kingpin Tommy Castro; Magic Slim and the
Teardrops; and Steve Lucky and the Rhumba Bums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each festival has its own unique quality,'' Mazzolini said.
``You never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzolini is looking forward to seeing Morrison, Rogers and
Ramblin' Jack this year, along with the Nelson, Bell, Thomas trio
belting out tunes from the CD, ``Sing It!'' He expects close to a
full house, but even after a quarter of a century, Mazzolini isn't
sure what kind of blues will draw what kind of crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always up to the gods,'' he said. ``The high-water mark
for us was in 1991, with B.B. King. We sold out in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   A sell-out at Great Meadow is 9,000 tickets, and if the
weather's fine _ as it has been more often than not _ the Blues
Festival could make a run at a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzolini will have a better idea of what kind of response to
expect when the Charmaine Neville Band plays at the annual free
kickoff concert on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for Sept. 19 includes acoustic blues artist Barbara
Dane, the Fedora Blues Allstars, the Jimmy McCracklin Revue with
DeSanto and Jesse James, the Mississippi Delta Blues Caravan, the
Steel Guitar Explosion with Sonny Rhodes and Freddie Roulette,
Little Charlie and the Nightcats, Staples and the Robert Cray Band.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will see the True Spirit Gospel Singers; the Elmer Lee
Thomas Blues Revue; Lucky and the Rhumba Bums; the Delta Rhythm
Kings with Rogers, Elliott, Morrison and Tom Rigney; Wolfman
Washington and the Roadmasters; Magic Slim; Castro; the
Thomas-Ball-Nelson trio; and Taj Mahal and the Phantom Blues Band.
</P>
<P>
   One-day tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door. A $35
two-day pass is available only in advance. Tickets are on sale
without service charge at Streetlight Records in San Francisco,
Down Home Music in El Cerrito and Village Music in Mill Valley.
They can be purchased with reduced service charges through BASS
tickets at Tower or Wherehouse stores or by calling (415) 979-BASS,
(510) 762-BASS, (408) 998-BASS or 1-800-225-BASS out of state.
Tickets can also be purchased on-line at www.ticketweb.com.

BERKELEY MUSEUM EXHIBIT OF BLACK ARTISTS' WORK IS WORTH NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ If the Berkeley Art Museum were showing work
by two white males, it would not be particularly noteworthy;
indeed, it would be normal. Until recent years, white males have
dominated the schedules of even the most progressive and inclusive
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the Berkeley Art Museum, a part of the
University of California, is showing simultaneously two female
African-American artists _ Carrie Mae Weems and Faith Ringgold _ is
worth notice, especially in light of the recent change in admission
policies forced upon the university by the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the admission of African-American freshmen has
plummeted as a result of the end of affirmative action programs, it
is ironic that the university's museum is showing two
African-American artists purely on the basis of their merit as
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ringgold (born in 1930) and Weems (born in 1953) are artists of
two different generations with correspondingly different ideas
about artmaking. Both, however, address the African-American
experience from their position as women, and both root their
primarily visual work in storytelling. In their work, texts and
images are equally important, but how they put image and text
together distinguishes them.
</P>
<P>
   Weems, who attended the University of California at Berkeley and
later lived in Oakland, has shown in the San Francisco area
frequently. A major touring Weems retrospective appeared at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1993. Her socially concerned,
photo-based work is marked by intelligent analysis and fierceness
of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ritual &AMP; Revolution,'' a sound and image installation, was
originally made for the 1998 Dakar Biennial in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   It appears through Sept. 27 as part of Berkeley Art Museum's
MATRIX series, and it finds Weems in a lyrical and meditative mode.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven diaphanous cloth banners, on each of which is printed a
sepia-toned photograph, hang close together. You walk among them.
The entry is framed by two images of a Greek colonnade. Between
them, recessed, Weems herself appears garbed a la Isadora Duncan in
a Greek tunic; behind her, on either side, hang mirror images of a
Greek sculpture of a headless woman wearing a similar robe.
</P>
<P>
   Next are images of nature _ the sea on the left and a formal
park with trees planted in rows to the right. Following are images
of Ryoan-ji, the classic Zen rock and gravel garden in Kyoto; the
decaying white-washed fortress in Dakar from which slaves were
taken to the New World; Hopi Indian women and, finally, a crowd of
blacks being hosed-down in a demonstration, the image's dramatic
chiaroscuro reminiscent of baroque painting.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the images address ideas of nature and culture, how
culture shapes nature, how, over long period of time, distinctive
cultures have emerged in different parts of the world and how
political injustice exists along with beauty.
</P>
<P>
   While you look, you hear a poem recited in both French and
English. A lament for the failed revolutions of the past 200 years,
it can be seen as an answer to Yeats' ``The Second Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at the Louvre: Faith Ringgold's French Collection and
Other Story Quilts,'' an exhibition with a lengthy touring schedule
organized by New York City's New Museum, continues at the Berkeley
Art Museum through Aug. 30. In it, Ringgold attempts to rewrite
history, inserting African Americans, especially women, into
situations where they might not have fit so comfortably at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   For Ringgold, '20s Paris was the Eden where racism was not quite
so virulent and social situations possessed a degree of fluidity
that allowed room for her kind. She uses the City of Light as the
site for her idealized reconstruction of cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Ringgold uses the quilt as her medium, and by making it
narrative through both image and text, she created a genre she
calls the ``story-quilt.'' An arts activist in the '60s and '70s,
Ringgold made politically charged paintings and effigy-like dolls
earlier in her career, but with her adoption of the story-quilt,
she came into her own.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 quilts of ``The French Collection'' _ nine are on view at
Berkeley _ tell the story of Willia Marie Simone, who in 1920 at
age 16 sailed to Paris to pursue a career as artist. As a model,
she posed for both Picasso and Matisse, and she was a member of
Gertrude Stein's literary and artistic salon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Ringgold's mother, who designed clothes for Harlem's
privileged set, Willia Marie is a charming naif. But she comes with
a healthy dollop of wish fulfillment. In reality, Ringgold's mother
went to Paris only in her later years, accompanied by her daughter
and granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   As charming as the story-quilts initially seem, their texts,
which appear somewhat illegibly on strips of cloth incorporated
into the quilt, offer a counter-narrative. Ringgold's words often
possess an anger contrary to her imagery. In her works, there is a
war going on that never quite gets resolved.

`SESAME STREET' EXHIBITION INCLUDES WORKS BY CELEBRITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A traveling ``Sesame Street'' art exhibition,
now in San Francisco, features contributions from various
celebrities detailing what the long-runing educational program has
meant to them.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa Sherman-Cohen, publicist for the Children's Television
Workshop, admits that there are certain advantages to getting
celebrities to contribute to a ``Sesame Street'' celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, who doesn't like `Sesame Street'?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the program celebrates its 30th year on public television,
people were asked to donate a little something for a traveling
tribute, which will culminate in New York next spring with an
auction to benefit three charities: the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation, Reading is Fundamental and the National Black
Child Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, people starting sending in paintings,
collages, sculptures and just about everything else. The exhibit
runs through Aug. 16 at the International Children's Art Museum at
the World Trade Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making contributions were singer Carly Simon, actor
Dennis Franz, talk show hostesses Katie Couric, Rosie O'Donnell and
Sally Jessy Raphael, musicians Wynton Marsalis and Mary Chapin
Carpenter, and former first lady Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sent in a drawing of herself reading her book about her dog
to a group of children as Big Bird and a giant furry purple
creature looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the efforts were more professional than others, but all
seemed to come from the heart. Simon sent a detailed oil painting
of a piece of fruit with the caption ``P is for Pear.'' Comedienne
Ruth Buzzi's painting of various ``Sesame Street'' characters
lazing beneath a tree showed some real art training, while Franz's
cartoon self-portrait with letters floating through his brain was
charming, though he should clearly not consider a change of
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the contributors seemed a bit old to have their own
personal Sesame experiences, except through their childrens' eyes.
But two of the people at the museum Thursday fit the perfect
demographic.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's Educational Director, Julie Wolfe, 30, said,
```Sesame Street' made me feel special. I loved it when the number
of the day was my age or the letter was in my name. And I loved
Grover.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jana Johnson, who is traveling with the exhibit, is 29. But
her tale is a bit sadder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents never let me watch television before dinner,'' she
said, maintaining a professional smile despite the obvious pain
inflicted upon her inner child. ``I do feel a bit neglected.''

   TECH-LOBBYING _ WASHINGTON _ Last fall, the high-tech industry
lost a legislative skirmish in its multi-year battle with the FBI
and U.S. spy agencies over who will control encryption of messages
on the Internet. Scared and enraged by a loss that threatened the
growth of their industry's profits, high-tech rivals stopped
dissing each other long enough to chip in more than $5 million to
form a lobbying coaltion called Americans for Computer Privacy and
convince a lot of their customers, suppliers and sympathizers to
sign up. Launched in March, the $5 million lobbying alliance of
more than 90 companies and 40 associations already has won some
early rounds in its fight against the FBI and U.S. spy agencies. A

   MEXICO-ELECTIONS _ OAXACA, Mexico _ Mexico continues to test its
transition to peaceful and pluralistic elections this Sunday, Aug.
2. Jubilant from its first gubernatorial victory in Zacatecas state
in July, Mexico's left-center Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) has another strong candidate running in Oaxaca state on Aug.
2. In many ways, Oaxaca's election is more meaningful for the PRD
than Zacatecas': In Zacatecas, the PRD's candidate was a recent
convert from the dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party (the
PRI), who took votes with him because he was popular. In Oaxaca,
the PRD's Hector Sanchez is a true party man, and a popular
grass-roots activist who speaks Zapotec, an Indian language, and
whose political experience includes fighting for peasant and Indian
rights. His victory -- or even a close second place showing_ would
represent an electoral break through for Mexico's Indian and left
activists, who are often targets of assassination attempts and
arbitrary arrests in this impoverished, politically violent state.
On Aug. 2, governors will also be chosen in the Mexican states of
Aguascalientes and Veracruz. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-CADET _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The first woman ever

Point, she has tales to tell of difficult days ina mostly-male
dominion. But Lyudmilla Yolshina is alone, a female class of one in

he has been dictatorial and let his country languish in an economic
recession, Jordainians breathed a sigh of relief to see him
apparently in control of his recently found lymphoma cancer. ``This
is not the time for the king to be sick, you know,'' said car parts
retalier George Naber, after watching the King on television
Tuesday nigh. ``The situation in this country is very bad. He is
the only one who can control everything.'' The King's illness calls
into question the future of a small country that plays a huge role
in protecting the stability of the Middle East. (Kaplow, Cox News

IT'S SHOWTIME, AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This weekend is Showtime's coming out party.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the network has been in business for years but if you
wanted to pick a time when it really tried to define itself, you
couldn't pick two better days than Saturday and Sunday. That's when
Showtime begins to not only give HBO a run for its
original-programming money, but the networks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Showtime unveils two new sitcoms in ``Linc's,'' which
looks at all aspects of the African-American experience, and ``Rude
Awakenings,'' which destroys the notion of safe, predictable
premises for comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday the channel airs the controversial ``Lolita.''
While airing ``Lolita'' is really business as usual for Showtime,
the two sitcoms represent an expanding line up of original drama
and comedy series. There are some flaws in each of the two shows,
but they shine brightly in a field of bland, unoriginal network
programming that is about to assault television sets in September.
</P>
<P>
   When Tim Reid was asked why the networks couldn't make a sitcom
like ``Linc's,'' he just started laughing. It really is that
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   First, cable doesn't hesitate to break new ground or do
something edgy or different. In ``Linc's'' (check local listings)
Showtime found a sitcom _ some might say dramedy _ with an
African-American cast that doesn't need a laugh track and doesn't
go over that tired, stereotypical ground that forces all
African-American comedies to look and sound the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linc's'' breaks out of that box by being political, harsh,
funny and touching all at the same time. Reid, who created the
short-lived but acclaimed ``Frank's Place'' and also starred years
ago in ``WKRP In Cincinnati,'' is executive producer and co-creator
along with Susan Fales-Hill (``A Different World''), two of the
more powerful African-American producers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly had a plan. That a black show didn't have to be any
different than a white show as far as content, and the limitations
of comedies would have to be smashed. Thus we get Steven Williams
(``The X-Files'') as Linc, owner of a bar in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Russell Lincoln _ and Republican as Abraham,'' says
Williams in the one-hour pilot. He opens the show by walking around
the Capitol, commenting. ``Washington, D.C. _ a city laid out by a
black mathematician now run by a black ex-con.''
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``You can always tell when white folks are moving
into the neighborhood when a Starbucks opens up.''
</P>
<P>
   People have tried to paint this show as a black ``Cheers,'' but
it isn't. ``Linc's'' is much more political and socially charged,
less interested in the quick one-liner. Regulars at Linc's bar and
grill include Pam Grier as Eleanor, a children's rights activist
who is as liberal as Linc is Republican. Grier, who has started her
red-hot comeback, is wonderful in this series. She gets to go
toe-to-toe with Georg Sanford Brown as Johnnie, another lobbyist
who has few morals and calls her ``juggs for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Other regulars are Tisha Campbell as Rosalee, Linc's military
daughter leaning toward lesbianism; Joe Inscoe, the lone white
actor who plays Harlan, chief of staff for a leathery old senator
and longtime supporter of Linc's bar; Golden Brooks as CeCe the
sassy waitress; Eartha, the aging call girl; and Winston, the
sex-starved Nigerian cab driver who also knows all the political
dirt on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a show that is clearly in the dramedy category since real
issues are dissected with a sometimes humorous bent.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rude Awakenings'' (check local listings), creator Claudia
Lonow didn't laugh when asked why the networks didn't gobble this
gem up. The real joke is that they were interested in the concept,
just not the script as it was, and certainly not in the version
that Showtime ultimately made. Talk about groundbreaking and
envelope pushing. Lonow says flat out this is a show about an
alcoholic slut trying to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Fox would touch that concept. But on ``Showtime'' it's
hilariously good and very adult _ and that's the targeted audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sherilyn Fenn plays Billie Frank, a fading soap star given over
to Irish coffees light on the coffee. Whenever she hits the local
bar, she usually drags somebody back with her. Now she's a
secretary, and her boss _ Richard Lewis _ disdains her drinking but
lusts after her. When she hangs out with her mom, played by Lynn
Redgrave, she can see herself in the future. Redgrave plays her mom
as a functional alcoholic who has a haughty manner and a wicked
tongue (she calls her daughter-in-law ``the vagina'' throughout the
show).
</P>
<P>
   Credit Fenn with pulling off this high-wire act. She's both
funny and sad at the same time, an enormously difficult emotional
trick that the networks wouldn't try in 10 million years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Awakenings'' manages to be raunchy, funny and even
slightly touching.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is truly blossoming as a pay cable outlet, and it
proves it's more than a worthy rival for HBO. What this weekend's
coming-out party suggests is that discerning viewers searching for
originality and quality just may have to pay to get it these days.

RESTORED `CABIRIA' SHOWS FELLINI AT HIS EARLY BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nights of Cabiria,'' Federico Fellini's 1957 Oscar winner, is
the latest classic movie to receive a careful and extensive
restoration and re-release, part of a very pleasing recent trend in
the movie business that's brought us vastly improved prints of
pictures like ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of the golden age of ``art cinema,'' ``Cabiria''
was the culmination of Fellini's realist period, which included the
extraordinary pictures ``I Vitelloni'' and ``La Strada'' (also an
Academy Award winner). By the time he made his next movie, ``La
Dolce Vita'' (1960), he was internationally famed and working with
higher budgets, and his interests had veered toward the
autobiographical and fantastical.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in 1993 he made other remarkable movies, but
``Cabiria'' represents the director in top early form.
</P>
<P>
   The film was the second of three major pictures Fellini made
starring his wife, Giulietta Masina. (She was also the victimized
waif in ``La Strada'' and the abandoned housewife of ``Juliet of
the Spirits.'')
</P>
<P>
   Masina had a wondrously expressive face and a comedic talent
that earned her comparisons to Chaplin. Fellini wrote that she had
``a gift for evoking a kind of waking dream quite spontaneously, as
if it were taking place quite outside her own consciousness. With
her clown-like gift for mimicry, she embodies in our relationship
my nostalgia for innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabiria (Masina) is a Roman prostitute whose hope for a better
life is doomed because of her naivete. As the film opens, she is
humiliated when her ``boyfriend'' grabs her purse and pushes her
into the river. This shouldn't be funny, but Cabiria's innocent and
romantic nature, combined with her bantam's anger at being duped,
makes it a superb comic sequence, summing up Cabiria's nature:
She's a bit ridiculous, maybe, but still a suffering human being.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she decides to try her luck on the ritzy Via Veneto,
though she's completely out of place with her ratty fake fur jacket
and ankle socks. She's picked up by a famous movie star (Amedeo
Nazzari) who's had a fight with his girlfriend and taken to his
absurdly extravagant mansion, only to wind up locked in the
bathroom for the night. She joins a group of prostitutes and pimps
for a pilgrimage to a religious shrine, but finds no relief there,
either.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes for Cabiria until she meets Oscar (Francois Perier),
a young man who speaks to her kindly and asks nothing about her
past. She cashes in her bank account, says goodbye to her friend
and fellow streetwalker Wanda (Franca Marzi), and sets out to join
Oscar to celebrate their engagement.
</P>
<P>
   She's giddy, imagining her luck has finally changed. It hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, ``Cabiria'' was available only in extremely poor
prints. The restored version is a pleasure to look at, and is
greatly enhanced with newly and more accurately translated
subtitles. Some of the script, incidentally, was written by Pier
Paolo Pasolini, at the time known only as a poet and novelist, who
was hired to make the prostitutes' dialogue more authentically
gritty.
</P>
<P>
   The restorers are also proud of having found and included a
``missing'' sequence (known as the Man with the Sack episode) about
a mysterious figure who dispenses charity, and which was rumored to
have been cut from the film because it offended the Roman Catholic
Church.

`MARIUS' A WARM TALE OF WORKING-CLASS LIFE AND LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A warm-hearted and humane examination of love between a pair of
mature, working-class adults, ``Marius and Jeannette'' tells a
simple story with both good humor and somber overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the romantic tale, director Robert Guediguian recounts
the life of a neighborhood, a congested section of Marseille where
the inhabitants still talk to each other and share a sense of
community. The filmmaker's other pictures have been set in the same
city, and he clearly relishes the milieu and its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette (Ariane Ascaride) is struggling to raise a pair of
children from two different, absent fathers. Her fiery temper and
anti-capitalist views soon cost her her job at a supermarket.
Marius (Gerard Meylan) is a quiet, burly man who works as a guard
at an abandoned cement factory, where he catches Jeannette trying
to steal a few buckets of paint to freshen up her rundown
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Tough times have made Jeannette a pretty brassy woman. When
Marius decides to give her a break and not call the police, she
tries to badger him into letting her have the paint anyway. No
sale, but she's obviously made an impression. If the trepidations
and inertia of middle-age can be overcome, these two could be
headed for something nice.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somewhere else this would be Marius and Jeannette's
concern and nobody else's, but in the courtyard where her neighbors
meet, argue and chat, it's everybody's business. Marius eventually
moves in with Jeannette, then abruptly disappears. The neighbors _
her friends, really _ believe it's their duty to reunite the couple
if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Jeannette's quarter is hard, but has its compensations _
companionship and a shared, generally leftist viewpoint. A laborer
(Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is endlessly upbraided by his wife for
having once voted for the right-wing National Front. A retired
teacher (Jacques Boudet) starts a liaison with a single woman
(Pascale Roberts) of a certain age after a row over fava beans.
There's a camaraderie of griping, like that of military lifers.
</P>
<P>
   Guediguian has a sentimental streak and takes no pains to hide
it, but the tone is offset to a degree by the acerbic notes in the
fine performance of Ascaride (his wife, who has appeared in all his
films). As Jeannette, she shows the kind of toughness women develop
working alone to feed and clothe their children, and uses it to
give spine to the role.
</P>
<P>
   Ascaride has extensive film and television credits in France,
and her work here earned her a Cesar award _ the French Oscar _ for
best actress.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker tells his story in a manner as unembellished as
the tale itself, which he refers to simply as ``a love story
amongst the poor.''

COAST TO COAST TO ALMOST-COAST _ WHAT A COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1997 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ America is way too big. Worse, it's a
pasted-together country that could _ and maybe should _ be divided
into fourths or fifths or sixths without hurting much of anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know all this because, for good and sufficient reasons, I've
spent much of the summer pinballing around America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even now I might be somewhere other than where you think I am,
if you think about my being any place at all. Which, for your sake,
I hope you don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the summer innocently enough, going to Illinois for a
family reunion. I have more relatives in Illinois than elsewhere
because I grew up there, as did my parents. A lot of my relatives
got so deeply rooted in the Land of Lincoln, it turns out, that
they think of Ohio as the East Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is like Indiana, only more so. And like Wisconsin, only
less so. Along with those three, you could throw in a few other
states _ Iowa comes to mind _ and you'd have a pretty homogeneous
country that could export enough corn and soybeans to feed all of
California, which is where I went after I got done hanging around
Illinois. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California should be at least two countries, south and north. I
first spent time in San Diego, which is terribly proud of itself
for being smart enough to be located in San Diego, which has some
pretty lovely weather and a slick zoo. Then I went up to Berkeley,
itself a semi-slick zoo that has weather more to my perverse liking
_ cool, misty, foggy and whatnot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to suggest that weather is the only difference
between southern and northern California. Nosiree. People in San
Diego, for instance, spend lots of time being glad they don't live
in nearby Tijuana, Mexico, which seems to them, I gather, like a
dirt-poor cousin you hope never shows up at your lawn parties. By
comparison, many people in Berkeley would be just as happy selling
leather goods in a Tijuana street market _ and wouldn't notice much
difference in their lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, being unfair to huge numbers of San Diegans,
but given the vast wealth there they could bear up under the strain
of my insults, if they chose, by declaring La Jolla, say, a
separate, gated nation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I was just a kid, I went to La Jolla with my family to
visit friends, who had managed to slip into town before there was
an asset minimum for residents. I remember these sweet people
talking about how many millionaires already lived there, though I
don't recall the specific number. I knew, however, that if I were
ever reduced to going door-to-door to raise funds for my next meal,
people behind the doors in La Jolla could afford to share. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are rich people in Berkeley, too, of course, but their
assets are mostly tied up in what, almost anywhere else, would be
cheap housing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after I got done with California and had stopped at home
long enough to throw away the junk mail and feed the dog, I headed
to Vermont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summer weather in Vermont can be like summer weather in San
Diego, only without the sea gulls and beach bums. My wife grew up
in Vermont. And it's a lovely state, too, except that if you take a
wrong turn you end up in New Hampshire or Massachusetts or some
other state that, if life worked right, would all be mooshed
together into a new country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after returning from Vermont I went to beautiful New
Mexico, which ought to be combined with Arizona, Oklahoma, Utah,
Nevada and parts of Texas to become a country called, say, Nuevo
del Norte Rio Grande Chihuahua del Pecos Bill. A complicated name
like that might keep folks in La Jolla from thinking of such a
country as closet space and attempting a hostile takeover. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which would lead to a too-big, pasted-together country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

&HT;        SENATE DELAYS NUCLEAR WASTE COMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 31 -- Opponents of a deal to store Maine and
Vermont's low-level nuclear waste in Texas won a reprieve Friday
when the Senate put off a final vote on the issue until after its
August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Maine-Vermont-Texas compact, which the House
approved 305-116 Wednesday, had been pushing Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott to schedule a vote this week, just before the Senate
leaves town for a month.
</P>
<P>
   But the compact's main blocker, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
threatened a filibuster and other delay tactics, prompting Lott to
pull the bill rather than use up what little time he had left
before the vacation on the contentious issue of storing nuclear
waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately though, it will be impossible to prevent a final
vote on this matter,'' Wellstone said. ``But it was very important
to stop it now. This is a time for organizing and mobilizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone does not object to the two New England states sending
their waste to Texas, but to the decision to dump the waste in a
poor, predominantly Hispanic town in west Texas, 15 miles from the
Mexican border. He believes the site will be environmentally
dangerous, and that its selection was based on the town's inability
to marshal political opposition to the compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important fight for an environmental justice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The compact has the support of the governors -- an independent,
a Republican and a Democrat -- as well as the state legislatures
and all six senators from the three states, and Maine voters
approved the deal by a three-to-one margin in a 1993 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve the deal because it involves inter-state
commerce, something that has been done with nine other nuclear
waste compacts that covered 41 states. Supporters of the compact,
including Maine's Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, and Reps. John Baldacci, D-Bangor, and Tom Allen,
D-Portland, say that it will be environmentally sound and that
Wellstone's arguments ``simply don't hold water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he not objected, we would have been able to dispense with
it this week,'' said Dave Lackey, Snowe's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Maine and Vermont will pay $25 million each for the
construction of the site, which will house low-level waste
predominantly from private nuclear reactors such as the defunct
Maine Yankee. Lott agreed to hold a debate and vote on the compact
Sept. 1.

A LITTLE VOCAL MUSIC, A LOT OF GERSHWIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consider the following releases as previews of
events upcoming events. The recent flood of George Gershwin music
heralds the composer's centennial. But, first, the acme and nadir
of current vocal releases:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Songs by Beethoven, Strauss, Schumann and Liszt. Ben Heppner,
tenor; Craig Rutenberg, piano. RCA Red Seal 09026-63104.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is possible for tenors with enormous voices whose last
name is not Vickers to both dominate the opera stage and to perform
Lieder with uncommon sensitivity. The peripatetic Heppner, who
gives his first local recital at the University of California at
Berkeley in January, is one of those rare artists.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, during this Toronto-taped compact disc, you can
feel the Canadian singer restraining himself. Yet he is savvy about
deploying his liquid tone to the needs of the concert hall without
slighting the emotional substance of Beethoven's ``Adelaide'' and
``An die ferne Geliebte,'' Strauss' Op. 27 (including ``Morgen''
and ``Ruhe, meine Seele''), seven of Schumann's ``Myrthen'' and
Liszt's ``Tre sonetti di Petrarca.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner projects the texts with thrilling clarity. And, as we
(and a growing host of singers) know from his local appearances,
Rutenberg is among the most caring and supple of today's
accompanists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arias by Strauss and Mozart. Jane Eaglen, soprano; Israel
Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta. Sony Classical SK 60042.
</P>
<P>
   RCA is using its contract with Heppner to record him in suitable
and engaging repertoire. In contrast, Sony Classical's philosophy
for Eaglen amounts to starting the tape and letting her rip.
</P>
<P>
   That she does. The English soprano, who will be Brunnhilde in
three of the San Francisco Opera's four ``Ring of the Nibelung''
cycles next June, certainly possesses monumental volume and weight
in all the material she undertakes. Yet this recital consistently
overpowers without convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The final scene of ``Salome'' rides the orchestral onslaught
impressively, but the absence of inflection suggests a limited
interpretive intelligence. Eaglen lacks the solidity in the bottom
register for an adequate rendering of Ariadne's monologue. And the
charm of ``Arabella'' completely eludes this singer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozart fares even worse. Eaglen simply doesn't have the
technical security to spit out the staccati in Donna Anna's honor
aria and Elettra's vengeful exit scene. Mehta and his Israelis are
no help at all to her.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Sony should have left this CD in the can.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin: ``Porgy and Bess'' (selections); ``Blue Monday.''
Marquita Lister, Harolyn Blackwell, sopranos; Gregg Baker,
baritone; Central State University Chorus; Cincinnati Pops
Orchestra conducted by Erich Kunzel. Telarc CD-80434.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody searching for a one-disc helping of the Gershwins'
great, if problematic opera, might find this an appealing
proposition. Of musicological interest, Kunzel includes 10 newly
orchestrated minutes of Act III that were previously suppressed
because of the length of the work. Of sentimental interest is the
late Cab Calloway's pungent, idiosyncratic delivery of Sportin'
Life's ``It Ain't Necessarily So.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the premiere recording of Will Vodery's original
orchestration of the promising, if ultimately unsuccessful 1922
chamber opera, ``Blue Monday,'' vastly improves upon previous
renderings; this one feels right.
</P>
<P>
   Lister, as she demonstrated in a touring production a few years
ago, is a vibrant Bess. Blackwell contributes an ethereal
``Summertime.'' Baker, who has been a memorable Crown, moves up to
Porgy here and takes on Jake for good measure. Kunzel conducts with
verve.
</P>
<P>
   Note, however, that Sony Heritage has just published for the
first time on CD its famed 1951 studio recording of ``Porgy and
Bess'' on mid-priced MH2K-63322 (two CDs). This was the initial
attempt to record the opera (virtually) complete, and it is still a
heroic undertaking, thanks to the performances of Lawrence Winters,
Camilla Williams and Avon Long and the theatrically oriented
conducting of Lehman Engel.
</P>
<P>
   Sumptuous packaging and a complete libretto for a change.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin: Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra on ``Porgy and
Bess''; Three Preludes; Songs for Violin and Orchestra. Joshua
Bell, violin; John Williams, piano; London Symphony Orchestra
conducted by John Williams. Sony Classical SK 60659.
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you so desire, dismiss Bell's first CD under his new
Sony contract as a mere crossover venture (one often wonders about
his company these days). But the playing is so opulent, fervent,
witty and tasteful that much can be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The Fantasy consists of a 20-minute medley by Alexander Courage
(he composed the original ``Star Trek'' theme) of nine numbers from
the opera. Bell delivers the preludes in Jascha Heifetz's
time-tested transcriptions and those contemporary deans among
arrangers, William D. Brohn and Jonathan Tunick, went to town on
seven Gershwin standards.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight is ``Sweet and Low Down.'' Bell starts by quoting
``Carnival of the Animals''; then he plays against an accompaniment
of Gershwin's original piano roll of the song. It's classy and
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We Got Rhythm'': A Gershwin Songbook. Andre Previn, piano;
David Finck, double-bass. Deutsche Grammophon 289 453 493.
</P>
<P>
   This CD adds up to a preview of the jazz concert these musicians
will play Sept. 27 at the Gershwin Theater, a benefit for the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation and Classical Action. Previn and Finck
finesse their way through 14 Gershwin tunes, and the air of
sophisticated improvisation is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Previn sounds like an exceptional jazz pianist. Sometimes, his
treatment takes you by surprise; ``They All Laughed'' is positively
ferocious in its chordal assault. And occasionally, he teases you
for a small eternity with the melody, which he finally delivers in
small doses. Still, for all its erudition, this Gershwin collection
swings.

ASSOCIATION WILL HELP SUICIDE SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I contact the group Survivors of Suicide? _ M.R.,
Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: One way to find Survivors of Suicide or a similar group in
your area is to call the American Association of Suicidology at
(202) 237-2280.
</P>
<P>
   The association maintains a directory of support groups, which
can be purchased for $10 from 4201 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite
310, Washington, DC 20008.
</P>
<P>
   More than 31,000 people committed suicide in the United States
in 1995, according to Alan Berman, the association's executive
director. The group also can refer callers to the nearest suicide
crisis hot line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If my son says the word ``moron'' one more time I'm going to
scream. Where did this word come from? _ J.G., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It originated in a 1910 classification scheme for
developmentally disabled people proposed by the American
Association on Mental Deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme grouped people into three categories depending on
their impaired level of mental development: idiot, imbecile and
moron. A moron was a person with an IQ range of 50-75 or a
potential mental age of 7-12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moron comes from the Greek ``moros,'' meaning ``foolish or
stupid.'' By 1959, the widespread use of the three terms as
all-purpose insults prompted the medical community to create a new
classification scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was the Will Rogers Coliseum named for the entertainer
when he was from Oklahoma? _ M.G., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The name was a popularly supported suggestion of longtime
friend Amon G. Carter Sr. The coliseum and auditorium were built in
1936, not long after Rogers' death on Aug. 15, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship between Carter and Rogers was described during
the Nov. 4, 1997, rededication of two artworks that Carter donated
to the memorial center.
</P>
<P>
   The works are an Electra Waggoner statue of Rogers riding his
horse, Soapsuds, and a life-size portrait of the entertainer by
Seymour Stone.  &QL;

 c.1998 The Progressive  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the
people concerned and discuss the problem with them. That is what
democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people
because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
</P>
<P>
   As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course
against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they
are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma. Reports
describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's
partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack
problems at their source. They seem to think that if they insist
the problem does not exist, it will simply go away. The best way to
deal with AIDS is through education. So we need a really widespread
AIDS education program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _
political, economic and medical. AIDS education would be just one
part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in
our country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because
that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want. We all
want justice and human rights. Since what we want will benefit all
the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much personal danger do you feel? Have you been
threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the
people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course
the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our
forces. (She laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   But we don't think about that too much. There's no time to be
thinking about such things.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the

democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people

</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>

describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>

   Q: Supreme Court Justice William Brennan liked the following
William Butler Yeats quotation: ``Did you see an old woman going
down the path?'' asks Bridget. ``No, I did not,'' replies Patrick,
who came into the house just after the old woman left it. ``But I
saw a young girl, and she had the walk of a queen.'' What does it
refer to? _ C.P.H., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from the Yeats play ``Cathleen ni Houlihan.'' One of
the many people Brennan quoted it to was Nat Hentoff, who wrote
about the conversation in a 1997 ``Washington Post'' column.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conviction remained that the living, evolving Constitution
_ not frozen in time more than 200 years ago _ will surely
rejuvenate liberty in the decades ahead,'' Hentoff wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the foundation that actor Jimmy Smits
established? _ J.R., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts,
Georgetown Place, 1101 30th St., N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC
20007.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created in 1997 to foster opportunities in
the entertainment industry for Hispanic actors and executives.
Toward that cause, it is co-sponsoring a Sept. 22 forum in
Washington with the FCC and President Clinton's Initiative on Race.
</P>
<P>
   You can send e-mail to the foundation by visiting its World Wide
Web site at www.incacorp.com/nhfa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the group Confederate Railroad still in business? _ D.,
Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The group has more than 60 concert appearances scheduled for
the rest of 1998, according to its Web site at
www.confederaterailroad.net.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad, winners of a ``best new vocal group'' award in 1993,
has a fan club at Box 128185, Nashville, TN 37212-8185. Yearly
membership costs $12 in the United States and $15 in Canada.  &QL;

MIYAZAWA'S TASK OF SAVING JAPAN IS ENORMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ This week's appointment of Kiichi Miyazawa, one of the
grand old men of Japan's 1980s economic boom, to be finance
minister shows the nation is relying on a revered figure of the
past to forestall a new financial crisis with possible global
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   But Miyazawa's selection was greeted with some misgivings. A
former prime minister as well as previously a holder of the
financial post, he is 78 and was himself reluctant to take on such
an arduous task _ nothing less than restoring the country to
even-keel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is widely seen as the only one with a genuine chance of
succeeding because he alone among Japanese politicians has the
prestige to deal on equal terms with the senior civil servants who
really run things.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately announced he would stop supporting the weak yen
and trying to bolster the floundering Tokyo stock exchange. He thus
provided a major challenge to the policy of intervention that has
long dominated in official circles.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has been using all the
right language about restructuring the banking system, which is
nearing collapse, and reforming the economy in general in order to
introduce more competition, especially from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But these are changes that the top civil servants have resisted
in the past because they represent a challenge to their own power.
These officials have been in charge for too long not to offer
tenacious resistance to a real overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, far-reaching reforms would have been attempted in the
early 1990s when the economy first began to skid.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi isn't the first prime minister to talk tough. Nearly all
have failed to fulfill their promises, and some have failed even to
try. The civil servants are well-practiced in the strategy of
appearing to retreat while holding onto the essentials of their
position.
</P>
<P>
   They were doing so 50 years ago when Gen. Douglas MacArthur
ruled Japan as U.S. supreme commander. The civil servants often
undermined the political and economic reforms he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was the most important figure in the preceding government
nominally led by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. His power didn't
stem from his job as foreign minister but from his status as chief
of the leading faction in the Liberal Democratic Party, which has
held power almost solidly for nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior member of Obuchi's group, Hashimoto was little more
than a front man for his boss. If he had wanted to, Obuchi could
have become head of the government at any time during the past two
or three years. Exactly why he decided to put himself in the line
of fire now is something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP has traditionally been much more concerned with
factional infighting among its own warring clans than with
governing, one of the reasons the senior civil servants gained
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP politicians are obsessed by the trappings of power _
the jobs and perks _ not with power itself,'' according to
historian Robert Rintoul, a specialist on Japan at the National
Research Council, a leading think tank here. ``Maneuvering within
the party is wholly separate from policymaking for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Miyazawa, old as he is, may be ready to break
the mold and act in decisive political fashion. Admittedly, the
odds are against him. Yet unless he does, Japan is likely to
stumble into yet a worse economic quagmire.

THANKS TO NEW TOOLS LIKE `THE WAND,' DENTAL PATIENTS FEELING LESS
PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the drill: It vibrates, whines, hisses, whirs, grinds
and smells like it's on fire.
</P>
<P>
   And as if the drill weren't bad enough, it's preceded by those
painful lidocaine injections to deaden the nerves and make the
drilling more tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The syringe is the most fear-provoking device in dentistry. Why,
just the sight of the gleaming needle could cause more sweat than a
peck of pickled habaneros _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   A new computerized anesthetic delivery system, called ``The
Wand,'' has some patients proclaiming lidocaine injections
``pain-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And other changes in dentistry are further reducing the ouch
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Air abrasion is doing away with the drill and needle altogether
in filling some superficial cavities, and lidocaine patches and a
powerful new anesthetic rinse are being used to numb the pain of
injections and sometimes eliminate the need for them.
</P>
<P>
   These days it's no pain, no ... really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had cleanings that were more painful than this,''
proclaimed Blake Estes, 43, immediately after undergoing more than
two hours of periodontal surgery. ``You don't feel anything but a
little bit of pressure on your gums, and then you can feel the
sensation of numbness moving out to the edges of your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes said if he had shut his eyes while Dr. William DuBois
anesthetized his mouth for the extensive gum surgery, he would not
have known the dentist was doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rinse and patches and the wand, we can really almost
guarantee painless dentistry. We've only been able to say that for
the last couple of years,'' said DuBois, a periodontist in Grand
Prairie, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 percent of Americans who seldom or never go to the
dentist, 60 percent say fear of pain is the reason, DuBois said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the research in the last year or so positively
linking gum disease to blood clots that cause heart attacks and
strokes, it is especially important that consumers know there are
things out there to make their dental work pain-free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He helped field-test the new lidocaine dental patches and uses
them for less extensive dental work. The anesthetic-laden
bioadhesive patches are applied directly to the mucous membrane
lining the jaw and take about 10 minutes to numb the area for minor
procedures or pain-free injections.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dyclone rinse, a mouthwash, achieves the same objective.
It is also used to suppress the gag reflex in the positioning of
X-ray films and making prosthetic impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wand,'' a computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery
system, debuted at the American Dental Association's annual
scientific meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the newest thing we have going,'' said Jann Ingmire,
public relations director for the ADA. ``It still involves a
syringe, but the drug goes in at such a slow, steady rate, most
people say it doesn't hurt at all. Some think it doesn't use a
needle, but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a very fine needle, and the anesthetic moves out
just ahead of the needle point so that it numbs as it goes into the
gum.
</P>
<P>
   Air abrasive dental devices, usually found in general dentistry
offices, are not new. They were first used in the 1950s, before the
introduction of the high-speed drill, said Chris Smith, a spokesman
for the Chicago Dental Society.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Borden Air Rotor'' drill was so far superior to anything
else available that it put the old belt-driven drills, as well as
air-abrasive units and other cavity-preparation tools, out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   But air abrasion, sometimes called ``dental sandblasting,'' is
making a comeback, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The current technology uses microparticles of aluminum oxide, an
abrasive substance used in some dentifrices, blown through a
pointerlike hand piece at a very high speed. The hand piece is
directed at tooth decay, which is blasted away in a matter of
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Discomfort due to vibration and heat is eliminated, so the
process can usually be performed without anesthesia, Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Dental sandblasting is used most often to clean out small
cavities without taking any healthy tissue. The cavity is then
filled with a liquid porcelain material that seeps into all the
cavity's nooks and crannies and quickly hardens.
</P>
<P>
   The process is much quicker than traditional drilling and
filling, and the filler matches the tooth color.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this year the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs
favorably reviewed data on the first laser system for treating
tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers have long been used in dentistry for soft tissue work,
such as gum surgery, and recently were approved for one-step
bleaching. A laser also is being used instead of a drill to clean
out cavities.

 &HT;    BRITAIN'S MILITARY BARS USE, SALE OF LAND MINES
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Supporting a cause championed by the late Princess
Diana, the British government Friday banned the manufacture, sale
and use by its military of land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The government had been working for months to implement the ban
before the Aug. 31 anniversary of Diana's death in a Paris car
crash. The princess had campaigned energetically and publicly for a
worldwide ban on mines, which kill 25,000 people a year and injure
many more.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary George Robertson said Britain's government was
trying to set an example for other countries that are not
participating in the Ottawa Convention, an initiative to rid the
world of the anti-personnel weapons. More than 120 countries have
signed the convention, and Britain's action Friday came at the same
time it formally ratified the pact.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia and China have not signed the accord.
The Clinton administration has explained that the U.S. military has
no practical alternative.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robertson told BBC Radio that eliminating land mines
would not diminish his country's military capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most professional army in the world now has said this is
not a system that is morally correct or militarily useful,'' he
said. ``I believe we now have the moral authority to ask other
countries to join us and make sure that these weapon systems are
outlawed everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the late princess for bringing attention to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a big impact on an international campaign that has
been for the good of the world,'' Robertson said. ``As we approach
the first anniversary of her death, I think it is a fitting legacy
that we should by that time have the 40 countries required
ratifying the treaty to bring it into force.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which had allowed only limited use of the bans, has
destroyed about half its stock of 500,000 mines. As the anniversary
of Diana's death approaches, official plans are being made to honor
the woman dubbed ``the People's Princess'' by Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth has ordered that flags be flown at half-staff on
Aug. 31, and a royal memorial service is planned at Crathie Church,
just outside the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles and his and Diana's sons, William and Harry, are
expected to attend the private ceremony. Blair and his wife,
Cherie, also are scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   William and Harry were on vacation from school at Balmoral last
year when Charles informed them of their mother's death. The two
boys held a 50th birthday celebration _ planned as a surprise party
until it was leaked to the press here _ for their father Friday
evening.

   Q: I have read that Al Gore gave the United Nations control of
46 national parks, including Yellowstone. Is this true? _ O.H.,
Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: This misapprehension comes from U.S. participation in a
U.N.-monitored effort to protect Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon and
many other historic and natural places around the world.
</P>
<P>
   These designated ``World Heritage'' or ``Biosphere Reserve''
sites are monitored by a U.N. group for compliance with
international environmental agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Host countries control their own lands but face a U.N. rebuke if
they fall out of compliance. In 1996, Yellowstone was declared a
``World Heritage Site in danger'' because of plans to reopen a mine
a few miles from the park's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho Rep. Helen Chenoweth and others argue that the effort can
lead to ``unconstitutional restrictions on private property.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sees it differently. ``This
administration has no intention of ceding sovereignty over U.S.
lands to international organizations,'' assistant Interior
Secretary George Frampton told Gannett News Service in 1996.

   Q: Are you allowed to visit the cemetery where Jean Harlow is
buried? _ R.J., Waco, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Public visits are allowed from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays at
the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow and many other legendary performers are buried there,
including George Burns, Sammy Davis Jr., Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart
and Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow's place of interment is the Great Mausoleum, which is in
a part of the cemetery that allows only family members after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of celebrity burial sites are described at the World
Wide Web site www.findagrave.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of car was featured in the movie ``Christine?'' _
M.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Christine was a ``Ford red'' 1958 Plymouth Fury, a model
that's a collector's item in real life because only 2,000 were
made.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephen King's book, Christine had four doors, but it was
changed to a two-door for the film because no four-door 1958 Furys
were ever built.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen 1958 Furys were destroyed in the making of the
film, according to the Internet Movie Database.  &QL;

`LINC'S' SHOWS MUCH PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LINC'S 
Starring: Pam Grier, Steven Williams, Georg Stanford Brown 
Created by: Tim Reid and Susan Fales-Hill 
On: Showtime 
Time: Saturday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's a rare TV comedy that makes politics the fulcrum of its
humor, and a rarer one still that doesn't shy away from the subject
of race.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``Linc's,'' an extremely promising new Showtime
sitcom that blends the barroom bonhomie of ``Cheers'' with the
Beltway buzz of ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Lateline.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that at the Washington tavern known as Linc's,
the owner and most of the patrons are black. The creators and cast
of ``Linc's'' (who include the one and only Pam Grier) do not waste
the opportunity this presents for a fresh perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Make that perspectives. Among the distinctive things about
``Linc's'' is that, without sacrificing any humor, it showcases the
political, cultural, and economic diversity of black Americans.
This is a show whose characters range from high-powered lawyers to
immigrant cab drivers, from waitresses to pinstriped lobbyists,
from rock-ribbed Republicans to diehard liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the Washington setting, the characters are wised-up.
At ``Linc's,'' everybody knows your name, and also your foibles,
and sometimes your price.
</P>
<P>
   At one pole of the ``Linc's'' world stands proprietor Russell
Lincoln (Steven Williams), a widower who wears his political
incorrectness with defiant pride and boasts that he is ``as
Republican as Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt soliloquy on pop culture, Linc takes hip-hop to task:
``And who is backing this so-called music? Liberal white boys who
show they're `down with the community' by wearing their caps
backward and making classic films like `Booty Call.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the other pole stands Grier's Eleanor Winthrop, a liberal
attorney and children's rights activist locked in a dismal
marriage. The ideological spats between Linc and Eleanor do a poor
job of concealing their attraction to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, talking politics and sex, with topical references
to Linda Tripp, Eddie Murphy, and Ellen DeGeneres, stands an
engaging roster of regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is amoral lobbyist Johnnie B. Goode (Georg
Stanford Brown), who can't understand why Winthrop and her
political allies are pushing a bill to penalize the tobacco
companies he represents. ``Doesn't anyone realize they've employed
more people than they've killed?'' Goode asks plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent target of Johnnie's blandishments is Harlan Hubbard
IV (Joe Inscoe), the reprobate chief of staff for a right-wing US
senator from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the ensemble is Cece Jennings (Golden Brooks), a
tart-tongued waitress and single mother whose appraisals of men are
as scathing as anything Carla Tortelli &UR;  &LR; came up with; Winston Iwelu
(Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a cab driver from Nigeria who fancies
himself the ``Prime Minister of Love''; and a high-priced callgirl
named Eartha (Daphne Maxwell-Reid).
</P>
<P>
   Their verbal roughhouse is no-holds-barred. Winston derides
Johnnie as ``you assimilated `Amistad' baby.'' Cece responds to
Winston's boasting about the glories of Africa with: ``Didn't you
people bring us Ebola?''
</P>
<P>
   It is Linc's daughter Rosalee (Tisha Campbell), an Army
lieutenant, who catalyzes tonight's premiere when she returns home
and informs her father that she believes she is gay. Linc doesn't
take it well; he prefers to see her as ``heterosexually
challenged,'' a condition he thinks he can reverse by finding the
right man for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let you watch `Lethal Weapon' far too many times,'' he
laments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such one-liners, Linc is not a caricature of a
conservative. Williams endows him with a strength and humanity that
makes viewers confident that his love for his daughter will
eventually triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, however, does not appear to have fully settled into her
role as Eleanor. The legendary star of ``Foxy Brown'' and the
recent ``Jackie Brown'' is a bit subdued, suggesting she is still
trying to find the character.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the cast is already hitting on all cylinders,
though. Their light touch will be needed, since upcoming episodes
will involve such heavy issues as gun control, religion, and
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Reid, who created ``Linc's'' along with Susan Fales-Hill,
was the force behind ``Frank's Place,'' a fine show set in an urban
restaurant that offered a look at black culture but was canceled
after one season in the mid 1980s. Here's hoping ``Linc's'' stays
open a lot longer.

<P>
   Q: Supreme Court Justice William Brennan liked the following
William Butler Yeats quotation: ``Did you see an old woman going
down the path?'' asks Bridget. ``No, I did not,'' replies Patrick,
who came into the house just after the old woman left it. ``But I
saw a young girl, and she had the walk of a queen.'' What does it
refer to? _ C.P.H., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from the Yeats play ``Cathleen ni Houlihan.'' One of
the many people Brennan quoted it to was Nat Hentoff, who wrote
about the conversation in a 1997 ``Washington Post'' column.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conviction remained that the living, evolving Constitution
_ not frozen in time more than 200 years ago _ will surely
rejuvenate liberty in the decades ahead,'' Hentoff wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the foundation that actor Jimmy Smits
established? _ J.R., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts,
Georgetown Place, 1101 30th St., N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC
20007.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created in 1997 to foster opportunities in
the entertainment industry for Hispanic actors and executives.
Toward that cause, it is co-sponsoring a Sept. 22 forum in
Washington with the FCC and President Clinton's Initiative on Race.

GM BLINKED, AND THE STRIKE IS SETTLED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   General Motors blinked this week, returning the controversial
dies to the plant from which they had been abducted, thus
triggering a lengthy, costly strike. By now, the agreement has been
signed and GM is slowly cranking up production of new models. There
was no victory in the agreement, only the postponement of
confrontation. GM did not learn to love or even live with its work
force, and the union still feels it has leverage with a company
that looks upon its labor as a commodity that's available much
cheaper elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are some mysteries left for us to ponder. For openers, how
much did the General actually lose? For more than a month, the
figure held at $1.2 billion in the media reports, although the
reporters every day told us the losses continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this week, it was reported to be a $2 billion loss; on
Thursday the New York Times said $3 billion. Yet, it was also
reported with some frequency that the losses amounted to some $80
million a day. Considering the duration of the strike, at that rate
the loss is more than $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street is content that profits are merely down for the
quarter _ does that mean the General made money during the strike?
</P>
<P>
   Note that during the discussion of losses, it was primarily
company losses that were discussed. The losses to the labor force
were mentionerd now and again. Never, however, in all of the
discussion of loss were you likely to hear about loss to the
nation, loss to the national industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who remember the mobilization of World War II and
recall that it was the automobile industry that virtually overnight
turned from building cars to building military might unparalleled
in history sense another kind of loss _ a much greater loss to the
nation. As the manufacturing base shifts to foreign shores, we lose
a means of creating national wealth and defending the national
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another mystery of the GM-UAW confrontation to consider.
Why, with auto stocks dwindling and dealers in a position to
auction off that dwindling inventory to the highest bidder, was GM
still offering rebates on virtually everything it offers for sale?
If a company is losing money so fast during a labor dispute that it
must shut off the utilities and cancel executive travel, does it
make sense to pay someone $1,000 to buy a car?
</P>
<P>
   The big question: Where was Chairman Jack, the current Smith in
charge? Where has he been during all this labor strife? In the
bunker? GM has suffered a plague of Smiths _ Roger the Magnificent
Spender who squandered billions while losing market share steadily,
and Jack the Silent who sits mute while the sales attrition
continues.
</P>
<P>
   And what next?
</P>
<P>
   The GM board meets Monday; expect an announcement Tuesday. Don't
expect an announcement of a love-in with blue-collar labor. Do
expect a reorganization and more job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting you'll see the demise of a couple of models, perhaps
a couple of divisions. And a shift of even more production outside
the United States borders. The way American trade law currently
stands, you can forge a widget in China, polish it in Canada, put
it in a sedan here, and count it as domestic content _ meaning
American made.
</P>
<P>
   What do we do when the Chinese and the Mexicans go on strike?

   On a cheerier note, August in New England offers the opportunity
to buy an antique car at auction, take up the congenial sport of
road rallying, or, if you own a V-12-powered automobile and have
around $3,500 in spare change rattling in your jeans, to sign up
for a 1,000-mile vintage autumn road rally designed for the
automotive sybarites among us.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Aug. 22, is the auction opportunity, at Owls Head
Transportation Museum where, as of this writing, some 66 vehicles
covering 1924 to the current year have been consigned for the
annual fund-raiser, New England Auction of Antique, Classic and
Special Interest Autos. A couple of Ford Model Ts, 1928
International truck, early Chevys, LaSalle, Packard, Marmon, Riley,
Jaguar, and Hudson are among the more interesting marques offered.
And there is the 1952 MG TD Mark II.
</P>
<P>
   The auction catalog, describing all the vehicles offered, is to
be available at $40 a copy, which includes two seats in the
reserved bidding section. For details on the auction, telephone the
museum at 207-594-4418 (fax 207-594-4410) or write to Owls Head
Transportation Museum, PO Box 277, Owls Head, ME 04854. For the
electronic set, e-mail address is ohtm(at)midcoats.com, and the
Internet site is http://www.ohtm.org.

</P>
<P>
   The rally opportunity comes Saturday, Aug. 29, in Connecticut as
the Sports Car Club of New England Road Rally Championship series
offers Hurdle '98. It is a 180-mile event begining and ending in
Southington, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   An SCCA rally is a competition, but it is not a race; the rally
is a time/distance/speed exercise in precision driving in several
classes, depending upon your experience. This one, in addition to
Novice Class for the neophytes, offers an F Class for first-time
rallyists.
</P>
<P>
   Registration and a rally school begin Friday evening, Aug. 28,
and registration continues from 7:30 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
First car is off the line at 8:31, and the last car is scheduled
across the finish at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Entries and questions should be directed to rallymasters Jon and
Kelli Lamkins, 77 Johanna Circle, Southington, CT 06489, or
telephone 860-747-9514. Or e-mail john.lamkins(AT)snet.net. All
that's needed are two people (one to drive, one to navigate), a
street-legal automobile and the entry fee _ $30 per car for SCCA
members, $35 nonmember. A copy of NER/SCCA rally regulations is
available at $4 per each.
</P>

<P>
   The Forza Mille V-12 is scheduled Oct. 4-9 through New England's
northern tier _ northern Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, with
stops at such fancy resorts as Samoset, Grand Summit, and The
Balsams, and Owls Head, Oxford Speedway and a lot of scenic byways
in the midst of autumn color.
</P>
<P>
   For details, write to Forze Mille V-12, c/o Rich and Jean
Taylor, Jackson Hill Road, Sharon, CT 06069, or telephone
800-645-6069. The $3,495 entry fee covers meals, lodging,
logistical support, security, and trained mechanics in attendance.
It's a benefit event that raises funds for a number of New England
charities. It's also fun on a grand scale.

ASSOCIATION WILL HELP SUICIDE SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I contact the group Survivors of Suicide? _ M.R.,
Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: One way to find Survivors of Suicide or a similar group in
your area is to call the American Association of Suicidology at
(202) 237-2280.
</P>
<P>
   The association maintains a directory of support groups, which
can be purchased for $10 from 4201 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite
310, Washington, DC 20008.
</P>
<P>
   More than 31,000 people committed suicide in the United States
in 1995, according to Alan Berman, the association's executive
director. The group also can refer callers to the nearest suicide
crisis hot line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If my son says the word ``moron'' one more time I'm going to
scream. Where did this word come from? _ J.G., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It originated in a 1910 classification scheme for
developmentally disabled people proposed by the American
Association on Mental Deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme grouped people into three categories depending on
their impaired level of mental development: idiot, imbecile and
moron. A moron was a person with an IQ range of 50-75 or a
potential mental age of 7-12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moron comes from the Greek ``moros,'' meaning ``foolish or
stupid.'' By 1959, the widespread use of the three terms as
all-purpose insults prompted the medical community to create a new
classification scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was the Will Rogers Coliseum named for the entertainer
when he was from Oklahoma? _ M.G., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The name was a popularly supported suggestion of longtime
friend Amon G. Carter Sr. The coliseum and auditorium were built in
1936, not long after Rogers' death on Aug. 15, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship between Carter and Rogers was described during
the Nov. 4, 1997, rededication of two artworks that Carter donated
to the memorial center.
</P>
<P>
   The works are an Electra Waggoner statue of Rogers riding his
horse, Soapsuds, and a life-size portrait of the entertainer by
Seymour Stone.  &QL;

PAIN OF JAPAN'S RECESSION FOUND IN TENTS, LEAN-TOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For anyone familiar with Japan's glistening, seemingly
uniform prosperity, or with the care this rich nation pays to
promoting income equality, it is hard to believe the encampments of
the homeless along the Sumida River exist.
</P>
<P>
   But as countless unwitting commuters whizz along the elevated
Capital Highway, hundreds of destitute people live almost invisibly
underneath, in neatly lined-up cardboard boxes wrapped in
waterproof blue tarpaulins. Their numbers are echoed by thousands
more _ mostly older, jobless men _ scattered imperceptibly in a
handful of Tokyo's train stations, underpasses, and parks.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless problem is not new here, but it is growing and
claiming some unexpected victims. The homeless in Tokyo doubled in
the first half of this decade with the fizzling of Japan's
``bubble'' economy, to an estimated 10,000, and their ranks are
growing faster now as unemployment hits post-war records.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most extreme victims of Japan's worst recession in
23 years, and because of the huge value this society places on work
and group belonging, the suffering they endure can be as much
psychological as it is physical.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have recently found a few ``salarymen'' still wearing
their company pins camped out on park benches. But most of the
homeless are blue-collar workers over age 50 who came here years
ago when jobs were plentiful. In the 1990s, manual work dried up,
and what is left is being offered to younger men.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Tokyo's homeless is a window into two serious
problems underlying Japan's current economic malaise: the decline
of its once-dominant construction and manufacturing industries and
the rapid graying of its population. Unless the country is able to
restructure flailing industries while at the same time finding
resources to better serve its laid-off and elderly, it could face
mounting homelessness and other Western-style social problems that
it has long prided itself on avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is perhaps nowhere more evident than along a grim,
gray stretch of the Sumida riverbank, across from a gas refinery
and nondescript warehouses, in the Sanya district of Tokyo once
famous for day labor opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, welfare workers say, there was no cardboard community
here; today, an estimated 500 refrigerator cartons, lean-to tarps,
and plywood cubes serve as homes. To a Western eye, they may be
striking in their orderliness; brooms, umbrellas and clean
undershirts hang from clotheslines, water bottles for drinking and
washing are tied to the tarps, single-burner gas cookers are
common, and shoes are left outside boxes so as not to sully
mattresses inside.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants are mostly clean-shaven and polite men, such as
Kazuo Yamada, 56, who said he was laid off without a pension last
year from a job making car bodies for Mitsubishi. He has lived in a
blue nylon tent between two men in cartons for seven months, ever
since he ran out of money to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, this is the first time I've been unemployed,''
confided Yamada. ``I can't find anything. That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamada's story is not surprising given that Japan lost 630,000
manufacturing jobs from 1990 to 1997, and retraining is not highly
developed here.
</P>
<P>
   Government policy toward the displaced has been spotty at best.
Starting in 1993, the government spent millions of dollars to build
temporary apartments for the homeless to get them off the streets
in winter but tore down the buildings in spring because no
community wanted a year-round shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There are places, such as the government-run Johoku Fukushi
Social Welfare Center in Sanya, that give out vouchers for cheap
motels. But director Kunio Nozaki says the vouchers are a band-aid;
jobs are the only long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if this recession ends, these people won't be able to get
jobs because of their age and lack of other skills,'' said a
dispirited Nozaki.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the bubble economy in 1988-89, the welfare center
had three times as many daily construction jobs on offer as
applicants. Since 1991, with the drop in property prices, building
has dropped off and machines have replaced people at work sites.
The center has seen a 20 percent jump in jobseekers this year but
will have only 11,000 jobs for 90,000 hopefuls in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nozaki wants the government to create more jobs for the
displaced, such as cleaning up parks and cemeteries. But he
realizes that will not solve the underlying problem of an economy
in the doldrums. Since 1991, 110,000 small firms have shut down,
and many of their castoffs have settled here too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the jobless do not apply for assistance. Single
mothers and children get cash benefits, but single laborers do not,
and many never worked at one place long enough to qualify for
national health or social security. Meanwhile, public and private
pensions are running out of funds; last year alone, 14 private
pension plans went broke.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 percent of Japanese are on welfare, Nozaki says.
Most men in Sanya ``are still hoping they can get a job. They still
have pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that almost half of Sanya's residents are now
working fewer than 10 days a month. Nozaki gestures out the window
at several old men sleeping on the pavement or weaving down the
alley, drunk on cheap rice wine, or ``sake,'' that is sold from
streetside vending machines. ``They have given up. This feeling
permeates everything here,'' he said. ``They're lonely, they have
no jobs, and they are getting desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Police Agency, unemployment and
bankruptcy are the causes of one in three suicides.
</P>
<P>
   For now, homelessness affects only a fraction of the population
and is isolated to a few areas. It is still nearly impossible to
find a panhandler in Tokyo. But these streets that were once noisy
with construction trucks begging for day laborers are now bereft of
activity. Sanya appears to be populated solely by slow-moving old
men.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's population is rapidly aging and birth rates are so low
that it is unclear who will support the elderly. Today, 21 percent
of Japan's population is over the age of 60. By 2020, that figure
is expected to jump to nearly one in three, versus 19 percent in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese families have more elderly to care for than
children, and with the fracturing of extended families, more senior
citizens are finding themselves alone. In Tokyo, 14,000 people are
on waiting lists for public nursing homes. Others, like Sanya's
homeless, aren't even seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   A clean-cut, 65-year-old homeless man named Nakayama who was too
embarrassed to give his first name survives on food he scavenges
from the garbage. ``I go to the jobs center and I look on the
street for jobs, but I can't get any because of my age. I have a
dream of getting a job, but I don't think that dream will come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakayama, who owned his own construction company before it went
bankrupt several years ago, has been living for 2 1/2 years in a
plywood shack. Carefully stacked on shelves he built are bread
loaves from volunteers, fruit and books rescued from a Dumpster and
cheap cooking pots. His tiny area reeks of rotting garbage, but he
keeps it clean with scouring powder and steel wool.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other men here, Nakayama has no interest in the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party choice for the new prime minister, Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, because he can't see how it will affect his
life. ``Japanese politicians never do anything good for us, so I
don't care anymore,'' he said. ``Even with a new prime minister,
nothing will change.''

AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTION: TWO SIDES OF A COIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 02, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, we consider automotive transportation sublime and
ridiculous, sublime as in the pricey Jaguar XK8 Convertible, an
automobile that offers style, luxury, performance _ and a touch of
the ridiculous if you think of it as family transport. For
ridiculous, consider the Kia Sportage, an alleged sport/utility
which at first glance would seem virtuous in that a well-equipped
4WD version is available for under $20,000, almost a budget car
these days. It may well be competent traversing a mudhole, but for
everyday driving, it's no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The XK8 is sublime revisited, and it hasn't changed since our
last visit in October 1997; it is still a vision of luxury with
leather and expensive wood inside, and this time around something
akin to plum coloring on the outside _ nice, I thought. But, then,
what do I know, being color-perception impaired?
</P>
<P>
   The radio controls still need work, the air conditioning still
accommodates those of us who like deep chill behind the wheel or
milder interior climes _ but both at once is pushing it. At a base
sticker of $70,480 delivered, I still think the buyer deserves a
top that disappears completely under a body panel rather than one
that, after a magnificent mechanical ballet, merely falls limp
behind the back seat like a dancer exhausted after the performance.
And, as far as this columnist is concerned, the stylish boot that
snaps in place over it can stay in the trunk _ or home in the
closet, if it were mine.
</P>
<P>
   The 290-horsepower V-8 offers very quick, quiet acceleration,
whisper-quiet touring at any speed, and the Jaguar's handling and
road manners equal or surpass in grace its elegant styling. Tooling
along at turnpike speeds, one may still hold a normal conversation
or listen to the radio. Mileage this time around was 19.73 miles
per gallon overall on an abbreviated tour. I would have kept it
longer had there been significant change _ so many cars, so little
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now for something completely different. That phrase, you may
recall, was a standard exclamation on televsion's ``Monty Python
Show.'' The Kia Sportage, I think, would have been right at home
with the Python posse.
</P>
<P>
   This was my third encounter with the Sportage, this after a
meeting with a platoon of Kia people assuring me that the car was
``much improved'' _ they said ``you'll love it.'' Love? This isn't
even close to ``like.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two encounters were at Pocono Raceway in the eastern
mountains of Pennsylvania under the auspices of the International
Motor Press Association and its annual test day at the track. On
the track, the Sportage was the pits; on the off-road course
provided, it wasn't much better. Since then, Kia has been fighting
to survive in bankruptcy and playing ``Lets Make a Deal'' with
customers _ you want a Kia, call the company and haggle. But why
would you want a Sportage when for less money you could have much
better, a Honda CR-V or a Toyota RAV4?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the interior of the tested model, a 4WD EX with
4-speed manual gearbox that lists for $18,495 plus $450 delivery,
was not exactly a welcome wagon. The emergency brake handle between
the front seats is partially blocked by an annoying sliding armrest
that covers a small bin. The radio controls are the worst thing
since the Hummer's, which was designed, I'm sure, in Hell.
Match-head-sized buttons, little rockers, all marked with quaint
codes, make tuning an aggravating chore.
</P>
<P>
   Once tuned, the FM snappedd, crackled, and popped persistently;
the AM simply faded out at every bridge, dip in the road, or overly
large tree.
</P>
<P>
   The 4WD tranfer case control lever is on the floor, close to
your leg _ not exactly convenient. Small glove box, door bins, coin
holder, and bin to the left of the wheel make up the front interior
storage.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear, entry is tight _ smallish door with large
wheel-well intrusion. Once aboard, you haven't much room for your
knees.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. On the road, the Sportage feels like a rollover
looking for a place to happen. The body leans, sways _ this may be
a safety feature. Maybe the Koreans did this to make us slow down
on the turns, to give us a physical warning of impending doom. And
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they really believe Americans use these things in the
boonies and designed a lot of travel into the suspension for
maximum benefit on the Rubicon Trail. And maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe _ my take on it _ it's an inferior car with a sloppy
suspension, sloppy handling. The nominal 2.0-liter, four-cylinder
engine (1.998 liters, to be exact) is somewhat anemic, given to
poor acceleration, a bit noisy. The five-speed manual was so-so,
and you had to work the poor thing to a frazzle to keep the engine
revving at a level where you might wrest anything like reasonable
performance from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kia starts as a four-door, 2WD model for around $15,000 and
offers eight variations in steps up to the 4WD EX with automatic
for around $20,000. Fuel mileage amounted to 20.3 miles per gallon,
but that's not based on protracted experience. I got out of Kia
rather quickly; I found it a thoroughly unlikable vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you must buy Korean, try Daewoo for reasonable transport at
reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   For what you get, KIa Sportage is overpriced. And, frankly, it's
not a car I'd want to see in the hands of new or inexperienced
drivers. Thumbs down!

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable political speeches in recent memory
sprang Wednesday from the lips of Clarence Thomas, the Supreme
Court justice who has been ostracized by a large and influential
faction of America's black leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me deeply,'' he told the largest convention of black
lawyers in Memphis, ``more deeply than any of you can imagine, to
be perceived by so many members of my race as being a harm.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people in his audience walked out, he was denounced from
the podium before he began his talk, and a number of prominent
blacks went out of their way to make clear they do not forgive his
apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since President Bush nominated him to replace
the revered and widely respected Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has
voted and written against some of the positions Marshall espoused.
</P>
<P>
   He is the most visible, and most powerful (with his one-ninth of
the highest court's clout) of the conservative black Americans who
were raised up in the Reagan years in an attempt by the GOP to
blunt the 10-1 advantage Democrats typically enjoy among black
voters.
</P>
<P>
   What made Thomas's speech at the National Bar Association so
poignant to me, as it was so painful to him, was the manner in
which he felt he had to beseech his own people for the most
elementary standards of acceptance, respect, and compassion. I have
never been a Thomas advocate. But the manner in which he has been
shunned by so many of his own race is disquieting and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Because America is such a broad and diverse land, we have
learned that it is dangerous to hold others hostage to our own
narrow views. Because of the distances and numbers involved, our
land cannot afford the narrow and brutal ultimatums that make much
smaller places like Northern Ireland, the Middle East, or the
Balkans such killing fields. It is in the Congress and the courts,
as well as in our national elections, where we thrash out the
differences, regional and racial, that would otherwise divide us at
our peril.
</P>
<P>
   It was race and class that were at the root of the civil war we
are still trying to get over. And it is race and class that still
bedevil us. By selecting Thomas, a little-known and unheralded
black conservative, George Bush did not do the country nor Thomas
any favors. His confirmation hearings were anguished, angry, and
abrasive. Anita Hill's tales of sexual exploitation made the Senate
Judiciary Committee squirm. I have talked with members of that
panel who still feel reputations were wrecked, and professional
lives were destroyed, as a result of those televised accusations
and denials.
</P>
<P>
   Not until this year's steamy Lewinsky business has the American
political process been so drenched in so much sordid sexual
sheepdip. The Thomas-Hill confrontation, which further divided
feminists (``I believe Anita'' was their bumper sticker) from
conservatives, was never adequately resolved, though he was
eventually confirmed. While his court colleagues accept him without
reservation, the public and blacks of influence are deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of antipathy to Thomas is his resolute dismissal of
affirmative action as a legitimate tool to defuse centuries of
ingrained racial prejudice. He is still viewed by many as the
blackfaced tool by which clever white manipulators maneuver to
maintain a discredited antebellum status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gross oversimplification, it goes without saying, does
credit to neither side in the querulous debate. But a large number
of black professionals made it out of the working class into the
middle class by being singled out young and early for the kinds of
extra push that affirmative action was invented for. And many of
those same successful blacks denounce Thomas as a traitor to his
race because of his philosophical objections to the way affirmative
action is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   For him to bow to the black majority view, Thomas argued
eloquently, would make him no more than ``an intellectual slave.''
His critics seem to want to deny him his ``humanity,'' he asserted,
to humbly ``follow the prescription asigned to blacks.'' It is that
very stereotype of the black slave bowing to superior force that
Thomas vows to reject, no matter what the personal cost.
</P>
<P>
   But he is clearly anguished over the personal rejections and
slights which have marred his career. ``All the sacrifice, all the
long hours studying, were to help, not to hurt,'' he pleaded.
``Despite some of the nonsense that has been said about me by those
who should know better ... the psycho-silliness ... I am a man, a
black man, an American.'' He all but begged for some sort of end to
his banishment from the salons of black acceptance. ``Isn't it time
to realize that being angry with me solves no problems?''
</P>
<P>
   He took a calculated risk in laying bare his heart, and some of
the most influential blacks in America still refuse to offer their
hand. In one 1996 survey of American blacks, he was viewed
negatively by 44 percent, positively by only 32. His harsh
criticism of black studies programs, and his hewing to
law-and-order positions that blacks think fall unduly on the
darker-hued, keep him out of the black mainstream. He once
denounced some black leaders as professional whiners who ``bitch,
bitch, moan and moan, whine and whine.''
</P>
<P>
   I think it's high time the black leadership relents, and invites
Clarence Thomas in from the cold. I would think more of them for
doing that, even as I continue to feel he is not my kind of Supreme
Court voter. That court and this country are big enough to tolerate
Thomas. Are the black leaders?

<P>
   If you are feeling a little guilty that you are not lugging to
the beach a big serious book about political economy _ David
Landes' ``Wealth and Poverty of Nations,'' say, or ``The Commanding
Heights'' by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw _ then I have a
suggestion. Read this column and relax.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith a list of 10 books that are at once weightier and less
fun. (With a single exception, they are university press books.) In
a more virtuous life, or in the fall perhaps, you might enjoy
reading any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Each was written for a specialized audience. But each has
something to say bordering on news about a topic of general
interest. So they are digested here.
</P>
<P>
   Skim what you're missing, then go for a walk with a friend.

<P>
   ``The Money Interest and The Public Interest,'' by Perry G.
Mehrling (Harvard University Press). This warm and humane biography
of three monetary economists whose careers spanned the last 100
years _ Allyn Young, Alvin Hansen, and Edward Shaw _ has a great
deal to say about action away from the ball. In this case it is the
efforts of three practical men to construe and fashion monetary
policy during the ``revolution'' and ``counterrevolution'' of John
Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technopols: Freeing Politics and Markets in Latin America in
the 1980s,'' edited by Jorge Dominguez (Penn State University
Press). It is early yet to expect anyone, even a journalist, to
pull together the similar yet different experiences of Argentina,
Mexico, Brazil, and Chile during their market-oriented
transformations. So editor Dominguez, professor of government at
Harvard University, has done the next best thing, coralling experts
to write engaging profiles of the technically skilled, politically
savvy leaders (``technopols'') who made them: Domingo Cavallo,
Pedro Aspe, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Evelyn Matthei, and
Alejandro Foxley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumaine's Amoskeag: Let the Record Speak,'' by Arthur M.
Kenison (St. Anselm College Press). The twinkly-eyed portrait of
Frederick C. (``Buck'') Dumaine is the key to this reinterpretation
of the career of New England's legendary asset stripper. The book
conveys admirably the feel of old New Hampshire. But even the most
sympathetic treatment can't turn Dumaine into a latter-day Aaron
Feurstein. In the depression of 1921 he tried to cut the hourly
wage at Amoskeag Mills by 35 percent while incresing the work week
to 54 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam Military Lore: Legends, Shadows and Heroes,'' by Ray
Bows (Bows and Sons Publishing, Hanover, Mass.). This grand
adventure in self-publishing has a remarkable secret: in 53 war
stories and hundreds of photographs sprawling over 1,200 pages,
retired Special Forces master sergeant Bows has tracked down, often
in the unlikliest places, the stories of the fallen heroes for whom
American camps and airfields in Vietnam were named: an annotated
Wall of Remembrance for the home. What's the connection with
business? Same as anything having to do with America in Vietnam:
it's a vivid reminder of growing up in a certain way in the 1960s
at a key fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demanding Medical Excellence: Doctors and Accountability in
the Information Age,'' by Michael L. Millenson (University of
Chicago Press). A former newspaper reporter tracks the revolution
in quality management and medical measurement, thereby providing a
highly readable and persuasive account of the reasons for the turn
to managed health care in the 1990s. It's more than your doctor is
likely to tell you about why he/she does what he/she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mutual Fund Business,'' by Robert C. Pozen (MIT Press).
What do you get when you ask Fidelity Management and Research Co.'s
top lawyer to teach a course on mutual funds? This combination
textbook and reader, designed to display the mutual fund industry
and many of its controversies, makes a good introduction and
reference book. It has a fair amount to say as well about Dreyfus
Corp., Vanguard Group, Putnam Cos., T. Rowe Price Associates, and
other giants of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Government in the Tropics,'' by Judith Tendler (The Johns
Hopkins University Press). It's a commonplace in mainstream
development thinking that the closer you get to the equator, the
worse governments are likely to be. Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor Tendler argues the opposite _ that there is no
necessary connection and that the remarkable performance of the
small state Ceara in northeast Brazil demonstrates how a government
whose servants are thought to be slightly better than the rest _ as
civil service bureaucrats are thought to be in France or Japan _
can work well in a poor region, as long as the sense of chosenness
cuts across all categories of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty Years in a Red House: A Memoir of Childhood and Youth
in Communist China,'' by Zhu Xiao Di (University of Massachusetts
Press). Ross Terrill says in his foreward, ``Sometimes one person's
story, like a single ray that bursts from a mirror as a powerful
wave of light, illuminates the life of an epoch and a nation.'' Zhu
Xiao Di was born in 1958. This matter-of-fact account of his
family's travails, especially during the Cultural Revolution (his
father was a prominent Communist official) is a splendid lesson in
20th century Chinese history, the next best thing to having had a
family friend all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Population Spike and After: Reflections on the 21st
Century,'' by W.W. Rostow (Oxford University Press). There is no
more ardent devotee of the Big Picture than Rostow, professor
emeritus of political economy at the University of Texas at Austin.
The great spike he discerns is in populatiuon growth rates: having
greatly speeded up during the past two centuries, they are about to
decelerate even more quickly. The earth's population will level off
at 10 billion by about 2050 as the birthrate drops, he expects;
thereafter, the global problem of an aging population dependent to
a smaller work force will make American, German, and Japanese
Boomers' problems with soicial security today look like kid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Stream of Windows: Unsettling Reflections on Trade,
Immigration, and Democracy,'' by Jagdish Bhagwati (MIT Press).
Along with Paul Krugman and Alan Blinder, Bhagwati is at the top of
the class of smoothwriting economists. This collection of his
articles is an excellent tour d'horizon of trade and immigration
issues from the perspective of a former economic policy adviser to
the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

<P>
   Penis envy may be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The clitoris, it turns out, is no ``little hill'' as its
derivation from the Greek ``kleitoris'' implies. Instead, it
extends deep into the body, with a total size at least twice as
large as most anatomy texts show, and tens of times larger than the
average person realizes, according to new studies by Helen
O'Connell, a urology surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in
Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The clitoris earned its Lilliputian reputation, in part, because
much of its elaborate 3-D structure is on the inside, hidden by fat
and bone _ an anatomical smoke screen that has helped fool lay
people and experts alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of erectile tissue down there that is not drawn
in any anatomy textbooks, save perhaps a couple of really old
dissections in the French and German literature.'' O'Connell says.
``Just because you can't see the rest does not mean it isn't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it mean it is not important. O'Connell's detailed
descriptions of female sexual anatomy could help prevent women who
have pelvic operations from ending up with impaired sexual
function.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dissections are wonderful,'' says Cindy Amundsen, a
gynecologist at the University of Houston in Texas. ``The erectile
tissue is closer to the urethra and encompasses a far larger area
of the anterior vaginal wall than most people thought.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell first realized just how little was known about female
sexual anatomy when she was studying for her surgical exams in the
late 1980s. Even nowadays, she says, textbooks routinely recycle
decades-old, inaccurate illustrations of female sex organs, or omit
diagrams altogether. The written accounts can also lack a certain
something.
</P>
<P>
   One text describes female genitalia as the same as the guys'
only turned inside out. Another describes it as the ``poor
homologue'' of the male.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them _ not even the anatomists' bible, ``Gray's
Anatomy'' _ describe in detail the nerves and blood vessels that go
to the clitoris. ``For a surgeon,'' O'Connell says, ``that's
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of men's sexual anatomy has fared slightly better.
Back in the 1970s, modern microdissection techniques were brought
to bear on the nerves and blood vessels that supply the penis. The
information gleaned helped spawn ``nerve sparing'' surgery that
reduces the risk of impotence following operations for diseases
such as prostate or bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by John Hutson, an expert on pediatric genital
reconstruction at the University of Melbourne, O'Connell hoped to
do the same for women's sexual anatomy and surgery. But as she
started to map out the nerves, she realized it wasn't just the fine
detail that was missing from the textbook picture of the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, Damn! I'm not sure the gross anatomy is correct,
either,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then O'Connell and her assistant Robert Plenter have
dissected the bodies of 10 adult women, relying heavily on
photography to capture the 3-D structure of the clitoris. She has
described in detail the dorsal nerves (much bigger than in the
anatomy books) that are thought to carry the sensory information on
the first step of its journey to the brain, as well as the
cavernosal nerves that probably control the smooth muscles of the
clitoris, and the size of its blood vessels, enabling it to swell
during sex. She has also concluded that the clitoris as described
in most textbooks is a mere shadow of its real self.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Connell's dissections, the external tip of the
clitoris, or glans, connects on the inside to a pyramid-shaped mass
of erectile tissue, far larger than previously described. The
``body'' of the clitoris, which connects to the glans, is about as
big as the first joint of your thumb. It has two arms up to 9
centimeters long that flare backward into the body, lying just a
few millimeters from the ends of the muscles that run up the inside
of the thigh. Also extending from the body of the clitoris, and
filling the space between its arm, are two bulbs, one on each side
of the vaginal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbs do, in fact, make an appearance in at least some
textbooks, but few recognize them as part of the clitoris. Indeed,
they are usually referred to as the ``bulbs of the vestibule'' _
the vestibule being the vagina.
</P>
<P>
   To make their origins clearer, O'Connell wants to rename them
the ``bulbs of the clitoris.'' The penis also has bulbs of erectile
tissue at its root that extend into the body cavity, but ``the
bulbs are more prominent in females,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray's Anatomy'' and other texts also claim that the clitoris,
unlike the penis, is entirely separate from the urethra, the tube
that connects the bladder to the outside. O'Connell disagrees.
According to her dissections, the clitoris surrounds the urethra on
three sides, while the fourth is embedded in the front wall of the
vagina.
</P>
<P>
   That layout makes perfect sense if you think about what the
clitoris has to do. Freud described it as a tool for arousing the
rest of the female much as ``pine shavings can be kindled in order
to get a log of harder wood on fire.'' But the clitoris also helps
squeeze the urethra shut during intercourse, perhaps stopping
bacteria from making their way up to the bladder and causing an
infection. The engorged bulbs of the clitoris may also help hold
the walls of the vagina rigid, aiding penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the clitoris's design, could also help protect
women's ability to have good sex. According to O'Connell's
descriptions, the cavernosal nerves travel alongside the walls of
the uterus, vagina, bladder and urethra. And although practically
nothing is known about how operations for, say, incontinence or
bladder cancer or hysterectomies affect sexual function, the
positions of the nerves suggest that it could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of operations involve dissections around the urethra.
That could affect patients' sexual function,'' Amundsen says. Just
as doctors routinely ask men who have had prostate surgery about
their erections, they should ask female patients who have had
comparable operations about any changes in their sexual function,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nerves' pathways are known, it should also be
possible to modify at least some operations to reduce the risk of
sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been tons of studies about how to prevent impotence
after radical prostectomy,'' says John DeLancey, an expert on
gynecological anatomy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Anatomically speaking, a radical hysterectomy for cancer of the
cervix is similar to a radical prostectomy. ``Given this
beautifully detailed knowledge of the interrelationship between the
female urethra and sexual organs,'' it should be possible to
develop similar nerve-sparing operations for women, he says.
</P>
<P>
   So why have anatomists routinely got the clitoris wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be a Victorian prudishness about
examining women's sexual organs in detail. Then there's the fact
that most of the clitoris is hidden inside, shielded by lots of fat
and the arch of the pubic bone. Another obstacle to accuracy is
that anatomical studies are usually done on the bodies of women in
their 80s and 90s. Just as muscle and bone wither with age, so does
the mass of erectile tissue in the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   In men, shrinking erectile tissue is less of a problem, at least
for the anatomist. More men die in accidents, so young bodies
routinely find their way to the dissection table. And as the
erectile tissue of the penis is mainly on the outside in one
compact piece, it's easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell had two cadavers of women under forty. The older
bodies had much smaller clitorises (although still far larger than
in the textbooks), but once O'Connell had identified the erectile
tissue in the younger women it was easy to find in the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lucked out,'' she says, ``one of our cadavers was 36 years
old. She looked like an Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is now studying the cellular structure of the
clitoris, urethra and vagina. Amundsen, meanwhile, suggests another
topic for research: ``We have Viagra. We know anatomically what's
going on in the clitoris. We need some studies on erectile
dysfunction in women.''  &QL;

<P>
   O'Connell first realized just how little was known about female
sexual anatomy when she was studying for her surgical exams in the
late 1980s. Even nowadays, she says, textbooks routinely recycle
decades-old, inaccurate illustrations of female sex organs, or omit
diagrams altogether. The written accounts can also lack a certain
something.
</P>
<P>
   One text describes female genitalia as the same as the guys'
only turned inside out. Another describes it as the ``poor
homologue'' of the male.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them _ not even the anatomists' bible, ``Gray's
Anatomy'' _ describe in detail the nerves and blood vessels that go
to the clitoris. ``For a surgeon,'' O'Connell says, ``that's
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of men's sexual anatomy has fared slightly better.
Back in the 1970s, modern microdissection techniques were brought
to bear on the nerves and blood vessels that supply the penis. The
information gleaned helped spawn ``nerve sparing'' surgery that
reduces the risk of impotence following operations for diseases
such as prostate or bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by John Hutson, an expert on pediatric genital
reconstruction at the University of Melbourne, O'Connell hoped to
do the same for women's sexual anatomy and surgery. But as she
started to map out the nerves, she realized it wasn't just the fine
detail that was missing from the textbook picture of the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, Damn! I'm not sure the gross anatomy is correct,
either,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then O'Connell and her assistant Robert Plenter have
dissected the bodies of 10 adult women, relying heavily on
photography to capture the 3-D structure of the clitoris. She has
described in detail the dorsal nerves (much bigger than in the
anatomy books) that are thought to carry the sensory information on
the first step of its journey to the brain, as well as the
cavernosal nerves that probably control the smooth muscles of the
clitoris, and the size of its blood vessels, enabling it to swell
during sex. She has also concluded that the clitoris as described
in most textbooks is a mere shadow of its real self.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Connell's dissections, the external tip of the
clitoris, or glans, connects on the inside to a pyramid-shaped mass
of erectile tissue, far larger than previously described. The
``body'' of the clitoris, which connects to the glans, is about as
big as the first joint of your thumb. It has two arms up to 9
centimeters long that flare backward into the body, lying just a
few millimeters from the ends of the muscles that run up the inside
of the thigh. Also extending from the body of the clitoris, and
filling the space between its arm, are two bulbs, one on each side
of the vaginal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbs do, in fact, make an appearance in at least some
textbooks, but few recognize them as part of the clitoris. Indeed,
they are usually referred to as the ``bulbs of the vestibule'' _
the vestibule being the vagina.
</P>
<P>
   To make their origins clearer, O'Connell wants to rename them
the ``bulbs of the clitoris.'' The penis also has bulbs of erectile
tissue at its root that extend into the body cavity, but ``the
bulbs are more prominent in females,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray's Anatomy'' and other texts also claim that the clitoris,
unlike the penis, is entirely separate from the urethra, the tube
that connects the bladder to the outside. O'Connell disagrees.
According to her dissections, the clitoris surrounds the urethra on
three sides, while the fourth is embedded in the front wall of the
vagina.
</P>
<P>
   That layout makes perfect sense if you think about what the
clitoris has to do. Freud described it as a tool for arousing the
rest of the female much as ``pine shavings can be kindled in order
to get a log of harder wood on fire.'' But the clitoris also helps
squeeze the urethra shut during intercourse, perhaps stopping
bacteria from making their way up to the bladder and causing an
infection. The engorged bulbs of the clitoris may also help hold
the walls of the vagina rigid, aiding penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the clitoris's design, could also help protect
women's ability to have good sex. According to O'Connell's
descriptions, the cavernosal nerves travel alongside the walls of
the uterus, vagina, bladder and urethra. And although practically
nothing is known about how operations for, say, incontinence or
bladder cancer or hysterectomies affect sexual function, the
positions of the nerves suggest that it could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of operations involve dissections around the urethra.
That could affect patients' sexual function,'' Amundsen says. Just
as doctors routinely ask men who have had prostate surgery about
their erections, they should ask female patients who have had
comparable operations about any changes in their sexual function,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nerves' pathways are known, it should also be
possible to modify at least some operations to reduce the risk of
sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been tons of studies about how to prevent impotence
after radical prostectomy,'' says John DeLancey, an expert on
gynecological anatomy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Anatomically speaking, a radical hysterectomy for cancer of the
cervix is similar to a radical prostectomy. ``Given this
beautifully detailed knowledge of the interrelationship between the
female urethra and sexual organs,'' it should be possible to
develop similar nerve-sparing operations for women, he says.
</P>
<P>
   So why have anatomists routinely got the clitoris wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be a Victorian prudishness about
examining women's sexual organs in detail. Then there's the fact
that most of the clitoris is hidden inside, shielded by lots of fat
and the arch of the pubic bone. Another obstacle to accuracy is
that anatomical studies are usually done on the bodies of women in
their 80s and 90s. Just as muscle and bone wither with age, so does
the mass of erectile tissue in the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   In men, shrinking erectile tissue is less of a problem, at least
for the anatomist. More men die in accidents, so young bodies
routinely find their way to the dissection table. And as the
erectile tissue of the penis is mainly on the outside in one
compact piece, it's easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell had two cadavers of women under forty. The older
bodies had much smaller clitorises (although still far larger than
in the textbooks), but once O'Connell had identified the erectile
tissue in the younger women it was easy to find in the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lucked out,'' she says, ``one of our cadavers was 36 years
old. She looked like an Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is now studying the cellular structure of the
clitoris, urethra and vagina. Amundsen, meanwhile, suggests another
topic for research: ``We have Viagra. We know anatomically what's
going on in the clitoris. We need some studies on erectile
dysfunction in women.''  &QL;

   What do extraterrestrials eat? A team of American biologists is
starting to explore the possibilities by weaning Earth bacteria
onto a diet that they would not normally encounter on this planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know all the possibilities for life,'' says Andrew
Ellington of the University of Texas in Austin. ``If we found life
on another planet, what could it be like, where could it live, what
might it eat?''
</P>
<P>
   The search for life on Mars and other planets might eventually
answer some of these questions, he said last week at an
astrobiology workshop at the NASA Ames Research Center near San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, Ellington has decided to take a different
approach. If he couldn't find an extraterrestrial, he could try to
make one instead. The building blocks of life might be very
different on another planet, so he and his team decided to see if a
terrestrial microbe could adapt to a major change in its diet.
</P>
<P>
   They grew a strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli that can't
make the amino acid tryptophan, an essential part of proteins. As a
result, it requires a constant supply of tryptophan to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also gave it a related synthetic amino acid,
fluorotryptophan. This might conceivably be an essential component
of life on another planet, but to life as we know it,
fluorotryptophan is poison. When substituted for tryptophan, the
impostor is incorporated into E. coli proteins and cripples the
cells, killing them after about three divisions.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers gave the bacterial cultures a mixture of 95
percent fluorotryptophan and 5 percent normal tryptophan, the
organisms barely coped and grew only slowly. But after many
generations, the microbes started to divide more rapidly,
suggesting they had developed mutations that helped them cope with
fluorotryptophan's toxic effects. In small steps, the researchers
increased the amount of the synthetic amino acid. The cells were
eventually able to survive on a diet with 100 percent
fluorotryptophan and have divided for seven generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bacteria grow incredibly slowly,'' Ellington says, ``but
they are continuing to divide.'' His team is eager to discover what
genetic tricks the microorganism has used to develop a taste for
this unusual dish.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington thinks this ``unnatural selection'' could encourage
terrestrial microbes to live on inhospitable planets with very
different sources of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to think we can't simulate a piece of Mars
in the lab and then coax something to live on it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He even suggests that such bacteria could terraform other
worlds, by digesting toxic compounds in the soil and giving off
gases that would help to make a planet's atmosphere more suitable
for people to live on. &QL;

CAMRY? LEXUS? ONLY THE STICKER TELLS YOU FOR SURE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a Camry or a Lexus?
</P>
<P>
   Only a look at the nameplate _ or the sticker _ can tell you for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, the upscale division of Japan's Toyota, rolled out an
all-new version of its entry-level ES 300 sedan in mid-1996 as an
early 1997 model.
</P>
<P>
   This bigger and better ES 300, with a 200-horsepower V-6 engine
and roomier interior, set the stage for a more important event for
Toyota: the introduction of the all-new midsize Camry sedan.
</P>
<P>
   That vehicle, which debuted in fall 1996 as a '97 model, took
the market by storm, giving the Camry its first win as the
best-selling car in the United States. It beat the Ford Taurus and
Honda Accord, whose sales had held first or second place most of
the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the main reason the Camry finally beat the Taurus and
the Accord is that people who saw it and drove it came away knowing
that it was a Lexus in Toyota clothing.
</P>
<P>
   This trend of automakers cloning their niche-market upscale
brands to provide vehicles for their mass-market nameplates is
quite common. I mentioned a similar arrangement recently with the
Audi A4 and this year's new Volkswagen Passat, two vehicles that
share a chassis and drivetrain.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Audi and Passat, the Camry and ES 300 have some
differences. But other than the ritzy appeal of the Lexus
nameplate, there is little difference between a high-end Camry XLE
model ($24,868) and the ES 300 ($30,790) except the price. Add the
popular extras, such as leather interior and sun roof, and the
Lexus costs at least $5,000 more than a comparably equipped Camry.
</P>
<P>
   For value-conscious buyers, the choice is clear: Toyota wins
easily. The Camry is also a better bet for people who routinely
carry five adults; despite their nearly identical designs, the ES
300 has slightly less room in the rear than the Camry. That means
two adults can sit comfortably in the back seat of the Lexus, but
three is a tight fit.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference in the trunk, too: 13 cubic feet of space
in the ES 300 vs. 14.1 cubic feet in the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to buy the most expensive Camry to get a car
that's very Lexuslike. We tested a midlevel, four-cylinder Camry LE
(base price $20,218) back-to-back with an ES 300, and found the
Camry to be an exceptionally good buy.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the four-cylinder engine _ with 133 horsepower and 147
foot-pounds of torque _ isn't quite up to the speed of the V-6
engine that is standard in the Lexus and optional in Camry. But the
extra power really isn't necessary; stick with the four-cylinder if
price is a consideration. Just to upgrade to the V-6 in the Camry
LE costs an additional $2,340.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the low price of the LE four-cylinder, you get the same
four-speed automatic transmission of the Lexus, as well as power
windows and door locks, cruise control, power dual outside mirrors,
air-conditioning and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Leather is optional on the Lexus ($1,650) and the Camry LE
($1,100).
</P>
<P>
   Now, with all of that in mind, why bother buying the Lexus? If
you have the extra bucks, the ES 300 is a good buy even though it's
basically the same car.
</P>
<P>
   First, it will have a better resale value because of the Lexus
name. Second, it has a lot more standard or available extras, such
as automatic air-conditioning, side-impact air bags (new for 1998),
and a great stereo-system upgrade: a 215-watt Nakamichi
AM/FM/cassette unit with a remote-control six-disc CD changer
conveniently mounted in the glove box. That unit costs $1,600 and
comes with seven speakers, including a subwoofer. But even the base
Pioneer AM/FM/cassette in the Lexus is better than the stereo in
the Camry. (You can add a six-disc changer for $1,050 in the Lexus
or $650 in the Camry).
</P>
<P>
   The side-impact air bags are optional on all Camry models, but
standard in the Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could tell you that the ride in the Lexus is quieter
than the Camry's, but I couldn't tell a difference. Both are so
quiet even at highway speeds that you can carry on a conversation
at whisper level. These are two of the quietest vehicles on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the rides in both cars are cushy. But Lexus offers an
uplevel variable-suspension system ($600) that has four
driver-adjustable modes: soft, normal, sport or hard. The soft
setting is comparable to the Camry's ride; the firmer settings
allow for better cornering and more road feel.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel is also a consideration. The four-cylinder Camry is rated
at 23 miles per gallon in the city and 30 mpg on the highway, and
it burns regular unleaded gasoline. The V-6 in the Camry and the ES
300 is EPA rated at 19 mpg in the city and 26 on the highway, and
premium fuel is recommended. (Both come with an 18.5-gallon tank).
</P>
<P>
   My advice is to buy the Lexus if price is no object and you
don't need the bigger back seat and trunk of the Camry. But if you
want to save money, try a Camry equipped to the level your budget
can handle, and enjoy an almost-Lexus for a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you can't go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're having trouble making up your mind, check out the
full-size Toyota Avalon, which we also recently tested. It's built
on the same chassis as the Camry and ES 300, although it's
stretched a bit.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most luxurious Toyota available; it sells for
$24,278 to about $30,000, and has more room than the Camry or the
ES 300.
</P>
<P>
   A HYBRID TOYOTA: The Prius, a Corolla-size Toyota that uses an
electric motor and a 1.5-liter gasoline engine, will go on sale in
the United States in fall 2000, the automaker announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   The car operates on zero-emissions electric power under 30 miles
per hour, perfect for crowded city streets, but switches to
gasoline power at higher speeds _ usually on less-busy (and
less-polluted) highways.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota will initially earmark 20,000 of these vehicles a year
for North America and Europe. It has been on sale in Japan since
December at a reasonable price of about $15,500. (The biggest
problem with electric vehicles, other than their limited range on
battery power, has been their prohibitive cost).
</P>
<P>
   The Prius doesn't have to be plugged into an electrical outlet
to be recharged; its batteries charge while the gasoline engine is
running. That means that you're not stuck if the batteries run
down; just fire up the gas engine and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota claims fuel economy of up to 66 miles per gallon with a
combination of both power sources.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned: I will test-drive the Prius this month when Toyota
brings it to Fort Worth-Dallas for a media program.

   A star in the constellation Draco may be giving us a glimpse of
the Earth's future 4.5 billion years hence, when the Sun swells up
into a red giant, say astrophysicists in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sun grows large enough, the Earth's atmosphere and
surface will be stripped away. But its iron and nickel core might
survive, as the Sun shrinks back to become a white dwarf star the
size of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Jianke Li, Lilia Ferrario and Dayal Wickramasinghe of the
Australian National University, think a white dwarf called GD356,
65 light years away, has gone down a similar path. White dwarfs
sometimes have powerful magnetic fields, and Li says these would
induce huge electrical currents in the metal core of any planet
circling the star. The currents would flow between the star and the
planet, carried by the ionized gases surrounding the star.
</P>
<P>
   The team's calculations, due to appear in Astrophysical Journal
Letters, show that such electrical currents could excite hydrogen
atoms in the poles of GD356 to emit frequencies of light which
would be polarized by the star's magnetic fields. Until now the
polarized light emitted by the star has defied explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is intriguing, says James Liebert of the University of
Arizona in Tucson, who has studied GD356 since its discovery in the
1980s. ``I have seen no viable alternative idea proposed to explain
this unique star.'' &QL;

   A star in the constellation Draco may be giving us a glimpse of
the Earth's future 4.5 billion years hence, when the Sun swells up
into a red giant, say astrophysicists in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sun grows large enough, the Earth's atmosphere and
surface will be stripped away. But its iron and nickel core might
survive, as the Sun shrinks back to become a white dwarf star the
size of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Jianke Li, Lilia Ferrario and Dayal Wickramasinghe of the
Australian National University, think a white dwarf called GD356,
65 light years away, has gone down a similar path. White dwarfs
sometimes have powerful magnetic fields, and Li says these would
induce huge electrical currents in the metal core of any planet
circling the star. The currents would flow between the star and the
planet, carried by the ionized gases surrounding the star.
</P>
<P>
   The team's calculations, due to appear in Astrophysical Journal
Letters, show that such electrical currents could excite hydrogen
atoms in the poles of GD356 to emit frequencies of light which
would be polarized by the star's magnetic fields. Until now the
polarized light emitted by the star has defied explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is intriguing, says James Liebert of the University of
Arizona in Tucson, who has studied GD356 since its discovery in the
1980s. ``I have seen no viable alternative idea proposed to explain
this unique star.'' &QL;

A COLLEGE PROFESSOR IN A STRUGGLING HIGH SCHOOL

<P>
   A recent survey suggested that education professors are out of
touch with the reality of the American classroom, students' needs
and the public's desires. The survey, by the research organization
Public Agenda, concluded that education professors value the
learning process over the right answer and creativity over grammar
and spelling, and they consider discipline a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such conclusions make parents growl and
classroom teachers cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who work with new teachers struggle daily with the
conflicting demands of classroom realities and academic ideals. We
want our teachers to have realistic expectations and appropriate
tools, but we also seek commitment to change and a recognition that
the traditional ways of teaching are not the only ways.
</P>
<P>
   In our program at Columbia University, we encourage aspiring
teachers to read widely and work in cooperative groups, and we
offer alternative methods for assessing their future students'
progress besides traditional testing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of our graduates find jobs in schools that emphasize
traditional teaching and learning _ and the transition can be
difficult. I think of Ashley, for example, idealistic and
enthusiastic, who was placed in a school where the teachers focused
on issues of control and discipline. Ashley found the approach
troubling. Yet when she took over a class and tried out other
techniques, students responded only to the lack of restraints, and
chaos ensued. She was left feeling that there was no choice but to
assert control.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, prompted by questions of pedagogy and a conviction
that, after five years at Teachers College, it was time to get back
to kids, I accepted an invitation to spend two weeks teaching at a
high school in Yonkers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a high school English teacher for 20 years, and
later, as a teacher of teachers, I had spent three years at the
Yonkers school supervising student-teachers. My intent in returning
to a high school classroom was to teach, not to write. But much of
what I saw lends a firsthand glimpse into the chasm between the
theory and the practice of education, a disjuncture that recurs in
urban districts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The high school where I taught is located among practically
identical well-manicured, one-family homes. Until a decade ago, the
school was well respected for academic achievement. But today, its
reading and math scores are among the lowest in the state. In the
mid-1980s, a high-profile, bitterly fought redistricting effort
triggered white flight. Today the school is 10 percent white, 40
percent Hispanic, 45 percent black and 5 percent Asian and other.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to the classroom to see if I still responded to
students _ and they to me, but what surprised me most was the
teachers. Some were curious about me, others suspicious about my
motives or aggressive in their attacks on the Ivory Tower. Day
after day, what I heard was sadness, sometimes anger, and often
despondence when the subject turned to the lack of money or support
services. Yet, what my colleagues wanted most was help in becoming
more effective teachers, help working with their students.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Day 1
</P>
<P>
   I had been up until 3 the night before, worrying, but class was
completely anticlimactic. The 27 10th graders came full of noise
and energy, but settled down quickly at the request of my host
teacher, Mr. M., as the kids call him. He introduced me,
distributed our project for the next two weeks, ``The Taming of the
Shrew,'' and took a seat in the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   I asked why anyone would want to read Shakespeare today, and we
wended our way into a discussion about whether human nature _ and
teen-agers _ have changed much in 400 years. We talked about
arranged marriage, why older siblings always think they got a bad
break, and who has the upper hand in the battle of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-discussion, one child asked, ``What are you doing here if
they don't be paying you?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him, ``I came down to see what the big deal is with all
the dopey Tommies you guys wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, they laughed. Perhaps I wasn't so bad for a
geeky-looking, middle-aged white woman.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried. I spent four hours tonight making up questions,
group projects and character maps for my new students, indicating
each character's role and relation to the others. I have my own
project due this week for a class at Teachers College, plus another
rewrite for my dissertation proposal. Tomorrow I pick up curriculum
projects from my own Teachers College students, which will have to
be returned in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   What was I thinking?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Day 2
</P>
<P>
   Mr. M. had a conference day, so there was a substitute teacher
in class with me. Maybe in her mid-20s, she was certified to teach
Health Ed. She seemed sweet. She took attendance _ there were five
kids who had been absent yesterday _ then she sat down and chewed
gum for the rest of the period. I could tell when I got boring just
by looking over at her. She would start bobbing her head or staring
out the window.
</P>
<P>
   I handed out the character maps. Now, all I needed was their
attention! I told the class that Mr. M. had told me the class was
great and so should be able to do the entire play in one period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. No open books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, OK, if we can't read the whole play, maybe we can at
least get an idea of what the play is about, and then we can try
and convince Mr. M. that we did read the whole play.''
</P>
<P>
   A few grins: they knew they'd been set up, but it wasn't such a
bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   So we plowed through the summary and the character map _ with
small time-outs for explanations about dowries, soliloquies, asides
and why the Shakespearean casts were all men.
</P>
<P>
   We got to the crucial scene in which Petruchio admires what he
claims is moonlight in the middle of the afternoon, and forces Kate
to acquiesce to the false observation. A few kids started going off
on Kate _ how she was a sellout, and worse.
</P>
<P>
   One boy said, ``Most of the women be saying they want their
rights, but when the man says the word, they be bending their heads
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased that they were being talkative. I had feared
silence. At the end of the period, they asked if we were still
going to fool Mr. M. Sure, I told them, why not?
</P>
<P>
   After class, the substitute said she had thought I was in
trouble when I started by asking questions. It turned out ``good,''
though, she said. I asked her why she didn't consider getting
certified in one of the major subjects, where there are more
opportunities than in Health Ed. No, she told me, that's boring
stuff and too much work.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Day 3
</P>
<P>
   The kids laughed when I started class by asking Mr. M. if he
could please get me some coffee. (``Hey, Mr. M., she think she
Petruchio!'') While he was gone, we planned our attack. Mr. M.
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. M., what are we going to read next?''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Taming of the Shrew.' I thought you started it yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You what?'' He played it big. ``You guys don't know about the
_ moonlight scene, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazement, laughter, all very silly.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on to the reading. They took turns, but some read so
haltingly it would have been difficult to sustain all period. After
reading a pivotal scene and discussing it, we watched the Elizabeth
Taylor-Richard Burton version. They liked the movie.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the next period in the faculty room with Mr. M. When he
introduced me as ``from the university,'' several teachers started
talking about ``reality,'' as if theirs is separate from mine. It's
what I'm here to see, I told them.
</P>
<P>
   They began to tell stories. They agreed that the central problem
in this school is that students suffer few consequences for
breaking rules, unless violence is involved. This last is not a
rare occurrence. In the fall and winter, there were half a dozen
reported instances of fights involving teacher injury.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical scenario they described goes like this: There's
an announcement that teachers should make boys remove their hats. A
teacher sends one student who refuses to do so to the office. He is
back in five minutes _ his hat still on. Another five minutes, an
administrator peeks into the classroom and criticizes the teacher
in front of the class for not enforcing the hat rule! I groan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Day 4
</P>
<P>
   Mr. M. has his kids in the computer room every Thursday working
on vocabulary. The kids look up 20 words, copy the definitions into
their notebooks and then write sentences using them. Some teachers
might use the time to go ``on vacation,'' but Mr. M. circulated
throughout the entire period, troubleshooting computers and
assisting with vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of energy and enthusiasm. It's his 30th year, and
he still wants to learn as well as teach. He wants interaction and
feedback and stimulation and support _ something teachers don't
often get, because it is so easy to become isolated in classrooms.
Many of us teach as we were taught, and as we were taught to teach.
But we need to teach differently today, because kids learn
differently.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the vocabulary lesson as an opportunity, I decided to
raise a point. I'm certain
</P>
<P>
   that memorizing words out of context and copying dictionary
definitions is not very effective. Many students, for example,
write sentences like these:
</P>
<P>
   My friend is glib.
</P>
<P>
   My friend is forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   My friend is finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. M. listened and encouraged me to think of different
approaches. My first thought was to trash the vocabulary
altogether. If these kids need to know these words because the
Curriculum God says so, why not just give them definitions and be
done with it? Then we could spend the time focusing on context. I
tried to design a handout that gives definitions, indicates parts
of speech, and then asks students to put the correct words into a
coherent paragraph _ hardly the challenging innovation I'd
fantasized about, but perhaps useful.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Day 5
</P>
<P>
   I missed a fight yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women were involved, one of whom took her shirt off to
fight. Mr. M. tried to break it up, and in the process was slugged
by a boy. The girls were suspended for five days; the boy got
three.
</P>
<P>
   The class was restless today, edgy. I wasn't a new face anymore.
Perhaps they figured they'd been polite for long enough. One boy
turned and started talking to the boy behind him. I stood near them
as we were reading, and he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But then two girls in the back started up. When I moved toward
their desks, naturally, I heard a new conversation sprout up on the
side of the room. So I strolled casually over.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon I was playing the classroom equivalent of
``Whack-a-Mole,'' the carnival game where little animals pop up
from different holes as fast as you can whack them down. Finally,
Mr. M. bailed me out by again showing a key scene from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   After class, Mr. M. spent the break in the faculty room. The
main topic there was a principal's letter to a teacher detailing
the proper disposal method for dead rodents. Having tried
unsuccessfully to get the custodian to remove the offending mice
from her classroom, the teacher had finally scooped them into a box
and left it on top of the garbage can, prompting the reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mr. M. had three classes in a row, and I stayed to observe.
Each class was much like second period _ resistant, even a little
hostile. Mr. M. worked the room, pushing and pulling and teasing
the kids. But I noticed there were some he didn't approach or
touch. Later, he told me he fears they might really go off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now I know why Mr. M. has structured the week like this, with
Thursdays in the computer room. Consciously or unconsciously, he's
saving his energy for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I was critical of the relative ineffectiveness of the
vocabulary work. Today I was in awe that he comes back every
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lunch period for upperclassmen. The cafeteria had
been the site of too many fights, so lunch was eliminated. Juniors
and seniors attend school only from 8 until 12:45 _ with no lunch
and no break _ and then are dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After his last class, as Mr. M. and I were walking toward the
lobby with a crush of students all around us, I noticed a spill _
red paint or something.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed it out, saying, Should we call the custodian? Someone
spilled paint.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me strangely. It took a minute, but then I realized
that it wasn't paint. It was blood. The kids didn't seem to notice.
They walked right through, trailing blood all over the hall.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, a boy from second period asked
me, ``Miss, you coming back next week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I tell him. ``I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weekend
</P>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I might
have done differently on Friday. Why has discipline become the
Consideration That Dare Not Speak Its Name in our universities?
Keeping students engaged and expressing concern for them goes a
long way toward maintaining a good working atmosphere _ but it
isn't the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   I decide we need to keep reminding them of the relevance of the
material, and they need to have at least two activities each
period. Designing those kept me entertained for four or five hours
late Sunday evening. It is taking me well over three hours each
evening to prepare for a 40-minute class.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Day 6
</P>
<P>
   I brought in a few props, including one of my son's books,
Where's Mommy's Truck? It shows the Mommy driving a pickup to work
at a construction site and changing her own tire on the way. I knew
I had my class back when I walked over to one of the biggest guys
and got him to lift the flap to show the class ``Mommy's truck.''
</P>
<P>
   I also brought in an article about Kelly Flinn, the first female
B-52 bomber pilot, who was accused of adultery. We spent 10 minutes
on a few ``Dear Abby'' situations, like what if your brother wanted
to be a nurse or a kindergarten teacher? And, should Tasha ask out
the shy boy in her class who she thinks likes her?
</P>
<P>
   In between we read and paraphrased the play. Some of the boys
persisted in thinking that I was poisoning their minds with
propaganda, but for the most part, they were surprisingly willing
to examine their preconceived notions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Day 7
</P>
<P>
   Quiz day. Mr. M. and I each made up our own, 10 questions each.
Mr. M.'s had five on vocabulary, and five on the play, all based on
memory. What year was Shakespeare born? What was Kate's suitor's
name?
</P>
<P>
   Mine was a paragraph of fill-in sentences, each one about Shrew,
and each using one of the vocabulary words. Among them: Gremio,
Hortensio and Lucentio are eager to ---- Kate's marriage so Bianca
will be free to marry. (The word: expedite.)
</P>
<P>
   Mr. M. was concerned that mine might be too hard, so we gave
both quizzes and told them we'd count whichever grade was higher.
</P>
<P>
   The results were interesting, but not very definitive. The
average grade on mine was 69; on Mr. M.'s, 62. The kids who did the
worst on my quiz were four girls who usually get grades in the 80s.
All four study hard, memorize definitions and facts, and were
probably thrown by the change in format.
</P>
<P>
   The kids who did the best on my quiz were students who usually
do poorly. They may not study, but they're bright. When the test
depended on memorizing facts and definitions, they failed; but when
they could use context clues or information from discussion to
figure out the answer, they did well. Angel, who rarely comes to
class, got a 90.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Day 8
</P>
<P>
   Today Mr. M. and I co-taught, and we had them hooting and
hollering. We read the scene where Kate and Petruchio finally meet,
and I asked Mr. M. to read aloud with me. The scene is rife with
double entendres, and these kids seemed to pick up on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Just before we started the scene, Mr. M. surprised me by
inviting the class to split up, girls on one side, boys on the
other, and encouraging them to root for the character of the
appropriate gender. I was taken aback, but the kids loved it. Mr.
M. and I were soon striding around the room:
</P>
<P>
   Petruchio: ``Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate: ``Moved? In good time: let him that moved you hither
</P>
<P>
   Remove you hence!''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany and Krystal: ``You go, girl!''
</P>
<P>
   We then showed the Taylor-Burton version of the same scene, and
as it played, two boys determinedly shredded loose-leaf paper into
the tiny pieces of confetti that you find on the floor in every
high school in America. When the bell rang, I walked over and told
them, ``Hey, there's paper all over the floor by your desk.'' They
both looked up and replied in concert, ``I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no way I could win this one. It was a perfect example
of Mr. M.'s maxim: Don't grab the rope. Don't take the bait, Mikki.
Don't argue.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to. Instead, I looked down and said, ``Well, let's pick
it up.'' I didn't wait to see their reaction; I just started
picking up the confetti. After a moment, first one boy, then the
other helped. It took 10 seconds. I stretched out my hand for the
paper, but one of them smiled and rolled his eyes at me, and said,
``No, I'll do it, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Day 9
</P>
<P>
   Vocabulary in the computer room. I gave out a sheet with words
and definitions, parts of speech and a sentence for each as an
example. Students had to say whether the word was used correctly
and then write a new sentence using it. The period was tough; they
kept calling us over and asking questions. It seemed as if they
weren't listening or reading the directions. But their sentences
were much improved.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception was Benjamin, whose first three sentences were
terrific, clearly indicating that he knew the part of speech, that
he could write a complex sentence and that he understood the
meaning of the word. But the fourth sentence was ``He is grimy.''
The fifth was ``She is a hypochondriac.'' And so on. When I asked
him why the difference, Benjamin, a recent transfer student, said:
``The school I come from, no teacher ever read past my third
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Last Day
</P>
<P>
   I asked the kids to write a letter with some advice for the new
teachers I work with. What do they need to know to be good
teachers? The kids struggled, unsure what right answer I was
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Some wrote things like, You've got to like kids and then quit.
Others wrote from the heart. Tyrone, whom I thought I'd really made
a connection with, asked to leave the room. The pass was out so I
told him he had to wait. He insisted he had to get something from
his locker, made a face and walked out. Don't grab the rope, Mik, I
told myself again. I'll write him up later. To my amazement, he was
back in a minute _ with a pen to write his letter.
</P>
<P>
   I walked around and shook hands with each student and wished
them good luck. This seemed to take them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Several girls hugged me; a few
</P>
<P>
   asked if I would come back and visit. But when the bell rang,
they
</P>
<P>
   zipped out the door without a backward glance. I left the
building feeling both reluctant and relieved, remembering what Mr.
M. had told me when I asked how he kept going after 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids,'' he said. ``I'm there for the kids.''

ONE THING LINDA TRIPP IS NOT: A VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking
around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his
investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed
silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and
making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a
response.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her
final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex
Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing
herself off as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position,'' Tripp
declared.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of people who could honestly claim that
they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe. Bill
Clinton never asked. Monica Lewinsky never asked. The Secret
Service never asked. Even Starr never asked _ at least not before
Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the
independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the
sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this
country for six months. But Tripp not only invited herself into
this mess _ she started it.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with
Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with
Clinton. It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news
media to the existence of the tapes. It was Tripp who reportedly
baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to
lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved? Maybe she's right. She
``demanded'' to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look
upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her
role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of
the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the
embodiment of the ``average American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation
about just who I am and how I got here,'' she said. ``Well, the
answer is simple. I'm you. I'm just like you. I'm an average
American who found herself in a situation not of her own making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's us? She's an average American?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash. Average Americans don't tape private
conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends;
they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something
illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root
through their friends' sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   The average American is not a scheming, back-stabbing,
double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred
for a politician than help a friend who's clearly in need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining
about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian
spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid
prevaricators.''
</P>
<P>
   She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either. But
she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president
she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young
woman who trusted her.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target
for vilification. No one who is inventive enough to touch off a
scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so
naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad,
depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an
average American. And she is not a victim, though she has
victimized others.
</P>
<P>
   She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would
retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.
</P>

SHOOT DOWN MISUSE OF BRADY ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal tax. Background check. Waiting period. Transfer fees.
</P>
<P>
   If this were an answer on ``Jeopardy!,'' the correct $500
question would be: ``What onerous and possibly unlawful
restrictions are the Clinton administration trying to impose on
law-abiding gun owners?''
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Act is set to expire at the end of November. When the
bill was originally passed in 1993, it was known by all parties
involved in its creation that the five-day waiting period to
purchase a handgun would be replaced by a National Instant Criminal
Background Check System (or NICS) in five years.
</P>
<P>
   No one on either side of the gun issue can reasonably argue that
the instant check is not a good idea. For years, many states have
been successfully operating their own versions of what the national
program should be like once it's up and running. A person goes into
a gun dealer's to purchase a firearm, and the dealer can get an
immediate answer as to whether that individual is prohibited from
buying one.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great law enforcement tool. Although the overwhelming
majority of people who buy firearms have every legal right to do
so, there are those rare occasions when a felon or some other
prohibited person attempts to buy a gun through a licensed dealer.
The instant check is a law that can work to keep guns out of the
hands of people who shouldn't have them.
</P>
<P>
   One feature of the law that apparently escaped many gun owners
at the time the Brady Act passed is that the instant check will
apply not only to handguns but also to long guns beginning Nov. 30.
Although it may come as a surprise to some sportsmen when they go
to Wal-Mart for that new deer rifle this fall, the two to three
minutes that 80 percent of the instant checks will take is not much
of an imposition _ especially if it ensures that a gun stays out of
the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   But as it is with too much legislation, the devil is in the
details. The way that the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms are interpreting provisions of the Brady Act
is stepping dangerously close to unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the law does it state that the FBI has the right to
tax lawful firearms buyers for the NICS check. Yet a fee _ ranging
from $13 to $30, depending on who's doing the talking _ is being
proposed for each transaction. Perhaps I'm reading the wrong
Constitution, but I can't find where the FBI has the authority to
assess or retain taxes on American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A recent telephone call from a Second Amendment advocate
underscored another concern of legal gun dealers nationwide. In a
local seminar sponsored by the FBI and BATF to explain the instant
check system, licensees were told that the background check _ and
the accompanying fee _ will be necessary for folks who take their
guns in for repair work and (heaven forbid) expect to get them
back, or for people who have used a gun as collateral at pawnshops
and go in to retrieve their property.
</P>
<P>
   This is lunacy. The Brady Act says that a background check is
required for the transfer of a gun. Any sane mind would understand
that this means a change of ownership from a dealer to an
individual, not just a temporary exchange of custody. Nowhere does
it say that a gun owner who takes a firearm to a gunsmith for
rebluing, or one who may send a defective piece back to the
manufacturer for repair, should have to undergo a background check
to retrieve his or her property.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for gun owners, rational minds prevailed in the
Senate last week. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire offered
legislation that would prohibit taxing lawful gun buyers for
background checks once the NICS goes online. It passed, 69-31.
Smith also offered and received approval of an amendment that will
prohibit the feds from retaining information on gun owners whose
purchases have been approved. It's sad that such legislation was
even necessary, since existing law _ both the Brady Act and the
1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act _ specifically prohibits any
gun ownership records from being kept in a facility owned, managed
or controlled by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But the House of Representatives will get a crack at similar
legislation when Georgia Rep. Bob Barr's No Gun Tax Act of 1998
comes up for a vote. Noted anti-gunner Charles Schumer of New York
is loaded for bear in his desire to see it defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even the most strident member of the National Rifle
Association, wants a firearm to get into the wrong hands. That's
why the instant check is a good law. Unfortunately, it's being
twisted into a convoluted form that unlawfully taxes and harasses
Americans who have every right to privacy and gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But then, maybe that's the whole idea.
</P>

GM BLINKED, AND THE STRIKE IS SETTLED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors blinked this week, returning the controversial
dies to the plant from which they had been abducted, thus
triggering a lengthy, costly strike. By now, the agreement has been
signed and GM is slowly cranking up production of new models. There
was no victory in the agreement, only the postponement of
confrontation. GM did not learn to love or even live with its work
force, and the union still feels it has leverage with a company
that looks upon its labor as a commodity that's available much
cheaper elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are some mysteries left for us to ponder. For openers, how
much did the General actually lose? For more than a month, the
figure held at $1.2 billion in the media reports, although the
reporters every day told us the losses continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this week, it was reported to be a $2 billion loss; on
Thursday the New York Times said $3 billion. Yet, it was also
reported with some frequency that the losses amounted to some $80
million a day. Considering the duration of the strike, at that rate
the loss is more than $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street is content that profits are merely down for the
quarter _ does that mean the General made money during the strike?
</P>
<P>
   Note that during the discussion of losses, it was primarily
company losses that were discussed. The losses to the labor force
were mentionerd now and again. Never, however, in all of the
discussion of loss were you likely to hear about loss to the
nation, loss to the national industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who remember the mobilization of World War II and
recall that it was the automobile industry that virtually overnight
turned from building cars to building military might unparalleled
in history sense another kind of loss _ a much greater loss to the
nation. As the manufacturing base shifts to foreign shores, we lose
a means of creating national wealth and defending the national
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another mystery of the GM-UAW confrontation to consider.
Why, with auto stocks dwindling and dealers in a position to
auction off that dwindling inventory to the highest bidder, was GM
still offering rebates on virtually everything it offers for sale?
If a company is losing money so fast during a labor dispute that it
must shut off the utilities and cancel executive travel, does it
make sense to pay someone $1,000 to buy a car?
</P>
<P>
   The big question: Where was Chairman Jack, the current Smith in
charge? Where has he been during all this labor strife? In the
bunker? GM has suffered a plague of Smiths _ Roger the Magnificent
Spender who squandered billions while losing market share steadily,
and Jack the Silent who sits mute while the sales attrition
continues.
</P>
<P>
   And what next?
</P>
<P>
   The GM board meets Monday; expect an announcement Tuesday. Don't
expect an announcement of a love-in with blue-collar labor. Do
expect a reorganization and more job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting you'll see the demise of a couple of models, perhaps
a couple of divisions. And a shift of even more production outside
the United States borders. The way American trade law currently
stands, you can forge a widget in China, polish it in Canada, put
it in a sedan here, and count it as domestic content _ meaning
American made.
</P>
<P>
   What do we do when the Chinese and the Mexicans go on strike?

   On a cheerier note, August in New England offers the opportunity
to buy an antique car at auction, take up the congenial sport of
road rallying, or, if you own a V-12-powered automobile and have
around $3,500 in spare change rattling in your jeans, to sign up
for a 1,000-mile vintage autumn road rally designed for the
automotive sybarites among us.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Aug. 22, is the auction opportunity, at Owls Head
Transportation Museum where, as of this writing, some 66 vehicles
covering 1924 to the current year have been consigned for the
annual fund-raiser, New England Auction of Antique, Classic and
Special Interest Autos. A couple of Ford Model Ts, 1928
International truck, early Chevys, LaSalle, Packard, Marmon, Riley,
Jaguar, and Hudson are among the more interesting marques offered.
And there is the 1952 MG TD Mark II.
</P>
<P>
   The auction catalog, describing all the vehicles offered, is to
be available at $40 a copy, which includes two seats in the
reserved bidding section. For details on the auction, telephone the
museum at 207-594-4418 (fax 207-594-4410) or write to Owls Head
Transportation Museum, PO Box 277, Owls Head, ME 04854. For the

<P>
   The rally opportunity comes Saturday, Aug. 29, in Connecticut as
the Sports Car Club of New England Road Rally Championship series
offers Hurdle '98. It is a 180-mile event begining and ending in
Southington, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   An SCCA rally is a competition, but it is not a race; the rally
is a time/distance/speed exercise in precision driving in several
classes, depending upon your experience. This one, in addition to
Novice Class for the neophytes, offers an F Class for first-time
rallyists.
</P>
<P>
   Registration and a rally school begin Friday evening, Aug. 28,
and registration continues from 7:30 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
First car is off the line at 8:31, and the last car is scheduled
across the finish at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Entries and questions should be directed to rallymasters Jon and
Kelli Lamkins, 77 Johanna Circle, Southington, CT 06489, or
telephone 860-747-9514. Or e-mail john.lamkins(AT)snet.net. All
that's needed are two people (one to drive, one to navigate), a
street-legal automobile and the entry fee _ $30 per car for SCCA
members, $35 nonmember. A copy of NER/SCCA rally regulations is
available at $4 per each.

BUYER BEWARE: HANSON LETTERS INSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am going to sell two of my computers. I want
to make sure absolutely none of my files are accessible or
retrievable. Someone told me that formatting the hard drive will
erase everything permanently. Is this correct?
</P>
<P>
   _Privacy Please
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PRIVACY: Afraid someone's going to stumble across those fan
letters to Hanson? You have every right to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   Formatting the drive is generally enough to discourage most
normal people. However, you can bet the FBI has a whole room full
of guys dressed like the Blues Brothers who have ways of
resurrecting all your embarrassing secrets. If you're worried about
things like that, you can use these procedures I found at the Naval
Surface Warfare Center's Web site while looking for nuclear secrets
to sell to Third World tinhorn dictators. Maybe I shouldn't have
told you that last part.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's how the Navy would do it, because you never can
tell when Saddam Hussein will show up at the surplus store. First,
make yourself an MS-DOS bootable diskette on an unclassified
system. Your mom's computer will do. Then copy Fdisk.exe and
Format.exe from the DOS directory to the diskette. If you have a
SCSI hard drive, you'll need the low-level format program that came
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Now go find a copy of Norton Utilities (version 8 for DOS _ yes,
DOS _ or earlier) and copy Wipeinfo.exe, Wipeinfo.hlp, Nlib200.rtl,
Nusetup.cfg and Diskedit.exe to the floppy and write-protect it by
sliding the little black tab so that the square holes on either
side of the disk are open. Oh, go look at a diskette to see what I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I'll skip the Windows NT stuff the swabbies go through since it
probably doesn't apply to you. Boot with the floppy, then run
Fdisk. Follow the on-screen menu to delete all disk partitions and
drives. When they're all gone, create a new partition _ or more
than one if your drive is bigger than 2 GB _ and run Format.exe on
it. If you have a SCSI, use its format program instead.
</P>
<P>
   Now make Saddam really have to work for it by typing in Wipeinfo
/gov:c, which overwrites the drive with twice as much meaningless,
random garble as the Navy actually requires, making it the ideal
speech generator for Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure for Macs is pretty much the same: reformat, then
run the Mac version of Wipeinfo.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still worried, use Diskedit to randomly verify that
sectors have been overwritten. As long as you're doing it the Navy
way, make sure to document the procedure in triplicate. The yellow
copy goes to CINCPAC, the blue to ECOMCON and the pink to that
suspicious-looking yeoman with the Iraqi accent.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and you should probably take the ``Hanson Rules'' bumper
sticker off the computer while you're at it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How can I eliminate the sign-on that comes up
every time I boot Windows 95? There is no reason we would ever want
it in our household.
</P>
<P>
   _ Too Many Keystrokes
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TOO: It's refreshing to see a family that has no secrets,
with a relationship built on trust and mutual respect. So how did
you manage to get your letter through that rift in the space-time
continuum all the way from the '50s?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, go to Network in the Control Panel and make sure your
primary log-on is set to Windows Logon. Then go to the Password
icon to change your Windows password. Leave the blanks empty, even
when you have to verify the password, and you shouldn't be bothered
again. Is that homemade apple pie I smell?
</P>

READERS RELATE THEIR TALES OF WINDOWS 98 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent issues of online and computer trade publications are
brimming with horror stories about Windows 98 upgrades gone bad. A
check of Usenet news groups and other discussion forums devoted to
Microsoft Corp.'s new consumer operating system also reveal cries
of pain.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft insists that everything is peachy in
Windowsland. The company says it's getting a third fewer requests
for technical support than it did with Windows 95. That's despite
the fact that Windows 98 is selling at about the same pace as
Windows 95 in its early days.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on here? Is Windows 98 a flawed upgrade, or are
we merely hearing a small percentage of squeaky wheels demanding
grease?
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when there are problems with an operating system
upgrade, I'll hear about it from readers via e-mail. But in the
days and weeks that followed the release of Windows 98, I received
not a single complaint. The silence, as they say, was deafening.
Either those who'd tried Windows 98 were completely happy, or their
computers were so messed up that they couldn't send e-mail and were
too depressed to call me on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to get to the bottom of this, I asked readers to tell
me about their experiences upgrading to Windows 98, whether good or
bad. I received about 50 e-mail and fax responses.
</P>
<P>
   About three-fourths said the installation went smoothly, with
only minor problems if any. Those users seemed fairly happy with
the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   An Austin, Texas, woman's ebullient response was typical. ``I've
installed Windows 98 on several machines now, and each one has been
a breeze. I had a minor problem, which turned out to be due to old
drivers I was using for specific hardware. Once I downloaded the
newer drivers, ''voila!`` I'm looking forward to upgrading many
more! I've been telling all my friends to make the change. In a
nutshell, Windows 98 rocks!!''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a problem was minor depended on the sophistication of
the user. While this woman saw a modem-driver issue as a stroll in
the park, others considered the same problem as a barefoot marathon
over broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two days to get Windows 98 to set up my US Robotics
Sportster Winmodem,'' wrote one man. ``It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the respondents, though, were in dire straits.
Windows 98 caused major problems for them, ranging from completely
hosed installations to systems that crashed with regularity. In
many cases, this group beat a hasty retreat to their original
Windows 95 installations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common problems in this category involved
Windows 98 stopping dead in its tracks in the middle of the
installation process. This left users in a kind of operating system
limbo, stuck between Windows 95 and 98 and often unable to fully
boot their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these people tried getting through to Microsoft's
technical support via phone, and found themselves on hold for
extended periods of time and eventually giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Installing the upgrade was definitely a nightmare,'' wrote a
Bellville, Texas, man. ``It was on a Compaq Presario 1620 notebook.
The first part went smoothly, but 19 percent of the way through
copying files it just stopped copying files. After 30 minutes of no
activity, I called Microsoft support. Ironically, a screen touting
`More reliable than ever,' or something to that effect, was frozen
on the monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, who was trying to install Windows 98 on several
computers at work, didn't set his expectations too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience with the upgrade from 95 to 98 went as
anticipated,'' he wrote. ``It didn't work, and we couldn't get
through to Microsoft for support.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two specific problems that seemed to crop up
repeatedly in mail from readers and in online forums. The first
involves modems _ Windows 98 seems to be having a hard time in
general recognizing modems properly. This is surprising because
Windows 95 was pretty good at it.
</P>
<P>
   The other, and more serious, involves lockups during
installation. In many cases, the only solution was to reinstall
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   I ran these problems by Microsoft spokesman Ryan James, and he
came back with information that might help users who plan to
upgrade to Windows 98. James pointed me to articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base, the same database of issues that
Microsoft's tech support uses. It's available online at
support.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Windows 98 may incorrectly detect a modem if the
driver on your system is used for several different kinds of
modems. The solution is to get a Windows 98-specific driver from
the modem's manufacturer, or manually detect the modem instead of
letting Windows 98 do it for you. (Use the Modems module in the
Control Panel, and choose the ``Don't detect my modem ...''
option.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem of lockups during installation may be caused by a
virus checker left running, either via the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or
from Windows itself. Virus checkers and all programs that run in
the background should be disabled before installing any operating
system upgrade. It's a good idea to get down to the simplest system
configuration possible, then re-enable your bells and whistles once
everything is working properly.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if users are diligent, there may be a hidden trap
waiting to trip them up. It seems that some computers have a
rudimentary form of virus-checking built into their hardware that
prevents Windows 95 and 98 from configuring the hard drive. Before
installing Windows 98, check the BIOS settings (you can find out
how to get into them by reading your computer's manual) and disable
virus-checking if it's turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The Knowledge Base includes a general page that links to
specific Windows 98 troubleshooting tips. The page can be found
atsupport.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q187/6/02.asp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're considering upgrading to Windows 98, you also might
want to read a column I wrote on strategies for a successful
upgrade at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/06/26/compute.html.

LOOK AT THE DOT PITCH, RESOLUTION WHEN SHOPPING FOR PC MONITOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm in the market for a new computer monitor, and I've been
shopping around. I understand about screen resolution and dot
pitch, but I get the feeling there are other things to pay
attention to. What other specs matter?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm glad you're taking the time to understand about monitors.
Unfortunately, most people who buy a PC approach a monitor as an
afterthought. Or, even worse, they see it as a category in which
they can cut costs by buying cheap.
</P>
<P>
   However, a monitor is one of four key components through which
users interact with a PC, including the keyboard, mouse and
speakers. Cheap out on the monitor, and the result is eyestrain and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dot pitch (the distance between the tiny dots that make up an
image on a screen) and resolution (the number of dots, or pixels,
expressed both horizontally and vertically) are indeed important.
As you've read on these pages many times before, a smaller dot
pitch is better _ look for a maximum of a .28 dot pitch (or a .25
stripe pitch, if you are considering a monitor that uses a Sony
Trinitron tube). For resolution, you want a screen that will handle
at least 1,280-by-1,024 pixels. The bigger the resolution, the more
space you'll have on your screen for multiple applications.
However, as you increase the resolution, objects, such as icons and
text, will get smaller.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a monitor, see what it looks like at a variety
of resolutions, ranging from 640-by-480 to 800-by-600 to
1,024-by-768. On larger monitors, such as 19 inches and higher,
check out 1,152-by-864 and up.
</P>
<P>
   You should also look at the refresh rate _ how fast the screen
is redrawn _ which is expressed in hertz. You want as high a
refresh rate as possible for the highest resolution the monitor can
handle. Look for a refresh rate across all resolutions of at least
72 hertz, which is the point at which the human eye no longer sees
that annoying onscreen flickering. Some monitors can handle refresh
rates of 120 hertz and higher, but you should be happy in the 75-85
hertz range.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect to consider is convergence _ how well the red,
green and blue electron guns in a monitor are able to focus on one
pixel. If these guns don't converge well on that single point, you
end up with a fuzzy image and pixels that aren't quite true white.
</P>
<P>
   Check out how text appears on the edge of the monitor, and avoid
those with text that appears fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to play with a monitor's controls. Most monitors now
have onscreen menus that guide you through tweaking and resizing
the image. Poorly designed menus can drive you nuts, so make sure
you inspect the way they are laid out.
</P>
<P>
   The level of brightness and contrast is often a matter of
personal choice, so make sure you are comfortable with these
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, be aware that the stated size of the monitor includes part
of the screen covered by the bezel around the edges of the cathode
ray tube. So, a 17-inch monitor usually has a viewing area in the
15.5-inch range.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had a hard drive crash last week and am in the process of
restoring it all. But I have a nagging problem under dial-up
networking. A little black window pops up asking for log in and
password info. The window is ``post dial terminal screen.'' Had
this problem once before but cannot find the fix for it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Look in the Dial Up Networking folder for the connection icon
that's giving you problems, right-click on it and choose
Properties. The bottom half of the box that appears shows the kind
of modem you're using _ click on the Configure button. Then, click
on the Options tab. One of the options you'll find is ``Bring up
terminal window after dialing.'' Uncheck that box, and you should
be fine.

DESPITE `ALL THE GOLD,' GATLIN SAVED BY FAITH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Gatlin, the Grammy Award-winning country music singer,
already had hit records such as ``Broken Lady'' and ``All the Gold
in California,'' when drugs and alcohol began taking him down a
disastrous path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a mess, wasn't I?'' Gatlin said in an interview this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin tells about it in a new book, ``All the Gold in
California,'' named after the song, released by Thomas Nelson
Publishing. It's a story, fortunately, with a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his faith, family and loyal friends, the singer
recovered in time to save both his marriage and his career.
</P>
<P>
   He got help along the way from former University of Texas
football coach Darrell Royal and television personality Kathie Lee
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like Lou Gehrig,'' said Gatlin, quoting Gehrig when
the baseball legend knew he was dying of a rare muscle disease. ``I
consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin is a West Texan, born in Seminole, northwest of Fort
Worth, and reared in Abilene, Olney and Odessa. He went to the
University of Houston on a football scholarship and was headed for
law school. But he had been singing in public since childhood and
was destined for an entertainment career.
</P>
<P>
   He began as a gospel singer and was trying out as a singer with
the Imperials when he met the late Dottie West. She hired him as a
songwriter in Nashville while he was working as a janitor. The
Gatlin Brothers burst on the scene with a series of hit records in
the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And cocaine and alcohol became a part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting high in places all over the world was fun,'' he said
this week. ``It's very alluring. But all of a sudden the drugs stop
working, the alcohol stops working and it finally becomes a hellish
experience of having to have it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He found himself at his lowest point in 1984 after he performed
in Dallas and then began bingeing on alcohol and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crawling around on my hands and knees looking for little
pieces of cocaine,'' Gatlin says in his book. ``I crawled into the
bathroom and caught a glimpse of the devil in the mirror. Surely
this reflection in the glass was not Larry Wayne Gatlin, good
Christian boy from good Christian parents.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on his knees and prayed, ``God, if you don't help me, I'm
going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin said God did help him. He somehow got packed, made his
way to a cab and asked to be taken to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport so
he could fly home to Nashville. But he had no money to pay the
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the driver, who didn't recognize Gatlin at first, gave
him credit after Gatlin sang a line from ``All the Gold in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, with gentle persuasion from Royal, Gatlin agreed to
go to a drug treatment center in California. He credits prayer with
ending his desire for cocaine and alcohol. After becoming free of
drugs and alcohol, he continued his career, starring in ``The Will
Rogers Follies'' on Broadway and appearing in the movie ``The
Dottie West Story.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his brother retired from the road five years ago and have
a theater in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Larry Gatlin, who lives in Austin
and attends the Riverbend Church where the Rev. Gerald Mann is
pastor, has a new gospel album. He has written a musical, ``Texas
Flyer,'' based on his childhood memories. It had a nine-week run in
Houston, and he hopes it eventually will be seen on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin's autobiography, which has a foreword by singer Johnny
Cash, is an attempt to help others who get caught in the snare of
drug addiction, Gatlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this book to tell people _ no matter who they are or
what condition they are in _ that it is never too late to turn to
your heavenly Father.''

CALIF. PRISONS ACCUSED OF NEGLECTING AIDS PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Ezra Davis believes the California Department
of Corrections is hastening the death of prisoners with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who spent 10 years in the state prison system and is
infected with the AIDS virus, said he watched as fellow inmates
deteriorated and died due to what he alleged was medical neglect at
Corcoran and other state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to officials at the Department of Corrections, Davis
said ``they have no idea how to treat prisoners with HIV, and they
are indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   During a forum here Wednesday night, Davis recounted stories
about inmates infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
suffering in prison because of incomplete and inconsistent
administration of drugs, a shortage of trained staff, and what he
said was a general disregard for seriously ill inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a man collapse in his cell and by the time they
responded two days later, he was dead,'' Davis said. ``We all
yelled, `Man down,' but they just ignored us.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Eyewitness Report: HIV Behind Bars,'' the forum
coincided with state hearings on allegations of brutality at
Corcoran state prison. Prisoner advocates said they hoped the event
would encourage state officials to broaden the scope of those
hearings to include what they believe is a crisis in medical care
at Corcoran and other state facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just learned of another death of an HIV-positive
prisoner and we are appalled at the continuing medical neglect of
more than 200 HIV-positive men incarcerated at Corcoran prison,''
said Judy Greenspan, spokeswoman for California Prison Focus. ``The
medical care is just as brutal as the beatings and the abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections health services officials did not
respond to repeated phone calls seeking comment on state prison
health care conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But a representative of the prison employees said the prison
system treats inmates as humanely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, we have one of the best hospice programs in
any prison system,'' said Lance Corcoran, vice president of the
California Corrections Peace Officer's Association. However,
Corcoran said it is difficult to attract medical professionals to
the underpaid and less-than-glamorous prison system.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's forum, prison health advocates also spoke of
problems at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``For women prisoners all over the state, conditions like those
at Corcoran are the norm,'' said Cynthia Chandler, director of the
Women's Positive Legal Action Network. ``No women's facility has an
HIV specialist and so no one reviews infectious-disease cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of nearly 160,000 inmates in the state prison system, 1,500
have been identified by the Department of Corrections as having
HIV. But a 1996 department study estimated the HIV-positive
population to be closer to 4,500. Prisoner advocates believe the
number to be greater than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to local prisoner advocates, there are no official
figures showing how many inmates have died of AIDS-related
illnesses while in state prisons.

1999 SAAB 9-3: A SOLID BREAKAWAY FROM THE COOKIE CUTTER

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)  
 (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Saab introduced its redesigned 900 in 1994, cheers quickly
turned to groans among many die-hard fans of the Swedish icon. They
thought that the car didn't seem as tough or as durable as its
predecessor; they complained that it lacked the traditional solid
feel of a Saab.
</P>
<P>
   Since General Motors acquired 50 percent of the company four
years earlier, many of the traditionalists concluded that Saab,
which had maintained a distinctive character in a sea of generic
look-alikes, had succumbed to Americanization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for its 1999 model year, Saab has tweaked the 900 in an
effort to counter those concerns. The car, which went on sale in
May, even has a new name _ the 9-3. It's part of a one-two punch by
Saab to revive its lagging sales and re-establish itself as a
leader in auto technology.
</P>
<P>
   In April, it introduced the 9-5, a new high-end model that
replaces the 9000 and competes with luxury sedans like the BMW
5-Series.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 9-5 is impressive to drive, if not daringly
styled, Saab is clearly counting on the 9-3 to put it back in the
good graces of its loyal customer base. It just might work: while
the 9-3 looks much the same as the 900, Saab has made a number of
technical modifications that add up to an impressive overall
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The car comes with an array of standard equipment and its
pricing is fairly aggressive. Including destination charges, the
suggested retail price ranges from $26,050 for the three-door
hatchback to $32,050 for the five-door hatchback SE.
</P>
<P>
   The two convertible models are $37,050 and $42,050. After taking
into account equipment that is standard on the new models but was
optional on the 900, all but the three-door hatchback are less
expensive _ the five-door hatchback by nearly 9 percent. Prices of
the other models are down by around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All 9-3s come with a 185-horsepower, 2-liter turbo-charged
four-cylinder engine previously available only on the 900 SE. While
the flagship 9-5 features a smoothly integrated and very civilized
light-pressure turbo-charger, the 9-3 has the kick of a full-boost
turbo.
</P>
<P>
   This maintains Saab's hallmark of maximum torque at low engine
revolutions, making the car fast off the mark. The 9-3 hits its
maximum torque of 194 foot-pounds at just 2,100 rpm with a
five-speed manual transmission; with a four-speed automatic, the
maximum is 170 foot-pounds at 2,000 rpm. The 9-3 manual accelerates
from zero to 60 miles an hour in about 7 seconds; the automatic,
according to Saab's data, takes 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The interior maintains the previous, clean design, with
logically placed switches and controls. The driver's area has the
look and feel of an airplane cockpit. The front seats are wider and
have longer bottom cushions, and they are extremely comfortable,
providing just the right amount of firmness without being
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I found the 9-3s seats to be more comfortable than the
bigger, more expensive seats in the 9-5. The rear seats have ample
leg and head room.
</P>
<P>
   But I had a couple of nits about the interior. The optional
compact-disk player is just $100 extra. At that price, why not just
include it so a buyer is not left with a nickeled-and-dimed
feeling? My guess is that the CD player will become a dealer
giveaway to clinch sales.
</P>
<P>
   The other involves cup holders, or the lack thereof. Europeans
can like it or not, but these gadgets are important to many
American commuters. And Saab just doesn't seem to get it: The 9-3
has a cup holder between the front seats that only the rear
passengers can use easily.
</P>
<P>
   (At least the 9-5 has a cleverly designed holder that pops out
of the dash and is convenient for the driver.)
</P>
<P>
   But these irritations melted away as I eased a 9-3 SE with a
manual transmission onto Route 3 in New Jersey and headed east for
the 12-mile drive to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The car zipped and maneuvered effortlessly through traffic.
Unlike the light-pressure turbo on the 9-5, the full-boost version
on the 9-3 was more forceful but produced a ``turbo lag'' _ that
split-second delay between when you kick the accelerator and when
the turbo-charger fully kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a little getting used to, and the only way to avoid it
is to keep the engine revved up above 2,000 rpm _ not a very
practical or economical solution.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, once you're accustomed to the lag it becomes part of the
driving experience, and a lot of turbo enthusiasts actually like
it.
</P>
<P>
   For those Saab owners, myself included, who were disappointed
with the redesigned 900 of 1994, the 9-3 is a welcome return to
better days. Changes in the chassis, steering, struts, springs and
shock absorbers have eliminated the last 900's light feeling and
helped restore the car's traditional solid demeanor without
sacrificing a smooth ride.
</P>
<P>
   Steering improvements are especially noticeable, a result of
altering the steering ratio for quicker and more precise response.
And longer-travel front struts help make the car less choppy over
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   The car climbs hills like a champ, and the manual transmission's
five speeds have a very wide range. The hydraulically operated
clutch and four-wheel antilock disk brakes do their jobs without
effort or complaint.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Saab's safety features are outstanding. The 9-3 has
front and side air bags, and its crashworthiness has been further
refined to direct the forces of a crash downward to the floor and
away from passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both the 9-3 and the 9-5 include Saab's new
``active'' head restraints to help protect against whiplash: if the
car is hit from the rear, the front headrests pop up and forward to
cradle the heads of the driver and passenger.
</P>
<P>
   And the side-view mirror on the passenger side is ``split'' in
such a way as to provide a 30 percent wider field of view,
eliminating a common blind spot for drivers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: For once, past performance really does guarantee
future returns. &QL;

GOP SENATE CANDIDATE GAINS ON INCUMBENT BARBARA BOXER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ GOP candidate Matt Fong, who was written off as
unknown and too little funded to secure his party's nomination, is
whittling incumbent Barbara Boxer's once-healthy lead in
California's U.S. Senate race, a San Francisco Examiner poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Of those surveyed, Boxer won support from 43 percent compared
with 40 percent for state Treasurer Fong _ a statistical dead heat
based on the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In an Examiner poll taken in February, Boxer had a 9-point lead
over Fong. That had slipped to 5 points in a poll taken in May,
just before the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, Boxer maintained strong support among women,
San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles voters and among independents,
the fastest-growing and most influential voting bloc in California.
With two men running for governor, Boxer is the most prominent
woman in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   She was first elected in 1992, after a brutal campaign against
Republican Bruce Herschensohn, and has long predicted her 1998
re-election campaign will be close.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Boxer faces a tougher campaign against Fong
than she would have against the man he beat in the primary,
car-alarm magnate Darrell Issa, a more conservative Republican with
a questionable past that included allegations he stole a car in his
youth and inflated his war record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxer is vulnerable,'' said Del Ali, senior vice president for
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of Columbia, Md., which
conducted the Examiner's poll. ``The one thing that makes this race
competitive is that Fong is a moderate enough Republican he could
knock her off. Boxer has never had good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 832 registered California voters was
conducted Sunday through Tuesday. All who participated said they
regularly vote in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer continues to have near-universal name recognition among
Californians, which means she can spend her time defining her image
and Senate voting record and not worry about introducing herself to
voters. Eight-seven percent of those surveyed recognized Fong's
name compared with 96 percent for Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But a high percentage of voters _ 34 percent of those surveyed _
view Boxer negatively. Forty-one percent said they had a favorable
feeling about Boxer, compared with 35 percent for Fong. In
contrast, far more people said they were neutral about Fong than
they were about Boxer, meaning Fong has more work to do to solidify
support.
</P>
<P>
   To win re-election, some analysts say, Boxer must attack Fong to
increase the number of people who view him negatively _ now only 9
percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they think the campaign could get nasty, like the 1994
race between Sen. Dianne Feinstein and millionaire Michael
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petracca, a political scientist at the University of
California at Irvine, said that ``Boxer may have to do to Fong what
Huffington did to Feinstein. He turned somebody who was extremely
popular into somebody with very high negatives as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali said he's never seen a poll showing Boxer with more than 50
percent support of those surveyed. With a number of third-party
candidates on the ballot, the winner could easily tally less than
50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign aides point out that only one of the past five
U.S. Senate races was won by a candidate who received more than 50
percent of the vote. That was in 1992, when Democrat Feinstein
trounced Republican John Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, like GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren, opposes
state-funded abortions, says minors should be required to get
parental consent for an abortion and is opposed to late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republican women who support abortion rights could
swing toward Boxer on this issue alone, some analysts said.

ILL-CONCEIVED RULES REGARDING SICK DAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A craftsman who works for one of Houston's biggest
companies said he is pressured to take a day of vacation when he
calls in sick.
</P>
<P>
   Companies claim they're family-friendly, he said, asking not to
be identified, yet they want you to use a day you'd normally spend
with your family when you're really sick.
</P>
<P>
   In their zeal to cut costs, some companies have zeroed in on
absenteeism. And many have instituted strict sick leave policies
that leave workers yelling for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The craftsman said he and his co-workers are frightened of
layoffs and worry that the amount of sick time an employee uses
will be a major factor as to who stays and who goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foremen have become doctors now,'' the craftsman said.
They diagnose illnesses, deciding whether an employee's malady is
enough to get a day off.
</P>
<P>
   By putting so much pressure on employees not to take the sick
leave they've earned, workers are pushed to lie about themselves,
said Daryl Koehn, director of the Center for Business Ethics
Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They are sick, but they are telling the world they are ``on
vacation,'' Koehn said. Businesses are sending out a double signal:
They complain about people lying on their resumes, but now they
want their employees to lie on their time sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers get a bonus for good attendance in their
departments, prompting some companies to design programs that put
subtle pressure on employees.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, for example, give an annual banquet or pass out
$50 bonuses if employees meet attendance goals, said E. Dale
Wortham, assistant business manager for the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 716.
</P>
<P>
   Employees like the perks, so if Joe Blow gets pneumonia, all of
a sudden he's the black sheep of the family, Wortham said. That way
the company doesn't have to be the bad guy _ it has all the
employees enforcing the goals.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham said that many of the programs he sees that discourage
employees from using their sick leave usually come from human
resource managers who're trying to improve productivity. And they
often backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies require an employee to be off for two days before
he is paid for any sick leave. That just encourages the two-day
flu, Wortham said, because employees stay out both days to get
paid.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, said Chuck Niederhofer, director of human resources
for Williams Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Union-represented employees are not paid for the first day
they're sick, so they tend to stay out a second day because they're
annoyed, said Niederhofer. He said the program was designed by a
previous administration to reduce absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of pressure on school teachers not to call
in sick, said Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, because of a handful of ``anal retentive principals,''
who were trying to reduce absenteeism, teachers were told they
could no longer report their illness to an automated system, said
Fallon, who represents about 5,000 teachers in the Houston
Independent School District. The system was great, she said,
because teachers could chose a substitute and leave detailed lesson
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, teachers must call in to the school and talk to a
secretary, who relays the message, Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the teachers dislike the new system _ now it's the
principal's or secretary's job to find a substitute and explain the
lesson plan _ and it never dawned on HISD that they have to pay
overtime for the secretaries to take all the sick calls, she said.
</P>
<P>
   HISD press secretary Terry Abbott said it's more difficult to
fake an illness if a teacher actually talks to a principal or
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At the city of Houston's public works and engineering
department, employees must notify their supervisor 24 hours in
advance if they plan to be sick to avoid an ``occurrence,'' said
Faye Cole, executive director of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Workers Local 1550 in Houston. Too many
``occurrences'' and an employee is fired, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To fight back, Cole told the employees she represents to notify
their supervisor each day that they planned to be sick the
following day. That way, if an employee took sick, he'd be covered.
Cole said the department threatened to cite the union for ``abusive
sick leave'' but there was one catch: No one actually called in
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Vara, human resources director for the city, said he
believes the 24-hour notice, if true, is overstepping reasonable
bounds and he is looking into the situation.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE TO STAY MUM ON LEWINSKY UNTIL CLINTON TESTIFIES
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vowing to testify ''completely and truthfully''
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton on
Friday ruled out any other comment on the matter until he faces
questions from federal prosecutors Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to button up and hunker down over the next
two weeks was aimed at tamping down the media clamor for demands
for comment on the latest developments in independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is probing allegations that Clinton had an Oval Office
affair with Lewinsky then later urged her to lie about it _ charges
the president has denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to get this matter behind us more than I do _
except maybe all the rest of the American people,'' Clinton told
reporters in the White House Rose Garden, after making brief
remarks about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am looking forward to the opportunity in the next few days
of testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully. I am anxious
to do it,'' Clinton said, ignoring questions shouted at him about
the issue. ''But I hope you can understand why, in the interim, I
can and should have no further comment on these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Clinton's remarks, presidential spokesman Michael
McCurry told reporters gathered around his desk that the White
House press office would also go dark on the Lewinsky matter until
Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in a position to answer any Lewinsky questions. I
don't have any information,'' said McCurry. ''I don't expect to
have any information before Aug. 17.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry told reporters he was leaving Friday for a two-week
vacation _ ''I'll be so far in the deep hollows of South Carolina
you won't be able to find me,'' he said _ and urged journalists to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not much that's going to happen on this matter in the
next 10 days to two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks might have been as much wishful thinking as
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the White House has sought to respond only minimally
to questions about the Lewinsky matter, trying instead to interest
reporters in a diverse menu of policy themes ranging from Social
Security to efforts to shoo away the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's investigation kicked into a finishing sprint this
week, however, the issue of Clinton's defense, and possibly even
his survival, eclipsed all other concerns for the White House press
corps.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton tried to turn the lights out on the story
Friday, Starr's office was awaiting lab tests to determine whether
a dress Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors contained physical
evidence of an intimate encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also expected to decide by Monday whether to
appeal to the Supreme Court a federal appeals court decision
requiring deputy White House counsel and Clinton confidant Bruce
Lindsey to go before the grand jury to answer questions about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has appeared several times before the grand jury, but
has declined to answer key questions, claiming that to respond
would violate the confidentiality of his attorney-client
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court rejected that argument in a Monday ruling,
saying essentially that Lindsey was a public official first and a
presidential confidant second.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been investigating the Lewinsky matter since January
and is expected to compile a lengthy report of his findings for
submission to Congress as early as mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   It would then be up to the House to decide whether there was
evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Clinton that might support
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stated in sworn testimony that he never had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky, who has also denied such a relationship
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, Lewinsky exchanged her Fifth Amendment
right to remain silent in exchange for blanket immunity from
prosecution. She is expected to change her testimony and outline
the details of an Oval Office liaison with Clinton.

 GRIER-RETURNS-TEX PASADENA, Calif: black action films. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But ask about script availability, and she says, ``Every script
that comes to you there's a jewel of a scene, jewel of a character
in it, and you can work all the time,'' instead of hearing
something about a Hollywood in which women and people of color are
merely afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing to me as a small role. I don't care if
I'm in two scenes that say something about my humanity, that say
something about challenging my craft, challenging myself as a
person. I'm a character actor. I want to be different in everything
I do. I haven't played Pam yet. Most people don't know who Pam
really is. And maybe that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier is the daughter of an Air Force mechanic' she grew up on
military bases, mostly in Denver. She was a student at Metropolitan
State College there when spotted at a beauty pageant by an agent
who persuaded her to make a dash for Hollywood. After small parts
in campy Roger Corman films like ``The Big Doll House'' in 1971,
she landed the starring role in ``Coffy,'' and her cult-figure
status began.
</P>
<P>
   The formula Grier film featured colorful characters, thumping
music, nudity and violence. She portrayed women proficient with
their brains and certainly their bodies _ despite the films'
posturing about women's liberation, Grier often appeared in various
stages of undress either in bed or battle. In ``Coffy,'' she was a
nurse who singlehandedly brought down a drug-dealing empire as
revenge for its destruction of her young sister.
</P>
<P>
   Grier doesn't make excuses for the films and rather wonders if
we pulled the plug too soon, as do many whose livelihoods were cut
short when groups like the NAACP and Urban League protested about
``negative black images'' in films that depicted the lives of
pimps, pushers and prostitutes. She says, ``You have to crawl
before you walk, and we were crawling and ready to walk. Look what
happened after that. We had nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier certainly didn't. She would appear in films like ``Greased
Lightning'' with then-boyfriend Richard Pryor and log screen time
as Philip Michael Thomas' girlfriend on ``Miami Vice.'' There was
the homicidal hooker in ``Fort Apache, the Bronx;'' Steven Seagal's
bantering police partner in ``Above the Law;'' and a lucky survivor
in ``Mars Attacks!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Brown'' broke a two-decade drought for Grier as leading
lady, although her stature was, strangely, resurrecting. Grier had
wooed the rap community as the head-bopping girlfriend of Dr. Dre
in the video of Snoop Doggy Dogg's ``It's a Doggy Dogg World,'' and
whether it was '70s nostalgia or not, the name ``Pam Grier'' was
being batted about.
</P>
<P>
   Scripts are now coming in, more than she'd ever seen before, but
you'd never know it by Grier's response. ``Movements are cyclical;
if I've learned anything in this business, I've learned that,'' she
says. ``I mean, people like to reminisce. There's a comfort zone
about that time that was interesting. It had everything, the '70s
did. It had this incredible energy and creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grier understands her lot. Someone asked her the other
day whether her career will now take off like John Travolta's after
his ``Pulp Fiction'' rebirth, and she replied that, no, she's not
an attractive, white, male actor who can dance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Grier is diversifying, looking to write and direct. In
the meantime?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to explore characters,'' she says. ``We're all so
uniquely different, with unique thoughts. There's a vast psyche to
explore. I feel like I'm just getting started.''

 GRIER-RETURNS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``There is no frustration level,'' Pam Grier
says quickly. ``You don't deal with it. It's acceptance.'' Grier is
discussing Hollywood and scripts, fame and perception, downfalls
and comebacks. The way she sucks in questions and spits out
answers, you'd think she either prepped herself magnificently or
simply switched to autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Bet on the latter. She answers swiftly and softly, concisely and
precisely, sounding like a polished team player concerned about
image _ and a radical, restless sistergirl from around the way at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   This changeable rat-ta-tat-tat appears easy for Grier, who
certainly has been around long enough to adjust the controls, to go
both street and sophisticated, to know the players and their whims,
to have heard it before it gets to her, to know that survival is
based on inner strength and reserve, and that you can't possibly
retain sanity without a concrete plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about her disappearance from film and she launches into the
state of Hollywood and the craft of acting, saying that one never
goes anywhere, they merely redirect and reload.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about her sex symbol status, and she gently turns the
tables, drilling you about sexist ideals of women in Hollywood and
mentioning that she has never once called herself a sex symbol.
``So why should you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the 1970s blaxploitation films, in which her largest
body of work is represented, and she questions what would have
happened had black film been allowed to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about her comeback, and she smiles sheepishly, only to say
that, Uh, sweetie, I ain't been nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1970s _ when Grier was the queen of a string of
films featuring black performers in mostly street dramas like
``Coffy'' and ``Foxy Brown'' and ``Sheba Baby'' _ has she been in
such demand. Grier is taking it in stride, with the grace of a
veteran who has the battle scars to prove that patience and time
are things earned. Who better to understand the fickle ways of
Hollywood, how quickly it all can be snatched out from under you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Brown,'' the Quentin Tarantino film in which Grier
played a down-on-her-luck flight attendant drawn into a sting
operation with federal agents and a cast of sociopaths and
druggies, launched her back into the public eye. But television, a
medium somewhat foreign to her and just as unwelcoming to black
women, is where she could become a household name again.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is the premiere of ``Linc's,'' the first black-cast
situation comedy developed by Showtime and one of the few conceived
under the creative notion of separate-but-equal programming.
Created by Tim Reid and featuring a strong cast that includes Georg
Stanford Brown, Steven Williams and Tisha Campbell, the show's
selling point is, by and large, Grier.
</P>
<P>
   She plays a Washington, D.C., lobbyist who's married but having
trouble. She hangs out at a bar (Linc's) where she's surrounded by
an eccentric mix of characters designed to spark a whole bunch of
political and social and racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks are calling it a black `Cheers,' '' says Reid. ``And
while I'd love to have the kind of success they had in terms of
years and becoming woven into the pop and cultural fabric, I don't
see this as a black anything. It's just a well-written, funny
series about a group of people who frequent this bar.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Linc's,'' Grier's character is firm but fair, soft around
sharp edges. ``She's da bomb, basically, the funk, the acting
diva,'' Campbell says. ``As soon as I learned that Pam was cast, I
knew this would be a quality project. I mean, the woman is such a
survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivor is sitting cross-legged on the end of her hotel
bed. Having just endured a 23-hour flight from Australia the night
before, she claims fatigue but looks energized. She claims to be a
loner and recluse who'd rather be on her Colorado ranch with her
fiance, 36-year-old RCA Records executive Kevin Evans, but when we
meet, she's warm and personable.
</P>
<P>
   She talks a lot about the metaphysical, of taking care of body
and soul and mind, how such a routine keeps her, at an age
reportedly somewhere between 44 and 50, (she says 49) looking more
like 35, tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be true to yourself, got to give to yourself,''
Grier says. ``It helps me stay centered in this crazy business, to
keep focused on my craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier seems incredibly focused; words spray from her lips in a
rapid-fire succession and she rarely forgets what she's been asked,
even if she takes a roundabout way of getting there.
</P>
<P>
   You have to ask how Grier has remained so centered, so at peace,
figuring that her world had to be turned upside down when the movie
industry turned its back on black action films. MORE &QL;

MUSIC FROM A NIGHT TO REMEMBER

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles is burning up, but the transplanted
Brit looks cool. Relaxed. As if the Huntington Library's shady
outdoor cafe were Ian Whitcomb's natural habitat and he'd been
reared in this desert inferno instead of in mild, moist Surrey,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Whitcomb has had nearly 30 years to adapt to Southern
California's endless summers, ever since a boyhood infatuation with
comic books, Hollywood movies and rock 'n' roll first lured him to
America.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the well-spoken Altadena resident has been a
journalist; a KROQ, KCRW and KPCC radio host; a sometime film and
TV character actor; an author of a dozen books about American music
and popular culture; and a ukulele/accordion player with some 200
recordings under his belt. He even had a Top 10 rock novelty hit _
surely you remember ``You Turn Me On'' from the summer of '65?
</P>
<P>
   His latest project, however, has transported Whitcomb halfway
back across the Atlantic Ocean, to a night that made history 86
years ago and endures as the most unsinkable of legends.
</P>
<P>
   When the R.M.S. Titanic struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912, the
eight members of the ship's White Star Orchestra picked up their
instruments and started to play. Warding off bitter cold, they
performed song after song as they moved up the ship's sloping
stern, doing their best to keep the doomed passengers from
panicking.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra's leader, violinist Wallace Hartley, and his seven
bandmates were among the 1,500 people who drowned that night.
Hartley was found with his violin case strapped to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb decided to honor the brave musicians' spirit with a
1997 CD release, ``Titanic _ Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage''
(Rhino). Performed by Whitcomb and his six-man band, the
compilation includes such fin de siecle parlor favorites as ``The
Mosquito's Parade'' and ``Lily of Laguna,'' both dating from the
1890s, along with pre-World War I pop standards including Irving
Berlin's ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``Shine on Harvest Moon''
and ``Oh, You Beautiful Doll.''
</P>
<P>
   In putting the collection together, Whitcomb had access to the
White Star Line's company music book, a total of about 350 tunes
that its bands could play on request. Additional research was
carried out at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and
Botanical Gardens in San Marino, where Whitcomb has been a kind of
unofficial scholar-in-residence for some years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The CD) was not done as a commercial venture, it really was
done as a labor of love,'' Whitcomb says, wincing slightly for fear
his sentiment might sound trite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to expose the world to some of this beautiful and
neglected music from the turn of the century,'' Whitcomb proceeds,
more confidently. ``We're getting near the millennium, and it's
about time we looked back on a wonderful century of American
music.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Whitcomb and his band the Bungalow Boys will launch
another salvage operation today with a 2 p.m. concert of music from
the ``Titanic'' CD at Glendale's Alex Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of four concerts at the Alex dedicated to
early-20th-century American music. Coming up Oct. 25 is ``Treasures
of Tin Pan Alley,'' followed by ``Songs of the Ragtime Era'' (Nov.
15) and ``Songs of the Jazz Age'' (Dec. 6). Whitcomb's vocalist
wife, Regina, will accompany the band at each concert, and couples
will re-create dances from the period.
</P>
<P>
   Having served as a musical consultant on James Cameron's
blockbuster movie, Whitcomb knew it would be a smart marketing move
to open the series with the ``Titanic'' concert. But other
historical reasons dictated this concert be first, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the time the ship went down, America was receiving the
first bite of ragtime, the first bite of American popular culture,
and jazz was soon to follow. It was the first invasion of American
popular culture in the world. It's the earliest form of lounge
music, but much better than what we call lounge music.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauling up musical relics from the past is Whitcomb's grand
passion. While his teen-idol status has long since faded, his
stature as an authoritative advocate of American popular music
continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb began developing his wide-open musical tastes in youth,
when he was the class cutup at a posh British prep school. Never a
fan of traditional British culture _ he considers Shakespeare
``vastly overrated'' _ Whitcomb fell in love with New Orleans jazz,
Texas boogie-woogie and gangster movie slang. In those days, he
says, ``I didn't know you weren't supposed to like Pat Boone
because he'd ripped off Little Richard.'' He also preferred Sam the
Sham to Bob Dylan because ``I can get a sermon from a pulpit and a
lecture from a schoolmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb describes the Titanic era of music as ``very
democratic.'' Radio stations and record labels hadn't yet seized
control of the music industry, so it wasn't unusual for an average
listener to have a working knowledge of everything from classical
to ragtime.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb says he's been a Titanic buff since reading Walter
Lord's ``A Night to Remember'' when he was 14. He was even close to
getting cast as bandleader Hartley in Cameron's film but didn't get
the part _ ``quite rightly, because Wallace Hartley was 34 when he
died, and I'm not 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb's only objection to Cameron's depiction of the original
orchestra was in having its final song be the pious ``Nearer My God
to Thee.'' In reality, the band went down playing the melancholy
``Songe d'Automne'' (``Dream of Autumn'').
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb says he'd have been proud to stand on that deck,
playing great music on his way to the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one good thing that came out of that night, it
was what that band did,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to go down yet. I think I've still got some
songs to sing.'' &QL;

   Participants take on guises of vampires, werewolves and other
creatures of the night. But unlike role-playing board games such as
the popular Dungeons &AMP; Dragons, live-action vampire games require
players to act out their parts.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia game company, White Wolf Game Studio, introduced
vampire games, formally called Masquerade, in 1992. Six years
later, vampire games continue to attract a loyal following through
clubs, including one based in Pasadena called the Sabbat Live
Action Phan Klub.
</P>
<P>
   Killienne Thomas of Pasadena has been a longtime fan of
role-playing games and other vampire lore. But the health-care
company employee wanted to do more than push a figurine around a
game board. She wanted a role-playing game that would further
stretch her creative and dramatic abilities _ something a little
meatier.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Thomas played her first vampire game and has
been an active member and leader of the Pasadena club for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it boils down to is like an interactive soap opera,''
Thomas said. ``This game happens on the mean streets. But it is a
mirror of reality that happens separate from it. ... It's very easy
to get lost in it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's the escapist quality of vampire games that helps lure
players like Rob Marley of Baldwin Park. He's a member of one of
Masquerade's official clubs, the Los Angeles Camarilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to kind of ignore reality for a while, and
this is a great chance to do that,'' said Marley, who works for a
satellite broadcasting company.
</P>
<P>
   LATE NIGHTS: And playing make believe can mean losing track of
time when a story line gets particularly juicy. At the Pasadena
club's monthly gatherings, usually on a Friday night, a good game
often continues until well after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to stop at 1 (a.m.) or 2 or 3, but people
don't want to stop,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night game playing can make parents of teen-age players
nervous. Linda Grant, a parent in Berkeley, was so worried about
her daughter's interest in vampire games that she did some
investigating of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I was absolutely appalled. As a writer, I was
fascinated,'' said Grant, who went on to write a crime novel about
vampire games, ``Vampire Bytes'' (Scribner; $22).
</P>
<P>
   Grant concedes that to uneducated outsiders, vampire games can
seem odd. After all, players dress up and go outside in public when
it's not Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Glendale Police Department did not receive any
telephone calls inquiring about the games at City Hall, Masquerade
players elsewhere have alarmed authorities, crossing the line from
game-playing to reality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, police in Kentucky blamed the game for inspiring a
teen-ager to beat her parents to death with the help of friends.
Also two years ago, a Virginia man was convicted of molesting eight
young girls after recruiting them to play Masquerade.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas and Marley stressed their clubs do not promote or
tolerate such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, rules and story lines, painstakingly detailed in
Masquerade books, guide players' behavior. And when all the facts
get too overwhelming or fuzzy, Thomas and Marley refer to sheets of
paper or flash cards, each jammed with notes about characters and
plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   And that's usually the extent of characters' props. Unlike the
popular ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' there are no stake-wielding
characters here.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's just a game, enthusiastic players take their
characters seriously. ``We don't want to be seen as a bunch of
freaks running around,'' said Marley, who now is playing Frank
Gravano. His community thinks he's a mobster, an allegation Gravano
_ aka Marley _ strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see vampires split into bloodlines or breeds. And each one
is a clan that has restrictions. ...'' Marley then stops to
interject: ``This sounds really strange talking about this.''

<P>
   Police will soon be more confident about using digital images as
evidence in criminal trials, thanks to a new watermarking system.
Using digital pictures as evidence has been a problem until now,
because they are so easy to alter.
</P>
<P>
   But the British firm Signum Technologies, based in Cheltenham,
England, has come up with a device that makes digital images more
secure. At least one British police force is keen to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces are already trying out digital cameras to collect
evidence of driving offenses on motorways in Leicester and Devon,
and around London. But they are concerned that this evidence could
be challenged in court. Police would also like to use digital
cameras for more than just motoring offenses. They want to use them
to take pictures of the scene of a crime. The advantage of a
digital camera is that the photographer can preview the scene
through a screen that shows the final image.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Crown Prosecution Service warned the House of Lords
Science and Technology Committee late last year that ``some form of
data protection and encryption is needed to exclude external
interference and rebut claims that images have been tampered
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital images are built up from several hundred thousand
individual picture points or pixels, each represented by a
numerical value. If the camera uses 8-bit code, each pixel can have
any one of 256 values. Signum's system, called VeriData, breaks
down the picture into an unpredictable jigsaw of small blocks of
various sizes, each containing around a thousand pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The value of selected points within each block is slightly
altered, usually by plus or minus 1. The pattern of these changes
is dictated by a mathematical key, which is specific to the user.
</P>
<P>
   The changes to the picture are too small to be noticeable to the
human eye, but analysis software that has access to the key is able
to check the pattern in each block, and between blocks. If all the
blocks check out correctly, the picture is validated. If the sums
in any block come out wrong, the software marks it with
crosshatching to warn that it has been tampered with. If the
picture has been cropped to remove an object from the scene of a
crime, the picture shows hatching around the altered edges.
</P>
<P>
   The VeriData software works in conjunction with standard image
software on an ordinary PC. Processing is virtually instant. But
Signum recognizes that for the system to be tamperproof, the image
has to be coded inside the camera. The company is working with the
photographic film maker Agfa on real-time coding.
</P>
<P>
   Signum is also working with Hammersmith Hospital in London on a
similar system to encode medical images, such as X-rays, as they
are created. ``The medical area is now full of litigation,''
explains Signum's Alan Bartlett. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARVARD, Mass. _ Toward the end of this last school year,
Theodore Sizer, the author and strategist of school reform, was
sitting at a long table in the windowless office of the Francis W.
Parker Charter Essential School here.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer is a largish, shambling fellow with shaggy brows and merry
little eyes, an ironist with a deft sense of human folly. At that
moment, however, he had lost his sense of humor. He and his wife,
Nancy, had just agreed to become co-principals of Parker, a
three-year-old junior and senior high school founded on the
progressive principles with which he is associated.
</P>
<P>
   The school does not believe in tracking, grade levels,
multiple-choice tests or letter grades. And now the Sizers were
getting a dose of school reality: For the previous two weeks,
Parker had been forced to yank half its students out of class to
take a battery of exams that represents the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts' very different idea of school reform. Classes had
virtually ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion that a small group of unelected people could
decide the ideas that everyone is going to be held accountable for
to me is outrageous,'' Sizer said, fuming. ``Outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of standardized tests, and of statewide curriculum, is
not quite so outrageous as all that, but Sizer's idea of a good
school is far from conventional. As head of the Coalition of
Essential Schools until his retirement this spring, Sizer, 66, has
been remarkably effective in attracting teachers, administrators
and even policy makers to his vision of school as an autonomous
community devoted to sophisticated intellectual inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent book, ``Horace's Hope: What Works for the
American High School'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996) _ Horace, a
world-wise high school teacher, is a fictional alter ego _ Sizer
offers stirring vignettes of just such schools. But the stirring
vignette is, he knows, the opiate of school reform. He openly
concedes his continuing dismay at the resistance the system puts up
in the face of change. ``The system carries on,'' he writes, ``even
when the carrying on is irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizer the freshly minted principal couldn't have been surprised
at what Sizer the author already knew; after almost 45 years in
education, he's not subject to many illusions. Still, he soldiers
on. He spoke over coffee at a former officers' club. (Parker is
located on a decommissioned military base.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I take real satisfaction with the extent to which some of the
ideas which in the mid-'80s appeared far out are now in the
mainstream,'' he said, citing the notion that children move ahead
based on their performance, not their age. ``In my optimistic
moments,'' he added, ``I think we've changed the agenda of the
national conversation about secondary schools.''
</P>
<P>
   School innovators tend to be either former teachers or
academicians; Sizer is a teacher who became an academic. When he
left the Army in 1955 _ he was briefly stationed at the
intelligence center that now serves, coincidentally, as Parker's
massive and forbidding home _ he taught English at the Roxbury
Latin School in West Roxbury, Mass., and then at a boys grammar
school in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He got his Ph.D. in education and history at Harvard; taught in
the education school and then served as dean, and in 1974 became
headmaster of the Phillips Academy at Andover.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer had become increasingly interested in why schools seemed
to be doing such a poor job. In 1981, backed by Carnegie and
several other foundations, he left Andover and spent a year
traveling in the land of high schools. The result was a personal,
intentionally unsystematic narrative called ``Horace's
Compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Sizer described an academically sterile world governed by
a bargain he called the ``conspiracy of the least'' _ you promise
to behave if I promise to ask little or nothing of you. He found
superintendents who prided themselves on their efficiency as they
presided over well-behaved, lifeless schools. But unlike the
authors of the famously alarmist 1983 presidential report ``A
Nation at Risk,'' he did not blame the lassitude of the '60s and
did not propose a return to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``High schools,'' he wrote, ``should respect adolescents more
and patronize them less'' _ the kind of plain-spoken, appealing
aphorism that helped make ``Horace's Compromise'' perhaps the most
discussed school reform book of its time.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer contended that students had to be actively engaged in
their own learning, allowing schools to set the bar of expectations
much higher. In effect, he linked the progressives' faith in the
capacities of the child with the conservatives' criticism of school
standards.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately elaborated nine principles that would guide the
kind of alternative school he had in mind, including the doctrine
that teaching be personalized and entail coaching rather than
imparting; that teachers and principals be able to make important
educational decisions for themselves; that the curriculum focus on
essential skills _ reading, writing, oral presentation,
mathematical problem-solving, scientific investigation _ rather
than broadly cover facts; and that students demonstrate ``mastery''
of a subject in so-called exhibitions, in which students give an
oral presentation of a paper or project, rather than merely passing
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements remain controversial to this day. Many educational
psychologists, as well as more traditionally minded educators,
believe that skills like ``critical thinking'' cannot be taught
directly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Professor E. D. Hirsch of the University of Virginia, for
example, promotes the idea that teachers should impart, and
students master, a specific body of information; students become
effective learners, he asserts, as their knowledge expands. Sizer,
however, contends that children will not make sense of information
unless they know why they are learning it, and unless they care
about the reason. This debate continues to divide the progressives
from the traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Sizer established the Coalition of Essential Schools at
Brown University, where he also taught. More than 1,000 schools are
now associated with the coalition; 253 that have substantially
restructured along the coalition's lines are considered ``essential
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Sizer also started an initiative called Re:Learning in
which governors and state education commissioners agreed to try to
foster statewide school restructuring. So far, the governors of 12
states have pledged to join the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer's ideas have achieved a level of acceptance he never
dreamed of when he was articulating them. And yet he concedes that
much of the change has been superficial or transitory. For example,
at Wilmington High School in Delaware, he recalled, ``a wonderful
team of five teachers created a school within a school. These five
teachers kept riding it out, but without support from above, they
couldn't sustain it, and they finally quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hierarchical bureaucracies are brutally difficult to change,''
he concluded, ``particularly when the political establishment
doesn't care about them.'' Even when the establishment had
committed itself, through the Re: Learning project, Sizer conceded,
``a lot of it was just talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the essential schools have turned out to be essential in
name only. A recent study of four restructured schools in Illinois,
one of the Re:Learning states, concluded that over time the
essential-school changes ``had a tendency to become
indistinguishable from what other district schools were doing and
what the superintendent wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, written by Nora Prestine, a professor of education at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, found that while
the less controversial changes _ learning in teams or the use of
longer class periods _ survived, the ones that more deeply violated
conventional practice, like requiring exhibitions rather than tests
or the pedagogy of a narrower, deeper curriculum, did not.
Moreover, the effort of rethinking everything in a school turned
out to be exhausting; without constant stoking of the fires,
efforts ultimately went cold.
</P>
<P>
   Change was never institutionalized enough to survive the
departure of prime movers. ``Elaborate schemes for dramatic and
systemwide change,'' Ms. Prestine concluded, ``may provide high
melodrama but little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizer does not dispute the study's discouraging conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's driving the debate is the basics,'' he said. ``If you
think that an educated person is a question-asker of a respectful
sort, a lot of people just don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   The essential schools movement is encountering not only inertia
but an opposing tide of change _ toward prescribed curricula,
mastery of content and standardized testing. Indeed, the same 1993
Massachusetts law that established a mechanism for charter schools
like Parker also led to the creation of subject-by-subject
frameworks, and to the tests that Sizer deplores.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer strongly objects to the current effort in New York state
to raise standards by requiring all students to take
college-preparatory Regents courses. ``The kind of serious
intellectual activity which is in the marrow of the bones of the
kids will be replaced by a narrow test,'' he said. ``They'll kill
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sizer has been one of the most cogent critics of what he
considers a mushy curriculum spooned out at high schools, it is
surprising to hear him oppose efforts for a more rigorous course of
study. His position is that the wrong kind of reform is making the
right kind impossible.
</P>
<P>
   One clear implication of both Ms. Prestine's research and
Sizer's own reflections _ and, for that matter, organizational
dynamics theory _ is that schools will embrace a radical new model
only if they start from zero, and will remain true to their
principles only if they are independent from central authority.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary public schools can satisfy the first criterion _
thousands of wholly new schools have started up in recent years _
but not the second. Charter schools, however, do both. Charter
schools are public schools that operate autonomously and are held
accountable to goals set out in their initiating charter. Thirty-
two states now have charter statutes. A law for New York state
failed in the last legislative session. But Massachusetts, which
passed one of the first laws, has 24 charter schools. The movement
represents the best hope for essential schools, and for all such
ambitious programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Parker charter school was founded by a group of local
parents and educators in 1995 with 122 seventh and eighth graders;
the Sizers agreed to serve on the board. Like many such schools,
Parker has offered an object lesson in the limits of pure
democracy. The school was originally directed by one of its
teachers. That system didn't provide much guidance to the eager and
largely inexperienced teaching staff, and the school's format
seemed to change every two weeks. For year two, the board hired
someone to serve as both teacher and administrator.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a vacuum of authority. ``We were a bit naive
about power,'' Nancy Sizer said gently. By this past year it had
become clear that the school needed a full-time principal. The
Sizers, who had long had a second home in Harvard, a bucolic spot
in central Massachusetts, and who had decided to move there after
Sizer had retired from the coalition, agreed to take the job
without pay until a permanent principal could be found. It was the
first real school job Ted Sizer had had in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Parker now has about 250 children in what
would be grades 7 through 10 if the school had grades. Instead, the
children are grouped in one of three divisions. They gateway
(essential schools are virtual factories of neologisms) from one
division to the next when they have demonstrated mastery in one of
the two domains, Arts and Humanities or Math, Science and
Technology. (You can simultaneously be in Division 1 in one domain,
and Division 2 in another.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The traditionalist criticism of essential schools is that
students are held to squishy, unverifiable standards. But the
standards for promotion at Parker appear to be high. To demonstrate
excellence in reading, for example, students exiting Division 1 are
expected to identify an author's purpose and point of view; analyze
the positions taken in a text and the evidence offered in their
support; evaluate writing strategies and elements of the author's
craft, and so on, down through 20 criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Parker answers almost perfectly to the popular conception of a
progressive school. It is an extremely friendly, unbuttoned sort of
place where students eat lunch in any empty space, where teachers
hold counseling sessions on ancient sprung couches at one side of
their classrooms, where everyone knows everyone and last names
barely exist. Students sit in clusters rather than rows, and they
spend time in class not so much learning things as using their
knowledge in a setting that supposedly makes that knowledge
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Everything at Parker is a project. In one class, students were
preparing for a mock trial of the early 20th century anarchist Emma
Goldman, some serving as defense lawyers and others as witnesses.
In another, they were learning how to write ballads to prepare for
writing one of their own about a historical figure (a marginalized
or oppressed figure, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Is this a better way? ``It's different,'' said Leah Tyo, a
Division 2 student. ``I can't tell you all the battles of the Civil
War, but I can tell you what it felt like to be a slave.''
Substituting this kind of emotional identification for hard
knowledge is just the kind of thing that drives people like E.D.
Hirsch crazy. Leah also said, ``In my old school, I was getting A's
and B's in science, and I didn't remember a thing. Now, when we did
a segment on eclipses, I had to think up a mathematical equation to
demonstrate which planets could have eclipses.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether students are, in fact, gaining a deeper understanding of
a narrower range of knowledge is the $64,000 question of the
essential schools movement. (Parker's test results will not be
available until October.)
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the Massachusetts Department of Education sends out
a team to evaluate each of the charter schools. Ed Kirby, the
department's assistant for charter schools, said that on his recent
visit he was impressed by the school's intellectual atmosphere, by
the students' engagement and by the faculty's commitment to
Parker's founding principles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the team identified a number of
tensions inherent in Parker's design. The school has to figure out,
for example, how to deal with students who don't take
responsibility for their own learning. It has to remain
personalized even as it almost doubles to a projected 400 students.
Most of all, Kirby said, Parker has to find a way of adapting to
the reality of the statewide curriculum standards, and the
accompanying tests. Like it or not, he added, people will look at
those results and draw comparisons with other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer doesn't like it, but he is too much the realist to dispute
it.
</P>
<P>
   He and his staff worry about the test results, and they worry
about the consequence of not giving out conventional grades. They
are hoping to persuade colleges to look instead to the students'
portfolios and their teachers' detailed comments on them, which is
likely to be an uphill struggle. Sizer also has to worry about
money. State aid, he says, leaves Parker 10 percent shy of the
irreducible minimum the school needs for its daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   But he is determined not to accept the kind of compromises to
which his mythical teacher, Horace, has grown wearily accustomed.
When Sizer is asked what he is going to be thinking about this
summer, he doesn't talk about money or tests; he mentions the
intellectual challenge of devising a curriculum for students now
reaching Division 3.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of slipping into a good conventional thing instead of
a super-good unconventional thing is high, he said. And he
characterized the school's culture as very positive, quite
undisciplined and often, albeit unintentionally, rude. A good
school, he said, has a strong sense of collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, a great deal to ask of a school; but then, it
is Sizer's school. He may have recognized that he cannot change the
world but he can, at least, cultivate his own little patch of
earth.

<P>
   SOLIHULL, England _ Reversing itself, Land Rover now plans to
sell its new Freelander sport utility vehicle in North America.
Only eight months ago, senior company officials at the headquarters
here declared the demise of a project to re-engineer the Freelander
to meet United States emissions and safety regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle will arrive in the United States in late 2000, three
years after going on sale in Europe and elsewhere. American
versions will have a 2.5-liter gasoline-powered V6 and five-speed
automatic transmission, in contrast to the four-cylinder gas and
diesel engines and manual transmissions currently available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Freelander costs $27,250 to $32,350 in Britain, where it is
priced well below Land Rover's Discovery model and about half as
much as its Range Rover. The price tag includes the value-added tax
required by the European Union, so the Freelander is certain to be
less expensive in the highly competitive American market.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is available in Europe as a conservative five-door
wagon or as a more youthful three-door with a convertible softop or
removable hardtop, only the five-door will be exported to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all previous Land Rovers, which use separate steel-girder
chassis and light alloy bodies, the Freelander has a unit body
structure like that of a conventional car.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it will be an obvious competitor to the hot-selling
Mercedes-Benz M-class _ a model that now outsells all Land Rovers
in the United States more than 2 to 1. Rover Group, owned by
Mercedes's archrival, BMW, could not ignore such a showroom
performance by its old adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Freelander will be one element in the counteroffensive. The
other will be the BMW E53 _ the so-called sports activity vehicle _
which goes into production in South Carolina next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a wide spread of dealers ready to introduce the
new model to a broader public,'' said Walter Hasselkus, chairman of
Rover. ``The timing is right for Freelander to enter the American
market'' _ the largest for sport utility vehicles. &QL;

   With the humidity in planes typically under 10 percent, the air
is drier than the Mojave. That may be why supermodels on the
Concorde spritz Evian on their skin. Now Skinceuticals is proposing
a different approach. Its Hydrating B5 Gel contains hyaluronic
acid, which attracts water and boosts the effect of any
moisturizer, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The gel was introduced to counter the drying tendencies of
Skinceuticals products that are used to prevent wrinkles. But
customers used it to prevent the flaking that jet travel can
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Why use Hydrating B5 Gel, at $55 an ounce, rather than an
inexpensive drugstore product? ``If someone has normal skin, any
moisturizer will do the job,'' Dr. Patricia Wexler, a
dermatologist, said. ``But if someone has aging or sun-damaged
skin, there is a clinical difference between something like the B5
Hydrating Gel and the less expensive generic moisturizers.''
</P>
<P>
   The gel is available through dermatologists and Bliss Spa in the
SoHo section of New York, or from (800) 811-1660.

   Board Game from the Mars/Venus Author
</P>
<P>
   The universe of ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus''
keeps expanding. John Gray's 1992 self-help manual has sold 6.5
million copies and has generated audiotapes and videotapes, a CD of
love songs, a Broadway show and now a board game. (Sample question:
``Bigger is a) better; b) not better; c) who cares?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``You constantly want more from him,'' said Pattie Smith, a
former drug counselor who owns the book, videos and board game.
``The material is like vitamins or nutrients.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the Mars/Venus philosophy _ which holds that men and
women must understand the differences in how the sexes communicate
_ with saving her marriage. After training at the Mars and Venus
Institute in Mill Valley, Calif., she became one of 200 workshop
leaders teaching the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the telephone interviews he schedules on a ``media
day'' every two weeks, Gray, a psychologist, said, ``People call
this an overnight success, but they forget I was in practice for
close to 20 years before I wrote the book.''

   Fashions for Full-Figured Teens
</P>
<P>
   For years, clothing for queen-size women was often dowdy and
unstylish, and Lane Bryant, the national chain store for women size
14 and up, was not exactly fashion-forward. But the company is
introducing a new label, Venezia Jeans Clothing, with an emphasis
on stylish looks for amply proportioned young women.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are being modeled by full-figured young spokeswomen,
including Mia Tyler, an actress; Abbie Kearses, a television
reporter, and Kym Hampton of the Women's National Basketball
Association. They will take part in a photo shoot and fashion show
at Chelsea Piers in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant said it developed the line in response to a study
showing that the fastest-growing market for such clothing was among
women 17 to 25. No doubt they crave stylish clothes as much as
anyone, but one might wonder about the message in the company's
news release that ``it's phat to be fat.'' The number of overweight
adolescents has more than doubled since 1965, according to the
Centers for Disease Control, and doctors link obesity to health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty comes in all different packages,'' insisted Ms. Tyler,
19, the sister of the actress Liv Tyler. ``You can't put a size on
it. If you're a size 12, then you're not any less beautiful than a
size 4.''
</P>
<P>
   What does her father _ Steven Tyler, the whippet-thin lead
singer of Aerosmith _ think of her work as a ``phat'' spokeswoman?
``He loves it and he's proud of me, and it keeps me out of the
house,'' she said.

   Goggles as Street Wear
</P>
<P>
   Once found only under water, goggles are making a splash on the
street, sold alongside sunglasses and baseball caps by sidewalk
peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Rappers like Busta Rhymes, DMX, Cam'Ron and Big Pun have
popularized goggles as the latest hip-hop accessory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having them strapped across your forehead is an important
aspect of the look,'' said Emil Wilbekin, the fashion director of
Vibe magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cam'Ron sports a pair on the cover of ``Confessions of Fire,''
his latest CD, which is currently the No. 2 seller at the Virgin
Megastore in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The trend started about four years ago when a rapper named Super
Natural, who based his image on an amphibian, wore swimming
goggles. Then ski goggles by the likes of Oakley and Bolle were
adopted as street wear.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbekin said goggles made sense as street wear for the same
reason as North Face anoraks and Patagonia fleece _ protection
against the extremes of inner-city life.

FRIENDLY DEALS CLOUD LEADERSHIP ROLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It is hard enough for investors to tell whether many of the
recent corporate mergers make sense. But figuring out whether the
power-sharing agreements made by top executives of the merged
companies will work is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Even the executives who negotiate these arrangements can find
them confusing. Charles R. Lee, chairman of GTE, stumbled last week
while trying to explain his arrangement with Ivan G. Seidenberg,
chief executive of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be chairman and chief executive officer of the merged
company,'' he said at a news conference, ``and Ivan will be
president and co-chief executive officer of the company. I'm a
co-chief executive, he's a `co' _ I think I goofed that up. We're
partners, we're two `cos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lee can be forgiven his tied tongue. After all, such marriages
of convenience are still a bit new for corporate America. Among the
biggest merger deals, hostile takeovers are giving way to so-called
mergers of equals, in which the chief executives of the merged
companies must, by definition, maintain equal status after their
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that old-fashioned command-and-control hierarchies
still drive the action at corporate headquarters. These days,
sharing is a fashionable term, and chief executives besides Lee and
Seidenberg are using it often.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Stafford, chief executive of American Home Products, and
Robert B. Shapiro, chief executive of Monsanto, for example,
announced such an arrangement in June. And Sanford I. Weill, the
chairman of Travelers Group, and John S. Reed, the chairman of
Citicorp, agreed to share power in their new company, Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the chances that these modern marriages will work?
</P>
<P>
   Consider, as a baseline, that close to half of all real
marriages end in divorce _ and most of them do not start off as
marriages of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate weddings of chief executives, the power-sharing
agreements are typically just a side effect of getting the deal
done, not a result of two executives' seeking each other out
because their strengths are complementary.
</P>
<P>
   Executives may have any number of reasons to want to retain the
title of chief executive in the new company: protecting their
lieutenants in the merged company, making more money or avoiding
being seen as a loser in a power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to solve a social problem,'' said Herbert M.
Sandler, the co-chief executive of the Golden West Financial Corp.,
the Oakland, Calif.-based parent of World Savings Bank. ``They're
not saying, `That's a guy I'd really like to team up with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler can speak with some authority on the subject. He has
shared the title of chief executive with his wife, Marion O.
Sandler, since they bought Golden West in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said that for co-chief arrangements to work, the
executives must trust and respect each other, and, most important,
have no hidden agendas. ``If it's being driven by other factors,
then you're making real compromises, and then there is a high risk
that it's not going to work,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives have said they do not think such relationships
can work, period. When CUC International merged with HFS Inc. last
December, CUC's chairman, Walter A. Forbes, entered into an unusual
agreement with Henry R. Silverman, the HFS chairman. Until the year
2000, Forbes would be chairman of the merged company, the Cendant
Corp., and Silverman would be chief executive; after that they
would switch jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Forbes resigned this week over accounting
irregularities at the company, he said in an interview earlier this
month that they chose the job-trading structure because it would
have been unwieldy to have two chief executives making decisions at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt that co-anything is difficult,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee of GTE and Seidenberg declined to be interviewed. But Dennis
C. Carey, vice chairman for the United States practice of Spencer
Stuart, an executive search firm that has often worked for GTE,
said he believed Lee and Seidenberg would develop a productive
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, he said, has long made a habit of sharing decision-making
with his top managers at GTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that Chuck will find this power-sharing
arrangement very comfortable,'' Carey said. ``It's part of his
approach to conducting business.''
</P>
<P>
   And Seidenberg, who will become the sole chief executive of the
merged company in July 2002 and will replace Lee as chairman two
years later, has already shown that he can wait patiently. He was
chairman of Nynex when it merged with Bell Atlantic and agreed then
to take a back seat until Raymond W. Smith, the chairman of Bell
Atlantic, stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a radical departure from what Ivan had already
adapted to,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, marriages of convenience do work out. Robin H.H.
Wilson and Glenn R. Zander were co-chief executives of Trans World
Airlines during most of 1993, as it was working its way out of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. They were thrown together because
they represented two important parties in the bankruptcy _ Wilson
the airline's employees, and Zander the creditors.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, their skills fit together nicely: Wilson had
expertise in airline operations and Zander in finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this particular circumstance, this was the right
solution,'' Wilson, who is now managing director of SH&AMP;E Inc., a
consulting firm, said last week. ``But it does create some
particular pressures on individuals to acquire a certain
compatibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As successful as the executives were in helping TWA emerge from
bankruptcy, Wilson said he would probably not have chosen a
co-chief role if he had the chance to do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A more traditional model would be preferable,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What if you went to work in your pajamas?
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has crossed many a line in the sand in the name of
creativity and publicity, but the latest taboo to be broken seems
to have been thought up before designers had showered and shaved in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   If the styles coming down men's runways over the past weeks in
Milan, Paris and New York are any indication, slouchy drawstring
pants, reminiscent of pajamas, are going to be big in spring 1999.
Calvin Klein even showed drawstring pants as the bottom half of a
tailored suit.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for more casual men's clothes has boomed over the
last few years. But are drawstring pants, made of cotton or nylon
for spring, or of heavier cotton or wool for fall, pushing the
casual envelope too far? These humble pants, beloved of surfers,
yogis and good-for-nothing bums, might seem to be out of their
depth when made of luxury fabrics, with price tags to match.
</P>
<P>
   But designers are arguing strongly that men should add them to
their wardrobes. ``They're sexy,'' Cynthia Rowley said, watching as
her own midweight plaid wool drawstring pants were modeled by her
husband, Bill Keenan, an artist, last week at her showroom.
``There's something a little gritty about them, like you just
rolled out of bed. And they make you seem kind of creative, like a
free spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wore drawstring pants to a law office or on Wall
Street might quickly find himself a very free spirit. But for those
who need not dress in a uniform in or out of the workplace, there
is a good variety of drawstring pants already in stores. At
Bloomingdale's, DKNY's version in cashmere and wool knit is $150;
in black cotton ($130), also by DKNY, the pants have a sort of
paratrooper flair.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly flush, Yohji Yamamoto's black drawstring
karate-style wool pants are $530 at Barneys New York. Ms. Rowley's
drawstring pants are $180 at her store at 112 Wooster St. (Prince
Street) in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-priced versions are more in keeping with drawstring
trousers' shiftless chic. Wearmart, a new store in NoLIta, just
east of SoHo at 229 Elizabeth St. (Prince Street), sells
medical-scrub-style cotton drawstring pants for $68. At Paragon
Sporting Goods, 867 Broadway (18th Street), a pair of Gramicci
light cotton twill walking pants is $40.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, at OK Uniform, at 368 Broadway (Prince Street),
cotton drawstring pants for the medical trade come in a rainbow of
colors, from white and gray to ruby, midnight blue, pink and green.
If you're unsure if you're a drawstring-pants kind of man, OK
Uniform is a good place to start, since its versions cost only $12.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the year-round activities for which drawstring pants
work well, like drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and throwing
away unpaid bills, they are perfect for the one time of year when
everyone's ambition is to be a beachcomber. That is, right now.
</P>
<P>
   See you in September.

FINANCIAL PLANNERS FUME AT THE TAKING OF A TITLE

<P>
   For the investment advisers, accountants, stockbrokers,
insurance agents and other consultants who bill themselves as
financial planners, there is a one-word answer to Shakespeare's
question, ``What's in a name?''
</P>
<P>
   It's money. And lately there has been plenty of it as more and
more investors are willing to pay for financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder that these advisers are in high dudgeon that some
New York City welfare workers are now being called financial
planners, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not call these people doctors, or astronauts or nuclear
physicists?'' asked Valerie Lasher-Adelman, a certified financial
planner who is also president of the New York chapter of the
Institute of Certified Financial Planners, which has 12,800
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've yet to find a financial planner who works on career
counseling, let alone job placement,'' she said. ``To call a
financial planner a caseworker would be just as inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   What has her so upset is the city's decision to use the title
``financial planner'' for caseworkers at its 30 welfare offices who
screen welfare applicants in hourlong interviews. The offices are
being renamed ``job centers'' as part of the national effort to
overhaul welfare policy _ and to freshen welfare's image.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who were already calling themselves financial
planners say the name is being misappropriated. ``Financial
planning is much more than giving people budgeting advice,'' said
Rosilyn Overton, a certified financial planner and New York chapter
president of the International Association for Financial Planning,
which represents 36,000 planners. ``It's about investments, estate
planning and using the financial planning process, which is very
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Independence Administration in New York City (that's
what used to be the welfare department) argues that financial
planning is a key to getting people off welfare, regardless of how
those who like to call their clients ``high net worth individuals''
feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to look at what the particular concerns are, but
frankly, we're now asking our staff to engage in discussion that
involves a certain level of financial detail,'' said Debra Sproles,
a spokeswoman for the city Human Resources Administration, which
oversees the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sproles said that because welfare benefits now carry a
lifetime limit of five years, the workers sometimes go to great
lengths discussing topics like cash flow, credit information and
the potential benefits _ like Medicaid _ that might keep applicants
out of the welfare system altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to get people thinking about financial
self-management,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's move would appear to be perfectly legal, even if it
flies in the face of efforts by more traditional financial planners
to become recognized as a profession, for no one holds the rights
to the ``financial planner'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Certified financial planners, however, are not only protected by
a federally registered trademark, but they must also pass a test
administered by their trade group's board of standards.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, that board sent a letter to Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, protesting the title change. It also offered to work with
welfare officials to find a more appropriate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if 5 percent of what caseworkers offer might legitimately
be called financial advice, I still think it's a misnomer,'' said
Robert P. Goss, president of the Certified Financial Planner Board
of Standards.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the usage, Bill Waldman, president of the American
Public Health Services Association, which represents state and
local welfare agencies, noted that these days caseworkers are
called upon to help people ``move from their entry-level jobs and
out of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about estate planning, or tax shelters,'' he
said. ``But financial independence does involve a lot of
planning.''

being renamed ``job centers'' as part of the national effort to
overhaul welfare policy _ and to freshen welfare's image.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who were already calling themselves financial
planners say the name is being misappropriated. ``Financial
planning is much more than giving people budgeting advice,'' said
Rosilyn Overton, a certified financial planner and New York chapter
president of the International Association for Financial Planning,
which represents 36,000 planners. ``It's about investments, estate
planning and using the financial planning process, which is very
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Independence Administration in New York City (that's
what used to be the welfare department) argues that financial
planning is a key to getting people off welfare, regardless of how
those who like to call their clients ``high net worth individuals''
feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to look at what the particular concerns are, but
frankly, we're now asking our staff to engage in discussion that
involves a certain level of financial detail,'' said Debra Sproles,
a spokeswoman for the city Human Resources Administration, which
oversees the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sproles said that because welfare benefits now carry a
lifetime limit of five years, the workers sometimes go to great
lengths discussing topics like cash flow, credit information and
the potential benefits _ like Medicaid _ that might keep applicants
out of the welfare system altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to get people thinking about financial
self-management,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's move would appear to be perfectly legal, even if it
flies in the face of efforts by more traditional financial planners
to become recognized as a profession, for no one holds the rights
to the ``financial planner'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Certified financial planners, however, are not only protected by
a federally registered trademark, but they must also pass a test
administered by their trade group's board of standards.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, that board sent a letter to Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, protesting the title change. It also offered to work with
welfare officials to find a more appropriate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if 5 percent of what caseworkers offer might legitimately
be called financial advice, I still think it's a misnomer,'' said
Robert P. Goss, president of the Certified Financial Planner Board
of Standards.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the usage, Bill Waldman, president of the American
Public Health Services Association, which represents state and
local welfare agencies, noted that these days caseworkers are
called upon to help people ``move from their entry-level jobs and
out of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about estate planning, or tax shelters,'' he
said. ``But financial independence does involve a lot of
planning.''

PRIEST, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ADVANCE, PLANS TO LEAVE PARISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUZANNE HOHOLIK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sitting in the office he has used at St. Cecilia's
Catholic Church for 12 years, Monsignor Joseph Deane takes a deep
breath and exhales. He is bracing to discuss the worst experience
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Shirley Willis accused Deane of making sexual
advances toward her. She said in court documents that when she
refused his wishes, she was fired as principal of a San Antonio
school affiliated with the church.
</P>
<P>
   Deane, 63, is not uncomfortable talking about the allegations,
but he is quick to state his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it,'' said Deane, who has spent his 39-year career
in San Antonio. ``As a priest, I expected a cross. I didn't expect
this, but I'll hang on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, he vehemently denied the allegations, and
in September, criminal charges filed against him were dropped.
Willis filed a civil lawsuit asking for court costs, back pay and
punitive damages. Deane countersued.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected repeated attempts to settle that suit, even for
$2,500, saying he would never admit to something he had not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't settle,'' Deane said. ``I had no reason to settle,
for that little amount was the same as the half million I was sued
for. It was admitting something I didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Deane and Willis agreed to drop the lawsuits against
each other. A lawsuit against the church over her dismissal
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Lawrence Stuebben, vicar general and director of
administration for the archdiocese, said settling with Willis is
not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to pay a penny,'' Stuebben said, adding that
he did not believe the case would ever go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Petty, Willis' attorney, would not comment on the case
until she had spoken with her client. Willis reportedly was out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners at St. Cecilia's rallied to the priest's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Reyes, a member for 30 years, said she never doubted
Deane's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people behind him. A lot of his
ex-parishioners would come to our church and support him,'' Reyes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alice R. Trevio, Deane's housekeeper for 11 years, said the
allegations took a toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just crucified, persecuted. He was down, just down,''
she said. ``He was just in prayer all the time for one year. He was
hurting real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the charges against him, Deane remained on the job he
loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has always been my source of strength _ ministering to
people, preparing people for baptism, preparing people for
marriage,'' he said. ``It's been a test of my priesthood. It made
me appreciate my parish staff and parish.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deane will return to his home in Ireland for a three-month
sabbatical, saying ``I will not, more than likely, be back in San
Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy here. It's a very responsive congregation,
good school and responsible staff,'' he said. ``I'm just putting
this behind me.''

INVASION OF THE CAT PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Aug. 3)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was an interesting story in the Arizona Republic about how
there are two kinds of people in the world: cat people and dog
people.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here is that cats and dogs have opposite
personalities and philosophies of life. Cats, for example, are
independent, devious, untrustworthy things that, as soon as you let
your guard down, leap at your neck and sink their claws into your
carotid. Kenneth Starr is an example of a cat person. So are
religious evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Dog people, on the other hand, are loyal, obedient optimists who
are unburdened by false modesty, mood swings or dreams of world
conquest. Forrest Gump was a dog person. So are most vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   You will notice that I had to use a fictional character as an
example of a dog person. That is because, in my opinion, there are
a lot more cat people these days than dog people, which is sad but
perhaps inevitable given the wily nature of cats and the fact that
dogs would much rather chase their tails or sniff each other's
butts than waste time worrying about the shifting balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that the world would be a better place if more of
us behaved like dogs, excluding the butt-sniffing part, of course.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, despite his recent acquisition of a Labrador
retriever, is a cat person down to his last corpuscle. While this
may account for his success as a politician, it does not win him a
lot of points in the ``character'' department. (It is typical of
cat people that we would entrust Clinton with our nuclear arsenal
yet would not feel comfortable allowing him to chaperone our
teen-age daughter to the prom.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of our recent presidents have been cat people, which could
explain why we haven't had a chief executive worth a hoot since
Harry Truman, the last, great dog president.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a president is a dog does not guarantee that he's
worth a hoot, of course. Gerald Ford was a dog president in the
sense that he was clumsy and also because he pardoned Richard
Nixon, the ultimate cat president. (Dogs are nothing if not
forgiving, which is why dog people have no chance against cat
people, whose idea of forgiveness is to drag your barely breathing
carcass into the living room so they can bat you with their paws
and chew on you for a few days until you die of blood loss or
starvation, whichever comes first.)
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan might have seemed like a dog president because he
was so friendly and good-natured, but he was really a cat president
in dog's clothing. Reagan liked nothing more than a good, long nap
(a classic cat trait) and, when awake, seemed uninterested in just
about everything that did not pertain directly to him. Since it is
considered unseemly, even in Washington, for a president to drag
the near-lifeless carcasses of his tormentors onto the Oval Office
carpet and gnaw on them slowly over the course of several days,
Reagan simply adopted the strategy of ``not remembering'' anything
that happened during his administration that was remotely
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were a great many unpleasant things that happened
during Reagan's administration (Ollie North and James Watt come
immediately to mind), Reagan spent almost his entire eight years in
office either sleeping or not remembering, a perfect cat's life by
almost any definition.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that dog people do not understand cat
people, whereas cat people understand dog people perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that men may not be from Mars, nor women
from Venus, but that all of us merely arrived from different
kennels. It is an idea worthy of further exploration, just as soon
as I finish my nap.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ It never occurred to me that my son would not go to

   Evan had got into a competitive high school and scored 1,220 on
his SATs. The fact that he had stumbled his way through three years
at Bronx Science was laid either to learning disabilities or to
boredom. ``You'll see,'' teachers would tell me, ``he'll catch fire
one of these days.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't yet, and I am here to tell you: There are worse
things than not getting your child into college. Here's one:
getting your child into college.
</P>
<P>
   Evan had wanted to go (``of course,'' as he put it). But two
years and $50,000 later, he dropped out of the Rochester Institute
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   I had refused to listen to what admissions officers were telling
me: He was not grown-up enough to take college seriously. If he was
going to succeed in school, they said, he needed time off _ to
work, to travel, perhaps to do an internship that would inspire
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilpin, a youth counselor, encourages high school seniors
to study other options. ``As far as college is concerned,'' he
said, ``if you have the courage to opt out of the lemmings' rush to
the sea, you're a special person.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider some statistics:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1992 survey by the National Center for Education Statistics
showed that 30.6 percent of college freshmen did not return in the
fall for their sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of students who entered four-year colleges, only 26 percent
received a bachelor's degree within five years, according to a 1994
study by the center.
</P>
<P>
   _ As of 1996, only 23.6 percent of Americans over the age of 25
had a bachelor's degree or higher, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: Counselors say that the number of students
taking a break between high school and college is increasing. Some
are struggling academically but many, it turns out, are superior
students.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of Harvard students, for example, take off a year
or more during their schooling. ``We encourage students to take
time off,'' said William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions at
Harvard. ``In fact, in our admission letter, we talk about the idea
of taking a year off. We feel it's a good thing to do, to get off
this very fast train that most of them have been on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpin, who teaches history at Milton Academy in Milton, Mass.,
is also president of Time Out Associates, one of the agencies that
has cropped up to advise teen-agers on alternatives to starting
college right after high school, like a postgraduate year at a
boarding school to bring up grades or a yearlong program like
Dynamy, in Worcester, Mass., which provides a dormlike environment,
counseling and internship work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are tired,'' Gilpin said. ``They take time off because
they're bored. They're burned out. They do it because they haven't
done well and want to do better. Those who are upper middle class,
entitled and mobile take a year off to better their college
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Better that, he says, than begin college on the wrong foot or in
the wrong place. ``What most people don't know is, if you have a
bad year in college, it is the most difficult baggage to get rid
of,'' he said. ``It's very hard to move from college to college if
you're carrying a 2.3 or a 2.5. Kids who don't identify their
discontent with college will find themselves in a perilous
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is preferable for a student to succeed upward _ say, from
work to community college to four-year college _ than it is to aim
high, trip and fall down the academic ladder. A bad situation can
mean all or some of the following: drinking and drugs, depression,
skipped or dropped classes, incompletes, bad grades, flip-flopping
majors, flunking out. Meanwhile, it is costing anywhere from $6,000
to $30,000 a year to stay in college, not including the
state-of-the-art computer, trips home at Christmas and a new North
Face ski jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expensive way to find yourself.
</P>
<P>
   In two years at the Rochester Institute of Technology, a school
with excellent academic rehabilitation programs, Evan revealed
himself to be the kind of student one expert calls ``bright
loafers,'' children without the energy, interest or sense of
urgency to do schoolwork, children whose parents always have to
ask, Have you done your homework?
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the poorest risks are students whose SATs or ACT scores
are significantly higher than their grades,'' said Geoffrey Gould,
director of admissions at the State University of New York at
Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Karyl Clemens, dean of admissions at Hartwick College in
Oneonta, N.Y., was more optimistic. ``Parents wring their hands
over sons, especially, just wondering when they are going to wake
up and smell the coffee,'' she said. ``The good news is that they
do, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is what to do with them in the meantime. Larry
Griffith, director of admissions at the University of Delaware,
still remembers his dilemma several years ago as high school
counselor to a gifted athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``As his counselor, I knew that this kid was not ready for
college,'' he said. ``He had not connected academically.'' But when
Griffith tried to convey that, the boy's family's reaction was
``very negative.'' The young man went off to college but did not
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stuck with me to today,'' Griffith said. ``If he'd gone
to a different place, or taken a postgraduate year or gone to a
community college . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith believes that some people _ even bright ones _ may not
be cut out for college. ``I don't believe that learning isn't for
everyone,'' he said, ``but schooling may not be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that is hard wisdom to accept, especially when
parents and peers are asking your son or daughter: Got your
applications in yet? More important, what kind of pressure, shame
and guilt do young people feel when they believe there is only one
possible destination after high school _ college _ and they are not
up to the task?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Danny Siegle graduated from the North Carolina
School of Science and Mathematics, a public boarding school in
Durham known for its tough admissions standards, rigorous course
work and personal attention to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes straight to college from the School of Science
and Math,'' he said. ``It's assumed you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegle, one of five children, wanted to attend a small private
college, but he couldn't afford it. Instead, he found himself
headed for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
(enrollment: 23,000). He began to get cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd fall through the cracks there,'' he said. ``I
was afraid I would get lost. Meanwhile, I didn't think I knew
anything. I knew science and math, but I didn't know what made
countries different.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to defer enrollment for a year and see the world.
</P>
<P>
   There were long talks in the living room with his family.
Friends balked. ``People said, `Oh, you'll never go to college,' ''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Kathleen, accepted his unconventional idea. ``I
think there's this desire to be in a path of your own,'' she said,
``and some people know that sooner, and take these brave steps.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Siegle first spent five weeks delivering pizza
to buy a plane ticket to Seattle, where he got a job as a cook on a
fishing boat. ``They didn't ask me if I knew how to cook,'' he
said. ``They asked if I liked to cook. I knew how to boil water.''
</P>
<P>
   The job lasted four months, 100 hours a week. ``So I learned a
lot about the real world there,'' he said. He saved $10,000, got
off the boat in Japan and wandered through China and Tibet,
Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, Greece, Albania (``one of my faves''),
Serbia and Hungary. He then traveled through Western Europe and
flew home from London in August 1995. ``I entered school just like
I told everyone I would,'' he said, adding that the trip taught him
how to deal with bureaucracies, a skill he believed he needed on a
large campus, and something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled because I wanted to learn, and universities didn't
offer what I wanted to experience,'' he said. ``The same desire to
learn that drove me out of the U.S. drove me back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 22, Siegle has completed three years as a biology
major at Chapel Hill. He has spent seven months studying in Denmark
and four more teaching English in Turkey. When he graduates next
spring, he wants to go back to work on a fishing boat, this time as
an observer for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got paid about the same,'' he said of the observer on his
last expedition. ``But I was working 14 hours a day and he was
sitting in a chair.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers agree that no one should go to college until
he or she can do so with enthusiasm and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   But parents often divide along ideological lines (carrot vs.
stick) about what a child should do instead: mothers tend toward an
expansion of
</P>
<P>
   horizons like internships and seminars, while fathers often want
their child to learn some harsh lessons about work and
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best advice comes from Cornelius Bull, founder of
the Center for Interim Programs, a counseling program in Cambridge,
Mass. ``If you don't know where you're going,'' he says, ``any road
will take you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are six options:
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   An old remedy for young men at loose ends, the military now
finds that 20 percent of recruits are women.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: The GI Bill offers up to $15,300 (paid out at $400 a
month) for college after completion of service and between 75
percent and 95 percent tuition assistance up to a certain amount
while still serving. The experience can put some young people on
track. ``I just had a young man come in who had a 1.9 average in
high school,'' said John Chopka, dean of admissions at Malone
College in Canton, Ohio. ``He'd spent the last three years in the
Marines. We did admit him, conditionally. I really think this young
man is going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Downside: Discipline may come as a shock; pay is low ($856.80 a
month for basic training), and a two- to six-year commitment is
required.
</P>
<P>
   POSTGRADUATE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Boarding schools like Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H.,
offer programs that give students who have just graduated from high
school a chance to take classes they missed or retake ones they did
poorly in; to play more sports, or maybe to mature a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Students can bring up their grade point average and
take advanced courses that could get them into a better college.
``A postgraduate year is very much like what their freshman year
will be like, but very structured,'' said Karyl Clemens, dean of
admissions at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y. ``It helps them
gain confidence and helps them sharpen skills. And it may motivate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Downside: Cost can reach $25,000, about the same as a year of
private college.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNSHIPS
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies help match students with suitable programs
and can provide a leg up in the application process. For $1,500,
Bull and his Center for Interim Programs offers two years of
counseling and a list of adventure internships, like farming in New
Zealand or helping at an orphanage in India. Students usually
receive room and board but pay transportation costs. Time Out
Associates in Milton, Mass., charges $150 an hour for counseling on
internships and experimental education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Going to remote locations teaches self-reliance and
provides immersion in other cultures. ``Those students who travel
and see the world learn a lot about themselves,'' said Diane Anci,
associate director of admissions at Mount Holyoke College in
Massachusetts. ``They come back with an unbelievable ability to
make connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Downside: Some children are not ready for a solo adventure.
</P>
<P>
   RESIDENTIAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS
</P>
<P>
   Dynamy, in Worcester, Mass., provides a structured living
environment, counseling and three unpaid internships. The yearlong
program, for applicants ages 17 to 22, begins with three weeks of
canoeing and rock climbing through Outward Bound.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Provides guidance, supervision and the chance to
work in a variety of challenging fields that are traditionally hard
to break into, like advertising or television. ``Some kids can pack
a suitcase and take off, '' said David Rynick, executive director
of Dynamy. ``Others need the support.''
</P>
<P>
   Downside: An expensive solution: the fee is $10,250 and housing
$3,600.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit groups _ religious, cultural, humanitarian _ can
usually make use of a willing worker. Government programs like
Americorps and private national service organizations like
Americare, based in New Canaan, Conn., also welcome help.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Looks good on a college application, is beneficial
to society, expands horizons. Joshua Wray, 19, of Durham, N.C.,
said he was ``just getting by'' in high school. At the end of
September, he is to help manage computers in a Senegalese village
as part of a nonprofit program connected to the Ecopartners Project
at Cornell University. He is to get room and board but must pay his
own plane fare. ``My friends said, `Go to college first, and then
do it,' '' he recalled. ``But if I went to college, I'd never be
able to do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Downside: Low or no wages, and some youths need more
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   A JOB
</P>
<P>
   Many jobs will pay handsomely for something a teen-ager already
knows, from fooling around on a computer or car to mowing the lawn.
And a little bit of training _ say, in bartending or truck driving
_ will greatly increase income.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Teen-agers have a chance to grow up and support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Downside: A temporary gig could become a lifelong career. But,
as University of Delaware admissions director Larry Griffith says,
``There's a snobbery in academia, but there are perfectly
legitimate hair salon schools. Some people have a different path.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, A CALL TO ARMS
</P>
<P>
   By KRISTINA SHEVORY
</P>
<P>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
</P>
<P>
   When I told my father I was looking for something interesting to
do the summer after high school graduation, I was not quite
prepared for his suggestion: the Army.
</P>
<P>
   I thought he was joking. What young woman with an
upper-middle-class background, graduating from one of the best high
schools in Texas, would even consider the military? I had a bright
future awaiting me at the University of Chicago that fall.
Obviously my father doubted my intellect.
</P>
<P>
   But being an astute man, he knew exactly why the Army might draw
me: I was yearning for an eventful break after four years of
intense study, and I loved language. The military could send me to
the Defense Language Institute in California. I could learn a
foreign language. I could learn to surf.
</P>
<P>
   The local recruiter assured me of the superb wave conditions
around the institute. And in the summer of 1993, fresh from
graduation, I left for basic training in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The military intelligence unit in Austin I was assigned to was
up to quota in every language but Russian. So it was Russian I
learned. Now I also know how to fire a machine gun, throw grenades,
move under enemy fire, jam enemy communcations. I can march to John
Philip Sousa.
</P>
<P>
   More important, during two years of active duty, the Army
instilled in me a high sense of self worth and discipline, and a
desire for an education. In fact, I often find little in common
with my fellow students, who are largely ambivalent about their own
direction in life. I have a clear vision of my future as a Russian
specialist. In August, I leave for St. Petersburg, where I will
study Russian for another year.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, at boot camp, how unsure I was about some of the
more difficult tasks I was challenged to undertake _ for instance,
rappelling down a 30-foot wall in less than a minute. I have always
been terrified of heights, and the thought of throwing myself off
that wall positively filled me with terror. Somehow, I managed to
muster up the courage, and I beat everyone else's time.
</P>
<P>
   My father was not crazy at all. And I can surf.

 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a hot summer morning, Lori Smith, a trend
forecaster at Givaudan Roure, one of the world's largest makers of
perfume, was in a taxi on her way to a pastry shop in the East
Village, looking, she said, for new ways to express creaminess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been searching for the new warmth, for a new kind of
luxury,'' she said. ``One of our perfumers had this idea that
luxury had a texture _ a creaminess, but not like cream-cheese
creaminess. Something fluffier. Maybe something with a berry on
top. D'you know?''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Ms. Smith found herself nibbling macaroons and
biscotti in Veniero's on East 11th Street under the amused gaze of
the counterwoman, and talking excitedly of what the future might
smell like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olfactive epiphanies, new kinds of olfactive communication,
that's what I look for,'' said Ms. Smith, whose job is to translate
what is percolating on the street, in fashion and in the culture
generally for perfumers, so that they can distill her insights into
marketable products. She often speaks in epigrams like ``Coffee
smells like dating to the generation that grew up in Starbucks'' or
``Purity is sexuality today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who has the neat movements and compact physiognomy of
an athlete _ a tennis player, say, or a surfer _ calls her
fieldwork ``trend trekking,'' and it can take her to the top of
Killington Mountain in Vermont, among the snowboarders, or, as on
this day, around lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She had begun her morning with a quick stop at the Mercer Hotel
in SoHo. Like a radioactive hot spot, the lobby emitted faint
signals, and she pricked up her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought us this tiny glass of water in the middle of an
enormous silver tray,'' she said. ``And it was sort of galling but
sort of special, too. D'you know, these little intimate hotels are
like a very `for you' cologne. It's like going up and smelling
someone's neck. And that's where it's at now. Not unisex, but sexy.
Not Calvin Klein but Tom Ford. The beautiful bodies getting dressed
up again!''
</P>
<P>
   How insights and exclamations like these make their way into a
bottle of perfume is the latest chapter in the story of the
fragrance business. Makers of products from sneakers to soft drinks
have consulted trend forecasters and self-styled futurists at least
since Faith Popcorn, in a feverish display of self-marketing, began
``brailling the culture'' some 20-odd years ago. But the more
conservative fragrance industry has until recently eschewed such
practices.
</P>
<P>
   That is changing, as more than 1,100 perfumes crowd the
marketplace and companies fight for new customers in a $5 billion
industry. ``Gurus, prognosticators, trend spotters, whatever you
want to call them, help companies look at where the business is
going,'' said Ann Gottlieb, an industry consultant, whose clients
range from Calvin Klein to Christian Dior.
</P>
<P>
   A wake-up call was the surprise success in 1995 of CK One, the
unisex fragrance from Calvin Klein for urban 20-somethings. It was
a market that had been largely untapped. ``I was like, Hello, young
people!'' said Kathleen Montrose, vice president of marketing for
Firmenich, another fragrance company. ``That whole tribe thing was
very on target sociodemographically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith recently prodded her own employer, Givaudan Roure, to
develop a fragrance for teen-age surfer girls, or at least girls
who would like to be surfers, and to find a retail client to market
it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born Hula Scent from Roxy Quiksilver, due in stores
this fall. It smells, she said, a little like a beach, a little
woody (like an old wooden long board) and a little like the ocean
breeze off California. ``Which is sort of citrusy,'' Ms. Smith
added, ``and it's there because when I asked surfers what they
thought about when they were waiting for the next wave, they
described this smell.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth market is a moving target, notoriously difficult to
get a fix on, but Ms. Smith _ even though she is 36 and a graduate
of the Wharton School of Business _ is an expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori told us that the New Age consumer _ Generation Y or
whatever you want to call it _ is very comfortable with chemicals,
which is a complete switch from the Gen X
unbleached-linen-botanicals thing,'' Geoffrey Webster, president
and general manager of Givaudan Roure, said. ``So maybe now a
perfume has a silicone base instead of a natural one. Total
reversal! But these are the kids we have to bring in. Because once
you get a group to experience the joy of personal fragrance, they
don't ever go back.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the forthcoming Roxy scent, Ms. Smith has
contributed to fragrances like Michael Jordan's cologne and Polo
Extreme. ``What I do is bring the outside world in,'' she said. If
perfumers are the noses of the fragrance business, trend
forecasters are its eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes her field reports affect a perfume's scent, like Polo
Extreme, which contains a pepper note that is a perfumer's response
to Ms. Smith's suggestion that the fragrance be ``spiky and peaky,
like an adrenaline rush, the thing that links people involved in
extreme sports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes her reports affect the way a perfume is sold, or where
it is sold (surf shops, in the case of Roxy). And sometimes, said
Webster, her boss, her reports have no overt effect at all.
``Except that they affect the way we all think about the changing
culture, and that affects the perfumers in the mid- and
long-term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the industry were skeptical about the value of
futurists, trend-forecasters and assorted cool-hunters. ``If people
really knew how to predict things that are sensory, there would be
no failures,'' said Allan Mottus, publisher of The Informationist,
a fragrance-industry newsletter. ``Great successes are usually
initiated by intuition, not trend forecasting. Of course, what
happens is that when there's a huge success, like a CK One,
everybody goes running backward and tries to spin around it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A word on how the business works. The companies that stamp their
names and images on fragrances _ the Estee Lauders and Ralph
Laurens _ don't actually make the juice in the bottles, although
they collaborate. Almost every major scent is concocted by one of
four specialized companies, a group that includes Givaudan Roure,
International Flavors and Fragrances, Quest International and
Firmenich.
</P>
<P>
   Perfumers at the fragrance companies blend together fragrances
from personal collections of scents they've created in response to
a variety of things that may or may not include cultural trends, as
well as intuition _ how the creaminess of a macaroon may signal a
new sort of luxury, and what that may smell like.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping the crumbs from her mouth, Ms. Smith darted out of
Veniero's and race-walked south on First Avenue. A homeless man
careened into her. ``Peach,'' he whispered, and stumbled away.
``Did he really say that? Wow!'' Ms. Smith said. ``Fruit is so big
now. We had a grapefruit meeting the other day, and we're all like,
`Oh, man, this is the best part, or that is.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the future?'' she asked out loud. ``That biscuit we
smelled and ate. The smell of a supernatural color. A super
grapefruit. Something crazy in the mix, like disco lemonade,'' she
sang.
</P>
<P>
   Like designers trying to anticipate what hemlines or colors will
appeal a year from now, Ms. Smith and her colleagues have their
eyes fixed over the horizon of what is currently in stores. If
Mount Everest was yesterday's destination, its aroma may be
tomorrow's perfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragrance has left the realm of what it was originally, an
expression of character, and entered the realms of fashion and
experience and beyond,'' said Paul Austin, business development
manager and trend forecaster at Quest, the fragrance company.
</P>
<P>
   Once a forecaster nails a trend, a perfumer has a host of ways
of responding to it. One is to use head-space technology _
essentially sampling the air around a flower, or the breeze off the
Pacific Ocean, and reproducing the aroma in a laboratory. Givaudan
Roure has developed a machine called ScentTrek; nestled in hot-air
balloons the company has sent whizzing over the top of rain
forests, it forages for new smells.
</P>
<P>
   International Flavors and Fragrances used a similar technology
for its client Rei Kawakubo, the designer of Comme des Garcons,
whose new perfume, Odeur 53, contains notes of burnt rubber, sand
dunes and plastic baby dolls. So much for the language of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Joffe, managing director of Comme des Garcons and Ms.
Kawakubo's husband, said Odeur 53 was not a perfume but ``a
sequence of smells and associations.'' The company is advertising
it as an ``anti-perfume.''
</P>
<P>
   Through extensive polling, the folks at Quest can tell what
ingredients smell like peace or sex or clean laundry to the
majority of the population. Forecasters like Austin graze the
culture for trends, match them up with the database of stored
associations-as-smells and hope that a perfume star is born.
</P>
<P>
   Both Austin and Ms. Smith like to give the trends they spot
snappy names. Austin has identified 38, including ones called
Master of Time and High-Tech Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's First Aid. ``It's the whole idea of looking to the
pharmacy for inspiration, looking for something that's clinically
pure and perhaps anti-nature,'' he said. ``It's a mini-millennial
concept that also incorporates the notion of white. We saw a lot of
white gauzes in the fashion collections, and then there were those
Helmut Lang slashes, those wounds. A friend of mine said we're all
licking our wounds from being fashion victims. So we're exploring
smells that would create a germ-free aura.''
</P>
<P>
   At Broadway and Prince Street, Ms. Smith flourished a tiny paper
blotter like a little gift. ``Snap Green Bean! Can you feel the
snap?'' she asked. ``Can you hear it? This came from a trend we
called Veggie Values _ which arose from the fact that kids will
identify themselves as vegetarian even if they're not. It's like a
badge of identification for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dean &AMP; Deluca she stopped to sample some sorbets made by a
company called Out of a Flower _ Grapefruit Tarragon, Tequila
Cilantro _ because they reminded her of a DJ mixing different
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith reached into her handbag and brought out little pots
of powder. Touch Lycra, Air, Velvet the labels read. ``We
challenged the perfumers to create millennial materials, to mix up
the form,'' she said. ``I talked about things like lily of the
valley in a pill. And this is what came back.'' The powder felt
soft and shone on the back of a hand. It smelled terrific.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks south, in a clothing store called Yellow Rat
Bastard, Ms. Smith fondled a pair of cargo pants. Yellow Rat
Bastard spoke to Ms. Smith because ``it's about having all your
stuff on you,'' she said. ``Just look at all those pockets and
flaps and things,'' she added, pointing to the pants.
``Pro-function, that's big.''
</P>
<P>
   With its reggae soundtrack and plastic fruit displays, the store
also makes a brave show of surf culture, an environment _ nay, a
movement _ Ms. Smith is staunchly behind. ``A few months ago, I got
hit in the head by a freaking surfboard in Paris,'' she said.
``Paris. And then I'm in London a week later and there's one on top
of a car. I'm like, whoa! The beach is about peace, and everybody
wants some of that. It's about smelling the beach on the street,
and we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another little blotter appeared. ``We were in Costa Rica,'' she
said, ``and we found this beach _ here it is.'' The blotter smelled
like air, and the foam on the waves, and something else _ something
indefinable. It cut right through the sickly sweet smell from a
peanut stand on the corner. Perhaps it was the smell of the future.

`LOLITA' TURNS 40, STILL ARGUING FOR A RIGHT TO EXIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vladimir Nabokov promised that ``Lolita,'' his thin novel about
a pedophile named Humbert Humbert and a 12-year-old nymphet named
Delores Haze, had ``no moral in tow.'' He was interested only in
what he called the ``esthetic bliss'' of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the first 34 pages of ``Lolita,'' Nabokov playfully
planted a handful of moral justifications. The first one appeared
in the foreword, written by the fictional Prof. John Ray Jr., Ph.D.
The professor predicted the story would make parents more vigilant
and would lead to a ``safer world.''
</P>
<P>
   The second justification, a kind of ``inner child'' defense, was
given by Humbert himself. He said his Lo lust was a desperate
attempt to recover a lost childhood love. As a boy of 14, he fell
``madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love'' with a
13-year-old girl named Annabel Leigh, who tragically died of typhus
shortly after their first tryst. (Nabokov originally titled his
novel ``The Kingdom by the Sea,'' after a line in Edgar Allan Poe's
poem ``Annabel Lee.'')
</P>
<P>
   As these prescient parodies indicate, Nabokov realized that his
``Lolita'' would unleash a flood of sober, high-minded
interpretations telling us why, aside from pure ``esthetic bliss,''
Humbert's lecherous course deserves our undivided attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s the passion for finding important moral lessons
buried in ``Lolita'' was fed by the moral attacks against the book.
The book was turned down by four American publishers before Olympia
Press, a French press best known for its smut, published ``Lolita''
in 1955. Shortly thereafter, the book was banned in France.
Finally, in 1958, an American publisher, G.P. Putnam's Sons, picked
it up.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent wave of moral defense was sparked, yet again, by
moral outrage against ``Lolita.'' In 1997, while Adrian Lyne, the
director of the new movie version of ``Lolita,'' searched for an
American distributor, Norman Podhoretz wrote in Commentary that
``Lolita'' bore ``some share of the blame for the plague of
pedophilia.'' Now, after much waiting and a brand new layer of
moral justifications, the new ``Lolita'' will be shown on Showtime
Sunday night and released in theaters in September. Here are the
lessons of ``Lolita'' in their 1950s and 1990s versions.
</P>
<P>
   Lolita is a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said ``Lolita'' carried a warning: ``The wayward child, the
egotistic mother, the panting maniac _ these are not only vivid
characters in a unique story; they warn us of dangerous trends;
they point out potent evils. Lolita should make all of us _
parents, social workers, educators _ apply ourselves with still
greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better
generation in a safer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the philosopher Colin McGinn made a similar argument
in an essay titled ``The Moral Case for `Lolita,' '' in The Times
Literary Supplement: ``This is not a prettification or celebration
or endorsement of Humbert's actions. . . . It is an open expression
of misery, remorse, guilt and regret. . . . The book sees right
into the heart of Humbert's deceptiveness, brutality and depravity;
in no sense does it seek to excuse or mitigate them. . . . We are
never for a moment encouraged to approve of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   All men are Humberts.
</P>
<P>
   This logic was first given by Humbert himself, when he says he
is not the first man to fall in love with a child: ``After all,
Dante fell madly in love with his Beatrice when she was 9, a
sparkling girleen, painted and lovely. ... And when Petrarch fell
madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of 12
running in the wind, in the pollen and dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the director of the new ``Lolita'' movie, Adrian Lyne,
seconded that emotion: ``The hideous truth is nice people in the
end are pedophiles. I mean I think many adults are attracted to
somebody who is not of the legal age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' is a history lesson in which Humbert is Europe and
Lolita is America.
</P>
<P>
   This reading was offered by Harry Levin, a famous professor of
literature at Harvard, when Lolita first came out: ``Lolita'' is
``a symbol of the aging European intellectual coming to America,
falling in love with it but finding it, sadly, a little immature.''
</P>
<P>
   The same idea was radically elaborated by Douglas Anderson, a
professor of English at the University of Georgia, in Mosaic
magazine in Canada last year: ``Through the novel's rich
amalgamation of postwar America with prewar Europe, Nabokov
succeeds in linking an unbearable memory of genocidal holocaust
with elements of the prospective holocaust generated by modern
physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbert is the embodiment of selfish love.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 Elizabeth Janeway wrote in The New York Times Book
Review that Nabokov's purpose was ``to underline the essential,
inefficient, painstaking and pain-giving selfishness of all
passion, all greed _ of all urges, whatever they may be, that
insist on being satisfied without regard to the effect their
satisfaction has upon the outside world. Humbert is all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in The New Yorker, Roger Angell, writing about
Humbert, echoed that line: ``For all its glittering distractions
and diversions, this is a love story, after all. . . . We can
forgive him now, perhaps even tearily, because we recognize that it
is not obsession but delusion that has brought him down _ the
oldest delusion in the world but one we have all suffered from at
one time or another, and with any luck, may fall victim to again
any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert called Lolita ``the ideal consumer, the subject and
object of every foul poster.'' Damon Trent sounded the same theme
while writing about ``the new Lolitocracy'' in Spy Magazine last
year. ``In the last five years, our own civilization has developed
a bit of a thing for teen-age girls'' and girls know it. Indeed, he
added, ``every man, woman and child among us has become a vile,
pustulating pedophile.''
</P>
<P>
   In this stew of allegorical, sociological, high-minded
speculation, you've got to admire Groucho Marx's ineluctably moral
position on the novel: ``I am going to put off reading `Lolita' for
six years, till she's 18.''

THE ELEVATOR AS CIRCUS, AND CONFESSIONAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)

   (italics)Office-building elevators may provide a relatively
short ride to work, but they go a long way toward contributing to
the human comedy. Some passengers have nothing to do but listen;
others take the opportunity to have some fun with all those people
pretending they are unaware of their fellow passengers. And
sometimes a ride on a elevator can be a journey toward
enlightenment.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an elevator in a tall office building on Park Avenue, two
young Citicorp executives were talking one day in the early 1980s
when they were overheard by Paige Churchman of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One of them said, ``I used to have a ... ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause while the car descended at least half a floor.
</P>
<P>
   Then it came to him.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... photographic memory.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Carrier of Los Angeles and an office acquaintance use
their elevator time to catch up on personal news.
</P>
<P>
   One day, her friend asked, ``Do you have any children yet?''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Carrier, whose husband, George, is a lawyer, replied,
``No, not yet, but we'd love to start a family.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the acquaintance responded, ``And is your husband still
practicing?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carrier, astonished that the woman would ask such a personal
question in a crowded elevator, retorted, ``Yes, he's still
practicing, and one of these days he's going to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   And her friend said, ``I meant practicing (italics)law.''(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd broke into laughter, Ms. Carrier says she made a
quick escape _ to the wrong floor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk, they say, is cheap. But those who say it may want to
reconsider after listening to the story of James M. Marsh of
Rosemont, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Marsh was based in Philadelphia and
assigned by the Army to renegotiate military contracts on which
excessive profits were being made.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Marsh, a chief warrant officer, was in an elevator
downtown with his commanding officer. They found themselves in the
presence of two well-dressed men.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you doing?'' one said to the other.
</P>
<P>
   And the reply came: ``We're making so much money it scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's commander recognized the second speaker as the president
of a wire manufacturing company. When they returned to their
office, Marsh was ordered to send the man's company a notice of
renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're making wire today, the Signal Corps is paying for
it,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   The company responded to the order, reported for a discussion of
its pricing and agreed to refund the government $250,000. &QL;

<P>
   They didn't call Mark Vasconcellos jigoku-mimi for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he says, is how it happened:
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Vasconcellos, as a lending officer at a
major Japanese bank in Manhattan, was in the habit of having lunch
with his best friend, who was working in the treasurer's office of
a major New York bank with headquarters just up the street. They
met in its cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as Vasconcellos entered the elevator to return to his
office, two Japanese employees of the friend's bank were discussing
a multibillion-dollar deal, which happened to be one that
Vasconcellos was asked to bid on.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that he didn't understand Japanese, they were comparing
notes on their absolute rock-bottom bid.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Vasconcellos did understand Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to return to my office and undercut their bid by
less than one penny,'' he writes. ``My bank got the business, and I
was thenceforth nicknamed jigoku-mimi by my colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you knew the translation all along: hell ears. &QL;

 &HT;    Touched by the devil
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernice Butler saw the devil at a church service in Brunswick,
Georgia four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The scene she describes is only slightly less dramatic than the
famous film ``The Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   During a worship service at a revival where Butler's father was
preaching, a woman and her family came into the church and asked
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said the devil was in her,'' said Butler, 34. ``She was
mutilating animals, setting fires, cursing people and getting in
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the sanctuary, Butler's father, who is a Church
of God minister, and some of the men of the church gathered around
the woman. They prayed for her, blessed her and anointed her with
holy water, while the woman's eyes bulged, saliva came out of her
mouth, and she made animal sounds, Butler recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to me. Her voice changed. She began talking
normally. She was even walking differently,'' Butler said. Butler's
father called the exercise ``(re)'buking the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me a believer,'' said Butler. ``I've seen this with my
own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler was one of a majority of Southerners in a recent Southern
Focus Poll who said they believe people on Earth are sometimes
possessed by the devil. In the poll, conducted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and the University of North Carolina, 61
percent of Southerners _ 71 percent of those who say they attend
church weekly _ expressed that belief. Outside the South, 45
percent of those questioned said they believe in devil possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil has many minions and people can be possessed by
demonic spirits,'' said poll respondent Clifton Walker, 38, of
Dallas, Ga. Walker, an upholsterer who goes to church ``a couple of
times a year,'' sees demonic possession as part of ``the ultimate
battle between good and evil that we all fight every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is as real to me as the Lord is,'' said Linda
Kimsey, 50, a Baptist who works as a transcriptionist in
Loganville. ``He likes nothing better than to cause trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   An acceptance of demon possession is ``an extension of the
general Southern view that the devil is very real, the devil has
great power and is vibrantly at work in the world,'' said Samuel S.
Hill, professor emeritus of religion at the University of Florida.
``You can extend that to the devil (who) is as active in trying to
possess my life as the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Christianity, the practice of exorcism goes back to Jesus
himself. The Christian Gospels include accounts of Jesus casting
demons out of a man having convulsions in the synagogue (Mark 1), a
violent man from ``the country of the Gerasenes'' (Mark 5), and a
boy who fell to the ground foaming at the mouth (Mark 9), for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most mainline Protestant groups give little attention to
specific doctrines of demonology. In one exception, two years after
the 1973 debut of the movie ``The Exorcist,'' the then-Southern
branch of the Presbyterian Church issued a statement that
acknowledged the ``reality of powers of evil,'' but said the church
has no ``developed satanology or demonology.'' It went on to
caution against
</P>
<P>
   using demons to excuse ``human sinfulness'' or conceptualizing
the devil as equal to God.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of devil possession, on the other hand, is
unequivocally accepted by some major Christian groups, including
the Roman Catholic Church and most Pentecostal churches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta has never had
an exorcism, ``we do believe in the devil,'' said Vicar General
Peter Dora. ``We believe in evil. We believe Satan can take
possession of a person and we base that on the Scriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Crabtree of the Assemblies of God says his
denomination holds similar views. ``We are biblical literalists,''
he said. ``Because of that, we look very closely at the words of
Christ, the ministry of Jesus. ... A great deal of the ministry of
Christ dealt with casting out demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the gifts provided by the Holy Spirit to the church,
Crabtree said, are the gift of discerning evil spirits and the gift
of casting out devils. Crabtree, assistant general superintendent
of the Missouri-based Pentecostal denomination, said he has had to
call upon those gifts several times in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when he was serving as a pastor in Des Moines, Iowa,
he said, a man came to his house and asked
</P>
<P>
   for help, saying, ``I do things I don't
</P>
<P>
   want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Crabtree said, the stranger's face ``became fixed,''
and out of the man's mouth came a different voice that said, ``He
doesn't want to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree sensed that he was encountering a demonic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual feeling one has when you're speaking to
someone who really desires to be free and you have faith in the
power of Christ,'' said Crabtree. ``There is such strength and
authority. I felt that authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree commanded several times, in the name of Christ, that
the demon leave. The man let out a gasp and went limp, Crabtree
said. His countenance expressed relief, and he began to thank God.
</P>
<P>
   Some people questioned for the Southern Focus Poll said they
believe people are tempted by the devil to sin, but stopped short
of saying they accept the idea of demon possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are weak enough they let the devil take a hold and
go on,'' said Mary Edna Branstetter, 73, a widow who lives near
Hardyville, Ky. But Branstetter, who is a member of a Cumberland
Presbyterian church, said she doesn't think a demon can take over a
person's body.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jack Farmer, 57, of Winston-Salem, N.C.,
says, ``I believe demons can possess people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer, a disabled veteran and member of a Christian and
Missionary Alliance church, said he does not fear that Satan will
claim his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have control over my destiny,'' he said. ``If I
trust the Lord, he's gon' see me through. I wouldn't lose one
minute of sleep over it.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: How should we act when insects drop in?
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga. _ Strange, but Ben Whitaker and I found
ourselves talking about whether to kill or not to kill. The Georgia
representative and I were agreeing how it gets tougher and tougher
to smash an insect _ even as it invades the house.
</P>
<P>
   And this has been a summer for invasions. In some ways, indoors
looks much like outdoors, as various critters, seeking refuge from
the bitter heat, take up residence from floor to ceiling, living
among the houseplants just as comfortably as if they were camping
in trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   What to do _ reach for the insecticide? The swatter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to the point when I see a spider or a cricket, I
pick it up and take it outside,'' said Whitaker, a Republican from
Ellijay. ``Everything's put here for a purpose. I weigh 210 pounds.
Why should I snuff out the life of a little insect?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, sensibility. Our conversation reminded me of a passage from
the 18th-century novel ``Tristram Shandy'' by Laurence Sterne: The
gentle character ``my uncle Toby'' says to ``the fly which buzz'd
about his nose all dinner time _ `Go _ go poor devil ... get thee
gone _ why should I hurt thee? This world is surely wide enough to
hold both thee and me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In real life today, most of us do not shoo flies (and certainly
not mosquitoes) with such compassion. To be sure, neither Whitaker
nor I raised the question of what we do when they buzz our dining
rooms and porches. Usually, I find it a tossup between herding them
out or putting them out of my misery with a swatter or folded
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, we did not talk about regular rats or those cute,
bushy-tailed ones _ squirrels _ and what un-Tobylike behavior they
might inspire.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, certain insects seem more acceptable in the house
than do others. And insects in general seem more acceptable than,
say, snakes.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I do marvel at what change that represents _ just in
my lifetime. I have lived in houses where both sky and ground were
visible from every room in the house _ an open invitation to just
about anything that could fit through the cracks. Dirt daubers
seemed comfortably tame and at home, as did worms and wasps.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I can only imagine what it must have been like in
earlier times, surviving in dugouts on the Plains or in hovels on
Southern plantations.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with all manner of creatures coming in from the heat, I
am again getting a taste of life close to nature. Faced with armies
of insects and a lizard here and there (no cracks, but they're
clever), I'm less likely than before to jump up and look for a way
to eradicate them. Instead, I want to know what their intent might
be.
</P>
<P>
   If the wasp immediately flies to the ceiling, seeking a new
place to build a nest, well, it's all right for it to look around _
until I get around to showing it to the door.
</P>
<P>
   And the lizard _ what harm can it do, really? Its greatest
danger may be to itself. One found its way into a bowl sitting on
the floor. Black with blue markings, it made a beautiful sight
against the white porcelain. Forgotten, it must have stayed in the
bowl for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. Stiff, gone, it looked just like itself, perfectly
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, poor ants. Harmless harbingers of peony blooms in the
garden, their armies are despised in some homes almost as much as
roaches or mice. But not by Toby.
</P>
<P>
   As for Whitaker and me, our sensibilities are growing, but we've
still got a ways to go.

   Early one morning, Wilma Davidson, a communications consultant
from East Greenwich, R.I., and her husband, Stephen, a corporate
vice president, were side by side in a packed elevator in a Chicago
hotel, headed for different floors. He was on his way to a business
meeting and she was to deliver a seminar. All of the elevator's
passengers were silent and aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for my husband,'' Ms. Davidson writes. ``As the doors
to his floor opened, he quickly grabbed me around the waist
tightly, pulling me to him for a quick and passionate kiss. But
that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he jumped out, he turned back to me (and everyone else in
the elevator) and said in a clear voice, just as the doors
reclosed, `Now remember, not a word to my wife.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson says she has since forgiven him. But it was the
last time she accompanied him on a business trip. &QL;

   It's not just men who practice mischief in elevators. Robert
Ross of Queens remembers the time that he and a co-worker, a woman,
found themselves in a prestigious midtown Manhattan hotel after
work, on their way to have a drink with a former business
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator was almost full when Ross and his companion
entered.
</P>
<P>
   As it glided up, she turned to him and, in a clear, innocent
voice asked, ``Are you sure you will marry me afterward?'' &QL;

   Early in his long business career, Ronald J. Rakowski of Bethel,
Conn., worked in an office building in Washington in which one
floor was leased to the United States Information Agency. He had
read enough about the agency to have a favorable impression of it.
</P>
<P>
   One day, however, the press was full of accounts about a new
book that linked it to the Central Intelligence Agency and even
identified the building where Rakowski worked as a place where the
USIA conducted some covert activities.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Rakowski and his boss were in an elevator with
a third passenger when the car stopped at the floor occupied by the
agency. The doors opened slowly, then closed slowly, with no one
getting on or off.
</P>
<P>
   After a few moments, the fellow passenger, his eyes wide and his
voice filled with awe, turned to Rakowski and his boss and said,
``Talk about cover; you couldn't even see that son of a gun!'' &QL;

   Evening in Manhattan. At the end of a long workday inside 30
Rockefeller Plaza, an Art Deco elevator, crowded with women in
gowns and men in black tie, soared toward the Rainbow Room on the
65th floor. Lynne Hawes of Mount Kisco, N.Y., was among them, with
a dashing fellow as her escort.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting that presages a night of glamour above the
twinkling lights of the city, he was overcome with a need to
concoct some mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a phone,'' he announced. ``I forgot to call my parole
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Hawes recalls it, ``The captive audience, equally divided
in disbelief and horror, began to edge toward the door to get off
as soon as the elevator stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, she writes, ``I simply turned bright purple.'' &QL;

   Donald A. Duffy of Washington had some friends who took great
delight in telling bizarre tales when ascending in crowded
office-building elevators and then exiting at the first stop _ thus
leaving their stories unfinished and their fellow passengers agape,
spellbound and hanging in suspense.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Duffy arranged their comeuppance. He planted an
accomplice on the elevator. When the two jokers exited as planned,
the accomplice shouted: ``Wait a minute! I want to hear the end of
this.'' And he left with them.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplice told Duffy later that the tale teller had been
rendered utterly, and satisfyingly, speechless. &QL;

   After a tough day in the elevators, some people come home
absolutely exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, just after Marc Ungar had moved into an apartment
building on Manhattan's East Side, he got a lesson in urban living
from a young professional couple who followed him into the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too tired for takeout,'' the woman announced. ``Let's just
have dinner delivered.''

 &HT;    Some turn to 'spirit' instead of God
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something in the universe larger than the sum of its
parts, but not everyone is willing to say flatly that there is a
God.
</P>
<P>
   While a vast majority of people questioned in a recent Southern
Focus Poll said they believe in God, about one in 10 Southerners
and 17 percent of non-Southerners described their belief as in a
``spirit or life force.''
</P>
<P>
   Among weekly Southern churchgoers, 99 percent said they believe
in God, while 1 percent defined their belief as in a ``spirit or
life force.'' Of Southerners who said they never go to church, 27
percent expressed belief in a spiritual force, while 60 percent
said they believed in God. The poll, conducted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and the University of North Carolina, showed
that Southerners who describe themselves as politically liberal are
more likely than self-described conservatives (18 percent to 6
percent) to describe their belief as in a ``life force'' rather
than in ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe everything was created by accident
or by chance and is going nowhere,'' said poll respondent John
Reagan, 54, of St. Charles, Ill. ``I don't think that seems
reasonable. But I'm not sure the Christian concept is reasonable
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, an electrical engineer who was raised Catholic, said he
is troubled by the church's idea of eternal punishment for sins and
exclusion of non-Christians from God's grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of believe man created religion so he could find a way
of obtaining immortal life because he wanted to,'' said Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Faison, 74, of Charlotte, has similar views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick a word to describe it, I'm an agnostic,'' she
said. ``I do believe there's something that holds all of us
together _ I've just never been convinced of what that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Faison, a retired stenographer who was raised Methodist, said
she no longer attends church.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year between October 1992 and fall of 1993, her son,
mother and daughter all died, and she found herself crying out for
divine support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my direst moments, I find myself calling for help or
assistance or acknowledgment,'' she said. ``I don't remember any
response. I don't know that I've ever received any
acknowledgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward personal spirituality is growing, said Dan
Liss, 48, founding editor of Aquarius, an alternative newspaper in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who do believe there is a divine
force in the universe, whether they call it creator, goddess or
power,'' he said, ``but they're fed up with church politics. Should
women be ministers? Should gays be married in church? People want
to be connected to a higher power, but they don't want to be caught
up in all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are also dissatisfied with religious hierarchies, he
said. ``There's the same resistance to top-down management styles
you see in
</P>
<P>
   business.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Liss' readers are developing their own ``eclectic belief
systems,'' he said. ``They may be part of a Buddhist meditation
group. They may also do a `full moon circle' with a women's group
and study the kabbalah.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares the trend in religion to one he sees in medicine.
Some people go to doctors, but they still try herbal medicine and
massage therapy, he said. ``They want to pick out the parts that
work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Eiesland, an assistant professor of sociology of religion
at Emory University, talks about an ``amazing fertility'' of
spiritual beliefs in a culture where there is no state religion.
</P>
<P>
   She relates the trend toward belief in a ``life force'' to the
flourishing self-improvement movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tapping into a spiritual source,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Chase Melver, 24, a greenskeeper from Ash, N.C.,
describes that spiritual force as ``the driving energy that makes
the stars burn, which gives us light which makes the grass grow so
the cows can eat the grass and we can eat the cows and drink their
milk. ...''
</P>
<P>
   But Melver, who attended a Baptist church as a small child, said
he does not attribute to that force any morality or standards of
value. ``It sets the stage for us to make our own decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He looks at humankind as part of the giant food chain, with
responsibility for keeping the planet healthy. Melver said he has
talked at length to friends and read the New Testament, the Koran
and ``The Celestine Prophecy'' as part of his spiritual quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about it,'' he said. ``You can drive yourself nuts
thinking about this stuff.''

 &HT;    Porches: Homeowners expand the cozy, sit-a-spell comfort of the
indoors
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    By Lisa Mowry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Porches offer the best of both worlds. When you're swaying in a
swing, enjoying the hum of outdoors, you're not sealed off from the
world like you are inside on the sofa. Yet you're partially
protected from the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why homeowners of all ages and lifestyles are
clamoring to add a porch or just dress one up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're seeking nostalgia, a chance to re-create a Norman
Rockwell setting where pitchers of lemonade and churns of ice cream
provide wholesome refreshment, where Grandma's wicker settee and an
old creaky rocker are the furnishings of choice.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Andy and Aunt Bee entertained Mayberry folks on a
front porch _ not in a slick media room. With today's houses
buzzing, beeping and clicking from all the high-tech gadgetry, a
quiet porch is a gracious addition to our lives _ and an
opportunity to enjoy the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   When Audrey Newsome was growing up in Hawkinsville, friends and
neighbors gathered on her family's wide, open-air porch for
conversation and summer breezes. The 18-foot-by-30-foot porch she
recently added to her Atlanta area house serves the same purpose,
becoming party central for wedding brunches, holiday soirees or
smaller gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   At 1,100 square feet, the interior designer's house is compact,
so the porch became a necessity. ``With small houses, you need an
open place like this to breathe,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A friend's gift of a white wicker porch swing inspired Newsome
to collect other old wicker. She arranged three seating areas,
which somehow make the space seem larger, but more intimate, she
says. The furniture upholstery was a bargain _ yards of a
discontinued fabric she chose for its woven pattern (which shows
less dirt, she says) and soft shades of mint-greens and blues.
Using colors in nature draws in the surroundings. ``This way, the
eye picks up the greens, then continues into the wooded back
yard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome didn't hesitate to use wooden pieces, such as a teak
armoire and mahogany sideboard, or an oil painting outside, though
she chose tile-topped tables for ease in cleanup. ``I just hose the
tables off if they get dirty, and once a week I use a blower on the
cushions to get the dirt off,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Gwinnett County(Ga.), Newsome's friend and client,
Carole Kendall, spends entire weekends on the porch with husband
Dave. ``We both work inside all week, so whenever possible we want
to be outside,'' Kendall says. Their charming, open-air porch has a
touch of Charleston about it, which is appropriate; the Kendalls
have a second home there and are naturally drawn to Lowcountry
architecture. White-pine floors and columns help set the tone for
leisurely evenings and the occasional party.
</P>
<P>
   It was a get-together several years ago that inspired the porch.
When heavy rain ruined what was to be an outdoor party on their
rear deck, the couple decided they needed a roofed structure. David
Kendall wanted a barn, while his wife leaned toward a porch. Their
lofty structure _ designed by Atlanta architect Scott Zanardo _
offers the best of each, with its vaulted ceiling and dormer
windows. ``With the ceiling so high, you don't feel like you're in
a room, and the sunlight can filter in,'' Carole Kendall says.
</P>
<P>
   (Depending on the features, Zanardo says the cost of adding a
covered porch can range from about $20 to $45 per square foot.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Kendalls' architecture is farmhouse-meets-Charleston, the
decor has roots in Mexico. While vacationing there, Kendall picked
up a colorful, primitive fabric square and asked Newsome to
incorporate it into furnishings for her new porch. The setting now
radiates with vibrant greens, yellows and reds, a welcome change to
the soft pastel upholsteries typically paired with antique wicker.
</P>
<P>
   The porch is part living room, part dining area, part den. An
armoire hides a television set, allowing the Kendalls to experience
the unlikely combination of De Niro and a summer breeze. And in
nice weather, the Kendalls are known to eat three meals a day
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought about putting a bed out on the porch,'' she
says. ``Then we wouldn't have to come inside at all.''
</P>
<P>
   PORCH PLANNERS: M A K I N G T H E M O V E O U T S I D E
</P>
<P>
   Before building a porch, ask yourself these questions: Where is
the best location for exposure? Can the entry be created from an
existing door or window? Should the porch be open or screened?
</P>
<P>
   Visit as many porches as possible before designing your own, and
for best results consult a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   -- High ceilings and skylights allow natural light to filter in.
Add ceiling fans and electricity for lighting.
</P>
<P>
   -- Floors can be just about anything, preferably natural
materials such as old pine, Mexican tile or even cork tile.
Painting floors (with an oil-based paint) adds an old-fashioned
touch.
</P>
<P>
   -- While many prefer traditional outdoor seating made of wrought
iron or aluminum frames, others opt for a living room look. For the
latter, think aged wicker, painted wooden benches, sisal or cotton
rugs, round tablecloths, lamps and flea market finds such as picnic
baskets filled with magazines or collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use common sense about exposure. Recent refinements in
weather-resistant fabrics allow more choices in porch pillows than
in the past, but plan on replacing them every few years.
</P>
<P>
   -- A covered porch can be a great canvas for a gardener's
creativity, so long as you stick to shade or partial-shade plants.
Depending on the amount of light, container plantings can include
caladiums, hostas, ferns and even coleus and geraniums, says Teena
Barnes of Lost Mountain Nursery in west Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get a lot of splashy color in that sort of
environment, so you need to depend on the different tones of leaves
and textures of plants to add interest,'' she says.

AFTER PROTESTS, A MERGER IS SCUTTLED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Two closed-end funds _ the Scudder Spain and Portugal fund and
the Growth Fund of Spain _ said their boards had voted to end a
controversial merger agreement. Instead, the two funds, which trade
at steep discounts to their net asset values, are taking steps to
allow shareholders to cash out at net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   But the two funds, both managed by Scudder Kemper Investments,
are taking different tacks. The board of the Growth Fund of Spain
approved a plan to convert to an open-end fund. It expects
shareholders to vote on the proposal in October and, if approved by
a two-thirds majority of shares outstanding, to complete the
conversion by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A 2 percent fee will be charged on the redemption of shares not
held for at least one year, and the fund said it retained the right
to pay the proceeds of large redemptions ``in kind,'' or with stock
instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Scudder Spain and Portugal fund, by contrast, will remain a
closed-end fund but will offer shareholders in-kind redemption of
their shares as soon as is practical.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the merger comes after a bitter public
battle with shareholder activists who objected to several
provisions of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how the boards of directors and the managers are
being responsive to their shareholders out of necessity,' said
David Schachter, a vice president of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a
closed-end fund specialist in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike open-end funds, which issue and redeem shares at net
asset value, closed-end funds offer a fixed number shares that
trade on stock markets. As such, they may trade at a premium to
their net asset value but far more often trade at a discount,
sometimes in the double digit percentage.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 24, the Scudder Spain and Portugal fund traded at a
discount to its net asset value of TK percent, while the the Growth
Fund of Spain traded at a discount of 10.1 percent. &QL;

   Van Kampen American Capital has changed its name to Van Kampen
Investments, and the names of the funds that it runs will soon
follow suit. The company's 36 Van Kampen American Capital funds and
its 13 Morgan Stanley funds will begin using the Van Kampen name
starting on Aug. 31. The Morgan Stanley funds are administered and
distributed by Van Kampen.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes are in the works for the company's 38 Van Kampen
American Capital closed-end funds. The 13 closed-end funds run by
Morgan Stanley will not be affected by the name changes.
</P>
<P>
   The new names are part of a corporate-wide rebranding process,
said Eileen Davis, a company spokeswoman. The changes do not affect
the management or operations of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., is a unit of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. It took on its former name through the
acquisition of American Capital Management and Research Inc. in
1994. &QL;

   Blackrock Funds announced that it would close its Small Cap
Growth Equity fund to new investors on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with $1.5 billion in assets, returned 16.8 percent,
annualized, for the three years through July 24, versus an average
of 12.7 percent for its small-cap growth peers. It returned 5.8
percent for the 12 months through July 24, versus 6.8 percent for
its group, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher
</P>
<P>
   Blackrock has started the Micro-Cap Equity Portfolio, which is
managed by William Wykle and the same management team that runs
Small Cap Growth Equity. The new fund will invest in American
growth companies that have market capitalizations of less than $300
million. It will close when assets reach $250 million, the company
said.

   UNDATED - First-time filmmaker Vincent Gallo takes a tremendous
risk in ``Buffalo '66.'' He gives us a despicable hero and then
cajoles us into liking him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neat trick, for Billy Brown (Gallo) is no ``lovable
rogue,'' such as we are used to from Hollywood. No, he is a
thoroughly thuggish ex-con, bristling with skull-thudding violence
and emotional emptiness. He has no redeeming qualities.

   But then we meet his parents, and suddenly we know why and begin
to feel sorry for him. His parents (Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara)
are monsters. She cruelly tells Billy she is sorry he was born
because his birth made her miss an important football game. In a
flashback, we learn that when Billy was young, his bullying father
killed his pet dog to punish him. The two are self-centered,
mindless, negligent troglodytes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for some reason, Billy wants to impress them.
</P>
<P>
   Billy has just gotten out of prison, although his parents don't
know it. He has told them he was away for five years doing secret
government work. He lies and tells them he has a wife. They want to
meet her.
</P>
<P>
   So Billy kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci), a young tap-dancing
student, and threatens to beat her brains out unless she goes along
and pretends to be his wife when he meets his parents.
</P>
<P>
   But she takes on the charade with such gusto that we soon come
to realize that Layla is as unnervingly peculiar as any woman we
have seen in the cinema since Tuesday Weld in ``Pretty Poison.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is filled with hilarious details. When Billy grabs
Layla and drags her to the parking lot, she winds up having to
drive the getaway car because Billy can't handle a manual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   He tells her just how to act around his parents: ``You'll adore
me, you'll love me, you'll cherish me. Jesus Christ, you can't live
without me.'' And what is more, they will be like a couple who have
``spanned time together.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``time spanning'' is repeated and repeated until you have to
belly-laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo '66'' is a tremendous movie, funny at times, touching
at others, just when you don't expect it. But always there is the
threat of bloody death behind it, making it all just a little more
on its toes than you expect.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Gallo makes Billy oddly sympathetic. He has, as
Gallo said in an interview, ``incredible shame and guilt,
resentment and insecurity, disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all there in Gallo's incredible performance. We not only
care about him, we wish him _ and Layla _ well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo '66'' is rated R for violence, nudity, sexual
situations and language. 4 stars. &QL;

GUM-CHEWING BURSTS OUT OF THE CLOSET AND INTO THE BOARDROOM

 By ANDREA HIGBIE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a fairy tale wedding. The sky was a glorious,
sunny blue. Everything, from the radiant bride to the fabulous
flowers, was perfect. Everything, that is, except the bridesmaid
chomping away on a wad of gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled,'' said Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette expert,
who was a guest. ``It was so incredibly rude. But the sad thing is
that it was not shocking: all of a sudden gum chewing in public is
so prevalent that it has become acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Openly, brazenly, people are chewing gum. At work, gyms,
restaurants and clubs, gum has become the big cigar of the season.
Part of the reason is that smoking is forbidden in many places. But
mostly, it's that like a too-large Bazooka gum bubble, the taboo
surrounding gum chewing _ that it's tacky, especially in public _
has burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gum chewing is definitely cool,'' said Ruth Hiller, an artist
and a trainer at Peak Performance in Gramercy Park. ``It's everyone
and everywhere right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are popping gum at restaurants,'' said Ms. Hiller, who
is partial to Trident bubble gum and Dentyne Ice. ``At the gym,
lots of people chew. It feels good, and it tastes good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson accepted his Golden Globe best-actor award for
``As Good as It Gets,'' wad in mouth. Other high-profile chewers,
including Farrah Fawcett, Mary-Louise Parker and Reese Witherspoon,
have been photographed chewing gum in public recently, following
the lead of Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   All this chewing is making gum manufacturers happy. ``People are
chewing more gum than ever,'' said Christopher Perille, a spokesman
for Wrigley Co., the world's largest maker of gum. In July, Wrigley
reported year-to-date net sales of more than $1 billion, up $42
million, or 4.4 percent, from the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   While this is good for manufacturers, it's bad for the nation,
Ms. Baldrige said. ``I just saw someone chewing gum at a memorial
service, someone who was right in the front row, chomping away,''
she said. ``At graduations, students were going up to get their
diplomas, and they were chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to just chew gum in private, but lately they're
chewing it everywhere and all the time,'' she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? ``It's all part of this attitude now that `anything I
feel like doing is fine,''' Ms. Baldrige said. ``People just don't
care if they're rude or not, and some of them don't know that it
looks uncivil. It destroys the beauty of the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Forbes, a performer and songwriter who lives on the Upper
West Side, said she takes the gum out of her mouth before going
into clubs but has noticed that others do not. ``I've seen singers
take the stage with a piece of gum in their mouth,'' said Ms.
Forbes, who used to chew Juicy Fruit and then moved on to Big Red
and Winterfresh. ``I usually chew when I'm bored or stressed, like
during long car rides. I don't smoke and I don't drink, but I chew
and I drive a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the new chomping in previously uncharted territories,
gum chewing is suddenly not just acceptable but also practically
required for stress and weight control. Gum _ either Nicorette or
the conventional kind _ is the mouth occupier of choice for smokers
who aren't allowed to light up, as well as for former smokers, or
hopeful former smokers who are trying not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are chewing gum instead of putting food and cigarettes
in their mouths,'' Ms. Hiller said. ``When I want to avoid sugar, I
pop in a piece of sugarless gum.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even when it's not in people's mouths, gum is clearly on their
minds. There's the ``X-Files'' obsession with the force that
controls the world's gum supply, and a ``Seinfeld'' episode in the
last season about George's groping for things in common with a new
girlfriend. ``We both like gum!'' they cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet. all is not so sweet in the world of gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice it all over the sidewalks lately,'' said Teresa
Gallo, the assistant to the chief financial officer at the Food
Network.
</P>
<P>
   And the dangers go beyond sticky soles. ``You could easily
inhale your gum when you work out,'' said Jeff Dorman, a trainer at
the New York Sports Club at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square,
who happened to be chewing gum himself. ``I've heard of it
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this formerly private act now carried out in public
places is such a new phenomenon, chewing gum right now is a badge
of behavioral courage. It's about rebellion, or actually rebellion
lite, since compared with other vices it's relatively benign.
``It's a safe rebellion,'' said Ilka Peck, a clinical social worker
in Manhattan. ``Gum chewers are breaking the rules of etiquette,
but not so they'd get punished.''
</P>
<P>
   What used to be verboten at work is now taken for granted. The
Wrigley Web site (www.wrigley.com) points out that as early as
1939, scientific studies, including ``The Psycho-Dynamics of
Chewing,'' by Dr. H.L. Hollingworth of Columbia University, showed
how chewing relaxes people while they are working. But not until
only recently did so many people act on that.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McGill Murphy, the Brooklyn-based anthropologist and
writer, said the gum craze can be attributed to the strong yet
anxiety-provoking economy. ``It's a healthy economy, so people feel
they can get away with more, that it gives them license to thumb
their nose at taboos,'' Murphy said. ``Yet, dramatic consolidations
are going on, so people are also feeling stress. What's left in the
puritanical '90s but to chew gum?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peck agreed. ``In my business consulting on Wall Street and
Madison Avenue, I'm noticing that people are chewing gum,'' she
said. ``And this is in the conference rooms, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Salzman, a senior accountant for the Food Network,
added, ``A guy I work with always keeps a 10-pack of Extra on his
desk for everyone to take.''
</P>
<P>
   One nonchewer who smokes, Kunjali Shah, a graduate student who
lives on the Upper East Side, was a recent witness to the perils of
gum. ``The other day, a 6-year-old I know put her wad of bubble gum
on her mother's seat at work, and the mother sat right down on
it,'' she said. ``The mother was wearing a white suit.'' And the
child? ``She was punished.''
</P>
<P>
   But she seems to be about the only person lately who has
suffered any consequences of public gum chewing.

AIDS RISK KNOWS NO AGE BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY STEPHEN G. REED   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Tom Liberti tells a story that puts a new face on
the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Liberti, chief of the Florida Department of
Health's Bureau of HIV and AIDS, attended a community meeting on
AIDS in Miami. There, two people stood up _ a 75-year-old man and
an 85-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Both announced to the mostly older audience that they had the
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. They'd contracted
it through sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, you could hear a pin drop in the room,''
Liberti said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other state officials gathered Wednesday at the
University of South Florida in Tampa to announce a state program
designed to educate older Floridians about HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Among the myths they attempted to dispel: That AIDS is an
affliction of the young, and the activities that transmit HIV _ sex
and intravenous drug abuse _ are exclusively linked to youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HIV virus doesn't care how old you are,'' said E. Bentley
Lipscomb, secretary of the state Department of Elder Affairs.
``Anyone, even great-grandparents, can be infected. A virus does
not respect its elders.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Senior HIV and AIDS Prevention Education, or
SHAPE, is a joint project of the Department of Elder Affairs and
the Florida Department of Health. It will use advertisements,
community outreach and peer counselors to educate people 50 and
older about HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, SHAPE will operate only in Hillsborough County, which
includes Tampa. But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said
the agency has asked the Legislature for $275,000 to broaden AIDS
education efforts among seniors in the state's five most populous
counties, where the epidemic is most prevalent. Throughout the
state, brochures and other materials directed toward seniors are
available to health department educators, Liberti said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the fastest growing group of new HIV cases is among
people older than 50, according to the Department of Elder Affairs.
Of the state's 67,282 cumulative AIDS cases, 8,409 _ or 12.5
percent _ involved people 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Not all older patients were infected late in life. The AIDS
virus can remain hidden, and those it infects can have no symptoms
for many years. Some contracted the virus in their younger years
and didn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake to assume that older people don't indulge in
risky activity _ a mistake that even government epidemiologists
make.
</P>
<P>
   Lipscomb said the state has had to wrangle with the federal
Centers for Disease Control regarding the administration of health
surveys, for example. He said CDC surveyors were previously told
not to ask questions about sexual practices to people older than
55, because they might upset participants.
</P>
<P>
   Those attitudes, Lipscomb said, indicate a bias against older
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over 55. I haven't given up sex. And I don't think most of
the elders in this state have either,'' he said. ``Who do they
think is buying all this Viagra?''
</P>
<P>
   To help educate seniors about HIV, the state has printed posters
showing a gray-haired man and woman in bed together. Bearing the
legend ``sex is not only for the young,'' the posters urge readers
to get tested for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   They will be distributed to senior service centers, condo
associations and other groups that work with SHAPE, said Edith
Ellerson, project coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   SHAPE will recruit and train peer counselors _ older people who
have HIV or AIDS _ to discuss the illness with older audiences.
Such audiences are more likely to listen to people of a similar
age, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerson said SHAPE is working with focus groups to determine
what services seniors feel they need.
</P>
<P>
   SHAPE has a $35,000 budget, shared between the Department of
Elder Affairs and the Department of Health. A larger state-funded
program serves seniors in Broward County.

AN ECONOMIST ASKS, DOES HARVARD REALLY NEED $15 BILLION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (from `Education Life' special section)  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)  
 (ART ADV: Photo of Henry Hansmann is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or 1927.)  
 (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its last five-year campaign, Yale University raised $1.7
billion, helping to push its endowment close to $6 billion.
Harvard, with a $12.8 billion endowment, is in the midst of raising
$2.1 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a large endowment is a measure of prestige among
top universities, few have questioned the wisdom of accumulating
such huge nest eggs.
</P>
<P>
   One who has is Henry Hansmann, a professor at Yale's School of
Law and an expert on the economics and law of nonprofit
institutions. Hansmann is not against university fund raising. But
he says that students, universities and society would be better off
if universities spent most of their money now, rather than
investing it indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office, Hansmann spoke about the merits
and drawbacks of his ideas _ and why so few institutions seem ready
to embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   Saving has long been held up as a virtue. Why shouldn't we
applaud Harvard and Yale for what they have accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   Saving is worthwhile only if you have a better use for the money
in the future than you do now. With universities, there is no
particular reason to believe that there will be a better use in the
future and every reason to believe the reverse is true. At any
moment, boards of trustees should be asking whether a dollar is
better off going into an endowment or being invested in a young
student's mind or in research.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it better to spend the money now rather than later?
</P>
<P>
   Building an endowment means spending less on educating scholars
today and, instead, saving the money to give to scholars in the
future. Yet there is every reason to believe that incomes in the
future will be higher than they are today. That has been the case
for 350 years. So what we are doing is taking from the poor and
giving to the rich. Also, in terms of productivity of physics
experiments and other research, there is no reason to think they
will be more productive in the future than today.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the leading universities receive more income
each year than they can usefully spend, and that therefore it is a
good thing that they are piling up some of it in an investment
account. At least there it is being used to finance productive
industries and yields at least the same rate of return that
publicly traded companies produce on average.
</P>
<P>
   But if that is true _ if universities are taking in today more
income than they can productively spend _ why do they continue to
conduct major capital campaigns to raise more, as most major
universities have in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   Many universities say they need a big endowment to insure that
there is a steady stream of money to support students and research
_ that they can't count on tuition, grants and gifts year after
year. Are they wrong?
</P>
<P>
   There is an argument that universities should be risk-averse
since they have long-term commitments and there is no easy way to
expand and contract. They have heavy investments in a physical
plant that they can't just rent out for other purposes if they have
a bad year. Tenured faculty also represent a long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look back over the past century, has Harvard,
Princeton, Yale or Swarthmore _ or any university _ really used its
endowment as a buffer against adversity? When times are tight, they
cut educational expenditures so they can get over the hard times
and maintain the endowment's value.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would
probably say they are institutions whose business is to manage
large pools of investment assets and that they run educational
institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as
buffers for the investment pools.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really harmful to operate universities this way?
</P>
<P>
   The endowment makes a university riskier because when the stock
market moves down, spending goes down with it. That is probably the
very time when it is harder to get students to pay tuition and the
university is in tighter straits. What's more, the endowment tends
to be an overall net drain on most universities. They actually
spend less out of their endowments _ typically about 5 percent
annually of their endowment's current capital value _ than they put
into them each year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money in endowments isn't being wasted. It's
being invested in productive assets via the securities markets. It
just isn't being invested in education.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes so little sense, why are so many universities trying
so hard to build their endowments?
</P>
<P>
   They fell into it by habit. When these universities began, many
were state funded. They began raising endowments in the 19th
century, when the states cut their support. At that time, the flow
of gifts tended to be lumpy. There would be decades between
fund-raising campaigns. They couldn't afford to spend it all
immediately, or they wouldn't have had anything left after a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   So in the 19th century, having an endowment made a lot of sense.
Now financial gift flows are much smoother, so the need to have a
big endowment to smooth out the bulkiness of financial gifts is no
longer so apparent. But the habit remains.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for endowments is that donors prefer to make
gifts that way, to fund something over a long period of time. If
they feel they are contributing to a perpetual fund, they feel they
are buying a bit of immortality _ just as when they pay for
construction of a building. Whether it is the most efficient way to
fund a university or not, it is sometimes the only way the money
can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't there more debate about how endowments are maintained?
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one who has the power to raise the issue has the
incentive. Giving for endowments is an attractive thing. It's a
motivator. It's very quantifiable. With these patterns of giving,
no responsible educational administrator is going to go out and
announce the end of the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any chance, then, that behavior will change?
</P>
<P>
   Once the economics of endowments are better understood, maybe
that understanding will seep into conventional wisdom. Then
universities may begin to adopt creative investment policies that
are more thoughtfully geared to the real tradeoffs between
investing in financial assets and investing in other assets.

 &HT;    Vatican orders Texas hospital to eliminate reproductive services
 &HT;    (An Austin story that moved previously, recast for a national
audience. For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Vatican has twice instructed the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Austin to end contraceptive programs and
sterilizations at a church-managed city hospital, setting up a
dispute among the church, the bishop and community members.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops nationwide are watching the dispute, which
involves Brackenridge Hospital, leased from the city by the
Catholic-owned Seton Healthcare Network. Seton's lease with the
city requires it to offer such reproductive services, and McCarthy,
considered one of the more moderate bishops in the country, said he
intends to stick by the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Seton is owned by the religious order Daughters of Charity but
operates under the purview of the bishop, who is responsible for
ensuring that Catholic moral teachings are upheld in his diocese.
Seton had to and did receive the bishop's approval before entering
into the lease agreement; McCarthy was not required to have the
Vatican approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But an anonymous group of conservative Catholics in Austin had
complaints about the lease agreement sent to the Vatican's most
powerful office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. The
Congregation ensures that church laws are obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (conservative Catholics) don't listen to their bishop and
think they can overpower him, and that's what makes it more of a
problem than it needs to be,'' said the Rev. Kevin O'Rourke,
director of the Catholic Center for Health Care Ethics at St. Louis
University and one of several ethicists who reviewed the lease
agreement for the diocese.

   The Vatican's response could affect future mergers, acquisitions
and management operating agreements between Catholic and
non-Catholic hospitals and medical centers throughout the country.
Last year, the Vatican stopped one merger in New Jersey, and some
bishops have stepped in to halt others. The Seton-Brackenridge
agreement began in 1995, the year the pope issued an encyclical
that warned administrators of Catholic health facilities that if
they bend the church rules on reproductive services, their
institutions could lose Catholic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   In June, McCarthy met in Rome with Pope John Paul II and
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy confirmed that the 30-year lease agreement was
discussed but would not disclose details of his meetings, other
than to say the talks were amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict could have major repercussions for Austin, McCarthy
and Seton. The Vatican could order McCarthy to tell the Daughters
of Charity to stop sterilizations and contraceptive measures at
Brackenridge or face disciplinary action, including disavowing
Seton as a Catholic institution. If McCarthy failed to follow a
Vatican directive, disciplinary measures could range from a
reprimand to removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the city was considering turning over the
management of debt-ridden Brackenridge to Seton, controversy
erupted in the community over what would happen to reproductive
services.
</P>
<P>
   The city promised organizations such as Planned Parenthood and
the National Organization for Women that it would not turn the
hospital over to a private entity without ensuring that
reproductive services would be available. Seton vowed not to break
church laws, which prohibit abortion, sterilization, fertility
treatments and contraceptives. Both sides were optimistic that they
could work out a deal, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was not a perfect fit, McCarthy said, but it does
not violate any church laws because Seton does not directly provide
the reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Five Catholic ethicists approved the agreement and the City
Council unanimously approved it. The lease requires Seton to allow
reproductive services on site at Brackenridge; abortions are not
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Seton also is required to give space in the hospital for the
Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department to offer
reproductive services information and counseling, including
information on abortions and contraceptives. To offset the cost of
providing this service, the City of Austin required Seton pay an
additional $81,721 a year for the lease, bringing the total annual
payment to more than $2.1 million. The contract includes a possible
$10 million fine if Seton breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, sterilizations and contraceptives
are private matters between patients and physicians. Seton
contracts with nurses from another health-care company for nursing
services during tubal ligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman and her physician determine what services are
provided,'' said Ed Berger, Seton's vice president of advocacy and
public policy. ``There is not a hospital policy about that. The key
words are that Seton policies 'allow' these to take place... as
opposed to 'will provide' or 'do it' or whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fastiggi, an associate professor of religious studies at
St. Edward's University, has openly criticized the lease agreement,
saying he respects the bishop but thinks that the agreement
violates Catholic Church laws. He aired that opinion in 1995 during
a diocesan meeting where the agreement was explained.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the Rev. William Broussard, ethicist for the
Austin diocese and a Seton board member, sent Fastiggi a letter
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob you were described by those who witnessed your questions
as 'frantic,' 'emotional,' 'angry' and 'disturbed.' ''The letter
later said: ``Either you presented yourself years ago with the
skill of an actor hiding a split personality, or Bob, you are
deteriorating right in front of our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fastiggi also received a letter of reprimand from Patricia
Hayes, then president of St. Edward's and now executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Seton. Hayes warned
Fastiggi that his ``judgmental'' style of presenting information on
the Seton agreement and another issue needed to stop. Also, Hayes
said that her letter would become ``a part of your formal annual
evaluation as a faculty member at St. Edward's.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, at the request of some Austin Catholics who didn't
want to be identified, the Saint Joseph Foundation, a San
Antonio-based conservative Catholic group, notified Rome of the
proposed lease agreement between Seton and Brackenridge,
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the concerns expressed at the time is if the identities
of all those were known, the bishop could be harsh and take
retribution against them,'' said Chuck Wilson, the Saint Joseph
Foundation executive director. ``Everything that has happened since
then has been strictly between the Congregation and McCarthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith wrote McCarthy asking
for details of the agreement. He responded in early June 1995. The
Vatican sent back a letter of opposition. In July, McCarthy
notified the Vatican that a new agreement for sterilizations and
reproductive service delivery had been reached that created a
``wall of separation'' between Seton and the services the church
considers sinful.
</P>
<P>
   That letter didn't reach the Congregation for the Doctrine of
Faith office until December. In March 1996, the Vatican sent
another letter telling McCarthy not to allow the agreement to go
through until Vatican officials could fully review it. McCarthy
replied that a 30-year agreement had been signed Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Vatican has written two letters, the more recent
in December, telling McCarthy to instruct Seton to immediately stop
sterilizations and contraceptive programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clash of beliefs
</P>
<P>
   William May, an ethicist at the John Paul II Institute for
Studies on Marriage and Family in Washington, D.C., called the
Seton agreement ``fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   May, who until last year was one of 30 theologians on the
International Theological Commission, an arm of the doctrinal
congregation, added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great difficulty reconciling this as what a Catholic
hospital should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Theological disputes such as this one, he went on, ``are decided
by a higher authority, and the higher authority would be ... the
Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said he will continue to communicate with the Vatican
but has no plans to interfere with the Daughters of Charity
hospital operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely supportive of what the Daughters of Charity are
doing here,'' McCarthy said. He said they are delivering health
care to thousands of poor people who otherwise might not get needed
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the poor, he pointed out, is one of the cornerstones of
the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   In its last fiscal year that ended June 30, Seton delivered $47
million in charity health-care services. Next year, the amount is
expected to reach $50 million, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Seton will never break the lease, Hayes said. There are at least
15 dioceses in the country where Catholic hospitals have agreements
to offer reproductive services, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for Free Choice, an independent group that believes
Catholics should be able to make their own decisions on
reproduction, reports that 84 Catholic hospitals have merged with
non-Catholic institutions since 1990. Twenty more mergers are
pending. It is expected that 15 of the new institutions will not
provide reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions for such services are an economic necessity for many
Catholic hospitals. Without the availability of reproductive
services, Catholic hospitals risk losing contracts with managed
health-care providers, the bread and butter of any health system,
O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of a Catholic hospital system is to provide health
care to the poor, but it must have income from insured patients to
pay for its work with the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to expand our hospital empire ... we don't
think of health care as a business,'' McCarthy said. ``We are
trying to protect health care for the poor.

growth of their industry's profits, high-tech rivals stopped
dissing each other long enough to chip in more than $5 million to
form a lobbying coaltion called Americans for Computer Privacy and
convince a lot of their customers, suppliers and sympathizers to
sign up. Launched in March, the $5 million lobbying alliance of
more than 90 companies and 40 associations already has won some

   MEXICO-ELECTIONS _ OAXACA, Mexico _ Mexico continues to test its
transition to peaceful and pluralistic elections this Sunday, Aug.
2. Jubilant from its first gubernatorial victory in Zacatecas state
in July, Mexico's left-center Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) has another strong candidate running in Oaxaca state on Aug.
2. In many ways, Oaxaca's election is more meaningful for the PRD
than Zacatecas': In Zacatecas, the PRD's candidate was a recent
convert from the dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party (the
PRI), who took votes with him because he was popular. In Oaxaca,
the PRD's Hector Sanchez is a true party man, and a popular
grass-roots activist who speaks Zapotec, an Indian language, and
whose political experience includes fighting for peasant and Indian
rights. His victory -- or even a close second place showing_ would
represent an electoral break through for Mexico's Indian and left
activists, who are often targets of assassination attempts and

On Aug. 2, governors will also be chosen in the Mexican states of

   POPE-HOSPITAL _AUSTIN, Texas _ The Vatican has twice instructed

Catholic bishops nationwide are watching the dispute, which
involves Brackenridge Hospital, leased from the city by the
Catholic-owned Seton Healthcare Network. Seton's lease with the
city requires it to offer such reproductive services, and McCarthy,
considered one of the more moderate bishops in the country, said he
intends to stick by the terms of the agreement. (Perkes. Austin

What Southerners Believe.

<P>
   BELIEF-DEVIL _ Southerners look to God and organized religion
for help in explaining many of life's mysteries. And their beliefs
are not lightly held; they run deep. Much more than in other parts
of the country, Southerners believe there is a God (88%) and that
God answers prayers (90%). In Dixie, people may be less likely to
buy into alien visitation, UFO's or psychic healing, but they
absolutely believe in devil possession, and that some souls go to
heaven while others go to Hell. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BELIEF-LIFEFORCE _ A small but noteworthy portion of the people
we polled would not say they believed in God, but affirmed their
belief in a ``life force.'' Nearly 10 percent of Souterhners and 17
percent of non-Southerners fell into this category. We talk to some
of them about what they mean and how a life force is different than
a traditional Jewish-Muslim-Christian view of God. We look at the
possible Eastern influences. And, for the 87 percent of Southerners
who believe in God (compared to 68 percent of non-South), we
discuss how they view him/her as judge, redeemer, etc. (White,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

A PINCH OF GARDEN WHIMSY: ANNUAL GRASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)  
(lb) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grass is usually thought of in two ways: the green kind that has
to be mowed frequently in the summer, and the stately ornamental
kind that helps make the garden look decent in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   There's another kind: annual grass for the flower garden.
</P>
<P>
   Turf grass and most ornamental grasses are permanent landscaping
features that should be planted with some thought to their
placement, and given maintenance care. Annual grasses can be
planted on a whim _ in a garden or a tub or wherever you think
their flower stalks and seed heads would look good.
</P>
<P>
   Clumps of grasses like red switch grass and fountain grass are
good in the perennial garden, where they can fill spaces left by
Oriental poppies and other plants that go dormant after blooming.
Hare's-tail grass and canary grass look terrific in the annual
garden, mixed with bedding plants like dwarf cockscomb and globe
amaranth.
</P>
<P>
   In the cutting garden, quaking grass and Job's-tears provide
abundant material for fresh and dried arrangements. Biennial
grasses like wheat can be planted in autumn with the cornflowers
and larkspur, and will be ready for cutting early the following
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Annual and biennial grasses belong to the family Gramineae,
which encompasses everything from the front-yard fescue to bamboo,
as well as most important food grains, like wheat, barley, oats and
corn.
</P>
<P>
   Common grains are often attractive in their own right. (The
volunteer oats that sprout from the straw mulch in the cutting
garden save me the trouble of planting them.) But some grain
varieties can be selected especially for their beauty. Red and
black broomcorn (Sorghum vulgare) is striking as a screen or tall
background plant. Decorative wheat (Triticum aestivum) may be
silver, black or buff, and is usually bearded _ that is, with
slender bristles, or awns, extending from the seed.
</P>
<P>
   In a pinch, you could eat the decorative wheat, and any wildlife
visiting your garden certainly will. Birds are especially fond of
foxtail millet (Setaria macrocheata), which blends beautifully with
native flowers in wild gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Some annual grasses are grown for their seed heads. Job's-tears
(Coix Lacryma-Jobi) produce hard seeds, white to bluish-gray and
about the size of a pea, on 3-foot stalks. The seeds, which smell
like popcorn, are used as beads for necklaces and rosaries in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Canary grass (Phalaris canariensis) has tight seed heads that
look a bit like plumed cockscomb. As the name implies, it is grown
commercially for bird food. Quaking grass (Briza maxima) has
dangling, heart-shaped seed heads that dance in a breeze. The seed
heads of animated oats (Avena sterilis) have awns that twist and
untwist when laid on a moist surface, a habit that makes them
useful as fly-fishing lures.
</P>
<P>
   But most decorative annual grasses are grown for their flower
stalks, which don't really look like flowers but more like feathery
or fluffy plumes. If you intend to use them as fresh or dried
flowers, you should cut them before the color starts to fade and
seeds develop. They dry quickly hanging upside down in bunches in a
dark, well-ventilated place.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's-tail grass (Lagurus ovatus) produces white puffs at the
ends of foot-tall stems. The dark rose plumes of champagne grass
(Rhynchelytrum repens) are about 2 feet long and are produced
continuously from June until autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) grows to 2 feet, with
lavender-purple plumes. Feathertop (Pennisetum vilosum) produces
white, woolly plumes that look like small versions of pampas grass.
Red switch grass (Panicum violaceum) and prairie switch grass (P.
virgatum) are on the tall side, at 4 to 6 feet, but the purple-red
plumes are so delicate and airy that the plant doesn't look
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Switch grass is a perennial, and fountain grass will overwinter
in mild climates. Both bloom the first year from seed, and can be
grown as annuals, although you'll have to pull up the switch grass
to keep it from coming back the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Growing annual grasses is easy. Most can be sowed directly into
the garden in early spring, several weeks before the last frost. A
few, like Job's-tears, germinate better if started indoors under
warmer conditions. If you intend to grow grasses among your annual
flowers, you might want to start them indoors so they can be set
out with the flowering plants. Wherever you start them, a pinch of
seeds _ five or six _ is enough to produce a clump.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessary to thin the seedlings. If there are too many,
the strongest plants will crowd out the weaker ones.
</P>
<P>
   Most annual grasses will produce flower plumes 12 to 15 weeks
from seeding, so a clump of fountain grass planted in early April
will be in bloom just in time to rescue the flower garden from the
dog days of late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Seed heads of annual grasses do not persist through the winter
as well as those of perennial ornamental grasses, so you may want
to remove the plants after they have bloomed and replace them with
something like fall-blooming chrysanthemums or pansies.
</P>
<P>
   Annual grasses also need to be planted every year, as they do
not reliably seed themselves. That's really no disadvantage. If the
grasses seeded themselves, either they would become a nuisance or
the flower garden would become another lawn.
</P>
<P>
   A lawn, you'll remember, consists of that green stuff you have
to mow frequently.

DENALI: MOUNTAIN OF LUXURY AND $$$ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Who'd ever think:
</P>
<P>
   - Disco would make a comeback?
</P>
<P>
   - Nipple rings would be popular fashion accessories for men?
</P>
<P>
   - Full-size, luxury sport-utility vehicles would become major
cash cows for automakers?
</P>
<P>
   Range Rover kicked off trend No. 3, adding the element of
snootiness to the realm of four-by-fours. Then Chrysler joined the
fray with its Grand Cherokee; Toyota kicked its Land Cruiser up
into the social stratosphere; Mercedes and Lexus hatched their own
SUVs; and Ford piled Eddie Bauer accessories onto its Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also raised the ante and demonstrated the force of the
trend when it elevated its already big and expensive Expedition
into Lincoln territory. The resulting Navigator, with the prow of a
great yacht and a price tag to match, became a monster hit for
Lincoln dealerships, boosting their sales receipts by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Who'd ever think? It's as if all the Cadillac Eldorados,
Chrysler Imperials and other pleasure barges of the '50s and '60s
had been reincarnated. As trucks, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, General Motors was getting the message. The General
possessed the granddaddy of heavy cruisers, the Chevrolet/GMC
Suburban, plus its shorter versions, Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon.
Lavishing these formerly utilitarian beasts with option packages
that include many yards of leather, wood and stylish trim brought
them up to snuff on Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lesson of the Navigator looms large, and GM knew it
had to capitalize on the trend quickly to reap the profits. Its
heavy artillery needed to have a stronger identity to satisfy the
country-club crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Denali. This represents the first foray for GMC,
formerly GM's utility and work-truck division, into the big world
of luxury trucks. GM has merged GMC with Pontiac, and is proceeding
to change its image toward luxury and performance.
</P>
<P>
   The luxo version of the Yukon, Denali is named after Denali
National Park and Preserve in Alaska and is the Native American
name for the south peak of Mount McKinley, which is in the park,
natch. The fact that the Denali looks as big as a mountain sitting
among other cars and SUVs is coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, GM is at war with itself as well as its competitors,
with a dolled-up Cadillac SUV coming out sometime next year,
seemingly in direct competition with Denali. For now, GMC owns the
terrain and should sell plenty of these cushy trucks before Caddy
rolls out theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali is best appreciated from the inside out. Soft,
fragrant leather seats, attractive dashboard with exotic wood
veneers, thick carpeting, fabulous stereo system, every power
option known to man. You name it, it's in here. All standard.
</P>
<P>
   The six-way power seats are big and broad, with high backs and
long bottoms for extra support, and are as comfortable as
drawing-room chairs in an expensive men's club. This is the E
Ticket ride for a cross-country trip, especially if you're hauling
some gear or towing a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   But be ready to pony up the gas money, because this big boy has
a big appetite. That's what happens when nearly 3 tons of heft are
being pulled around by a powerful V-8 engine. The engine, basically
a Chevy 350, is strong and smooth, though it roars with effort as
it struggles to accelerate the heavy Denali.
</P>
<P>
   Cornering is somewhat tippy, and the driveability is not quite
up to the standard set by the Navigator, which steers better and
feels more stable on the road.
</P>
<P>
   All the Denalis are four-wheel-drive, operated by a set of
buttons that allows you to choose, with just one finger:
two-wheel-drive, four-wheel-drive in high or low range, or fully
automatic four-wheel-drive that does all the work for you. Simple
and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The front-end styling is vaguely reminiscent of Chrysler's big
Ram pickup, which looks like a semi-tractor front. Denali's hood is
more contoured than the standard Yukon; the front has a distinctive
grille and bumper treatment. The look is a sneak preview of next
year's Yukon/Tahoe/Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news about the body styling is the tacky-looking plastic
body cladding that swathes the Denali's lower parts, wrapping
around wheel wells and sheathing the quarter panels. Some GM
designer must think this is classy, but to me, it looks like a
cheap custom kit purchased through a mail-order catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The Yukon is a good-looking truck and doesn't need a bunch of
plastic junk glued to its flanks to make it appear upscale.
</P>
<P>
   One problem encountered in the interior is the placement of the
flip switch for the heated seats. They are tucked out of sight with
the rest of the seat adjustments and are far too easy to
accidentally switch on, resulting in a toasted rear end on a summer
day. Believe me, I know.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the Denali that's bigger and more impressive than
its sheer scale is its sticker price. Sure, it includes everything
standard, but it's still shocking. This $40,000-$50,000 range seems
to be where these popular luxury behemoths are landing. And people
are buying them up as fast as Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Beanie Babies. Now there's another one. Who'd ever think? &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In late May four teachers and administrators, sitting
solemnly behind a table at the office of a top Manhattan public
school, delivered the bad news to Elizabeth and Antonio Trindade.
Their son, Lorenzo, could not keep up. He needed to be placed in
special education classes at a smaller school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trindade listened with disbelief. The future she had
imagined for her child _ a competitive high school, maybe an Ivy
League university _ was disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant past, this sort of conference might have
occurred in Lorenzo's eighth year of school, or even as early as
the fourth grade. But Lorenzo was 6 years old. He was failing
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could kill my son,'' Ms. Trindade said of the school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   So she responded as if Lorenzo had been diagnosed with a fatal
disease: she went looking for a second opinion. After that meeting,
she arranged appointments with a child psychologist and a
pediatrician. And then she took Lorenzo to a Huntington Learning
Center, one of the for-profit tutorial and educational centers that
are becoming increasingly common in cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, Ms. Trindade joined thousands of other parents
across the country who are plunging into the vast world of
``supplemental education,'' of which chains like Huntington, Sylvan
and Score! make up only a part. In the past five years, an enormous
educational industry has taken off to meet the needs and demands of
parents who are either frustrated with schools, or fearful that
their children will fall behind in an increasingly competitive
world.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of products and services _ how-to books, software
titles, learning centers, private tutoring programs _ is stunning.
Since 1991, Sylvan, one of the first chains of storefront learning
centers, has grown from 466 to 700 outlets across the country, with
more than 124,000 students registered last year. Huntington is also
expanding, from 112 centers in 1995 to a planned 200 by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we get from parents is not so much that they're
frustrated with schools, but that they're frustrated with their
child's performance,'' said Ray Huntington, who with his wife,
Eileen, founded the first Huntington Learning Center in Oradell,
N.J., in 1977. ``Originally, we were the last choice. Today, we are
increasingly the first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   There is so much educational software that stores cannot come
close to stocking it all. About three new titles arrive on the
market every day, all aspiring to become the next ``Rabbit Reader''
or ``Jumpstart.'' Last year, sales of educational software topped
$511 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest sellers are for children in preschool through third
grade, and the target group seems to be getting only younger: the
new ``Jumpstart Baby'' is for babies 9 to 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say there will soon be electrodes they will hook up to a
woman's stomach that will be educational,'' said Ann Stephens,
president of PC Data, which tracks software sales. ``What's next?
`Jumpstart Fetus'?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But parental anxiety over education and future
success certainly helps explain some books, like ``Career Coaching
Your Kids, for Ages 6 to 26. The volume of materials hasn't
necessarily made for more clarity: Different books and tutoring
programs often espouse contradictory advice, like using the phonics
or whole-language approaches _ or neither _ to help children learn
to read. Some child development experts note, meanwhile, that many
``new approaches'' on the market are merely repackaged old maxims
like drills and memorization.
</P>
<P>
   What also concerns many development experts is the notion that
young children can be cleanly assessed and categorized. However
good their intentions, they say, parents and schools must be
careful not to place unrealistic expectations on young children,
and they caution that learning is not a one-size-fits-all
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a magic bullet for everything now,'' said Gail Furman,
a Manhattan child psychologist who works with several private
schools. ``If you're depressed, you take Prozac. If you're
impotent, you take Viagra. If you have a learning problem, you get
tutored, get tested and you think it will all get better. But
that's not always true.''
</P>
<P>
   Young children, Dr. Furman noted, develop differently. Some may
excel in early grades; others may take longer to bloom. One child
with early reading or handwriting problems may be incredibly
creative; another who achieves early may simply be more mature and
better organized. The second child may be identified early as a
high achiever _ and then end up struggling later as school subjects
become more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You then make these kids `labeled' and `identified,' and what
happens is they become more and more defensive and self-conscious
about learning,'' Dr. Furman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, though, the intense competition for admittance
into top elementary schools, public and private, often hinges on
early assessments. Private tutors charge up to $150 an hour on the
Upper East Side to help students meet, or get ahead of, their
workloads.
</P>
<P>
   In her own practice, Dr. Furman says she sees many examples of
children who she believes are inappropriately labeled as slow
learners by schools. She is now counseling a 6-year-old girl in
kindergarten whose parents want her to attend an elite elementary
school. In one sample of her work, the child has written, ``Ples Do
Not Tush, Thik you.'' She scored well on I.Q. tests, but has not
yet grasped spelling and reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child has been identified as a youngster with severe
learning problems,'' Dr. Furman said. ``Her parents have been
advised to get outside tutoring and counseling, and that she may
not be a candidate for the school.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents wait up to a year to take their children to Dr. Mel
Levine, director of the Center for Development and Learning at the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. The
author of several highly regarded books on child development, Dr.
Levine agrees with Dr. Furman that early assessments can lead to
premature conclusions, except where a child has severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, parents are right to be concerned if a fourth
grader is still struggling to read, or if a sixth grader resists
writing or doing homework. Such a child could have subtle motor
problems, memory problems or difficulty in organizing ideas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because he considers learning disorders to be an ``epidemic,''
Dr. Levine credited private learning centers with providing strong
remedial tutoring in basic skill subjects like reading and math.
But he said parents should not believe these programs are
reinventing the educational wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these programs portray themselves as being on the
cutting edge, but they're doing things that are very traditional,''
he said, adding that much of what is offered is old-fashioned
repetitive drilling.
</P>
<P>
   A conflict of interest can exist, Dr. Levine said, when centers
that offer tutoring also sell child-assessment services. ``You come
in, and you get assessed, and they say, `Well, we just happen to
have exactly what you need,' '' he said. ``It would be better to
separate assessment and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Glazar, a Sylvan spokeswoman, noted that Sylvan uses the
respected California Achievement Test to make its assessments;
Huntington uses a combination of tests, including parts of the
California test.
</P>
<P>
   But another potential area for conflicts of interest can come
from ``co-branding.'' In one example, Sylvan and the software
company Virtual Knowledge have a relationship in which children who
take Virtual Knowledge's ``Children's Skills Test'' assessment
software are nudged toward Sylvan for help.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dr. Levine has not seen that test, he cautioned parents
about placing too much weight on findings from any generalized,
at-home computer assessments. In many ways, this assessment is a
descendant of the old at-home I.Q. tests. Designed to be ``fun''
and not intimidating to children, the at-home assessment software
is based on the Iowa Skills Test and the California Achievement
Test, according to company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, many assessment specialists _ like child
psychologists, developmental pediatricians and educational
diagnosticians _ are struggling to stay in business, because
relatively few parents can afford the hundreds of dollars needed to
pay for a comprehensive evaluation, and insurance usually does not
cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Such specialized assessment can include a battery of medical and
diagnostic tests. Lawrence Green, a retired educational therapist
and diagnostician who lives near San Jose, Calif., said only
specialists can properly assess complicated, underlying learning
weaknesses that often go undetected in quick diagnostic
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parent is faced with all these options and they have
limited resources,'' said Green, whose book, ``Finding Help When
Your Child Is Struggling in School,'' will be published later this
summer by Golden Books. ``What they know is: `I have a child who is
bright and capable, but he is not working at a level commensurate
with his ability. So what can I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that lower-income children, many of whom would
greatly benefit from extra help, are far less likely to get it,
pushing them even further behind academically. Educational software
begins at around $30. And most poor families don't have home
computers in any case. One session at a learning center, meanwhile,
can cost $55 to $75 an hour, depending on the child's age and skill
level, and the centers suggest three hours a week _ putting the
price beyond the reach of many middle-class families as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning centers work, obviously, with kids who have
money,'' said Deborah Briggs, who owns two Huntington franchises in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a small number of public school systems, using
federal grants, have contracted with Sylvan to operate tutoring
centers in disadvantaged schools. And there are nonprofit programs
sprinkled across the country. The Readnet Foundation operates
programs in five upper Manhattan schools, using computers and
specially designed software to provide intensive reading support
and tutoring for underprivileged children. But these programs are
the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get 100 calls a month, 60 percent of them are from
parents who are really poor,'' Ms. Briggs said. ``The first thing
they ask is do we have financial aid. It's unbelievably
heartbreaking.'' She said currently she has five lower-income
students being tutored for free.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briggs emphasized that learning centers are not designed for
students with problems like dyslexia or other learning
disabilities. Instead, they best serve students who, for one reason
or another, are not reaching their potential.
</P>
<P>
   At Huntington, incoming students undergo two to three hours of
diagnostic and achievement testing to determine reading level, to
measure phonetic ability, to assess ability to recall information
and to pinpoint learning strengths and weaknesses. In one test, the
Slosson Visual-Motor Performance Test, a child is shown 14
different shapes and asked to perform tasks; for example, to ``draw
a straight line inside the rectangle.'' Ms. Briggs said this test
helps establish whether a child can process visual information
properly.
</P>
<P>
   She said her tutors _ all of them certified teachers _ do not
adhere to any particular educational philosophy. If they think
phonics will work, fine. If it is whole-word reading, fine. The
educational director, Robert Golden, says four of five students
show improvement after several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about going to a child's weaknesses and helping them
survive with that weakness,'' Ms. Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the promise of individualized attention is why so many
parents turn to help outside their children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how good or bad the school system is,'' said
Gary Natriello, a professor at Columbia University's Teachers
College, who took his own son to Sylvan. ``They're organized to
produce bunches of kids. They're just not organized to really
address the needs of particular kids. They're not organized to help
a kid catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, chains like Sylvan and Huntington may seem as
similar as McDonald's is to Burger King. Both use a ratio of one
tutor per three pupils and both have similar hourly rates. But
Sylvan offers an incentive plan in which students can earn points
toward winning a prize, such as a skateboard; Huntington considers
rewards to be the wrong message. Sylvan guarantees that a student's
reading skills will jump at least one reading level after 36 hours
of tutelage; Huntington doesn't make guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent learning centers or private tutorial services
offer even more individual attention. K.C. Genzamer, a Manhattan
tutor who charges $90 an hour and works with children ages 3 to 14,
offers a weekend study hall at her apartment so students can drop
by to work on homework.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Nelson, a retired teacher who opened Learning Power, a
tutoring center in Hartford, offers one tutor for every student.
Ms. Nelson said she decided against buying a Sylvan or Huntington
franchise because of what she described as their ``cookie-cutter''
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time looking over report cards, calling
teachers,'' Ms. Nelson said. Ms. Glazar, the Sylvan spokeswoman,
responded that the centers offer the assurance of ``consistent
programs around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   If learning centers represent a 90's variation on old-style
tutoring, then software _ the other fast-growing component of the
supplemental education industry _ may be the educational brave new
world. Titles like ``Math Blaster,'' ``Reader Rabbit'' and ``Where
in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?'' already constitute something of
a canon. There seems little doubt that using educational software
only enhances children's computer literacy, and many parents regard
it as essential to preparing for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are very worried in general that the world is going to
turn into a computer-generated place, and that their kids have got
to get started prenatally,'' said Mary Sue Lindley, an elementary
school computer teacher at Public School 321 in Park Slope,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Shohet, an executive producer with Hasbro Interactive,
which makes computer games with an educational bent, said that
``edutainment'' is the most recent trend for children. In
edutainment, the emphasis is on visual graphics and ``fun''
animated characters. ``People are doing more entertainment-form
titles that happen to have some education in them,'' Ms. Shohet
said. ``Fun,'' of course, is part of the attraction of software;
unlike rote school exercises, children embrace software learning
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to say that just because something is fun, it
isn't educational,'' Ms. Shohet said.
</P>
<P>
   But even educators involved with software worry that some
products labeled as educational are merely thinly veiled video
games. Robin Hubbard, executive director of the Readnet Foundation,
which has developed a reading software program in conjunction with
Teachers College, said most titles ``for younger children are
really just pleasant looking, not based on academic theory,
generally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The software the little kids are using really has to be a
close relative to the television they have been watching,'' she
said. ``Otherwise it won't hold their interest.''
</P>
<P>
   What is lacking is an easy way to make sense of it all. In this,
the government offers little help. Charles Blaschke, head of
Education Turnkey System, a market research group that monitors
federal and state initiatives for software, said that the last
major study of computer-based education in schools was done in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   For simply weeding through the options, the Web sites of Family
PC, Children's Software Revue, Home PC and Technology &AMP; Learning
offer reviews of new software.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say the evolution of software is already
transforming the learning process for the better. Voice-sensitive
computer software can interact with students doing exercises. The
not-too-distant future of virtual reality _ when a student can put
on a headset and find himself in first-century Asia Minor _
tantalizes many educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only the beginning,'' said Paul Houston, executive
director of the American Association of School Administrators.
``It's going to inevitably revolutionize a lot of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Kids and families are having direct access to learning and
education, he added. They don't have to go through an intermediary
like a school.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Trindade is spending much of the summer looking for
ways to help her son. Huntington determined that Lorenzo was, in
fact, in need of tutoring and recommended three hours a week at
$225. Ms. Trindade could not afford it. She is a personal trainer
who runs her own business; her husband is a personal trainer for a
health club.
</P>
<P>
   After Huntington, Ms. Trindade took Lorenzo to a child
psychologist, who raised the possibility of attention deficit
disorder. She also bought a copy of ``The World Almanac for
Children,'' and she kept meeting with officials at Manhattan's
District 2.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she said, she reached a compromise with them: Lorenzo
will repeat kindergarten this fall rather than transfer into
special education. In her research, she discovered that Lorenzo was
one of only a few children in his class who hadn't attended
preschool. Perhaps, Ms. Trindade said, Lorenzo wasn't slow, but
simply behind before he had started.
</P>
<P>
   To help him catch up, she has restructured her home life. She
now spends time every day tutoring Lorenzo; when he makes up his
bed, he has to also spell b-e-d. She has devised counting games and
learning games, partly from consulting books. He also works with
different educational software titles.
</P>
<P>
   It's all geared toward one goal: success, from first grade on.
``I didn't realize that after kindergarten,'' she said, ``you've
got to be ready.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fourth consecutive weekend with low humidity and dry
conditions is expected across much of the Northeast. Sprawling high
pressure will circulate seasonable air into New England with
cumulus clouds developing during the afternoon over the hilly
terrain. It will be mainly sunny from the Northeast Coast to the
Middle Atlantic states and westward through the Ohio Valley and
southern Great Lakes. With light winds and low humidity, there will
be large variations in temperature both from day to night and
between urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The push of Canadian air will reach into the Southeast with
considerable clouds and clusters of showers and thunderstorms
mostly concentrated along the leading edge of the cooler air mass.
Meanwhile, high pressure over the Gulf of Mexico will sponsor
continued hot, dry conditions over Texas and Louisiana. As sultry
air advances into the Plains, a large cluster of thunderstorms will
be generated over Kansas and western Nebraska. Farther north, humid
air streaming into the Dakotas and eastern Rockies will join with a
jet stream disturbance, triggering more thunderstorms.

   Much of the West will be sunny and warmer. High pressure
building along the Washington Coast will direct very warm air
toward the northern California shores. Marine air that has been
banked to the west of the Cascades will yield to drier, warmer
weather from the interior. A few thunderstorms will dampen the
southern Rockies, where the uneven heating of mountains and valleys
generates rising currents of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Island of Dryness
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Waterloo, Iowa, was on the verge of setting an
all-time record for July, having received only 0.35 inches of rain.
Waterloo's long-standing record for July dryness was set in the
Dust-Bowl year of 1936, when only 0.40 inches fell. This comparison
does not suggest that July should put in the same category as a
Dust Bowl year. The Dust Bowl drought was widespread and
protracted, spanning several years across much of the Plains. In
contrast, Waterloo received over 10 inches of rain in June, marking
its second wettest June. Moreover, most of Iowa was wetter than
average in July.

   AMD reduces prices on K6-2 processors
</P>
<P>
   By Omar L. Gallaga
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ AMD Inc. has cut prices on desktop computer processors
it makes in Austin to keep up with cuts by rival Intel Corp. The
move could make profits more elusive for AMD.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions on the K6-2 processors will keep its prices 25
percent lower than Intel's for comparable chips.
</P>
<P>
   When AMD Chief Executive Jerry Sanders introduced the K6 in
April 1997, he pledged prices would be 25 percent less than
Intel's. The K6 has been AMD's strongest challenger to Intel chips,
with companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM Corp. using it
in lower-cost PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said this week that it would cut prices by 18 percent to
31 percent on nearly all of the Pentium II and Celeron processors
it makes for PCs.
</P>
<P>
   AMD had said that it expected to post a profit in the second
half of this year after two years of losses. It would do that, the
company said in its earnings report earlier this month, by selling
3.5 million K6 and K6-2 processors in the third quarter and 4.5
million in the fourth quarter for a total of 12 million for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just putting more pressure on them,'' said
Michael Bernstein, an analyst with Semico Research. ``I think
they're going to be very challenged (to make a profit).''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMD slipped in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on Wednesday, falling 81 1/4 cents to $15.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The price cuts come even as a worldwide slowdown in the
semiconductor industry has eroded profits from companies, including
Intel and AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, AMD announced it lost $64.6 million despite
increased sales of its K6 processors.
</P>
<P>
   AMD will be further challenged when PC makers begin introducing
systems using Intel's new Mendocino processor, designed to compete
with AMD in the low-end PC market. Those systems are expected to
begin shipping late next month. So far, AMD won't say how it will
price its own processors in comparison to Mendocino chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to ship faster K6-2 processors at 350 MHz in
the third quarter and 400 MHz by the end of the year. The company
also expects to begin producing its follow-up product, the K6-3, by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, AMD will begin work on producing the next-generation
K7 in Austin, with production at a new facility in Dresden,
Germany, to begin in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   AMD is not offering a 25 percent discount against Intel's
Celeron processors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, AMD is matching prices on those processors, insisting
that its K6, while running at the same clock speed, offers better
performance and enhanced graphic capabilities missing in the
Celeron.

 &HT;    COLUMN: NASCAR fastest growing spectator sport in country
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sitting several hours in Thursday's rain, staring
at an empty race track and the bundled hulks of Winston Cup cars
hidden under heavy tarpaulins, was nothing for Tom and Diane
McDonald, their 12-year-old son T.J. and his buddy, Matt Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the McDonalds left their Gondert Avenue home in
Dayton for the Brickyard 400 qualifying and got as far as the
outskirts of Indianapolis when the transmission fell out of their
van.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just left it on the side of the interstate and started
walking 'til we got to an exit,'' McDonald said. ``We walked into a
motel and made two phone calls. One was to get the van towed back
to Dayton and the other was to get a taxi so we could get to the
track. The ride cost $40, but there was no way we were gonna miss
the Brickyard.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, huddled under a small brown umbrella in his Dale
Earnhardt tank top, cap and wristwatch, felt the same Thursday as
he sat in the middle of Section 25 in the uncovered grandstands at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His wife wore a rain parka and the two
ingenious kids were encased, barrel-like, in the blue and gold
plastic skirts that had been wrapped around the track's 55-gallon
trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold one for $5 to some guy who wanted to protect his
wife,'' Matt said incredulously. ``I could have sold more, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots more, since tens of thousands of other fans waited almost
four hours until the track dried enough for qualifying and Ernie
Irvan won the pole. That kind of not-so-dry devotion tells you a
lot about why NASCAR is the fastest growing spectator sport in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of increasing cynicism with pro sports, this is a love
affair that's heating up the turnstiles and the till. According to
a report by IEG, a Chicago-based consulting firm, NASCAR will
generate $1.1 billion in sponsorship revenue this year. That's more
than the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball _ COMBINED.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing, according to Nielsen Media Research, is the only
professional sport that has increased its TV audience each year
since 1990. Over the past five years, network ratings show NASCAR
with a 20.8 percent increase as compared to the NBA with an 8.9
increase, the NHL with a plus 5.6 percent, the NFL with a 6.9
decrease and Major League Baseball down 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a record 6.1 million people attended Winston Cup
races _ an average of 190,000 per event. Those numbers will
continue to jump as tracks are being built across the country _
including Kansas City, Chicago, Denver, Atlantic City and now Jerry
Carroll's speedway in Northern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already on his mailing list,'' said Mike and Tami
Cunningham of Cincinnati as they sat huddled beneath a
9-foot-by-12-foot sheet of plastic. ``We're waiting with an open
check book. We want tickets to the Kentucky track.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McDonald felt the same: ``I'll be first in line for tickets,
even if it means camping out down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup racing has become the nation's motor sport of
choice, especially since the IndyCar circuit continues to dilute
its product with a nasty civil war. Even in Thursday's rain, there
was more excitement around Indianapolis than there was this past
May. Unlike with the 1998-version of the Indianapolis 500, the
hotels and restaurants here are full, the best drivers in the
business are all gathered and sponsors are clamoring to get their
names on the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who grew up 20 miles from the Speedway in Pittsboro
and who won the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994, senses the
pendulum swing: ``What always made the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
and the Indy 500 is that the best of the best were in one series.
That's what I think we hold right now. We've got the best of the
best in stock car racing. And now that we're here, I'd love seeing
it be the top event here.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it already?
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Brickyard 400 winner Ricky Rudd wouldn't commit:
``Man, I hate to touch that one. I'm still a fan of the Indy 500,
but I don't think they did the race justice when they split the
sport. It's hurt the recognition. But it wouldn't be fair for me to
say stock cars are bigger than IndyCars.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to _ the numbers say it for him. This past May
the Indy 500 drew a 5.6 TV rating - down 33 percent from 1995, the
last year CART drivers were in the race. Meanwhile, this year's
Daytona 500 drew an 8.6 audience. Even lesser NASCAR races have
drawn Indy 500 numbers. Saturday's Brickyard will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Daytona 500 overtook the Brickyard in total purse
money this year, the crowd here _ annually at 300,000 _ is bigger.
And there would be an even larger gathering _ possibly eclipsing
the Indy 500 _ if the speedway would put more tickets on sale.
</P>
<P>
   If there are restraints on the gate here, there are none on
sponsorships. The top 10 national advertisers all market products
in NASCAR and IEG has found NASCAR alone will account for 10
percent of all the money spent this year on sports sponsorships by
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   As Bruton Smith, who owns the Charlotte, Atlanta and Texas
speedways, said: ``When you see Fortune 500 companies getting
involved, what are they getting? Number one, they get exposure for
their product. We find our fans are intensely loyal to their
product. If there's a product on one of these cars and a product on
the shelf next to it, our fans will pick up the product that's on
that car.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is there such loyalty?
</P>
<P>
   ``These drivers don't go on strike or refuse to report,''
McDonald said. ``They appreciate the fans. The stars here walk past
and they give autographs. You don't see that with a lot of pro
football and basketball guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunnigham agreed: ``There aren't prima donnas here. These guys
are like you and me. When Harry Gant was driving, he put on roofs
during the week, then got in his stock car on the weekend. There's
something that draws you to guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even football and basketball players feel the stock car pull.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Washington, the former San Francisco 49ers running back who
now fields a NASCAR Grand National team with former basketball
great Julius Erving, talked about the allure of NASCAR:
</P>
<P>
   ``After you attend one of these events, there's no way for you
not to be a fan. If there's a NASCAR event on TV, there's no way I
can walk past. It's as if Lawrence Taylor jumped in front of me and
tackled me. I stop dead. I've got to take it in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the same mindset Tom McDonald showed when he loaded his
family into a taxi to get to the track two years ago, the same
mindset Mike Cunningham and his wife had beneath that plastic
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could have got me out of here, today,'' Mike said.
``Well . . . almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a hole melted in the plastic. ``I tried to smoke a
cigar underneath here. I burned the plastic and ruined the cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   Tami laughed: ``Yeah, but he brought two more big plastic sheets
along, too. It could rain all weekend. We'd still be here.

 &HT;    Avery in doghouse
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ This is the definition of an optimist. You are an
NFL rookie. Training camp is 10 days old and you are in the coach's
doghouse. In fact, you figure you have ``the biggest chain in the
whole doghouse'' strapped to your neck.
</P>
<P>
   And you see this as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   This is Miami Dolphins running back John Avery's view of the
saga that has unfolded ever since he strained his right hamstring
Sunday during an intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   He has since been the target of criticism from Dolphins coach
Jimmy Johnson for missing two days (and counting) of practices, for
showing up 15 minutes before a walk-through and for joking with
healthy teammates during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Avery's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he has taken Johnson's words to heart. Yes, he wants to
please the boss. Yes, he wants to work hard to get healthy as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, he is not sitting in his room at night, frantically
calling his mother or his agent to complain about how the man who
just last week was covering him with praise is now blasting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach wants me back out there,'' Avery said. ``That's the way
I look at it. Not that coach dislikes me. I'm looking at it as he
knows I can contribute to the offense and I need to be out there.
That does more for my confidence than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at the negative things. I'm looking at the
positive things. I'm looking at getting well, getting back out
there and getting out of the doghouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he says, ``boy, I got the biggest chain in the
doghouse around my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that the only way to remove that chain is to get back
on the field and start making the kind of runs the Dolphins
envisioned when they made him their first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try some things to see how far to go,'' he said.
``I don't want to reinjure it and be back and forth between the
field and the training room throughout camp. I'm going to work
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to ask whether there is pressure to work
through it even when there is pain.
</P>
<P>
   All one has to do is wander through the locker room. Stop by
linebacker Derrick Rodger's locker. Look at the sign taped to one
side that says, ``I feel pain, but it doesn't control me.'' Check
out the one on the other side that says, in part, ``when the tough
get going, they don't say my leg is hurting or my feet are sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the talk. Just a few lockers away from Avery,
linebacker Anthony Harris is describing having his finger
dislocated Tuesday ... the bone popped through the skin ... it was
pointing this way ... it was throbbing like a second heart.
</P>
<P>
   Harris missed one practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one of those war injuries,'' he says. ``Got to tape it up
and go.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the NFL. Avery knew it would be like this. His first day
of training camp he looked over and saw rookie fullback Landon
Smith vomiting. Smith did not stop playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than in college,'' Avery said that day. ``When
you're in college, if you're the star and you get sick, 30 trainers
come running out. They wipe your mouth for you and say, `Are you
OK?' Here you've got to suck it up and keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Avery know that three days later he would feel
something in his right hamstring. He didn't say much about it then.
It wasn't until the scrimmage _ after he carried the ball six times
in eight plays and crumpled to the ground _ that the injury jumped
into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even after the injury, Avery says his biggest task in
training camp isn't physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest part is going to be how well I get through it
mentally,'' he said. ``Physically, I'm going to get well, I'm going
to get better, I'm going to get back out there. The mental aspects
are going to be the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trying the real thing: The Dolphins usually use college
officials for their practices. Thursday, though, three NFL
officials _ Dale Hammer, Tom White and Jim Quirk _ were on the
field. They also will work today's practice and Saturday's
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps us, especially working on some new techniques
and things we're doing in the secondary, just to see how they're
going to call pass interference,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   By training camp standards, it was an easy day. One practice.
Shorts. No hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got quite a few guys banged up,'' Johnson said.
``Nothing serious, but I wanted to pull back a little.''

</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Now that Monica Lewinsky has made a deal to
testify that she had a sexual relationship with President Clinton,
the American
</P>
<P>
   people have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now can either believe a man of such rectitude that he
never inhaled when he smoked marijuana or they can believe a lying,
little tramp.
</P>
<P>
   Put that way, a lot of Americans would choose to believe
Clinton, particularly if the economy remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   However he puts it, Clinton's well-honed modus operandi is to
trash the reputations of his accusers who can't otherwise be
deflected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's M.O. is to deflect potential accusers either with a
reward, such as the cushy government job he obtained for Gennifer
Flowers, or
</P>
<P>
   with a smear campaign, such as the one his investigators and
spin doctors did on Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Some accusers, such as Flowers and Kathleen Willey, get
Clinton's double-barreled treatment. Now that Lewinsky has grasped
the idea that
</P>
<P>
   people who lie under oath can go to prison, she should prepare
herself for Clinton's second barrel _ his ``dark side,'' according
to Leon Panetta.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton (or some nice person who works for him) helped land
Lewinsky a job in the Pentagon complete with a security clearance,
which is a
</P>
<P>
   classic example of Clinton's first-step damage control strategy.
But with subpoenas, affidavits and rumors clogging the air at the
White House, Vernon Jordan, Clinton's fixer, got several nice
out-of-town jobs lined up for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did much the same for Clinton's Arkansas buddy and
Whitewater insider Webster L. Hubbell just before the big guy went
down for the count for felonious fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the American ambassador to the United Nations met
at his home to discuss a U.N. job for Clinton's former intern
friend, who also
</P>
<P>
   could testify against him, is in keeping with Clinton's
time-tested M.O. for bimbo eruptions and scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dirt diggers, Investigative Group International, has
reportedly armed Clinton with every speck of dirt in Lewinsky's
background. These investigators performed a similar service for
Clinton in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky testifies that she had a sexual relationship with
Clinton, then someone is lying under oath, which, as everyone
knows, is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   This investigation is not about sex, which is a deflection
tactic used by Clinton's spin doctors . It is about high crimes and
misdemeanors. It is about the crimes of lying under oath,
obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has testified under oath that he did not have sex with
Lewinsky. He also looked right in the television camera and told
the American people that he did not have sex with the young woman
to whom he gave special gifts.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky does change her testimony under oath to say that she
and Clinton had a sexual relationship, then Clinton must shift the
criminal
</P>
<P>
   perjury blame back to Lewinsky by arguing that she told the
truth the first time she was questioned but lied the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Without any other evidence, all prosectors and the American
people will know is that either Clinton or Lewinsky is guilty of
criminal perjury.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a classic ``he-said, she-said'' dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dirt diggers may be able to produce evidence and
anecdotes that Lewinsky told lies in the past and therefore she
should not be
</P>
<P>
   believed now.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a tough sell because Clinton has been lying,
bending the truth, shading the truth and denying the truth since
before Lewinsky was born. Remember his lies and deception about how
he avoided military service? He's not called Slick Willie for
nothing.

 &HT;    Austin's Sensus Drug hopes to raise $46 million in initial
public offering
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Sensus Drug Development Corp. of Austin is planning to
raise up to $46 million by selling shares of stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   That would make it the first Austin-based biotechnology company
to make an initial public offering. Others in Austin's small
community of biotech companies are publicly traded, but they were
based elsewhere when they went public.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old company is attempting to commercialize a drug
called Trovert that may be useful in treating a rare disease that
stems from excessive pituitary gland activity.
</P>
<P>
   Called acromegaly, the disease can result in abnormal growth in
the hands, feet and other parts of the body. It can lead to heart
disease and cancer. Andre the Giant, the late professional
wrestler, suffered from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sensus estimates about 40,000 people are now receiving another
drug therapy for acromegaly.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawkins, who previously had founded a drug-testing
company, formed Sensus with Dr. John Scarlett in 1994 to work in
partnership with researchers to speed development of drugs for
niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   Trovert is the company's first drug candidate and is ready for
the last phase of clinical tests. The company intends to seek
approval from U.S. and European drug regulators in the second half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins founded Pharmaco Dynamics Research Inc. in the mid-1980s
as an Austin-based clinical drug testing company. He sold the
company in 1992 to Applied Bioscience International for $95 million
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   According to the registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Sensus would raise up to $46
million by selling up to 5 million shares of common stock. The
company, in four years of operation, has accumulated losses of
$32.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for drug companies to post heavy losses as
they develop drugs. The goal is to recoup investment and add profit
by selling drugs with high margins while they are protected by
patents.
</P>
<P>
   Existing shareholders own just over 23 million shares of stock.
Principal shareholders include: Ross Financial Corp. of Grand
Cayman Island, British West Indies, 8 million shares, 34.8 percent;
Richard Hawkins, 2.98 million shares, 12.9 percent; Dr. Nona Niland
of Austin, 2.98 million shares, 12.9 percent; Genentech Inc., 1.66
million shares, 7.2 percent; Chief Executive Officer Dr. John
Scarlett, 1.38 million shares, 6 percent; Goldman Sachs Group, 1.19
million shares, 5.2 percent; and Corporate Director Lyle Hohnke,
922,381 shares, 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use the funds raised in the offering to pay
for further drug testing for Trovert, for repayment of $1.6 million
in debt, and for establishing a sales and marketing organization
for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters for the offering are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.;
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities; and BankAmerica Robertson
Stephens.

Executive Jerry Sanders introduced the K6 in April 1997, he pledged
prices would be 25 percent less than Intel's. The K6 has been AMD's

DUTCH TEAM PULLS OUT OF TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   AUTUN, France _ Another day, another defection. Friday it was
the Dutch TVM team that pulled out of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   The five remaining riders on the team did not join the race that
started in Switzerland, where it finished Thursday, and headed back
to France. They would not even set foot back in the country, their
director said, but instead would leave Switzerland and make their
way back to the Netherlands via Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the team were taken away by police after
Tuesday's race and asked to give blood, urine, and hair samples as
part of the drug investigation that has shadowed the Tour since
just before its start. TVM did not drop out the next day, but three
other teams did, angered by what they consider harassment. The
remaining riders staged a slowdown, and the stage was nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday, TVM's team leader, Jeroen Blijlevens, quit the
race, and the rest of the team followed suit that night.
</P>
<P>
   The race that began July 11 with 189 riders is now down to 96,
with two days of racing to go. Some of those dropouts are the
results of crashes or fatigue, but most have withdrawn in defiance
amid the ongoing drug investigations by French police.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities placed Italian rider Rodolfo Massi under
investigation, one step short of charging him, the first such
action against a cyclist. Dr. Nicolas Terrados Cepada of the
Spanish team ONCE also was placed under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, there was a race Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The riders left Switzerland and headed west for a 150-mile ride
to this city of 16,000 near Dijon in central France. A group of 14
riders that included Pascal Derame and Frankie Andreu of the US
Postal Service team took off after just 15 minutes and opened a gap
of 15 minutes on the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But since no one in the lead group was top-ranked, the others
felt safe to let them go, since whoever won wouldn't affect the
overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   With about 5 miles left, a group of four bolted ahead to battle
it out on the flat sprint finish, and even though Derame appeared
in position to take it, he was edged by Swede Magnus Backstedt.
Andreu finished with a group just 25 seconds behind, and most of
the pack cruised in 16 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Backstedt, a former downhill skier, is the first Swede to win a
stage in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The overall standings remain the same, with Italian Marco
Pantani in first place, followed by Bobby Julich of Glenwood
Springs, Colo., and Jan Ullrich of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But in Saturday's time trial, all eyes will no doubt be on Tyler
Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., who surprised everyone with his
second-place finish in the time trial two weeks ago. ``Well, more
eyes will be on me than last time,'' he said Friday. ``Most people
were saying, `Who's this guy?' and going through their files to
figure out who I am and where I'd come from.''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed calm about the race as he relaxed before the stage
Friday, drinking coffee, eating a piece of apple pie, and talking
on a cell phone to his fiancee, Haven Parchinski, in Boston (at 4
a.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the race (today) is a lot like the last one, with a
lot of ups and downs, ups and downs, so I think that's good for
me,'' Hamilton said. ``But this is after about three weeks of
racing, so hopefully, my body will be able to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who was ranked fifth overall after that first time
trial, is now in 53d place. It's a disappointment, he said, but not
surprising, considering he suffered heat stroke one day last week
and almost pulled out of the race. ``My goal before the race was to
be in the top 20 or 25, but I lost an hour and 6 minutes in two
days last week,'' he said. ``But that's all right. You learn from
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The two riders who have the most at stake today are Julich and
Ullrich. They are separated by only 14 seconds and could easily
swap positions today.
</P>
<P>
   While Julich finished fourth in the last time trial, Ullrich won
the race and was 1 minute 18 seconds ahead of the US cyclist. If he
rides that way again, Ullrich wili probably leapfrog over Julich.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's race, Julich pedaled away from reporters,
saying, ``I have to get to the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the podium at the staging area where riders
sign in for the day's race, but by tomorrow, he might be talking
about a very different podium. That's the one in Paris, on the
Champs Elysees. And whether he's in second or third place, it's a
safe bet that Julich will be standing there.

WOOD TRAVELS TO THE US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ David Wood tells the story on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the Rockets, Hakeem Olajuwon told (general
manager) Ray Patterson, `You should have more players on this team
like David Wood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty impressive, huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' continues Wood. ``He said, `We need more
players making $300,000 so you have more money to pay me.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming David Wood has ever made $300,000 in one shot.
Maybe he has, but it's more likely that the Ultimate Handyman has
always settled for the minimum. He has, after all, played a total
of 412 NBA games for eight NBA teams. Throw in time spent in Italy,
Spain, and what we might call Denny's America (i.e., the CBA) and
you've got one of the great Marco Polo hoop resumes of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's representing Uncle Sam. Look what The Lockout hath
wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't a guy like me want to play for this team?'' he
says. ``This is a great opportunity. If I win a gold medal, it will
be the highlight of my basketball career.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich has made Wood a starting forward on his US team
here at the World Basketball Championships. He was in quick foul
trouble in the opener against Brazil. He was more conspicuous in
the loss to Lithuania (including a 3-pointer during a near-miss
comeback). And he was very efficient in Friday's 88-62 dispatch of
South Korea, shooting 4 for 5 from the floor while picking up two
rebounds and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players who chose to stiff USA Basketball and the world
championships are almost all cradle-to-grave spoiled athletic pups.
They were stars in high school. They schlepped around as AAU
princes. They were big deals in college. They were high draft
picks. They can afford to tip in large denominations.
</P>
<P>
   David Wood represents the flip side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 6-1 and 124 pounds as a sophomore in high school,'' he
reports. ``I got cut by the JVs.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Nevada-Reno via Skagit Junior College. He didn't
put up big numbers in Reno, either (12 points and 9 rebounds a game
as a senior). But what impressed NBA scouts was the same thing that
always seems to keep this 6-foot-7-inch forward employed. ``I
defend. I get offensive rebounds. I'm a 3-point shooter. I play
hard all the time,'' he explains. ``If you're looking for a guy
like that to come off your bench, then I'm your man.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is available. One of the reasons he was eager to get on
this team was the audition factor. ``I think there are as many as
seven or eight guys on the team who might wind up with NBA offers
if they play well in this tournament,'' he reasons. He figures he's
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was last seen in the NBA during the 1996-97 season
(Milwaukee). He split last season between Unicaja Malaga in the
Spanish League and the Rockford Lightning of the CBA. ``It's one
thing being a bench player in the NBA and it's another thing
playing in Europe and the CBA,'' he explains. ``I've played five
years as a role player in the NBA. In Europe and the CBA, I can
score. I averaged a double-double in Rockford. After you play there
for a while, you start to get your offensive aggressiveness back.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old journeyman _ if he isn't, then just who is? _ is
the complete team guy, so he is still smarting from the 84-82 loss
to Lithuania that keeps the US from getting a No. 1 seed in the
next round of this tournament. ``What happened, in my opinion, is
that we heard the game plan the coaches gave us, but it went in one
ear and out the other,'' he says. ``We did not rotate properly on
defense at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He still isn't sure how good this team is, although he
definitely knows how good it isn't. That realization became clear
when the US barely defeated middle-of-the-road Italy in an
exhibition game last Saturday night in Rome. ``My anxiety level
went up after that game,'' he admits. ``I realized then it won't be
a cakewalk for us here. We're good enough to win, but it depends on
a lot of factors. We'll have to play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   He pretty much implies that if the US doesn't bring home the
gold, it won't be the fault of the coaches. ``This might be the
best coaching I've ever had in my career,'' he says. ``Rudy, Del
(Harris), and Lon (Kruger) are all great communicators. The game
plans are superb. I know it sounds like I'm kissing some butt here,
but that's really the way I feel about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing David Wood knows something about, it's
coaches. In the NBA alone, he's had them in Chicago, Houston, San
Antonio, Detroit, Golden State, Phoenix, Dallas, and Milwaukee.
While in Houston, he came across Rudy T, then an assistant to Don
Chaney. Rudy already knew what made Wood tick, so it isn't so
surprising that he not only made this team but has wound up as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is well aware that he isn't playing for a Dream Team.
``We're looking for any motivation we can find,'' he says, ``but
some of the stuff that's been written and said is pretty hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst?
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in a Greek paper compared us to the lint at the bottom
of a washing machine,'' he replies. ``We had that translated for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood never gets too up or too down. ``Basketball is important,''
he says, ``but spiritual things are more important. I'm a follower
of Jesus Christ. I don't push my beliefs on anyone, but if someone
wants to find God, I'm there to share. Sometimes I think that's why
I've bounced around so much. He wants me to come in contact with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone out there thinks he has bounced around more than
Wood, let him or her speak now or forever remain silent. ``Most
guys like me spend a couple of years somewhere,'' he says. ``The
longest I've ever been anywhere is with Golden State for a year and
a half, and that was counting two different stints.''
</P>
<P>
   He was planning a normal summer. There was the matter of a
basketball camp, and there was a planned family vacation to Mexico.
Then one day, the phone rang and the voice on the other end asked
if he were interested in this US team. ``I talked to A.C. Green,
Armon Gilliam, and Chuck Person about it,'' Wood says, ``and they
said I should grab the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a childhood dream of mine, to play for the country.
When I was younger, you had to be an All-American. Now you've got
to be one of the top 30 players in the world. For me, this is huge.
It's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   There couldn't possibly be any more to say.

CHOOSE SOMEONE WORTHY OF SERVING, BILL  
 (THIS EDITORIAL IS APPEARING THE AUG. 1 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a thought:
</P>
<P>
   If President Bill Clinton is interested in filling job vacancies
in the federal government, how about filling them with qualified
people?
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall Clinton's selection of Zoe Baird for attorney
general, Lani Guinier for a Justice Department position and Judge
Frederica Massiah-Jackson to serve on the U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia never got off the ground. It wasn't going to happen,
thanks to the excess baggage attached to the nominees'
controversial careers.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton still hasn't learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee killed
Clinton's nomination of Daryl Jones to be Air Force secretary. The
president should have seen this coming and spared all concerned an
unpleasant battle.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his nomination last fall, Jones had difficulty _
indeed, different stories _ in answering several charges against
him. He boasted he had 2,000 hours of flying time, while official
records showed he had far fewer hours in the air. Jones apparently
accepted supplemental Air Force flight pay that continued for 3{
years even though he was no longer flying and an Air Force enlisted
man told investigators Jones had sought to sell Amway products to
him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated
a Miami airport bond deal that involved lobbying by Jones on behalf
of a financial company, though no wrongdoing has been established.
</P>
<P>
   These lingering doubts led to the inevitable failure of the
Jones nomination, a bitter setback for the president who invested
long hours on the phone with skeptical senators. In the end,
Clinton _ again _ has no one to blame but himself. Next time, Bill,
pick someone who has unimpeachable credentials. &QL;

TEXAS JUDGE APPLIES CALIFORNIA-STYLE `GANG INJUNCTION' AGAINST 5
SUSPECTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Using a California-style ``gang injunction'' for
the first time in Texas, a judge Friday ordered five suspected gang
members not to associate and banned them from a seven-block area
where Austin police said they openly dealt illegal drugs and
intimidated merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the five young men to be public nuisances, state
District Judge Wilford Flowers issued a temporary injunction that
authorizes police to arrest them if they violate any of numerous
restrictions, including a ban on their using certain pay phones and
carrying beepers.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers called the restrictions unjustified and
unconstitutional. They contend existing drug laws and criminal
trespass sanctions are the appropriate remedies to discourage
unwelcome visitors.
</P>
<P>
   One cited testimony indicating that prosecutors in Houston and
other Texas cities are watching the Austin case with hopes of
adding the ``gang injunction'' to their arsenal of anti-drug
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are planning to appeal Flowers' decision to the 3rd
Court of Appeals. A jury trial will be held later to determine if
the temporary injunction should be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had issued a temporary restraining order against the
five men about three weeks ago. He strengthened it Friday after
conducting a four-day hearing that included testimony from police
and concerned neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said the injunction is the hard-earned prize of
the Windsor Park neighborhood, whose crime-weary citizens withstood
threats and bureaucratic frustrations to address their problem. The
neighborhood, just north of Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, is a
collection of modestly priced homes dissected by a bustling
commercial corridor along Cameron Road.
</P>
<P>
   The court order bars the five men from gathering along certain
blocks of Cameron Road and specifically bars them from the premises
of two convenience stores and two nearby apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story here is how people in the neighborhood got behind
business owners and really lent their support to get these folks
off their property and to quit using their property to sell dope,''
said Assistant District Attorney Bryan Case of Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not have a right to get together to commit crimes.
They just flat don't have it,'' said Case, who overcame arguments
that the injunction trampled the five men's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers claim the civil injunction violates the
defendants' rights of association and assembly and say it was based
on flimsy evidence that would not have been admitted in a criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good example of how we can set a precedent with
very measly facts,'' said attorney Francis Williams Montenegro, who
represents Percy Prejean, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro said prosecutors failed to prove that the defendants
were engaged in organized criminal activity to deliver cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most, the evidence showed that some of the defendants
possessed cocaine,'' Montenegro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lawmaking by the judge. It's very vague, and it gives to
police the power to decide what is abusive language or intimidating
behavior,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro noted that during the hearing before Flowers, an
Austin policeman testified that a mere smile from a gang member can
be construed as intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it `showing your grill.' So, if my client smiles in
that four-block area, he's going to be arrested,'' Montenegro said.
``Anything that he does, whether it's going to get an ice cream or
smiling or bending down, is suspect behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro acknowledged there was police testimony that the five
defendants are affiliated with a ``subset'' of the Crips gang, but
he insists they are not an ``organized criminal enterprise'' as the
state alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are a criminal organization, the term is used
pathetically loosely,'' Montenegro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are kids who aren't organized, don't have a hierarchy or
even a subculture. They're kids in the neighborhood who don't have
anything to do but hang out. And the very fact that they have a
place as their socializing square is suspect to people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Case said testimony showed the ``hanging out'' was far from
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had business owners and civilians who had seen these
defendants make hand-to-hand deliveries of things into cars, short
exchanges of 5 to 10 seconds, repeatedly,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put on testimony that four of the individuals have been
previously arrested for possession of a controlled substance. One
of them was on tape selling an undercover officer a controlled
substance in Operation Crackdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that started happening, four of these defendants really
began to feel the squeeze and began intimidating owners and
residents with threats like `I'll kill your ass,' or `I'll burn
your place down,' or `I'll kick your ass.'''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said the injunction is similar to a 2-year-old
concept applied _ and legally upheld _ in California.
</P>
<P>
   While the tactic may be popular in some segments of the public,
Case said seeking and enforcing such an injunction is
labor-intensive and ``not very practical.'' He suspects the
injunctions will be sought only rarely.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am surrounded by women. Tall, short, fat, thin,
tank top, crop top, flattop, bobbed, blunt cut, dreadlocks,
Goldilocks, hair the color of wheat, whisky, midnight, creme de
menthe; they're young, old, sweet, weird, pierced, plucked,
smoothed, branded, braided, bald; with pants too big, pants too
small, kilts, culottes, khaki. Black, lots of black. Pajama pants.
Flannel. Latex. Cashmere. Tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   I am a man alone at Lilith Fair. A single man. Crossing the
parking lot, I can hear music fading and gaining against the
afternoon breeze. The music spools out and brushes between the cars
even a quarter of a mile from the gate. There is salt in the air,
and sisterhood, and I am here to answer the only honest question
any man ever had about Lilith Fair: Is it a good place to meet
women?
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair, of course, is the wildly popular amalgam of
all-female headliners, grrrl power and gender equity
fun-in-the-sun. Even in its second year, when the once-stunning
idea of an all-women's concert tour has worn off, it is still the
summer's hottest ticket. When it landed in New York not long ago, I
headed straight for the Jones Beach Theater to fulfill my destiny
as a romantic anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't quite the bosky maypole dance/fertility rite/feminist
barn-raising I'd been expecting. More like a self-actualized county
fair with music. Camped at the distant reaches of the Big Baked
Apple, the layout, the vibe and the footwear are all decidedly
suburban.
</P>
<P>
   In line for the alcoholic-beverage shakedown at the door, it
comes to me slowly that I'm virtually the only unaccompanied male.
The one other single guy I see is a shirtless bodybuilder
pretending to wait for someone while he eyeballs the crowd. Guys
like this make us all look bad, I decide. Predatory. He's sporting
Oakley wraparounds and a rattail Montana militia fade. He probably
told his friends that if you want to chat up the dollies, then go
where the dollies go.
</P>
<P>
   A sound strategy: The math of the place is all in our favor. And
I know that in a crowd like this, what plays is the
consumptive-poet look. Since I'm not nearly gaunt enough, I carry a
little notebook, the better to look tortured and potentially
lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   I see Mr. Flex several times later that night. He is always by
himself, the loneliness and want coming off him like cartoon stink
waves. Is this how we all look when left unsupervised? Do I look
like this? In a show of manly revulsion, I make a point of not
sucking in my gut the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that rock doesn't just have to be crazy men,'' says
Paula, 21, who's from Clifton, N.J. She's the first woman I speak
to. We chat about the music and the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to get a read on the curious nature of man-woman
interaction under such circumstances, but it's as if I'm being
watched. As if our conversation is being assessed by passers-by for
any inappropriate sexual content. My motives feel all too obvious,
so I flourish my notebook as a sign of my good intentions. Still, I
feel oddly carnivorous and ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm thinking all this, Paula has continued speaking. I
catch the phrase ``Women are on the rise.'' I avert my eyes,
scribble the quote and scuttle off without really thanking her.
This won't be as easy as I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The other men I see, most of them coupled up with wives or
girlfriends, or cruising in large, mixed teen-age groups, seem as
baffled by the whole thing as I am, chastened at being so
completely outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   While not specifically marketed as such, Lilith is for women _
thousands of them, in packs, in couples, alone _ and they revel in
the relaxed unity of their majority. By sunset most of the men, me
included, will be overstimulated and cranky. We'll have about us
the panicked, wanton look of kids caught in a burning candy store.
</P>
<P>
   I try again, with Nicole. Just some civil conversation, no
notebook. She's down from Westchester County. ``It's cool because
everyone's so comfortable,'' she says. Not me. We are sitting
behind the greasy cart that cooks up the Fried Dough and Bloomin'
Onions. I feel like an escaped convict. ``I came down to see the
bands,'' Nicole says. ``I didn't know they had all these little
booths.'' She and her friend Pam seem really nice. I feel like
Saddam Hussein at a VFW mixer. I excuse myself.
</P>
<P>
   I take my seat in the amphitheater. Missy Elliott is on stage
working ``Supa Dupa Fly.'' She and her backup singers are the only
ones dancing. There is plenty of reflective, supportive swaying
from the audience. I've never thought of hip-hop as being
particularly nurturing, but there's solidarity on the wind tonight.
I slump down, an outlander, while hundreds of adolescent girls from
Scarsdale flick gang signs at Ms. Elliott as if they had tape stuck
to their fingers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Back outside to the bazaar. The slickest booths and tents are
those of the big-name brands: Kodak, Levi's, Tower Records.
Shoehorned between them are the smaller outfits _ the craft
sellers, with their complicated hemp jewelry, vague ceramics and
pastel canvas bags. I pretend to shop. There are plenty of
cosmetics and therapeutics on display, nail polish running a
distant third behind skin care and aromatic oils.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Biore introduced its pore strips at Lilith and shook
the world of rhino-epidermal hygiene to its very foundations. This
year it's giving away self-heating facial masks, whose purpose
eludes me, but they get darned hot when you rub them on. (I tried
it. You could heat a ski lodge with these things.) Isn't that
enough in a too-complicated world?
</P>
<P>
   I give the grrrrl in the booth the big eye, the sideshow barker
smile; she's pretty and I'm alone, after all. Too loudly I say,
``How's business?'' She looks at me with perfect contempt. The
rolling of her eyes is almost audible.
</P>
<P>
   I now feel profoundly single. Maybe Starbucks, with its long
lines of over-mellowed folk-rockers trying to down enough caffeine
to jump-start their dance glands, is the place to exchange some
enlightened neo-postfeminist badinage with a member of the opposite
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks provides the evening's comic relief by setting up two
Magnetic Poetry boards, at which anyone can arrange a few couplets
while waiting for the significant other to sprinkle cinnamon on a
$4 iced latte.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that rotten poetry is indeed portable, the fragments I
see run the gamut from bad to extra-bad to bleeding-from-the-ears
bad. One suggests that I ``recall the caramel dazzle,'' another
that I ruminate on the ``dark water juice of evening.'' The word
``shards'' gets a real workout. Others take a more declarative
approach: ``It is evening'' and ``We were getting coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to concerts where people take drugs and throw
bottles and shout obscenities and get hauled off by the cops?
</P>
<P>
   I lose my stomach for the whole enterprise _ throw in the towel
on my woeful efforts as a would-be sensitive heartbreaker. Maybe
it's the poetry. What is happening to me? How have women lived for
thousands upon thousands of years under this kind of constant, arch
scrutiny? The pressure is too much.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time I discover a place of sepulchral peace. Cool
and silent, ringingly empty: the men's room. The Lourdes of men's
rooms. A porcelain blizzard of tile and light and immaculate
stainless steel. Forty-eight perfect urinals stretch to the
horizon, two dozen on each wall, mirroring one another across a
glacier top of otherworldly white. I am alone here. I am healed. It
is like finding Superman's Fortress of Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Next door the women wait in lines 20 minutes long. But here all
is quiet and safety. Other men begin to straggle in, haggard and
undone by the day. They pause for a moment, reverent, and sigh,
relief passing across their faces like that of a downed World War
II flier finding sanctuary in the nave of an abandoned church.
</P>
<P>
   More of us limp in, and more, still more, smiling at one
another, nodding to the next and the next as we arrive, knowing
that this is as good as tonight may ever get.
</P>
<P>
   I turn to leave. Mr. Flex arrives, still shirtless, still
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he says, scanning the brilliant room from behind his
sinister wraparounds, ``do you work out?''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ of its customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas utilities can pass on the wholesale costs of gas to
their customers. But except in some instances when interruptible
customers want to continue receiving power, electric utilities can
charge only what state regulators previously have approved.
Utilities and their shareholders have to absorb the extra cost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying we don't want to play by the rules. We're
saying let's make them fair to everybody,'' Philipp said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, she said, is a circuit breaker, which would
allow wholesale prices to go up only so far before taking a
breather. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even utilities that weren't on the brink of blackouts were
scrambling to meet the demand caused by the high temperatures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Power &AMP; Light, for example, knew that on July 20 it
was going to be hectic because of the hot weather. The demand for
electricity that day set a company record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the utility's major generating units was down for
repairs, but it was brought back on line to help supply the
afternoon's peak demand. Some smaller units that kick in to meet
peak loads also were put into operation, and the utility was able
to use a new gas turbine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expecting demand to soar, the utility notified its interruptible
customers that they would be affected. In addition, KCP&AMP;L purchased
200 megawatts from other utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the price was $500 a megawatt. That's 12 times this summer's
cheapest price, about $40. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all worked. The utility could say it had met the
demand from its residential, small-business and other customers who
weren't on interruptible contracts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate,'' said Frank Branca, vice president of
wholesale and transmission services at KCP&AMP;L. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the margin for error has dwindled over the last few years as
demand has caught up with the capacity to generate electricity. In
Missouri and Kansas, the last major power plant to be built was the
Wolf Creek nuclear plant in 1985. KCP&AMP;L and Western are the
owners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This (summer) is going to focus people on the issue of new
capacity,'' Branca said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L now has total capacity of 3,586 megawatts and can service
a peak hourly demand of 3,139 megawatts, for a reserve of more than
14 percent. Of that total, about 3,000 megawatts can be generated
by KCP&AMP;L; the rest is from contracts for power from other
utilities, which are typically less volatile than the spot market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In part, the wholesale supplies were tight and prices higher
because this summer's hot weather has been so widespread, from the
Rocky Mountains to the Ohio Valley. The situation was aggravated by
a higher-than-normal number of power plants off line because of
repairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the region's utilities have not had as much
power to sell to others. In a more-normal summer, a utility in an
area with moderate weather would have plenty of surplus power to
sell to a utility in an area with hot weather. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But other possibilities also have been suggested. Steel Dynamics
Inc., a company in Indiana, is accusing the utility American
Electric Power Corp. of not generating more electricity so it could
manipulate the market and sell some high-priced power on the
wholesale market. American Electric had denied the allegations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the shortages and price swings, the role
of wholesale markets will be scrutinized in the coming months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Linderman, director of fossil fuels and renewable-energy
programs for the Edison Electric Institute, said utilities had come
to rely too heavily on the wholesale market _ making them subject
to its whims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, is to build more plants. In some areas of
the country, entrepreneurs already are building plants that
generate power to sell to several utilities. The prices, however,
generally are higher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing whether capacity should be increased and how to do it
now is sure to get more attention. Utilities across the region are
at least considering how to increase capacity because of the
growing demand and the behavior of the wholesale markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western already has plans to bring a plant out of mothballs, a
decision it made before this summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Holloway, chief of energy operations for the Kansas
Corporation Commission, said, ``Simply put, demand has grown faster
than most people thought possible.'' &QL;

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS FOCUS ON BRAIN CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND SCHIZOPHRENIA
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exploring chaos in a search for order, scientists
who study the reality-shattering mental disease schizophrenia are
becoming fascinated by the chemical environment of areas of the
brain where perception is regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, a region known as the thalamus, a sort of
gateway that filters incoming information and relays it to other
portions of the brain, has attracted growing scientific interest.
</P>
<P>
   For persons such as Russell E. Weston Jr., the diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic charged with killing two U.S. Capitol police
officers, the sounds, sights, odors and feelings the rest of us
experience almost unconsciously may swell like microphone feedback
into a hellish roar of scrambled perception.
</P>
<P>
   From simple bewilderment to hallucinations, grandiose illusions
and terrifying paranoia, different schizophrenics react in
different ways to what may be similar underlying problems,
therapists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could imagine yourself sort of plopped down in a
country where you don't speak the language or know the customs,
where everybody else's behavior seems peculiar, it's something like
that,'' said Richard Lewine, professor of psychiatry and behavioral
science at Emory University Medical School. ``They have these
mental explanations about what all around them means.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether a court will conclude that this
kind of mental chaos moved Weston to charge past metal detectors,
gun down the two policemen and shoot a female bystander while
terrified tourists fled and scrambled for cover. His
court-appointed lawyer has not said whether he will attempt to show
that Weston was insane at the time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Converging threads of research into the disease that afflicts an
estimated 2 million Americans are generating insight that in some
ways is hopeful and in others, desperate.
</P>
<P>
   They include the use of scanning technology to watch both normal
and abnormal brains while they work, post-mortem examination of
brain tissues and studies of the ways chemical
``neurotransmitters'' relay impulses between nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous volume of material that has come out in
the past few years,'' said Frank Brown, a psychiatrist who also
teaches at Emory and is medical director of the Wesley Woods
Geriatric Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas we have an extraordinary amount of information,
and in many others we do not,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the deficiencies in the thalamus, where sensations
are processed, may be central to most cases of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is impaired thalamic filtering of these stimuli, a
lot of that stuff comes through disorganized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that some areas of the thalamus are hypersensitive
to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in relaying
the nerve impulses that make the brain work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relaying a signal, then disappearing, such a
chemical might continue to stimulate the next nerve cell, like
pushing the play button on a radio or tape player again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said newer drugs now being used to treat schizophrenia
often have a dopamine antagonist effect, meaning they inhibit the
chemical's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish scientists who compared brain tissues of 19
schizophrenics who had died of other causes with tissue from the
brains of persons who had not had the disease found evidence that a
schizophrenic's thalamus lacks much of the natural ability to
inhibit the activity of its neurotransmitters.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that abnormal brain development, or even damage
to the brain prior to birth, might allow ``unmodulated stimulatory
activity'' to flow through the thalamus to the rest of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Imaging technologies that scan the brain have been used by
researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda,
Md., to show that in many schizophrenics the thalamus starts to
shrink, even in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, families are shocked when a seemingly normal
teenager or young adult seems to suddenly develop the bizarre
behavior that signals a life of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it were possible to look back at hours of home movies,
we would probably find signs that some subtle things were going
on,'' Brown said. ``There probably were what we call neurological
'soft signs' that showed something was wrong. There may be some
left-right confusion, some problem with poor coordination and some
very minor physical anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Different ``types'' of schizophrenia may be merely the way
different personalities react to the same underlying vulnerability,
Lewine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten people will see the same movie, and some will laugh out
loud or cry and others will be more restrained,'' he said. ``This
is a fundamental dimension of human personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewine said the schizophrenic's psychosis often interferes with
his or her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their illness leads them to believe nothing is wrong with
them,'' he said. ``Yet sometimes they are amenable to logical
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid schizophrenics, who tend to be young males, sometimes
receive their first treatment only after a series of fights,
arrests or other confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find we can make the case to them that there is a link
between their disorder and the consequences,'' he said. ``Even in
the midst of their psychosis, there are logical elements in their
thinking. Then if we can keep them on the medicine long enough,
they may see the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most anti-psychotic medications have wide-ranging and often
unpleasant side effects, Brown said, including stiffness, tremors
and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Also, persons with delusions of grandeur may crave the
experience and not want to give it up.

HEAT OF SUMMER REVEALS PROBLEMS WITH WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The call came in late June, just as the
summer heat wave began building, to the oil refinery owned by
Farmland Industries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KG&AMP;E, the electric and gas utility, said it would have to cut
the refinery's supply of electricity unless Farmland paid a sharply
higher price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, the call came again. And again last week, when high
temperatures caused the demand for electricity to soar. Farmland,
unwilling to shut down the Coffeyville, Kan., plant, agreed to pay
up to 84 times what it normally paid for power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmland asked for an explanation, but the utility never
answered, the farm-products cooperative said. So it filed a
complaint with the Kansas Corporation Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know why they didn't have enough (electricity),''
said Sherlyn Manson, a Farmland spokeswoman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources, the owner of KG&AMP;E, said there was no mystery
here. Farmland and many other large customers have interruptible
contracts that permit cutoffs during periods of high demand, and
they are given explanations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The effect on Farmland was unavoidable, said Michel' Philipp, a
spokeswoman for Western. A convergence of events, including the
widespread heat wave and an unusual number of malfunctioning power
plants in the region, put a strain on the capacity of many
utilities and caused wholesale prices to gyrate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our responsibilities seriously,'' Philipp said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, the living isn't easy for electric
utilities. Utilities throughout the country, including Kansas City
Power &AMP; Light, have been put to the test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Utilities say they are used to the hectic demands of summer,
when air conditioning pushes demand to the highest of the year. But
this time things are a bit different. Wholesale prices for
electricity, which utilities pay to supplement their own supplies,
have soared as much as 200 times their normal levels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New rules governing the transmission of power over the country's
electric grid and a dwindling cushion of surplus power nationwide
have contributed to the tightening of supplies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, say utility executives, regulators and
analysts, this summer's events will be fodder for debating big
issues that lie ahead for electric utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wake-up call,'' said Bill Washburn, manager of the
electric department for the Missouri Public Service Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, large commercial customers such as Farmland have been
most affected. Those large customers have interruptible contracts,
but they benefit the rest of the year by paying cheaper rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the interruptions can be avoided by paying a
higher rate. Farmland's refinery continued to receive power by
paying a rate roughly tied to the wholesale price, which recently
has been up substantially. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources, which owns the utility supplying Farmland's
refinery, declined to comment on the specifics of Farmland's
complaint but noted that it had no control over wholesale prices
and that other interruptible customers at other utilities also were
affected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most other customers, including residential users, haven't been
affected because they don't have interruptible contracts. However,
in Colorado, the state's largest utility had to implement a rolling
blackout for a few hours that included residential customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere there have been close calls. The Chicago area was
recently on the verge of blackouts. Last week Western's KPL and
KG&AMP;E warned customers that if they didn't reduce their consumption,
rolling blackouts were possible. Customers responded and the
blackouts were avoided. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its situation, Farmland questions whether it was necessary to
interrupt its service, noting that Western has a generating
capacity of 5,300 megawatts and the recent peak demand of KG&AMP;E and
KPL combined was 4,300 megawatts. A megawatt powers 500 homes for
an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western executives say, however, that the 5,300 figure is
misleading. The utility is required to keep some capacity in
reserve, and that reduces the capacity available to just over 4,600
megawatts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was also a generator off line _ the Lawrence 5 unit _ and
the need to keep its electrical grid from becoming overloaded. The
utility also had long-term commitments to sell about 400 megawatts
of electricity to other utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is an interruptible customer that didn't want to
be interrupted,'' Philipp said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western, for its part, has pushed federal regulators to
investigate the wholesale market, including the recent price
spikes. New rules to prevent overloading of transmission lines also
made receiving electricity purchased on the wholesale market more
difficult. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale electricity is power that a utility has available to
sell to other utilities. And on the spot market, prices can
fluctuate wildly because wholesale electricity has been deregulated
since the mid-1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western was one of several utilities that pushed federal
regulators to investigate the wholesale market after prices spiked
about $40 to as high as $7,500 a megawatt in late June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Western's grievances is that while the wholesale market
is deregulated, the price the utility can charge is controlled for
most of its customers. &QL;

AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Full-size, luxury sport-utility vehicles
have become major cash cows for automakers. Thus, the Denali. This
represents the first foray for GMC, formerly GM's utility and
work-truck division, into the big world of luxury trucks. The luxo
version of the Yukon, Denali is named after Denali National Park
and Preserve in Alaska and is the Native American name for the
south peak of Mount McKinley, which is in the park, natch. The fact
that the Denali looks as big as a mountain sitting among other cars
and SUVs is coincidental. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L''

 &QL; 
MOVIE-REVIEW (Undated) - First-time filmmaker Vincent Gallo takes a
tremendous risk in ``Buffalo '66.`` He gives us a despicable hero
and then cajoles us into liking him. It's a neat trick, for Billy
Brown (Gallo) is no ``lovable rogue,'' such as we are used to from
Hollywood. No, he is a thoroughly thuggish ex-con, bristling with
skull-thudding violence and emotional emptiness. He has no
redeeming qualities. But then we meet his parents, and suddenly we
know why and begin to feel sorry for him. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story

BUYING ROYALS INVOLVES GIVING TO COMMUNITY, ACCEPTING FINANCIAL
LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Is there an economic justification for paying
the asking price of $75 million for the Kansas City Royals? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but it involves a Catch-22. Given the Royals' inability to
turn a profit in their relatively small market, they probably are a
worthwhile investment only if the franchise can be moved to a more
lucrative locale. The terms of the sale, however, will preclude any
such move for the time being. Meanwhile, the transitional directors
are obligated to ensure that the purchasing partnership includes
adequate local representation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This means the Royals must find prospective buyers willing to
look beyond the economics of the deal and buy the franchise more or
less as a gift to the community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the community, nobody seems willing to step
forth and fill the civic leadership void created when Royals owner
Ewing M. Kauffman died. Kauffman's legacy was an ingenious plan to
create a bonanza for charities from the proceeds of a Royals sale
that would keep the club in Kansas City. The success of the plan,
though, turned on finding just the right buyer willing to pay a
premium for an enterprise more geared to producing psychic rewards
than attractive investment returns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the quest for the dream buyer has become increasingly
frustrating, which raises the question of whether this is a problem
of local leadership shortcomings, daunting financial challenges or
just plain old bad luck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, yes and yes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman was unique. Kansas City never again will have a citizen
combining his high level of dedication to the good of his community
with the financial wherewithal and willingness to spend what it
takes to translate his lofty dreams for his community into
reality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart magnate David Glass might have become a dedicated
keeper of the Kauffman flame as far as the Royals destiny is
concerned. His pockets and his love of baseball are both deep. He
may not be a Kansas Citian, but his devotion to local civic
interests also seemed deep when he came to head the Royals interim
stewardship team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, though, Glass apparently thought
better of assuming a permanent role as Kauffman's dream keeper.
It's hard to read a guy's mind at long distance but, given the
downside of the role, who could blame him? After he took the knocks
from the media that come with the territory, he probably decided
the cost to his psyche wasn't worth the benefit of being a
continuing part of major league baseball in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What probably hurt worst was having his motives impugned when
all he was trying to do was keep the faith with a dead friend, do
right by his late friend's community and enjoy being part of a game
he loves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that has hurt the Royals marketability is the
residual bad vibes from the strike that shut down baseball a few
years back. Some who might have been bidders before the strike
probably came to see major league baseball as damaged goods. Now
the basketball lockout has come along to reinforce the notion that
big-league sports is a sinkhole and there are better places to put
your money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for bad luck, the Lamar Hunt-Western Resources Inc. bid seems
jeopardized by an arcane tax rule that diminishes the Royals'
investment value for its purposes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if this deal does everything for Kansas
City that Kauffman wanted, it, too, will prove unique. &QL;

 &HT;    HOUSE REJECTS CHALLENGES TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN AND ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted overwhelmingly Friday to reject the
final attempts to add crippling amendments to the main bipartisan
bill for overhauling federal campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to pass the House,'' predicted Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., after he and Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., kept almost all
Democrats and a healthy chunk of the Republicans united in
opposition to the parliamentary ``land mines'' planted by the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said the sponsors accepted some ``harmless'' amendments,
but managed to avoid all 15 of the GOP amendments, including five
defeated Friday, that ``would have torn off limbs (or) blown us
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would close loopholes under which parties
have been able to accept ``soft money'' from people giving more
than the legal contribution limits or from the treasuries of unions
or corporations. It would also apply the existing disclosure and
financial rules for campaign ads to any TV or radio ads that
mention a federal candidate in the weeks leading up to an election.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the Shays-Meehan itself will be be held Monday
evening, said Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. Votes on
substitute bills, and possibly on amendments to those substitutes,
are also possible. The House plans to send the bill with the most
votes to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Armey repeated his promise that the leadership would end months
of foot-dragging and let the House send the bill to the Senate
before members leave for their month-long summer vacation, probably
Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It weighs heavy on my heart,'' Armey said. ``I don't know how,
but we will have completed this by the time we leave town on
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors called the five amendments that were defeated Friday
``poison pills,'' because each of them would have made the bill
unacceptable to some of its existing supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a 218-vote majority to amend a bill in the 435-member
House. But Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other GOP leaders
were unable to round up more than 200 votes for any of the 15
bill-scuttling amendments offered during weeks of sporadic debate.
</P>
<P>
   One defeated Friday was an effort by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., to
prohibit election officials from publishing voting materials in
languages other than English. With 74 Republicans joining 186
Democrats and one independent in voting against it, Barr's plan
obtained only 142 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal, defeated 253-160 after it was offered by Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla., would have required congressional candidates to
raise at least half their campaign funds within their own state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overheard a couple of (opponents) say, 'We failed to put
enough weight on this ship to sink it,' `` chuckled Rep. Sander
Levin, D-Mich., who supports the bipartisan bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters are keeping their eyes peeled for more of
the ``savvy maneuvers'' already used by GOP leaders to delay action
on a bill originally scheduled for consideration in March, said
Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grown very wary though this process,'' Wamp said.
</P>
<P>
   If any bill does emerge from the House next week, it would then
face resistance in the Senate, where GOP filibusters have blocked
action on similar legislation twice during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin, who has a brother in the Senate, said he expects
sympathetic senators to find a way to force consideration of the
measure after the Senate reconvenes in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see it brought up and brought up and brought
up,'' Levin said. ``I think it will have a fighting chance.''

STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO THE ROUNDABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes a dose of neurotic energy and a
manic-depressive business history can have their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the case at the Roundabout Theater, where the
latest turn of the roller coaster _ going from Broadway's hottest
theater to Broadway's most beleaguered in the space of two weeks _
has a certain familiar, dark logic.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Roundabout had Broadway's most-desired ticket
in ``Cabaret,'' record overall sales and the appearance of a
theater juggernaut. Since then the construction accident in Times
Square has shut down ``Cabaret'' indefinitely and the Roundabout's
two other shows for a week, and the theater is one target of a
sweeping investigation of ticket scalping in the entertainment
business.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haimes, the company's artistic director, bustles about the
Roundabout's Criterion Theater these days with a slightly rattled
``what next?'' look. But he said that everything in his nature and
the company's history taught him not to expect the empyrean moments
to last, so this feels more like one more turn of the wheel than a
startling fall from comfortably lofty heights.
</P>
<P>
   Since its beginnings in 1966 in the renovated basement of a
supermarket on West 26th Street, the theater has declared
bankruptcy (in 1978), voted to close (in 1983), moved twice and in
the process grown to become the United States' second-biggest
nonprofit theater, after Lincoln Center. So shifts of fate are
nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``First by dint of my own personality and my own neurosis, and
second by dint of having been in this business long enough to go
through ups and downs and ups and downs, I never felt I was on top
of the world,'' said Haimes, who joined the company in 1983, only
to see the theater run out of money and face closure two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's healthy or good, but I always assume that
disaster is around the corner. I just didn't think a building would
fall down on top of `Cabaret.' That's a level of disaster that's
new. That's a new gold standard for my half-empty-vs.-half-full
neurosis.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Haimes' agenda is figuring out what, if anything,
to do about ``Cabaret,'' the critical and box office blockbuster,
whose Kit Kat Klub still sits empty on the closed-off part of 43rd
Street beneath the construction accident at the Conde Naste
Building. No start-up date has been set, but he said his best guess
was that the theater might reopen in about two weeks. Customers
with tickets for performances while the show was closed can get
refunds or exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the anxiety level is the investigation by the New York
attorney general's office of ticket scalping and ``ice,'' the
practice of box offices' overcharging ticket brokers for desirable
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   An article in Variety on Monday said ``The Roundabout'' was one
target of the investigation. Officials with the attorney general's
office say the Roundabout is one of more than a dozen major venues
asked to turn over information, and say the investigation covers
ticket and box-office practices at virtually all of the biggest
entertainment names in New York.
</P>
<P>
   David Corvette, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said the investigation focused only on box offices, not on
productions or theaters over all. Haimes said he knew of no
improper practices at the Roundabout and suspected that
``Cabaret's'' status as the most desirable ticket in town made it
the obvious magnet for any investigation of ticket scalping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time your tickets are selling for above the ticket prices
by anyone, it's horrible,'' he said. ``I know the Roundabout is
only charging the ticket price, but people on the outside don't
necessarily know it. I can't help but feel there is a little bit of
kicking us while we're down, but then I'm probably in the
feeling-sorry-for-myself mode.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret'' is losing about $280,000 in box-office receipts each
week and is still paying most of the $200,000-a-week costs of
mounting Cabaret. Since the accident on July 21, Haimes and the
show's artistic leaders have been scrambling to find an alternative
site. They are still looking. But given how much it would cost and
how long it would take to replicate the show's unique
configuration, which calls for building a seedy Berlin nightclub
and a stage, Haimes is not optimistic. Because of the costs, any
move would have to be permanent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still investigating any alternative we can think of,''
he said. ``But we are not going to move it unless we feel we can
replicate the artistic experience, and that's very hard to do. It's
not like taking over a Broadway theater and taking out the first
three rows, so our options are pretty limited.''
</P>
<P>
   One site that has been mentioned is the old Studio 54 location,
but it is not air-conditioned and the costs of renovating it may be
prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   The other two shows, ``Side Man'' and ``You Never Can Tell,''
reopened after a few days. But the total financial loss will be
considerable. Haimes said that because the accident was so unusual,
it is not clear whether it will be covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Even if insurance and damages from the developer or construction
company eventually compensate for much of the loss, for now the
financial costs are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably turn a profitable year into a not-for-profit
one,'' Haimes said in his office with its klieg lights hanging
overhead. ``If you're a commercial company and something, God
forbid, doesn't work out, you can close the company and move onto
something else. In a not-for profit like ours, when you have
problems you live with them forever. So if we lose $700,000,
$800,000, $900,000, that's a lot of money for us. Especially when
it happens to `Cabaret,' which is the kind of hit an institution
like ours has once in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout's annual operating budget is $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his gloom, the Roundabout is still seeing record
ticket sales and subscriptions _ 5,000 above its pace last year _
and is ready to begin rehearsing two new productions, ``Little Me''
with Martin Short, and Beth Henley's ``Impossible Marriage'' with
Holly Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   And for some cast members the delay isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is making her Broadway debut replacing
Tony-award-winning Natasha Richardson, said she felt terrible about
the disruption. But the delay has given her more time to rehearse
than the two-and-a-half weeks she had expected and more free time
to explore New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast really misses doing the show,'' said Ms. Leigh, who
is from Los Angeles, ``but it's kind of a luxury for me to have
more time to rehearse and get up to speed. And I'm really enjoying
New York. I've fallen in love with the subways. They seem so fast
and cool and anonymous. Everyone tells me this is a love affair
that will quickly pass, but for now I'm kind of enthralled.''

MARLIN CREATES TIE-IN WITH `ALLY BcBEAL' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ally McBeal, the cutesy go-getter lawyer on the
Fox TV series, has gotten a lot of attention for her short skirts
last season (we're still waiting to see what her fall wardrobe will
look like), but that dancing baby _ the Ooga-Chaka kid often seen
on the show _ now has his own line of ties by Ralph Marlin, the
company that launched its career with the fish tie. There are two
styles to choose from, and the microfiber neckwear can be purchased
at major department stores such as J.C. Penney, for $20.
</P>
<P>
   MORE BABY DETAILS: Women expecting their own dancing baby, who
don't want to show the world every little bulge as several
actresses are doing this year, have fashion options. Miz Hot Tips
learned that there's a new company called Belly Basics that has all
the really trendy items you're looking for, including classic twin
sets, designed with a little extra room over your protruding belly.
They're $96, come in black, khaki and pastels, and can be ordered
by calling (800) 496 6684. For more details check out the Belly
Basics Web site at http://www.nystyle.com/bellyb.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once you've got the baby in your arms, you might want to do
some hands-on parenting. Miz Hot Tips is talking about massaging to
increase motor skills (so she'll be a better dancer) and parental
bonding. To learn the proper technique, Kisses From Heaven has an
infant massage kit that includes a videocassette, an instruction
guide, almond oil and a specially designed infant neck rest. It's
$39.95 at baby stores, including the Juvenile Shop in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   TICKING OFF THE STARS: Forget New York. In L.A., most folks copy
what the stars wear, and by now you know they're fickle. So, the
watch of the moment, or at least the summer, is Pulsar's new Spoon
watch. Yep, it's silver with a digital dial and shaped like a
spoon. Originally designed for extreme board sports, it's now a
fave with Jack Nicholson, the Hansons, Tori Spelling, Patricia
Arquette, Billy Zane and Vivica Fox. Spoons are priced $99.50 to
$125 and you can find them at Swell in Los Angeles and Barneys in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Although no stars have been sighted with them yet, Timex has a
new Humvee watch inspired by the ultimate all-terrain vehicle
that's a natural for Arnold Schwarzenegger to wear in his Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   The watch (Arnold, too) has a chiseled, cubic design. And it's
ultra-shock resistant, has a 100-hour chronograph, 99-lap counter
and 100-hour countdown timer, plus an Indiglo night light. Price is
$42.95 at mass merchandising and department stores.
</P>
<P>
   NO HUGGING ALLOWED: Most teddy bears were designed for cuddling,
but at $100,000, the one-of-a-kind Gund teddy bear should be kept
in a glass case. The special bear will be part of an exhibit of
antique toys from Gund's archives going on display at the Los
Angeles Children's Museum on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be yours, as it's going to be auctioned at the end
of the year to benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation. !folo!Shopper's alert:!off! The Prada men's store has

   Ira Doreen Donovan, an elementary school teacher in Miami, was
31 credits shy of a master's degree in special education when she
saw an online advertisement for Columbia State University. After
sending $800 as the first payment on a $2,000 degree, Ms. Donovan
received a textbook to summarize and send back for grading.
</P>
<P>
   Believing this was the first step of several, she was shocked
when shortly after, a certificate not only for a master's but a
doctorate arrived at her home. Along with the degrees came
transcripts awarding her a 3.9 grade point average for classes
never taken and credit for a completed thesis and dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the school and told them if this degree isn't worth
the paper it's printed on, I don't want to pay for it,'' Ms.
Donovan said. ``This degree mill made me look like a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia State returned her money, but others say they have not
been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   After investigating 36 complaints, including one from Norway and
one from Malaysia, the Louisiana attorney general's office has
filed for a preliminary injunction against Columbia, charging that
it violates the state's Unfair Trade Practices Act and consumer
protection laws. Last month the State of Illinois also filed suit
seeking an injunction and restitution for consumers and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls to Columbia's office in Metairie, La., seeking
comment were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has ``rekindled the old-fashioned diploma mill,''
said Michael Lambert, the executive director of the Distance
Education and Training Council, a recognized accrediting agency
that has approved 65 online and home-study schools. ``The Internet
is a haven for these places.''
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Web these days is like flipping through a virtual
college catalog. With its interactivity and accessibility, the
Internet has sparked new interest in home-study programs, offering
actual courses online or just information.
</P>
<P>
   Although many distance-learning schools have solid reputations
and graduation requirements, hundreds of Web sites have popped up
for schools charging between $200 and $7,000 for sheepskin that
requires little or no work from students. Columbia, for instance,
promises degrees within 27 days.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate home pages make schools look credible, Lambert said.
The schools can operate in the anonymity of cyberspace, sometimes
listing just an e-mail address or post office box. And online, they
can reach a global audience for minimal cost.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Sullivan, co-author with David W. Stewart and Henry
Spille of ``External Degrees in the Information Age,'' the American
Council on Education's guide to correspondence programs, defines a
diploma mill as an ``organization that sells degrees without an
academic base and without requiring sufficient academic
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   While perfectly legitimate schools might have an element or two
of a diploma mill (say, credit for work experience), experts say
there are multiple defining characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   _ The school emphasizes credit for work or life experience
without appropriate mechanisms for assessing that experience in
terms of college-level learning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Degrees are obtained in far less time than would be required
at a legitimate institution. (A bachelor's degree typically takes
four years of full-time course work, a master's one to two years, a
Ph.D. dissertation several years to research and write.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tuition and fees are on a per-degree basis instead of per
semester or course.
</P>
<P>
   _ School brochures list faculty members who neither teach nor
provide other services, and there is virtually no interaction with
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The school is not accredited by an agency approved by the
Department of Education, the Council for Higher Education
Accreditation or other legitimate institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation, however, is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my experience it's not the blatantly fraudulent schools
that are the real threat,'' Stewart said. ``It's the academic
frauds that have a little substance that are the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to schools that require students to perform
some academic exercises like writing a paper or taking an exam _
and some students might invest considerable effort _ but their
degrees are unacceptable to established colleges and universities
and unimpressive to prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   But experts admit that most such institutions cater to people
who know exactly what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are well aware of what they are doing,'' Sullivan
said. ``They want a credential and they want to get it quickly. But
others are busy people or foreign students who don't know much
about higher education. They see these places as programs that fit
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Joyal of Atlanta said he had worked as an engineer for 20
years without a degree and applied to Columbia State for a joint
bachelor's/master's degree in mechanical engineering. He received
both degrees in under six months after summarizing two textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected the degree was worthless but nonetheless
listed it on his resume. Later he had second thoughts and took it
off. He is pursuing a degree from an accredited distance-learning
program.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia State claims in Internet advertising that it is
accredited by the International Accrediting Association, a
``fictitious school accrediting agency,'' according to the
Louisiana attorney general's complaint. The owner of Columbia,
Ronald Dante, was sentenced in February in Los Angeles to
five-and-a-half years in prison for operating fraudulent schools in
California. He jumped bail and is being sought by U.S. marshals,
according to Michelle Muth, a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade
Commission. Columbia continues to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest crackdown on schools took place from 1981 to
1991, when Operation Dipscam (for diploma scam) put 50 out of
business on charges ranging from mail or wire fraud to conspiracy.
``Sometimes we'd find phony accreditations or that we were able to
negotiate a degree for a lower price,'' said Allen Ezell, a former
FBI agent who oversaw Dipscam. ``Some schools sent transcripts and
diplomas to students for courses never taken.''
</P>
<P>
   States like New York and Illinois closely regulate academic
institutions, requiring that they be authorized to operate. But
many don't. Ezell said investigations often start by looking into
schools incorporated in the states with the weakest laws, like
Hawaii, Utah and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Web for a home-study school? The Department of
Education suggests that the first step is to check a school's
accreditation _
</P>
<P>
   a process in which courses are reviewed, students surveyed and
campuses inspected. For a list of agencies approved to accredit
schools, write: Department of Education Accreditation and
Eligibility Determination Division, 6000 Independence Ave., S.W.,

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Council for Higher Education Accreditation, an organization
of colleges and universities, also approves accrediting agencies.

STRATUS, ASCEND SAID TO BE IN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. is negotiating to be
acquired by California-based Ascend Communications Inc. for between
$800 million and $1 billion, according to a source familiar with
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   While the talks could still break off over the weekend, a deal
is expected to be announced as early as Monday, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the two companies were discussing a buyout has
been rampant since mid-week, fueling a 30 percent jump in Stratus
stock. The company makes failure-proof computer systems that run
non-stop for such customers as telephone carriers, banks, and
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, however, Wall Street seemed to have soured on the
deal. Investors dumped shares of Ascend, which makes networking
equipment for phone companies and Internet service providers, amid
concern that buying Stratus was a bad idea _ both financially and
strategically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes economic sense for Ascend to buy
Stratus,'' Steven Frenkel, an analyst at investment banking firm
Paragon Capital, told CNet, an Internet news service. ``It is like
buying a farm to get a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ascend's stock fell 7 1/32 _ a 14 percent slide _ to 44 15/32.
More than 25.2 million shares were traded, making it the most
active stock in US markets. Stratus shares, meanwhile, rose 7/8 to
28 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said investors are worried that Stratus,
which has struggled lately, will drag down Ascend just as the
Alameda, Calif.-based company is recovering from its last
acquisition: the $3.7 billion buyout of Westford-based Cascade
Communications in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling through most of last year, Ascend has beaten
Wall Street's earnings estimates for three quarters in a row,
fueled by strong sales of its powerful switching equipment, which
allows telecommunications companies to move data traffic over phone
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Stratus, meanwhile, lost $10 million in the most recent quarter
and saw its sales fall 20 percent. Last week, the company said it
would cut 350 jobs _ 15 percent of its work &UR;  &LR; force _ and take a $20
million charge against earnings because of slackening demand in
Asia that shows no signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Ascend may be attracted to Stratus because of its
capabilities in Signaling System 7, or SS7 _ an industry-standard
technology that is vital to allowing telephone carriers to offer
value-added services like caller ID, call-waiting, or
call-forwarding over data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With SS7 from Stratus, Ascend's data switching products become
more attractive to carriers,'' said Maribel Lopez,
telecommunications analyst at Cambridge-based Forrester Research.
``Ascend can start to offer voice and data switching in a single
box.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest data networking
firm, recently acquired a company called Lightspeed &UR;  &LR; International
Inc. of Sterling, Va., for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Stratus's SS7 expertise has been hotly purused by Ascend rivals.
In late March, Ascend rival Bay Networks Inc. of Santa Clara signed
a technology agreement with Stratus to jointly develop new products
based on Stratus's SS7 equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Cristinziano, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison
in New York, noted that SS7 applications are a small part of
Stratus' business. Most of its revenues come from selling powerful
computer servers _ a business that is far afield from Ascend's
networking expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend would be better off forming a strategic alliance with
Stratus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value is the services themselves, not the hardware
underlying it,'' he said. ``You can get some of these strategic
benefits without buying the whole company.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Matthew Barzowskas of First Albany Corp. in Boston,
agreed. ``There's a lot of stratus that Ascend doesn't need.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason that analysts frown on a deal between
Ascend and Stratus.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street have speculated that Ascend would make a
good acquisition target itself _ most likly, by Lucent Technologies
Inc. Lucent is the former equipment arm of AT&AMP;T Corp., which also
recently spun off NCR Corp., its computer division.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ascend would blow $800 million on Stratus, it makes them
less attractive,'' said Cristinziano. ``Lucent already got rid of
NCR. Why would they another computer company?''

BAY STATE INITIATES DRIVE TO PREVENT MEDICAL ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ Massachusetts health officials unveiled
Friday what they say is America's most ambitious drive to prevent
medical errors, a move made partly in response to the fact that
several of America's highest-profile and most tragic recent medical
errors occurred at Massachusetts hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of state officials, hospital executives, doctors
and other health leaders who announced their existence and mission
Friday actually has been meeting privately for more than a year.
But given the sensitivity of their misson, members said they wanted
to ensure they could work together before going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't as though we were trying to keep the media away,''
Dr. John Noble, who helped get the group going and chairs it,
explained at a briefing for three reporters at the headquarters of
the Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``We felt we had to get our
act together before we'd have anything to share . . . We're now at
a point where we think we can start to play a kind of ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And while coalition members acknowledged that the credibility of
health care providers and hospitals has been damaged by recent
mishaps here, they insisted their intent is to eliminate errors
rather than polish images. ``If someone at this table honestly
thought this was about spin control we'd have been out of here in
two seconds,'' said Dr. Randolph Peto, head of quality improvement
at a subsidiary of the Massachusetts Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Errors have always been a worry at health facilities here and
elsewhere, but the problem came into intense focus three years ago
when Betsy A. Lehman, a Boston Globe health columnist being treated
at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, was killed by a massive
overdose of a powerful anticancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Quincy Hospital was under the spotlight after
three elderly surgical patients died and another had the wrong
kidney removed; last year the state uncovered serious deficiencies
at Newton-Wellesley Hospital surrounding several maternal deaths,
and recently complaints of negligence have been leveled against
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   While all those incidents were distinct, so many happening
within such a short time convinced state officials that not enough
was being done to root out errors, said Nancy Ridley, the assistant
commissioner of public health who oversees investigations of
troubles like those.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Ridley added, several patterns became clear: While
human errors were involved, the underlying problems were with
quality-control systems. While each hospital fashioned its own
solutions, those solutions weren't applied as fast as they could
have been at other hospitals. And while studies have documented
easy-to-apply ways of preventing medical errors, there's no system
for ensuring everyone knows about and institutes such ``best
practice'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Noble shared those frustrations in his role as a commissoner of
the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations,
which inspects hospitals nationwide. So 18 months ago he approached
Bay State officials about assembling health experts here to come up
with solutions, and 15 months ago a letter was sent to every
hospital inviting it to join.
</P>
<P>
   The group's first target is medication-related errors of the
kind that killed Lehman. One approach will be to highlight the fact
that such errors most often involve 10 common drugs. Coalition
members also will zero in on the ease with which errors arise in
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Before any statewide changes are recommended, however, a
consensus will have to be reached among hospital executives,
doctors, nurses and other hands-on providers who will review the
proposals. ``If we're going to have interventions that really work
they've got to come from groups that are representative of
hospitals and other health care organizations,'' said Noble.

US PROBES RACE BIAS WITHIN MASSACHUSETTS POLICE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass. police department, stung by allegations
of racism and reeling from a $2 million jury verdict two months ago
to the family of an unarmed black motorist shot to death by a white
police officer, is cooperating with federal authorities
investigating racism in the department.
</P>
<P>
   A US Justice Department spokesman in Washington Friday confirmed
that the department is conducting an ``administrative
investigation'' into alleged racial discrimination by police
officers and will send civil rights investigators to the city for
two days early this month.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, sparked by complaints from the city's minority
residents, has been ongoing for at least two years, but many view
it with more urgency in the wake of the June verdict against the
city and patrolman Donald Brown.
</P>
<P>
   After less than seven hours of deliberation, a jury in US
District Court in Springfield found that Brown had used excessive
force when he shot and killed 20-year-old Benjamin Schoolfield in
1994. The jury also found that the city was negligent in providing
inadequate training to officers.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was widely viewed as vindication in a black
community that has long complained about the treatment blacks
receive at the hands of white police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, police officer Joseph Bradley was fired after
phoning a black minister and mocking the burning of black churches
in the South. That same month police allegedly used Mace to arrest
a 78-year-old black woman and in October of that year allegations
of police brutality were leveled when local and state police
tangled with hundreds of minority teenagers outside a local
athletic club.

   The verdict in the Schoolfield case came two years after federal
authorities refused to bring criminal charges against Springfield
officers in Schoolfield's death. US Attorney Donald K. Stern closed
the federal inquiry in April 1996, saying investigators found
insufficient evidence of any civil rights violations. A Hampden
County grand jury earlier had found that Schoolfield was shot
accidentally as Brown approached Schoolfield's van with his gun
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that he ran up to the van, which falsely had been
reported stolen, at a traffic light. He said he accidentally broke
the side window with the gun and as he tried to dislodge his arm
the van started rolling backwards. The gun fired, he said, as he
tried to free his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Justice Department spokesman Christine DiBartolo
confirmed that the inquiry was ongoing but refused to say who
requested it or when it might be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Under such an investigation, which does not involve the courts,
the Justice Department tries to work cooperatively with the party
under investigation. The probe, DiBartolo said, will determine
whether the Springfield police department discriminated on the
basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very cooperatively with the police department,''
she said. ``We hope to come to a voluntary resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Springfield Mayor Michael J. Albano said he first became aware
of the investigation before he became mayor in January 1996. ``Even
before I took office they were knocking on my door,'' he said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albano said he's pleased with the progress the police department
has made since then, including the appointment of a new police
chief, Paula Meara, the first woman to head a big city police
department in New England, a new police commission and enhanced
sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved the internal investigation unit outside the police
department,'' added Albano. ``We've done a number of things on our
own that will satisfy their concerns. I'm very comfortable with the
progress the city has made in the last two years, particularly in
the minority community.''

LAME DUCK MORALES BUYS $775,000 HOUSE IN SCENIC AUSTIN HILLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 2) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Not many state employees _ not even agency heads
_ live in $800,000 houses. But Attorney General Dan Morales is
already sampling the uppercrust lifestyle he expects as an
investment banker after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the recent controversy over lawyer fees in the
tobacco case, Morales quietly purchased and moved his new family
into a 5,059-square-foot house in the scenic hills west of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The property carries an $835,000 appraisal and a $615,000
mortgage, way off the normal lending charts for someone with a
$92,217 state salary. But Morales, who arranged financing through
the previous owner, is betting on much higher earnings when he
enters the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Property records show Morales purchased the house, located in a
gated neighborhood above Lake Austin, in March for $775,000 from
Tanya Hill of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman Ron Dusek said the attorney general spent $150,000
he had made from the sale of a previous home last year on the down
payment. He said Morales is paying Hill, who holds the $615,000
note on the property, $4,300 a month, based on an interest rate of
7 1/2 percent for a 30-year loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, on his salary, he cannot get a (conventional) loan
for that amount,'' Dusek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to sit down after he leaves office and
renegotiate the terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusek said there were no co-signers on the note other than
Morales' wife, Christine. He said the sale was arranged through a
real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Hill) had no idea who he (Morales) was,'' said Dusek.
</P>
<P>
   Property records indicate Hill had paid $775,000 cash for the
house in June 1997. Dusek said she never lived there.
</P>
<P>
   The only source of income Morales listed on his most recent
public financial disclosure statement, which covers 1997, was his
state salary.
</P>
<P>
   He did not report income from any investments, not even interest
on bank accounts. State officeholders are supposed to report any
interest income of more than $500 a year, according to the Texas
Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Dusek said Morales held the $150,000 he made from the February
1997 sale of a house on the Pedernales River outside Austin in a
noninterest bearing bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know how soon he was going to be using it,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 42, shocked the Texas political world last December
when he announced he would not seek re-election to a third term as
the state's top lawyer. He said he wanted to spend more time with
his wife, whom he married last year, and her two children.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he plans to enter the financial investment business
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Morales' public career occurred this year when
he negotiated a $17.3 billion settlement of a lawsuit against the
tobacco industry over public health care costs associated with
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   He became embroiled in a nasty political fight with Gov. George
W. Bush and seven state legislators over $2.3 billion in legal fees
that a federal judge awarded a group of private lawyers Morales
retained to represent the state in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and his detractors finally agreed to
separate the controversy over lawyers' payments from the body of
the settlement, which allowed the judge to give final approval to
the tobacco deal last month.

FRANCE'S THOMSON MULTIMEDIA COMPLETES A REMARKABLE TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, France, Ind.)  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ For years, Thomson Multimedia was known mostly for two
things: color television sets and losses.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft and the DirecTV unit of Hughes Electronics, which
is part of General Motors; NEC of Japan; and Alcatel SA of France
lining up to buy shares in Thomson, the French government is
betting this will end.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement announced on Thursday, each of the four
partners will be allowed to buy 7.5 percent of Thomson Multimedia.
The amount the four will pay for their shares will not be set
before the fall. With this deal, Thomson Multimedia gets commercial
connections and partners to help push it into new fields of digital
television.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a remarkable turnaround for Thomson
Multimedia. For years, French industrial policy had it that if
Europe surrendered the consumer electronics business to Japan
without a struggle, it risked not only the loss of engineering and
factory jobs, but ultimately important industries like
semiconductors, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when Paris nationalized France's leading consumer
electronics group, Thomson Multimedia, it named as chairman a tough
former paratrooper, Alain Gomez, and ordered him to stop the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, a cigar-puffing manager who drove motorcycles to work,
began by acquiring television manufacturers. He bought Telefunken
of Germany, and the Ferguson television division of Thorn EMI of
Britain and, in 1987, Thomson Multimedia acquired the consumer
electronics businesses of General Electric Co. and its RCA
subsidiary, which make RCA, GE and Proscan televisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Thomson Multimedia grew into the world's
fourth-biggest consumer electronics group, after Matsushita and
Sony of Japan and Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Though few Americans heard of the quiet French giant, by the
mid-1990s Thomson Multimedia and its American arm, Thomson Consumer
Electronics Inc., had become a global power. In the United States,
the world's biggest consumer electronics market, it led the
television market, with a 25 percent share. Indeed, by 1997, North
America generated two-thirds of Thomson Multimedia's $6.3 billion
of revenue. (In Europe, with a 10 percent share, the company was
No. 3, after Philips and Sony.)
</P>
<P>
   But size did not bring profitability. The spending spree piled
up debt; Thomson Multimedia's manufacturing base was outmoded, and
poor logistics tied up cash in unmoved stock. Losses mounted.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, successive French governments were selling
nationalized assets. Debating the company's future in Parliament in
1996, conservative prime minister Alain Juppe complained that $2.55
billion of debt made Thomson Multimedia, ``under the circumstances,
worth nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   A plan to sell Thomson SA, the nationalized holding company that
groups Thomson Multimedia with the military electronics company,
Thomson CSF, to the French Groupe Lagardere, was reversed after
Lagardere sought to dump Thomson Multimedia, by selling it for 1
French franc, or about 16 cents, to Daewoo of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a group of French companies led by the electronics
group Alcatel Alsthom took control of Thomson CSF, and Paris
ordered an overhaul of Thomson Multimedia. In the United States,
big factories like one for television sets in Bloomington, Ind.,
the world's largest, were shut, and production shifted to a new
$150 million plant in Juarez, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To wipe out debt, Juppe's successor, Socialist Lionel Jospin,
poured $2 billion into Thomson in 1997, agreeing in return to
European Union demands that Thomson Multimedia limit its European
market share and seek industrial partners.
</P>
<P>
   To find them, the government named as chairman Thierry Breton,
an owlish 43-year-old former computer science professor who had
earlier turned around the unprofitable state-owned computer
company, Groupe Bull, in which Paris sold shares to IBM, Motorola
and NEC, in exchange for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, Thomson has been improving rapidly, and the
fundamentals of the company are better than has been said,'' said
Elie Cohen, director of research at the National Center for
Scientific Research in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, Thomson becomes an important manufacturing and
distributing ally in digital television, but also in its struggle
against Sun Microsystems over a programming language for what is
called distributed computing, which promises to endow consumer
appliances, from televisions and telephones to kitchen appliances
and cars, with intelligence by connecting them to a computer
network.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel, moreover, is among the cellular telephone companies
that deploy the kinds of networks that are at the heart of this
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partners are interested in Thomson for the markets RCA
provides,'' Cohen said. ``It is important for them to have Thomson
at their side.''

`LINC'S': BAD MEN, FEISTY WOMEN AT THE LOCAL BAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Linc's,'' a new Showtime comedy series, all the men are bad
and all the women are good. Linc himself (Steven Williams), a
50-ish Washington bar owner, is a narrow-minded Republican who,
upon learning that his daughter has had a lesbian relationship,
asks a priest, ``How well do these exorcisms work?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie (Georg Stanford Brown) is an evil lobbyist who wants
only the best for the tobacco industry. Harlan (Joe Inscoe) is a
Southern white racist who keeps telling his young black waitress
about ``our old cook Bessie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Winston (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a cabdriver with an
inflated notion of his appeal to women. In the first episode, one
black man tells another to go back to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, CeCe (Golden Brooks) is just a hard-working
waitress and single mom; Eartha (Daphne Maxwell-Reid) is just a
hard-working prostitute, and Eleanor (Pam Grier, sexy and strong as
ever) is the head of something called the National Organization for
Children and works as a lobbyist only to do good, like pushing
through a free-school-lunch bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linc's,'' which has its premiere Saturday, has such a fine
pedigree _ created by Tim Reid, who did ``Frank's Place,'' and
Susan Fales-Hill, who worked on ``The Cosby Show'' _ that it's
particularly embarrassing to see its first episode include condom
jokes and the gratuitous use of vulgarities. Maybe it's impossible
for a show set in a bar not to have a hooker, but does everyone
have to refer to her work in such blunt terms?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the dialogue is obvious as well. ``Women are not fit
for combat; they're too weak,'' Johnnie tells Rosalee (Tisha
Campbell), Linc's 23-year-old daughter, who is an Army lieutenant.
And early in the first episode, a customer asks Linc, ``When are
you two going to stop doing the Texas two-step _ and tango?'' He is
referring to Linc and Evelyn, who is, unfortunately, a married
woman (but her husband cheats, so who could blame her?).
</P>
<P>
   The show is intelligent and very political, with jokes about
subjects from Linda Tripp to the coming-out episode of ``Ellen.''
Maybe if the characters start showing a little complexity and
become less fixated on sex, ``Linc's'' will have a chance to be as
good as its premise.

`RUDE AWAKENING': NOT AS CLEVER AS IT THINKS 
</HEADLINE>

   During the opening credits of ``Rude Awakening,'' the beautiful
Billie Frank (Sherilyn Fenn) wakes up in her big brass bed,
handcuffed to the headboard, with no memory of how she got there.
In the first episode of this new half-hour sitcom, Billie throws up
the morning after a drunken one-night stand, goes to work
(apparently as a B-film producer's receptionist), gets in trouble
for sleeping with a client, crashes her car into a fire hydrant and
is ordered by the court to join Addictions Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing probably happened to Sam Malone and Murphy
Brown all the time before they quit drinking, but we never saw it
on ``Cheers'' or Murphy's series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Awakening'' thinks it's cleverer than it really is and
could use an injection of real wit, but the cast is appealing. Lynn
Redgrave is charmingly haughty as Billie's mother, who missed her
daughter's pre-12-step intervention because she was having a bikini
wax.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Penner is likable as Dave, the handsome coffee shop
owner and fellow AA member who turns down Billie's almost immediate
offer of sex because under the circumstances it wouldn't be right.
(Now there's a novel reason for keeping the sexual tension in a
series going.)
</P>
<P>
   The self-consciously wacky characters also include a lesbian
recovering heroin addict and alcoholic (Rain Pryor, daughter of
Richard) and a born-again-Christian sister-in-law (Corinne Bohrer).
</P>
<P>
   Now if only some screenwriter will make them smart. Being able
to use four-letter words because it's cable doesn't make a
character sophisticated.

   Netscape Communications Corp. temporarily shut down Web sites
Friday belonging to dozens of its employees, after one of them
posted a parody that linked Apple Computer Inc. with several
notorious mass murderers.
</P>
<P>
   The site made fun of Apple's well-known ``Think Different'' ad
campaign, which features photos of famous artists, scholars and
human rights activists. The parody site attached the Apple logo and
slogan to photos of serial killers like John Wayne Gacy and
Theodore Bundy, as well as Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, who murdered
as many as a million of his countrymen during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape encourages its employees to create their own Web pages,
which are hosted on Netscape's own computers. The company has a
policy forbidding the publication of ``derogatory or demeaning
language or pictures'' on these pages.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site devoted to users of Apple's Macintosh computers
published news of the offensive Web site Friday. But officials at
Netscape were unaware of it until they were contacted by The Boston
Globe. Within minutes, Netscape shut down all its employee Web
pages pending an investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the majority of the sites don't contain
anything like this,'' said Margie Mader, director of human
resources. ``But we've got to be sure.'' Mader said that the
company would contact the employee whose page contained the
offensive materials, but declined to say what action might be
taken.

IBM UNIT ADMITS ILLEGAL SALE OF COMPUTERS TO RUSSIAN NUCLEAR LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An IBM subsidiary pleaded guilty Friday to
exporting illegally 17 advanced computers to a Russian nuclear
weapons laboratory and agreed to pay an $8.5 million fine, in what
is believed to be the first criminal conviction against the
corporate giant.
</P>
<P>
   Russia secretly bought the computers in late 1996 and early 1997
in the mistaken belief that Washington would approve the purchase
after Moscow signed a total ban on nuclear tests, long advocated by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The computers can improve Russia's ability to simulate nuclear
weapons testing. The sale of any computer to a Russian nuclear
weapons facility requires federal approval, which IBM never
received.
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-month investigation, IBM's Moscow-based subsidiary,
IBM East Europe/Asia Ltd., pleaded guilty to 17 felony violations
of the export control laws in U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that IBM's American executives were aware
of the illegal shipments, which involved a series of Russian
middleman and circuitous shipping arrangements in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM acted in a highly responsible manner'' by cooperating with
the government, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Dubelier, who
prosecuted the case.
</P>
<P>
   IBM spokesman Rob Wilson said: ``We regret the involvement of
our Russian subsidiary in this case. IBM will not tolerate any
violation of its standards of business conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Clinton administration has
unsuccessfully tried to persuade Russia to return the computers or
move them to a civilian location, administration officials said.
Those efforts included a request by Vice President Al Gore when he
was in Moscow recently.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Moscow-based subsidiary entered the plea,
Dubelier complained that the Russians ``have refused to assist us
in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States does not know the location of the most
powerful computer but believed the other 16 are at a facility in
Arzamas-16, a closed city where the Soviet Union designed its
hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the case illustrates the difficulties of adhering
to U.S. legal standards in markets like Russia, where the full rule
of law has yet to be established. IBM is believed to have no
previous criminal record, according to Mark Menefee, the Commerce
Department's top export investigator.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IBM case, which was investigated by the Commerce Department
and the Customs Service, ``confirms that the export control system
of the United States works,'' Menefee said.
</P>
<P>
   But if a Russian official had not boasted that he had acquired
some advanced American computers from Silicon Graphics and IBM, the
United States might never have found out about the unlawfully
shipped computers.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy,
which oversees nuclear weapon laboratories, told reporters of the
purchase, and federal investigators began an inquiry into why none
of the Russian computer sales had been licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics has denied any wrongdoing. Its dealings with
Russia are the subject of a separate federal investigation in
California which, investigators said, has found less incriminating
evidence than the IBM inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also reacted to the Russian admission, out of concern
that President Clinton had gone too far in 1996 when he relaxed
controls over the export of some advanced computers. Despite
opposition from the White House and lobbying by IBM's senior
executives, Congress replaced the tighter controls over some
computer exports last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when U.S. negotiators were pressing skeptical Russian
officials to join a nuclear test ban, officials in Moscow said they
were enticed with hints that they could later buy high performance
computers from the United States. U.S. officials deny any such
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of testing, computer simulations help determine
if nuclear weapons work as designed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's desire to obtain such computers was well known inside
IBM's Moscow office. The office sales manager was a Russian
national who previously worked at a government physics institute.
</P>
<P>
   And selling computers to Arzamas-16 was seen as a stepping stone
to the lucrative Russian market.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM was very pushy,'' said Yevgeny Shablygin, head of the
Moscow computer dealer that arranged the purchase of 16 IBM
computers. ``They thought Arzamas could be like Los Alamos, a very
prestigious customer. That's what this job was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of IBM's Moscow subsidiary knew that Arzamas-16 was
responsible for nuclear weapons research before they installed 16
computers there in November 1996, according to the ``factual
proffer'' submitted Friday by Dubelier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that one of America's leading corporations has been
undermining national security because it was willing to take risks
in entering the Russian market,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of
the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea by the Moscow-based subsidiary was entered by
Bruce Baird, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Covington &AMP;
Burling. U.S. District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson accepted
the 17-count criminal information and the fine of $8.5 million, the
maximum available under the export control laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian company will separately pay a civil
fine of $171,000 levied by the Commerce Department. The company
also agreed to accept Commerce Department restrictions on some of
its computer sales in Russia for the next two years.

AMERICAN GO NORTH TO CASH IN ON CANDIAN DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The swoon of the Canadian dollar has put
a sizzle into the wallets of Americans venturing north of the
border, especially those seeking vacation bargains in
accommodations, entertainment, and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to the radio on the drive up, it seemed as though
the Canadian dollar was hitting another record low with every news
update,'' said Paul Dow of Georgetown, Mass., on a camping trip
with his wife, Maureen, through Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty hard news for the poor Canadians, I'd guess, but
it meant our vacation was getting cheaper by the hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The loonie _ nickname of the Canadian dollar because of the
national bird, the common loon, depicted on the country's $1 coin _
is in free fall, plummeting to all-time lows against the greenback.
Right now, the Canadian dollar is worth about .66 cents US, its
lowest level in history. The value is eroding so inexorably that
prognosticators say there is no way of telling where the loonie
will finally flutter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick a bottom,'' said Sal Guatieri, senior economist
with the Bank of Montreal. ``The near-term picture is not very
rosy.''
</P>
<P>
   One often-heard joke asks what do you call Canada's $2 coin?
Answer: An American dollar. But the yucks are sounding hollow as
headlines proclaiming yet another precipitous drop have become
routine front page fare _ another day, another drop. In July, the
loonie closed at seven all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relentless, it's unhealthy,'' said Sherry Cooper,
economist at Nesbitt Burns Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Canada is the victim of Asia's economic woes.
Desperate times in once-booming Pacific Rim nations from Japan to
Indonesia means a drastically shriveled market for natural
resources and other exports on which the Canadian economy is so
reliant. Meanwhile, the economic tremors in Asia have investors
scrambling to put their money into the strongest and safest
currency in the world _ the US dollar _ and selling off secondary
currencies, such as Canada's.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other factors, as well, including long-running
fear that restless Quebec may yet vote to secede from the country
before the end of the century. Additionally, high unemployment
continues to dog most of the 10 provinces despite overall
strengthening of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the news is not all bad for Canada. Exporters benefit
from cheaper Canadian products, for example. Meanwhile, the
country's tourism industry is booming on the back of the drooping
loonie as Americans flock to Canada in search of bargains _ and
Canadians, less and less able to afford vacations in Maine or
California, settle for holidays in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really prefer to spend a week in Vermont and another week
on Cape Cod, as we usually do,'' said Mary Chan of Toronto,
vacationing in Nova Scotia with her husband and two children. ``But
the weak loonie makes New England just too painfully expensive to
enjoy. Even a family lunch break at McDonald's is going to run us
$45'' in equivalent Canadian money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tourist officials say the most startling change brought
by the plunging Canadian dollar is not so much the arrival of more
Americans _ although the numbers of Yanks are up almost everywhere
_ but the hordes of Canadians who feel financially obliged to
vacation in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Canadian visitor totals are up enormously, and that more
reflects the devalued dollar than the arrivals of more Americans,''
said Sharon Martin, manager of inquiries and research for Nova
Scotia's Department of Economic Development and Tourism. ``A lot of
Canadians are choosing Canadian vacations primarily because our
dollar is so weak down in the states. But I think it's rather rare
for an American to say, `Hey, the Canadian dollar is low _ let's
go!' It's more like they find the stronger'' US dollar ``just an
added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion was echoed by most of more than a dozen vacationing
New Englanders interviewed in the Maritime Provinces and Quebec in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came looking for natural beauty, not bargains,'' said
Robert Wilson of Uxbridge, Mass., vacationing in the Maritime
Provinces with wife Elaine. ``It's nice that the our dollar
stretches farther, and some of the savings are a real surprise, but
currency was not a deciding factor. We were just looking for a
lovely place and a relaxed pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the shrunken dollar, Canada is not an across-the-board
shopper's paradise. Nearly all manufactured consumer goods, whether
cameras or chain saws, still cost considerably more in Canada than
in the United States. Gasoline is also more expensive, as is a
bottle of wine or trip to the supermarket. Taxes are stupefying,
with combined federal and provincial sales taxes ranging from 15 to
19 percent. Even taxes are taxed, as in the case of postage.
</P>
<P>
   But the weak Canadian dollar has transformed many of the things
tourists seek into remarkable deals, whether motel rooms, museum
fees, restaurant meals, high-quality handicrafts, or kitschy
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in US dollars, a ticket for a musical at a Prince
Edward Island theater costs $6 while a room at one of
Charlottetown's better hotels can be had for $50. Cheaper but
perfectly decent motel rooms can easily be found for $25 a night.
Luxury hotel rooms in Toronto, Montreal or Halifax can be found for
$120 a night, about half the cost of New York or Boston. It's
possible to play 18 holes of golf at an oceanside course for $20.
Souvenir T-shirts can run as low as $5, while exquisite handmade
quilts can be bought for $250 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same quality of quilt in Pennsylvania would be $500,
easily,'' said Maureen Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Even gambling is cheaper because, hey, if you drop $100 at the
casino in Montreal or Halifax at today's rates it's only a loss of
$66.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar has been slipping for decades. The last time
one Canadian dollar trade for one US dollar was 1976. But it wasn't
until this year that the loonie plunged below the so-called
``psychological barrier'' of US 68 cents, hitherto the lowest level
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has made no effort to ride to the rescue, at least so
far. Indeed, Prime Minister Jean Chretien enraged many citizens
earlier this month when he shrugged off the dollar's decline as
just ``a reality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy is now powerless in Canada,'' Jeoffrey Hall,
market analyst for Boston's Thomson Global Markets, told the Ottawa
Citizen. ``Stick a fork in the Canadian dollar, it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans, Canada's grim reality is cause to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Peterson, a recently graduated law student from Bristol,
Rhode Island, said she and her husband had originally planned to
travel across the US this summer to celebrate their recent
marriage. But a look at the exchange rate changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we'll have basically the same
across-the-prairies-and-over-the-Rockies experience for two-thirds
the cost,'' she said while sipping Moosehead beer at an outdoor
cafe in Montreal's Old City. ``And we're hoping it'll be just as
romantic to stroll beside Vancouver's bay as San Francisco's.''

US RESORTS FAVORED BY CANADIANS FEELING LONELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine _ Once, this was considered the summer
resort town of choice for Quebecers. But the 8,000-person town _ at
a five-hour drive, the closest ocean beach to Montreal -- has seen
a decline in Canadian tourists as the strong US dollar pushes down
Canadians' buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few,'' says Phyllis Kilfoil, owner of the 18-room
Millbrook Motel, which has had fewer than half a dozen Canadian
guests each week this summer. ``The numbers are low, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is high tourist season in the Old Orchard Beach
area, with up to 140,000 people streaming into town on a crowded
Saturday, hotel owners say the Canadians are either staying away or
making shorter trips to Maine. And those Canadians who do come
often try to use the plummeting exchange rate to wring sympathy out
of businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to use it as bargaining power to get the rate down,''
says Mitchell M. Wood, who owns the Americana Motel, right across
the street from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once they've decided to shell out expensive American
dollars for a hotel room, Canadian tourists frequently spend less
on extra amenities, local businespeople say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little more frugal,'' says James E. Harmon,
executive director of the Old Orchard Beach Chamber of Commerce.
``Instead of dining out, they might cook in their room. They go to
matinees instead of evening movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Orchard Beach has tried to capitalize on the strong US
economy by refurbishing the nearly 350-year-old town, adding
fountains and trees and renovating the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really made an investment into the town about six or seven
years ago trying to bring back the American family,'' says Harmon.
``Where we've slacked off in Canadian tourists the Americans have
filled the void.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tourist void is not yet bottomless in Maine. Their
numbers may be shrinking, but Canadians continue to visit the
state. Border crossings into Maine were up in June, according to
the Maine Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some local hotel owners say Maine is a deal, compared to
steep vacation prices in Canada's Maritime Provinces. ``The motel
rates up there, they're double my rates,'' says Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   And for some Canadians, the exchange rate may be more a favorite
complaint than a vacation-killer. ``They've been talking about it
for 10 years,'' Rousseau says. ``It gives them some means of
conversation.''

 &HT;    AirTran to expand presence at Hartsfield
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AirTran will base more of its pilots and flight
attendants in Atlanta as part of a plan to expand service from
Hartsfield International Airport this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier announced this week it is adding service to some
cities and cutting back service to others. By October, it will have
more than 260 daily flights between Atlanta and 30 cities. The
company now has 120 daily departures from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will allow AirTran to set up a more traditional hub
system at Hartsfield and operate more like larger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the changes, AirTran is eliminating most of its 14
nonstop flights to Atlanta from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which was created by the merger of AirTran Airways
and Atlanta-based ValuJet, also will restart flights next month to
Miami. It will be the first time AirTran has flown directly to
Miami from Atlanta since the 1996 crash of Flight 592 that killed
all 110 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Flights also will begin from Atlanta to Quad Cities/Moline,
Ill., in September, and to Newark, N.J., in October. AirTran said
it is also adding service to Buffalo, N.Y., Washington's Dulles
airport and Orlando. But the carrier will discontinue flights to
Allentown, Pa.; West Palm Beach, Fla.; Des Moines, Iowa; and Islip
and Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran is the second-largest carrier serving Atlanta after
Delta Air Lines, which provides 80 percent of the flights. Last
month, Delta announced expanded service from Orlando through its
Delta Express flights, which do not come to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran said 165 pilots and flight attendants, mainly in
Orlando, will join 125 others already based in Atlanta. Spokeswoman
Cara Maruskin said the carrier will hire additional workers,
especially flight attendants, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will use its existing 18 gates at Hartsfield to
accommodate the expanded service. ``We'd like more and have made a
formal request for more gates,'' Maruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   She said funneling all its flights through Atlanta will allow
AirTran to tap into more stable year-round markets, allowing it to
maintain the profitability it has restored for the first time since
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that the Orlando market was primarily seasonal and
leisure-based, so that's really why we're going to the bigger
Atlanta base,'' Maruskin said. She added AirTran customers will
still be able to reach all the airline's destinations, just not
directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not stopping service,'' she said. ``We're just using
Atlanta (more).''

 &HT;    On deck: St. Louis Cardinals
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: WAGA-5, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (14-4, 2.68; 11-4,
3.85 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. LHP Kent Mercker (6-8, 5.94; 0-2,
6.35).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Glavine has lost just once since June 18, a span of seven
starts in which he has given up more than two runs just once. He
worked through the seventh inning in each of his last eight games
and was denied No. 15 after giving up an eighth-inning run in
Cincinnati on Monday. He has been successful through the years
against the Cardinals but will remember the last time he faced
them, when he gave up a two-run homer to Mark McGwire in the ninth,
on Aug. 15 last year. The Braves lost 3-2 in 12 innings. Mercker
makes his fourth start against the Braves and his second at Turner
Field. The Braves beat him twice last year as a Cincinnati Red,
accumulating 24 hits and 12 runs in 17 innings against him. The
only current Brave to homer off Mercker is Javy Lopez. Mercker has
won just once in his last eight starts, the win coming his last
time out in a 3-1 decision at Colorado. He allowed one run on five
hits over five innings before he was forced from the game because
of dizziness. In his five previous starts, Mercker had given up 22
runs in 22 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Banks sometimes share data with brokerage units
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Banks are pushing into the stock brokerage and
insurance businesses, enabling brokers and agents to poke into your
banking business.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank, First Union, Wachovia, SunTrust Banks and others
routinely share customer information with their investment
subsidiaries. So if your certificate of deposit is about to mature,
you could get a call from a stockbroker proposing alternative
investments.
</P>
<P>
   It's been perfectly legal since 1997 under an amendment to the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, as long as you give an OK. You probably
did that without knowing it, according to consumer groups, which
consider the sharing of such information an invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer groups and the Federal Trade Commission are doing
what we can to repeal that law. But it's a tough battle,'' said
Edmund Mierzwinski of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in
Washington. He termed the amendment ``a successful anti-consumer
lobbying effort by the banking industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks don't see a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no programs and systems in place that automatically
send referrals,'' said SunTrust Banks spokesman Hugh Suhr.
``Ideally a referral would be made from a relationship approach to
banking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's acceptable to share that information (about CDs)
between the bank and the broker dealer, it really does not happen
with a great deal of frequency within Wachovia. Our counselors are
not preying on CD lists as a way of doing business,'' said Forrest
C. Childers, senior vice president and managing director of
Wachovia Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a customer privacy document that's posted on our
Internet site (http://wachovia.com)'', Childers said. ``Basically,
anything we're going to do with customer information is specified
in the guidelines of that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires your permission for
information sharing, but in practice, said Mierzwinski, ``that's
buried in fine print.'' Notification of your rights along with a
means of requesting that your data not be shared _ an option that
you have to pursue _ is all that's required. The law does not
provide for a way to stop information sharing, according to the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   You should have received notice from your bank in one form or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, the notice about information sharing is in your
customer agreement with the bank, according to Pierce Nelson,
spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd find many people who thought they'd given
permission for that,'' said Jean Ann Fox of the Washington-based
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   She noted states could prohibit information sharing. Georgia has
no such law, according to Steve Bridges, commissioner of banking
and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Banking companies desiring to convert CDs into more profitable
securities have a large market to pursue. Insured savings
institutions have about $1.15 trillion in time deposits such as
CDs.

 &HT;    Holyfield gives Atlanta business comunnity another round
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Sudden interest from some Atlanta businesses has led
Evander Holyfield's representatives to give the community another
week to make a significant financial commitment for a potential
Holyfield fight in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, the heavyweight champion's attorney, said he
received phone calls from ``four or five major businesses'' on
Friday after Holyfield and Thomas expressed disappointment in the
community for not supporting a proposed bout against Vaughn Bean on
Sept. 19. Their comments appeared in Friday's editions of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls now from people saying, 'What do you mean
there's no support? What can we do?' `` Thomas said. ``There's no
concrete decision, but we're going to try to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the change has led Holyfield, promoter Don King and
the Showtime cable network to lower the amount of guarantees they
are seeking from the city's businesses. They originally cited a
figure of $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to take more risk and make more of a
sacrifice,'' Thomas said. ``We're willing to take a chance on
people buying tickets and the business support being there.''
</P>
<P>
   King's alternate plan, if the Atlanta fight doesn't come off, is
for Holyfield to fight Bean or Henry Akinwande in October in Las
Vegas or Atlantic City. Holyfield, whose scheduled June 6 fight in
New York City against Akinwande was canceled because the challenger
tested positive for hepatitis B, has not fought since a November
win over Michael Moorer.

 &HT;    Vatican orders Texas hospital to eliminate reproductive services
 &HT;    Eds: Fixes bishop's name in 2nd graf
 &HT;    (An Austin story that moved previously, recast for a national
audience. For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Vatican has twice instructed the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Austin to end contraceptive programs and
sterilizations at a church-managed city hospital, setting up a
dispute among the church, the bishop and community members.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops nationwide are watching the dispute, which
involves Brackenridge Hospital, leased from the city by the
Catholic-owned Seton Healthcare Network. Seton's lease with the
city requires it to offer such reproductive services, and Bishop
John McCarthy, considered one of the more moderate bishops in the
country, said he intends to stick by the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Seton is owned by the religious order Daughters of Charity but
operates under the purview of the bishop, who is responsible for
ensuring that Catholic moral teachings are upheld in his diocese.
Seton had to and did receive the bishop's approval before entering
into the lease agreement; McCarthy was not required to have the
Vatican approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But an anonymous group of conservative Catholics in Austin had
complaints about the lease agreement sent to the Vatican's most
powerful office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. The
Congregation ensures that church laws are obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (conservative Catholics) don't listen to their bishop and
think they can overpower him, and that's what makes it more of a
problem than it needs to be,'' said the Rev. Kevin O'Rourke,
director of the Catholic Center for Health Care Ethics at St. Louis
University and one of several ethicists who reviewed the lease
agreement for the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's response could affect future mergers, acquisitions
and management operating agreements between Catholic and
non-Catholic hospitals and medical centers throughout the country.
Last year, the Vatican stopped one merger in New Jersey, and some
bishops have stepped in to halt others. The Seton-Brackenridge
agreement began in 1995, the year the pope issued an encyclical
that warned administrators of Catholic health facilities that if
they bend the church rules on reproductive services, their
institutions could lose Catholic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   In June, McCarthy met in Rome with Pope John Paul II and
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy confirmed that the 30-year lease agreement was
discussed but would not disclose details of his meetings, other
than to say the talks were amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict could have major repercussions for Austin, McCarthy
and Seton. The Vatican could order McCarthy to tell the Daughters
of Charity to stop sterilizations and contraceptive measures at
Brackenridge or face disciplinary action, including disavowing
Seton as a Catholic institution. If McCarthy failed to follow a
Vatican directive, disciplinary measures could range from a
reprimand to removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the city was considering turning over the
management of debt-ridden Brackenridge to Seton, controversy
erupted in the community over what would happen to reproductive
services.
</P>
<P>
   The city promised organizations such as Planned Parenthood and
the National Organization for Women that it would not turn the
hospital over to a private entity without ensuring that
reproductive services would be available. Seton vowed not to break
church laws, which prohibit abortion, sterilization, fertility
treatments and contraceptives. Both sides were optimistic that they
could work out a deal, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was not a perfect fit, McCarthy said, but it does
not violate any church laws because Seton does not directly provide
the reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Five Catholic ethicists approved the agreement and the City
Council unanimously approved it. The lease requires Seton to allow
reproductive services on site at Brackenridge; abortions are not
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Seton also is required to give space in the hospital for the
Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department to offer
reproductive services information and counseling, including
information on abortions and contraceptives. To offset the cost of
providing this service, the City of Austin required Seton pay an
additional $81,721 a year for the lease, bringing the total annual
payment to more than $2.1 million. The contract includes a possible
$10 million fine if Seton breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, sterilizations and contraceptives
are private matters between patients and physicians. Seton
contracts with nurses from another health-care company for nursing
services during tubal ligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman and her physician determine what services are
provided,'' said Ed Berger, Seton's vice president of advocacy and
public policy. ``There is not a hospital policy about that. The key
words are that Seton policies 'allow' these to take place... as
opposed to 'will provide' or 'do it' or whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fastiggi, an associate professor of religious studies at
St. Edward's University, has openly criticized the lease agreement,
saying he respects the bishop but thinks that the agreement
violates Catholic Church laws. He aired that opinion in 1995 during
a diocesan meeting where the agreement was explained.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the Rev. William Broussard, ethicist for the
Austin diocese and a Seton board member, sent Fastiggi a letter
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob you were described by those who witnessed your questions
as 'frantic,' 'emotional,' 'angry' and 'disturbed.' ''The letter
later said: ``Either you presented yourself years ago with the
skill of an actor hiding a split personality, or Bob, you are
deteriorating right in front of our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fastiggi also received a letter of reprimand from Patricia
Hayes, then president of St. Edward's and now executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Seton. Hayes warned
Fastiggi that his ``judgmental'' style of presenting information on
the Seton agreement and another issue needed to stop. Also, Hayes
said that her letter would become ``a part of your formal annual
evaluation as a faculty member at St. Edward's.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, at the request of some Austin Catholics who didn't
want to be identified, the Saint Joseph Foundation, a San
Antonio-based conservative Catholic group, notified Rome of the
proposed lease agreement between Seton and Brackenridge,
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the concerns expressed at the time is if the identities
of all those were known, the bishop could be harsh and take
retribution against them,'' said Chuck Wilson, the Saint Joseph
Foundation executive director. ``Everything that has happened since
then has been strictly between the Congregation and McCarthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith wrote McCarthy asking
for details of the agreement. He responded in early June 1995. The
Vatican sent back a letter of opposition. In July, McCarthy
notified the Vatican that a new agreement for sterilizations and
reproductive service delivery had been reached that created a
``wall of separation'' between Seton and the services the church
considers sinful.
</P>
<P>
   That letter didn't reach the Congregation for the Doctrine of
Faith office until December. In March 1996, the Vatican sent
another letter telling McCarthy not to allow the agreement to go
through until Vatican officials could fully review it. McCarthy
replied that a 30-year agreement had been signed Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Vatican has written two letters, the more recent
in December, telling McCarthy to instruct Seton to immediately stop
sterilizations and contraceptive programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clash of beliefs
</P>
<P>
   William May, an ethicist at the John Paul II Institute for
Studies on Marriage and Family in Washington, D.C., called the
Seton agreement ``fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   May, who until last year was one of 30 theologians on the
International Theological Commission, an arm of the doctrinal
congregation, added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great difficulty reconciling this as what a Catholic
hospital should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Theological disputes such as this one, he went on, ``are decided
by a higher authority, and the higher authority would be ... the
Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said he will continue to communicate with the Vatican
but has no plans to interfere with the Daughters of Charity
hospital operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely supportive of what the Daughters of Charity are
doing here,'' McCarthy said. He said they are delivering health
care to thousands of poor people who otherwise might not get needed
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the poor, he pointed out, is one of the cornerstones of
the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   In its last fiscal year that ended June 30, Seton delivered $47
million in charity health-care services. Next year, the amount is
expected to reach $50 million, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Seton will never break the lease, Hayes said. There are at least
15 dioceses in the country where Catholic hospitals have agreements
to offer reproductive services, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for Free Choice, an independent group that believes
Catholics should be able to make their own decisions on
reproduction, reports that 84 Catholic hospitals have merged with
non-Catholic institutions since 1990. Twenty more mergers are
pending. It is expected that 15 of the new institutions will not
provide reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions for such services are an economic necessity for many
Catholic hospitals. Without the availability of reproductive
services, Catholic hospitals risk losing contracts with managed
health-care providers, the bread and butter of any health system,
O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of a Catholic hospital system is to provide health
care to the poor, but it must have income from insured patients to
pay for its work with the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to expand our hospital empire ... we don't
think of health care as a business,'' McCarthy said. ``We are
trying to protect health care for the poor.

 &HT;    `Nothing's really changed,' UPS employees complain
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A year after the bruising strike at United Parcel
Service, Teamsters again took up their posts outside the company's
distribution hubs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This time they were handing out flyers, not striking. Workers
are voicing complaints remarkably similar to those that led to the
paralyzing walkout last August. UPS and Teamsters continue to
wrangle over the company's heavy reliance on part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's really changed,'' says Scott McKee, a part-time
package sorter who picked up a union flier outside the company's
Doraville center.
</P>
<P>
   McKee, 43, is in his ninth year as a part-timer at UPS, despite
repeated requests to go full-time. His pay was bumped up after the
strike _ he now makes close to $30,000 a year for working 40 to 50
hours a week. But like many part-timers working full-time weeks, he
gets less pay, and reduced vacation time and pension terms compared
to full timers.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal that ended last year's strike, UPS committed to
shift part-timers into 2,000 new full-time jobs this year. But
under the agreement, the company doesn't have to add the jobs if
reduced package volume has led to layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has cut part-time jobs through attrition and
laid off some full-time drivers because its load of daily U.S.
package deliveries has dropped 4 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials dispute the company's conclusions, accuse UPS of
cutting back on its service in rural areas and point out company
profits are up.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are seeking arbitration to resolve the
dispute, according to spokesman Robert Godlewski. Donald Scott, the
statewide president for the Teamsters' local 728, says he doubts
the disagreements will grow into another crippling showdown between
the company and the union.
</P>
<P>
   McKee, the part-time sorter, agrees. ``Nobody wants that.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Vatican has twice instructed the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Austin to end contraceptive programs and
sterilizations at a church-managed city hospital, setting up a
dispute among the church, the bishop and community members.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops nationwide are watching the dispute, which
involves Brackenridge Hospital, leased from the city by the
Catholic-owned Seton Healthcare Network. Seton's lease with the
city requires it to offer such reproductive services, and Bishop
John McCarthy, considered one of the more moderate bishops in the
country, said he intends to stick by the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Seton is owned by the religious order Daughters of Charity but
operates under the purview of the bishop, who is responsible for
ensuring that Catholic moral teachings are upheld in his diocese.
Seton had to and did receive the bishop's approval before entering
into the lease agreement; McCarthy was not required to have the
Vatican approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But an anonymous group of conservative Catholics in Austin had
complaints about the lease agreement sent to the Vatican's most
powerful office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. The
Congregation ensures that church laws are obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (conservative Catholics) don't listen to their bishop and
think they can overpower him, and that's what makes it more of a
problem than it needs to be,'' said the Rev. Kevin O'Rourke,
director of the Catholic Center for Health Care Ethics at St. Louis
University and one of several ethicists who reviewed the lease
agreement for the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's response could affect future mergers, acquisitions
and management operating agreements between Catholic and
non-Catholic hospitals and medical centers throughout the country.
Last year, the Vatican stopped one merger in New Jersey, and some
bishops have stepped in to halt others. The Seton-Brackenridge
agreement began in 1995, the year the pope issued an encyclical
that warned administrators of Catholic health facilities that if
they bend the church rules on reproductive services, their
institutions could lose Catholic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   In June, McCarthy met in Rome with Pope John Paul II and
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy confirmed that the 30-year lease agreement was
discussed but would not disclose details of his meetings, other
than to say the talks were amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict could have major repercussions for Austin, McCarthy
and Seton. The Vatican could order McCarthy to tell the Daughters
of Charity to stop sterilizations and contraceptive measures at
Brackenridge or face disciplinary action, including disavowing
Seton as a Catholic institution. If McCarthy failed to follow a
Vatican directive, disciplinary measures could range from a
reprimand to removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the city was considering turning over the
management of debt-ridden Brackenridge to Seton, controversy
erupted in the community over what would happen to reproductive
services.
</P>
<P>
   The city promised organizations such as Planned Parenthood and
the National Organization for Women that it would not turn the
hospital over to a private entity without ensuring that
reproductive services would be available. Seton vowed not to break
church laws, which prohibit abortion, sterilization, fertility
treatments and contraceptives. Both sides were optimistic that they
could work out a deal, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was not a perfect fit, McCarthy said, but it does
not violate any church laws because Seton does not directly provide
the reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Five Catholic ethicists approved the agreement and the City
Council unanimously approved it. The lease requires Seton to allow
reproductive services on site at Brackenridge; abortions are not
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Seton also is required to give space in the hospital for the
Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department to offer
reproductive services information and counseling, including
information on abortions and contraceptives. To offset the cost of
providing this service, the City of Austin required Seton pay an
additional $81,721 a year for the lease, bringing the total annual
payment to more than $2.1 million. The contract includes a possible
$10 million fine if Seton breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, sterilizations and contraceptives
are private matters between patients and physicians. Seton
contracts with nurses from another health-care company for nursing
services during tubal ligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman and her physician determine what services are
provided,'' said Ed Berger, Seton's vice president of advocacy and
public policy. ``There is not a hospital policy about that. The key
words are that Seton policies 'allow' these to take place... as
opposed to 'will provide' or 'do it' or whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fastiggi, an associate professor of religious studies at
St. Edward's University, has openly criticized the lease agreement,
saying he respects the bishop but thinks that the agreement
violates Catholic Church laws. He aired that opinion in 1995 during
a diocesan meeting where the agreement was explained.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the Rev. William Broussard, ethicist for the
Austin diocese and a Seton board member, sent Fastiggi a letter
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob you were described by those who witnessed your questions
as 'frantic,' 'emotional,' 'angry' and 'disturbed.' ''The letter
later said: ``Either you presented yourself years ago with the
skill of an actor hiding a split personality, or Bob, you are
deteriorating right in front of our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fastiggi also received a letter of reprimand from Patricia
Hayes, then president of St. Edward's and now executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Seton. Hayes warned
Fastiggi that his ``judgmental'' style of presenting information on
the Seton agreement and another issue needed to stop. Also, Hayes
said that her letter would become ``a part of your formal annual
evaluation as a faculty member at St. Edward's.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, at the request of some Austin Catholics who didn't
want to be identified, the Saint Joseph Foundation, a San
Antonio-based conservative Catholic group, notified Rome of the
proposed lease agreement between Seton and Brackenridge,
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the concerns expressed at the time is if the identities
of all those were known, the bishop could be harsh and take
retribution against them,'' said Chuck Wilson, the Saint Joseph
Foundation executive director. ``Everything that has happened since
then has been strictly between the Congregation and McCarthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith wrote McCarthy asking
for details of the agreement. He responded in early June 1995. The
Vatican sent back a letter of opposition. In July, McCarthy
notified the Vatican that a new agreement for sterilizations and
reproductive service delivery had been reached that created a
``wall of separation'' between Seton and the services the church
considers sinful.
</P>
<P>
   That letter didn't reach the Congregation for the Doctrine of
Faith office until December. In March 1996, the Vatican sent
another letter telling McCarthy not to allow the agreement to go
through until Vatican officials could fully review it. McCarthy
replied that a 30-year agreement had been signed Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Vatican has written two letters, the more recent
in December, telling McCarthy to instruct Seton to immediately stop
sterilizations and contraceptive programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clash of beliefs
</P>
<P>
   William May, an ethicist at the John Paul II Institute for
Studies on Marriage and Family in Washington, D.C., called the
Seton agreement ``fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   May, who until last year was one of 30 theologians on the
International Theological Commission, an arm of the doctrinal
congregation, added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great difficulty reconciling this as what a Catholic
hospital should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Theological disputes such as this one, he went on, ``are decided
by a higher authority, and the higher authority would be ... the
Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said he will continue to communicate with the Vatican
but has no plans to interfere with the Daughters of Charity
hospital operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely supportive of what the Daughters of Charity are
doing here,'' McCarthy said. He said they are delivering health
care to thousands of poor people who otherwise might not get needed
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the poor, he pointed out, is one of the cornerstones of
the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   In its last fiscal year that ended June 30, Seton delivered $47
million in charity health-care services. Next year, the amount is
expected to reach $50 million, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Seton will never break the lease, Hayes said. There are at least
15 dioceses in the country where Catholic hospitals have agreements
to offer reproductive services, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for Free Choice, an independent group that believes
Catholics should be able to make their own decisions on
reproduction, reports that 84 Catholic hospitals have merged with
non-Catholic institutions since 1990. Twenty more mergers are
pending. It is expected that 15 of the new institutions will not
provide reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions for such services are an economic necessity for many
Catholic hospitals. Without the availability of reproductive
services, Catholic hospitals risk losing contracts with managed
health-care providers, the bread and butter of any health system,
O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of a Catholic hospital system is to provide health
care to the poor, but it must have income from insured patients to
pay for its work with the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to expand our hospital empire ... we don't
think of health care as a business,'' McCarthy said. ``We are
trying to protect health care for the poor.

AMERICAN GO NORTH TO CASH IN ON CANDIAN DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The swoon of the Canadian dollar has put
a sizzle into the wallets of Americans venturing north of the
border, especially those seeking vacation bargains in
accommodations, entertainment, and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to the radio on the drive up, it seemed as though
the Canadian dollar was hitting another record low with every news
update,'' said Paul Dow of Georgetown, Mass., on a camping trip
with his wife, Maureen, through Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty hard news for the poor Canadians, I'd guess, but
it meant our vacation was getting cheaper by the hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The loonie _ nickname of the Canadian dollar because of the
national bird, the common loon, depicted on the country's $1 coin _
is in free fall, plummeting to all-time lows against the greenback.
Right now, the Canadian dollar is worth about .66 cents US, its
lowest level in history. The value is eroding so inexorably that
prognosticators say there is no way of telling where the loonie
will finally flutter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick a bottom,'' said Sal Guatieri, senior economist
with the Bank of Montreal. ``The near-term picture is not very
rosy.''
</P>
<P>
   One often-heard joke asks what do you call Canada's $2 coin?
Answer: An American dollar. But the yucks are sounding hollow as
headlines proclaiming yet another precipitous drop have become
routine front page fare _ another day, another drop. In July, the
loonie closed at seven all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relentless, it's unhealthy,'' said Sherry Cooper,
economist at Nesbitt Burns Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Canada is the victim of Asia's economic woes.
Desperate times in once-booming Pacific Rim nations from Japan to
Indonesia means a drastically shriveled market for natural
resources and other exports on which the Canadian economy is so
reliant. Meanwhile, the economic tremors in Asia have investors
scrambling to put their money into the strongest and safest
currency in the world _ the US dollar _ and selling off secondary
currencies, such as Canada's.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other factors, as well, including long-running
fear that restless Quebec may yet vote to secede from the country
before the end of the century. Additionally, high unemployment
continues to dog most of the 10 provinces despite overall
strengthening of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the news is not all bad for Canada. Exporters benefit
from cheaper Canadian products, for example. Meanwhile, the
country's tourism industry is booming on the back of the drooping
loonie as Americans flock to Canada in search of bargains _ and
Canadians, less and less able to afford vacations in Maine or
California, settle for holidays in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really prefer to spend a week in Vermont and another week
on Cape Cod, as we usually do,'' said Mary Chan of Toronto,
vacationing in Nova Scotia with her husband and two children. ``But
the weak loonie makes New England just too painfully expensive to
enjoy. Even a family lunch break at McDonald's is going to run us
$45'' in equivalent Canadian money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tourist officials say the most startling change brought
by the plunging Canadian dollar is not so much the arrival of more
Americans _ although the numbers of Yanks are up almost everywhere
_ but the hordes of Canadians who feel financially obliged to
vacation in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Canadian visitor totals are up enormously, and that more
reflects the devalued dollar than the arrivals of more Americans,''
said Sharon Martin, manager of inquiries and research for Nova
Scotia's Department of Economic Development and Tourism. ``A lot of
Canadians are choosing Canadian vacations primarily because our
dollar is so weak down in the states. But I think it's rather rare
for an American to say, `Hey, the Canadian dollar is low _ let's
go!' It's more like they find the stronger'' US dollar ``just an
added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion was echoed by most of more than a dozen vacationing
New Englanders interviewed in the Maritime Provinces and Quebec in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came looking for natural beauty, not bargains,'' said
Robert Wilson of Uxbridge, Mass., vacationing in the Maritime
Provinces with wife Elaine. ``It's nice that the our dollar
stretches farther, and some of the savings are a real surprise, but
currency was not a deciding factor. We were just looking for a
lovely place and a relaxed pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the shrunken dollar, Canada is not an across-the-board
shopper's paradise. Nearly all manufactured consumer goods, whether
cameras or chain saws, still cost considerably more in Canada than
in the United States. Gasoline is also more expensive, as is a
bottle of wine or trip to the supermarket. Taxes are stupefying,
with combined federal and provincial sales taxes ranging from 15 to
19 percent. Even taxes are taxed, as in the case of postage.
</P>
<P>
   But the weak Canadian dollar has transformed many of the things
tourists seek into remarkable deals, whether motel rooms, museum
fees, restaurant meals, high-quality handicrafts, or kitschy
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in US dollars, a ticket for a musical at a Prince
Edward Island theater costs $6 while a room at one of
Charlottetown's better hotels can be had for $50. Cheaper but
perfectly decent motel rooms can easily be found for $25 a night.
Luxury hotel rooms in Toronto, Montreal or Halifax can be found for
$120 a night, about half the cost of New York or Boston. It's
possible to play 18 holes of golf at an oceanside course for $20.
Souvenir T-shirts can run as low as $5, while exquisite handmade
quilts can be bought for $250 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same quality of quilt in Pennsylvania would be $500,
easily,'' said Maureen Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Even gambling is cheaper because, hey, if you drop $100 at the
casino in Montreal or Halifax at today's rates it's only a loss of
$66.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar has been slipping for decades. The last time
one Canadian dollar trade for one US dollar was 1976. But it wasn't
until this year that the loonie plunged below the so-called
``psychological barrier'' of US 68 cents, hitherto the lowest level
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has made no effort to ride to the rescue, at least so
far. Indeed, Prime Minister Jean Chretien enraged many citizens
earlier this month when he shrugged off the dollar's decline as
just ``a reality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy is now powerless in Canada,'' Jeoffrey Hall,
market analyst for Boston's Thomson Global Markets, told the Ottawa
Citizen. ``Stick a fork in the Canadian dollar, it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans, Canada's grim reality is cause to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Peterson, a recently graduated law student from Bristol,
Rhode Island, said she and her husband had originally planned to
travel across the US this summer to celebrate their recent
marriage. But a look at the exchange rate changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we'll have basically the same
across-the-prairies-and-over-the-Rockies experience for two-thirds
the cost,'' she said while sipping Moosehead beer at an outdoor
cafe in Montreal's Old City. ``And we're hoping it'll be just as
romantic to stroll beside Vancouver's bay as San Francisco's.''

TRANSGENDER ATHLETES CHARGE GAY GAMES WITH DISCRIMINATORY
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gay Games, founded 16 years ago as way to bring together
through sports competition people who were being excluded from
mainstream life, has found itself on the eve of the fifth ``Gay
Olympiad'' in Amsterdam, Netherlands, being accused of the very
thing it was created to fight: sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   From within the games' ranks, newly vocal sexual minorities _
led by transgender athletes who have changed their sex _ have
arisen to denounce what they say is bias against them by
tradition-minded Gay Games organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are in many ways a result of success. The games
began in San Francisco in 1982 as a purely local event with 1,300
athletes and a budget of $120,000. Since then the event has evolved
into perhaps the most visible vehicle for gay pride and identity in
the world _ an institution of sport and culture that is expected to
draw 15,000 participants from 64 countries, beginning in full this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But along with growing impact has come a conflict over what the
games are meant to achieve _ what face for gay culture the event
should present to the world and how the complications of becoming
an institution, from the protection of the event's image to the
consciousness of potential legal liabilities, should be managed.
Rules about gender are where that conflict plays out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, local organizers in the Netherlands have
banned mixed-sex couples from competing in the ballroom dance
competition _ an event that will be a demonstration sport at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The goal, they say, is to
present the event as a kind of international showcase for
homosexual athletes: men dancing with men, women with women. What
that means, however, is that a lesbian school teacher from New York
City and her gay male dance partner will not be allowed out onto
the floor. Gay or not, they are of the opposite sex, and that has
been deemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The change that is drawing the most fire and discussion among
the gay participants, however, is a rule that affects only a tiny
minority: A requirement that athletes who have changed their sex
provide, for the first time, proof of what the rules call
``completed gender transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say that concerns over fairness and legal liability
have made it imperative that so-called ``transgender'' athletes be
put into the proper category especially so that men, with their
greater body strength _ whether born or created _ do not compete
unfairly, or perhaps even dangerously, against women. A man on the
path of becoming a woman, but not there yet, they say, might still
have a superior physical strength and weight that could provide
decisive in an event like powerlifting or tennis, or potentially
dangerous to opponents in single-sex women's team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the soccer field, a 100-pound waif of a girl has the right
to participate in a safe environment,'' said Roz Quarto,
co-president of the Federation of Gay Games.
</P>
<P>
   But while critics of the new policies agree that fairness and
safety are important, the central issue, they say, is larger: Who
is allowed to participate freely in the games without being
challenged about their private lives, and who is not?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gay Games were formed because gay athletes could not
compete openly _ how ironic that they are now forcing another group
of athletes to go back into the closet or face a barrage of
stigmatizing obstacles,'' said Riki Anne Wilchins, the executive
director of Gender PAC, a public advocacy coalition for the
transgender community and author of ``Read My Lips, Sexual
Subversion and the End of Gender,'' (Firebrand Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Games officials said that rules about ``gender transition'' were
initially proposed by the Federation of Gay Games, the event's
governing body, when the games were last held, in New York in 1994.
The idea was ultimately scrapped in favor of a policy that let
applicants simply declare their sex with no further questions
asked. The re-emergence of the issue _ local officials in the
Netherlands, unlike their New York counterparts, decided to
implement the federation's more restrictive proposals _ has made
the games an object of attack even from traditional gay rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is their sense of fairness and justice _ where does
discrimination stop?'' said Sydney Levy, research and advocacy
director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission, a San Francisco-based organization. ``Singling out
transsexuals means singling out people who vary from the norm and
asking a lot of private questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay Games, which has from its inception been a mix of sport
and pageantry, has 29 athletic events this year ranging from
ice-hockey to a foot- race marathon along the route of the 1928
Amsterdam Olympic games, plus numerous cultural and arts workshops.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policies, transsexuals must provide documentation
that includes, for example, a letter from a doctor stating that the
transgender applicant has undergone hormone treatments for at least
two years without interruption, and other proof, through
photographs, correspondence or an employer's declaration, that the
applicant has lived actively in his or her new sex for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The dance competition rules on gender are even more exacting.
Officials have said, for example, that a man may legally dance with
another man who is dressed as a woman. It's also fine if both are
dressed as women. Two women can similarly compete looking like a
mixed sex or same sex couple so long as both are, beneath their
costumes, of the same gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is quite unique in a dance competition to have all
same sex couples _ it will be one of the most interesting things in
the Gay Games,'' said Niek van der Spek, the director of operations
for the Gay Games 5.
</P>
<P>
   And while games organizers say they expect only about two-dozen
transgender participants at this year's games, gay rights officials
say there are probably many more like Loren Cameron who were
dissuaded from going at all. Cameron, a professional photographer
and author who changed sexes from female to male, trained for six
months preparing for the body-building competition. He said he felt
the gender documentation requirement was intrusive and that he
could not in good conscience comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they're singling out certain people. They're not
asking every competitor for proof of gender identity, and I felt
that was wrong,'' Cameron said. ``Isn't it the whole spirit of the
games to celebrate inclusivity out of the `normal standard?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Sharmat, the New York City school teacher and erstwhile
dance competitor who was also on the board of directors for the
1994 Gay Games in New York, said that striking the right balance
between the role of the games as a showcase for gay culture and its
function as unifying force for gay men and women was hard then,
too. The New York event, she said, wase harshly criticized by some
people who said it had become an event for mainstream society.
</P>
<P>
   Sharmat, even though she disagrees with the policy that is
keeping her out of the dance competition, said she thinks that
bringing the games into broad acceptance, thus helping break down
barriers between homosexuals and heterosexuals, is important. ``You
do want to mainstream it. The question is, to what extent?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilchins, the transgender group leader, said the opposite
question is more germane: What elements of the mainstream should
you avoid taking with you?
</P>
<P>
   ``When minorities set up their own structure, they take the best
_ and the worst _ of the majority culture with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of athletes to determine their actual sex is also, of
course, nothing new to sports. In the 1970s, a battle raged in the
courts over whether Dr. Renee Richards, who underwent a sex change
to become a woman, could legally compete in the women's division of
the U.S. Open tennis tournament without taking a chromosome test.
Richards won her legal case and didn't have to take the test, but
she lost in the tournament's first round in 1977. The Olympics has
required chromosome testing since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Games officials also said that ballroom dancing plays a
bigger symbolic role in Europe, where the image of hundreds of
ballroom dancers, all same-sex pairs, would be a powerful statement
that gay men and women had fully, and openly, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Games officials are divided among themselves about the gender
rules, especially on the dance competition. The tradition of the
games has been to allow wide latitude by local organizers, but
officials at the Federation of Gay Games said the time may have
come to start exercising more centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people unhappy about not being able to
perform, heterosexual and homosexual,'' said Scott Mandell, the
federation's executive director. ``But they are the host city and
hopefully when we move on to Sydney in 2002 it will be a different
story.''

COMMENTARY: SURFING THE WETLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAZENDA RIO NEGRO, Brazil _ I knew this was going to be an
interesting interview when Nilson de Barros, superintendent for the
environment for Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul state, insisted that we
conduct our talk in the middle of the Rio Negro river.
</P>
<P>
   I was visiting de Barros' state, which is at the core of the
Pantanal region, along the border between Brazil, Bolivia and
Paraguay. The Pantanal is the largest fresh-water wetland in the
world (the size of Wisconsin), and is home to the jaguar and a host
of other endangered species. I flew there, on a tiny prop plane,
with a team from Conservation International to talk with de Barros.
We rendezvoused at the Fazenda Rio Negro, a ranch and nature lodge
on the Rio Negro. Once there, we boarded motorized launches and set
off for the meeting point at a shallow bend in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Pantanal nature reserve is Jurassic Park without the
dinosaurs. Moving downriver, we passed scores of caimans (relatives
of alligators) lounging on shore, giant river otters bobbing up and
down, with egrets, hyacinth macaws, toucans, ibises, marsh deer,
spoonbills, jaburu storks, ocelots and rheas (relatives of
ostriches) all poking out from the forest at different points.
</P>
<P>
   De Barros and his team were waiting for us, standing waist-deep
in the middle of the river. ``First a beer, then a bath, then we
talk,'' he said, cracking open a can of Skol as the river flowed
by.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought I had the best job in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Amazon, de Barros explained, the Pantanal is not
threatened by poor residents who want to destroy the habitat to
relieve their poverty. Indeed, the culture in the Pantanal is a
rare example of man and nature thriving in harmony _ through an
economy of ranching, fishing and now eco-tourism. The threat to
this region comes from external forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The global triple threat to the Pantanal comes from soy farmers
on the plateau above the Pantanal basin, who are eager to feed a
rapidly expanding world soybean market. Pesticides and silt runoff
from their farms are fouling the rivers and wildlife. At the same
time, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia have formed
a trading bloc to make them more globally competitive. To better
get their soy products to market from this region, they want to
dredge and straighten the rivers here in ways that could greatly
alter the ecosystem. Finally, a consortium of international energy
companies is building a gas pipeline across the Pantanal, from
gas-rich Bolivia to energy-starved Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, the Pantanal may also be saved by
globalization and the Internet. For one thing, the residents of the
Pantanal now have a chance to strengthen their traditional life
style, which is based on keeping the land natural, by selling
eco-tours and naturally fed beef to world markets ready to pay a
premium for eco-friendly products. Moreover, having global
companies involved here can be an asset. They bring highly
sophisticated technologies that are less harsh on the environment _
like barges that can navigate river bends with high-tech propellers
so the rivers don't have to be straightened.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, these global companies want to work in
other countries and they are now finding that with the Internet,
environmentalists in one country are quickly relaying how a company
behaves to environmentalists in other countries, and this can
either open doors or close them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hiding place anymore for bad corporate behavior in
a world of globally interconnected activism,'' said Glenn Prickett,
who heads Conservation International's corporate program.
``Customers, regulators and shareholders everywhere can now reward
or punish companies for what they do in faraway places like the
Pantanal. Global companies are also learning that by supporting
conservation programs they can improve the image of their global
brand among customers who increasingly value the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ford Motor is now financing Conservation
International's research on the Pantanal, its wildlife management
program here and the conversion of Pantanal cattle ranches into
private reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these global companies are not saving the Pantanal
because they've fallen in love with its endangered species, but
rather because they believe they can sell a lot more Jaguar cars if
they are seen as saving the jaguars of the Pantanal. And if that's
what it takes to save this incredibly beautiful ecosystem and way
of life, then God bless Henry Ford and the Internet.

US RESORTS FAVORED BY CANADIANS FEELING LONELY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine _ Once, this was considered the summer
resort town of choice for Quebecers. But the 8,000-person town _ at
a five-hour drive, the closest ocean beach to Montreal -- has seen
a decline in Canadian tourists as the strong US dollar pushes down
Canadians' buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few,'' says Phyllis Kilfoil, owner of the 18-room
Millbrook Motel, which has had fewer than half a dozen Canadian
guests each week this summer. ``The numbers are low, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is high tourist season in the Old Orchard Beach
area, with up to 140,000 people streaming into town on a crowded
Saturday, hotel owners say the Canadians are either staying away or
making shorter trips to Maine. And those Canadians who do come
often try to use the plummeting exchange rate to wring sympathy out
of businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to use it as bargaining power to get the rate down,''
says Mitchell M. Wood, who owns the Americana Motel, right across
the street from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once they've decided to shell out expensive American
dollars for a hotel room, Canadian tourists frequently spend less
on extra amenities, local businespeople say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little more frugal,'' says James E. Harmon,
executive director of the Old Orchard Beach Chamber of Commerce.
``Instead of dining out, they might cook in their room. They go to
matinees instead of evening movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Orchard Beach has tried to capitalize on the strong US
economy by refurbishing the nearly 350-year-old town, adding
fountains and trees and renovating the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really made an investment into the town about six or seven
years ago trying to bring back the American family,'' says Harmon.
``Where we've slacked off in Canadian tourists the Americans have
filled the void.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tourist void is not yet bottomless in Maine. Their
numbers may be shrinking, but Canadians continue to visit the
state. Border crossings into Maine were up in June, according to
the Maine Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some local hotel owners say Maine is a deal, compared to
steep vacation prices in Canada's Maritime Provinces. ``The motel
rates up there, they're double my rates,'' says Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   And for some Canadians, the exchange rate may be more a favorite
complaint than a vacation-killer. ``They've been talking about it
for 10 years,'' Rousseau says. ``It gives them some means of
conversation.''

NEGOTIATORS AGREE TO $50M TAX CUT FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reaching agreement on what is believed to be the first
law of its kind, the Massachusetts Legislature was expected Friday
night to pass a long-awaited tax break for insurance companies in
return for contributions to a community reinvestment fund.
</P>
<P>
   After racing to craft a compromise between House and Senate
versions, conferees Friday said they had agreed to a bill that
would give insurance companies up to $50 million in tax relief over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, companies would contribute $200 million _ $100
million each from life insurance companies and property and
casualty companies _ to a pool to fund housing in poor areas of the
state as well as minority- and women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The full Legislature was expected to adopt the measure before
adjourning for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody involved with this is very pleased,'' said Sen.
Warren Tolman, chairman of the Senate Joint Committee on Taxation.
``The insurance companies are happy. The community groups are
happy. Some people up here have been working on this for 15 years.
We finally did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts insurance companies for years have lobbied for
lower taxes, which are higher in the state than the nationwide
average of 2 percent. Because of a peculiarity in insurance tax
laws, companies pay the rate of their home state wherever they do
business, meaning Massachusetts companies' tax bills are
significantly higher than their counterparts in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, community groups have long lobbied for laws
encouraging the insurance industry to contribute to development in
poor communities in the same manner community reinvestment laws
compel banks to make loans in underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good bill and a very good start to what we hope
will be a long and beneficial relationship with the insurance
industry,'' said Marc Draisen, president of the Insurance Community
Reinvestment Coalition. ``The insurance industry is one the
nation's largest controllers of capital. With this as a start, we
feel that in four or five years, insurance companies will be eager
to invest in low- and moderate-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating the $200 million pool of money, the bill
also infuses $100 million into the Massachusetts Capital Resources
Co., created in 1977 to promote community investment by the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bill scraps the 14 percent net investment tax now paid by
Massachusetts life insurers and eliminates two smaller but costly
taxes paid by property and casualty insurers based
</P>
<P>
   here. It also grants a 1.5 percent tax credit on the amount
invested by any insurer working in Massachusetts in community
projects and gives community advocates more say in how insurers
fund lower-income projects.
</P>
<P>
   Companies who choose not to give to the fund, won't receive tax
breaks under the terms of the bill.

DOS AND DON'TS OF RUNWAY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)  
(lb) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To get to Day for Night, a stylish space on fashion's
new frontier in the westernmost reaches of Chelsea, you need to
take a slow-moving, living-room-size,
don't-touch-the-walls-they're-filthy freight elevator up to the
18th floor. Including waiting time, air kisses and loading-dock
chitchat of the ``Love your Prada man-purse'' variety, it takes
maybe 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nautica show for spring 1999, held there last Monday, was
over in maybe eight.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 outfits on display went by in a flash of sleeveless
T-shirts and neoprene pants, leaving the audience wanting more _ a
full-fledged sampling of David Chu's latest collection, perhaps _
or less, that is, no show at all.
</P>
<P>
   In its brevity, the Nautica show was the soul of folly. All that
expense and for what? Cotton jams and a couple of suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Farhi, the British sportswear designer, used the term
``focused collection'' in the notes for her menswear show at the
New York Public Library last Tuesday. In that phrase, she hit upon
the essence of any good fashion show. It can't be too long or too
short, too boring or too radical, too somber or too cute. It must
be focused, but fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's men's shows in New York _ officially known as
General Motors Fashion Week _ offered plenty of lessons in how to
show fashion and how not to. The proceedings proved that not every
designer is up to the task of showing on a runway and that it takes
a particular confluence of ingredients to get it just right.
</P>
<P>
   What are those ingredients?
</P>
<P>
   Location, location, location. It is one of the unspoken rules of
fashion. If a show is held in a convenient place, it doesn't have
to set the world on fire. The Public Library's Celeste Bartos
Forum, where many shows were presented, is nondescript but
efficient. The Hugo Boss show was perfectly suited to it. If it's
hard to get to a show, however, it had better be good.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett can show on 10th Avenue. His mix of Army surplus
and Lilly Pulitzer _ what he called a ``dizzying world of
come-hither hybrids'' in the show notes _ was as cocksure and
cockamamie as always, and completely worth the trip. Few jaunts to
the far West Side were as fruitful, however.
</P>
<P>
   An air of exclusivity is important, too. Marc Jacobs showed his
collection of Old Navy Deluxe in a tiny space on Mercer Street with
Billy Zane's cueball head front row center. It felt as if you were
in for something, although after the show there was considerable
debate on the merits of cashmere fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger took exclusivity to the extreme at his show on
Tuesday morning. Once his bouncers closed the doors of the Dia
Center for the Arts on West 22nd Street, they didn't want to open
them. Sean Combs (known as Puffy), who arrived 25 minutes late just
as the show was beginning, almost didn't get in but was given
access as the lights were dimming. LaVelle Olexa, Lord &AMP; Taylor's
top fashion merchandiser, wasn't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get in, a runway full of the right models can do
wonders to help you forget the surliness of the bouncers. A
celebrity in the room helps if he is as unexpected as Dharma &AMP;
Greg's Thomas Gibson at Hilfiger or, better yet, as cool as Samuel
L. Jackson, the star of ``The Negotiator,'' at Hugo Boss.
</P>
<P>
   The most endearing presence on the runways last week, however,
was not a celebrity at all. It was the model Colin Egglesfield, a
looker in the Tom Cruise vein with a killer smile. Although he has
modeled for two years _ doing print campaigns for Calvin Klein and
Versace _ he seemed just the tiniest bit embarrassed by the
attention his gym-sculptured body was receiving.
</P>
<P>
   At Cynthia Rowley's rooftop showing, high above an entrance to
the Lincoln Tunnel on Wednesday, he was made to model a striped
Speedo-style bikini. His ear-to-ear grin seemed to say, ``I'm
nearly naked, and you're all staring at me!'' He covered his face
as he approached the outstretched lenses of the photographers,
which, of course, made him even more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the right models, giveaways are a good thing at any
fashion show. Ms. Rowley knows that parting gifts can't make a
presentation _ usually _ but they leave the audience feeling better
than it might without them. Believing that only too much is enough,
she plied her guests with enough gear for a day at the beach _ a
striped towel, lip balm, aloe vera gel and a good book.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Hugo Boss handed out metal-frame sunglasses in
black bags. Jacobs gave away plain white T-shirts with his name
writ tiny and silk-screened in white on white on the back between
the shoulders. There were note pads from Nautica.
</P>
<P>
   Of all fashion-show ingredients, cool music is among the most
important. It focuses opinion and sometimes explains a designer's
impetus. You hear ``Planet Claire'' by the B-52s, and you imagine
Bartlett in a new wave state of mind. At Kenneth Cole's show last
Monday, it was a disco remake of ``Dreams'' by Fleetwood Mac that
lent the collection its hipness.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience entered Gene Meyer's show on Wednesday at the
Public Library, it heard ``It's My Turn,'' then ``I've Never Been
to Me.'' At the finale, it was ``Xanadu'' by Olivia Newton-John.
The cheery schmaltz was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a designer whose colorful neckties and boxer shorts have
been spicing up even the drabbest men's wardrobes for years,
suggested that his latest collection was the result of ``designing
under the influence of St. John's wort.''
</P>
<P>
   The allusion to the trendy mood enhancer _ a sort of herbal
Prozac _ made it clear that he is aware of a world beyond the pages
of W. It added validity to the idea of sequined shirts worn with
chinos and reminded his audience how completely necessary it is for
a designer to pick up a thread of popular culture and weave it into
something of his own. The best shows last week did just that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Years ago, before ``zeitgeist'' became the most overused word in
fashion and television coverage of runway shows became ubiquitous,
menswear week as we know it didn't exist. Twice a year, journalists
would travel to the Westchester County suburb of Rye Brook for a
weekend at the Hilton organized by a trade organization known as
the Men's Fashion Association. Those who attended called it Fashion
Camp, and it was, in all senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, the runway presentations were strictly
Paramus Park: catalog models in commentated shows. But as cheesy as
it all was, the focus was always on the clothes. In retrospect,
that wasn't such a bad thing. Jhane Barnes in a hotel ballroom
wasn't nearly as glamorous as seeing Jackson, the movie star, on
the runway at the Public Library, but it had its merits.
</P>
<P>
   If the clothes are really good, not much more is needed. Ralph
Lauren didn't even attend his menswear still-life presentation last
Thursday _ he was on vacation at his ranch, his hands said _ but it
didn't matter. The clothes looked just fine without him. Likewise,
Donna Karan's showroom walk-through of DKNY Men later that day was
a winner because the clothes looked so good. The hors d'oeuvres
didn't hurt, however.

ADDISON WESLEY TO LAY OFF 375 WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publisher Addison Wesley Longman will lay off about 375
corporate-services employees from its Reading, Mass. headquarters
next March when parent company Pearson PLC completes its
acquisition of Simon &AMP; Schuster's educational publishing business
from Viacom Inc., Addison Wesley officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The combined Simon &AMP; Schuster/Addison Wesley educational
division, to be renamed Pearson Education, will be the largest
educational publishing company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson Education will be headquartered at Simon &AMP; Schuster's
475,000-square-foot facility in Upper Saddle River, N.J. All
Addison Wesley business divisions, including human resources,
orders, and finance, will move to New Jersey, while editorial
positions will remain in the company's Reading and Stoneham
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Reading headquarters' 730 employees were told of the layoffs
Friday morning. The remaining jobs will be transferred to New
Jersey by April 1999, except for the information services division,
which will move later that year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson plans to give laid-off workers severance pay and help
them look for jobs elsewhere in the company's publishing empire,
company spokeswoman Susan Stockman said.
</P>
<P>
   London-based Pearson bought Addison Wesley, which controls 14
percent of the US educational market, in 1988 for $283 million.
</P>
<P>
   The British media conglomerate, which also owns The Financial
Times, The Economist, and several TV operations, agreed to acquire
Simon &AMP; Schuster in May as part of a wave of publishing industry
mergers. After a planned sale of some Simon &AMP; Schuster assets to
Hicks, Must, Tate &AMP; Furst, the transaction is expected to bring in
$3.6 billion for Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is awaiting US regulatory approval; Addison
Wesley &UR;  &LR; chairman and chief executive Peter Jovanovich &UR;  &LR; said he
expects the sale to be finalized later this year. The company has
received requests for more information for an ``expected'' second
round of Department of Justice scrutiny and is cooperating,
according to Pearson spokesman Roy Winnick.
</P>
<P>
   Addison Wesley, founded in 1942 in Cambridge, Mass., moved to
its Reading location in the 1960s. The company has no plans to
abandon its Boston-area locations entirely, according to
Jovanovich.

`POISON PILLS' EXCISED FROM CAMPAIGN REFINANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House reached the threshold of what one
lawmaker called ``the promised land'' of a new campaign finance
system Friday as supporters of a landmark overhaul bill defeated
the last of more than 60 amendments aimed at gutting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul plan, considered a hopeless cause only months ago
amid stern opposition from House Speaker Newt Gingrich, faces a
final vote Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes, it will mark one of the most remarkable
rescues of apparently doomed legislation in the House in recent
years. No major proposal to improve the nation's campaign finance
system has become law in more than a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary accomplishment to have gotten through
this process, which was set up by the Republican leaders to defeat
the bill,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat, who is sponsoring the measure with Representative
Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were rebuffed,'' Meehan said of the GOP leaders, ``and we
are headed toward a showdown on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure would face another uphill battle in the
Senate, where a similar plan died earlier this year when backers
could not muster enough votes to end a Republican filibuster,
supporters hope the plan passes the House by a margin substantial
enough to provide fresh momentum in the Senate. President Clinton
has said he would sign the bill into law if it reaches the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he expects more than 230 members of the 435-member
House to vote for the overhaul plan, just months after he and
Meehan struggled to find enough colleagues to sign a petition that
forced Gingrich to permit a debate on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, Meehan remained cautious. ``We're in a strong
position,'' he said. ``But we need to work over the weekend to make
sure members don't get cold feet, which sometimes happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would ban the unlimited, unregulated contributions
known as ``soft money,'' which were at the center of the most
serious campaign finance abuses in the 1996 elections. Both major
parties are continuing to raise soft money for the 1998 and 2000
elections at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would prohibit independent advertising by
special interest groups before elections unless the organizations
disclosed who provided the money for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Friday, the Shays-Meehan coalition defeated five
amendments that were seen as ``poison pills,'' measures so divisive
they would break apart the coalition supporting the overall
package.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among them was an amendment by Representative Clay Shaw,
a Florida Republican, that would have required House candidates to
raise at least 50 percent of their contributions within their home
states.
</P>
<P>
   Shays-Meehan supporters said that proposal would hurt candidates
in some low-income and minority districts. The measure was
defeated, 253-168.
</P>
<P>
   In another key vote, the House rejected a plan that Shays-Meehan
backers said would have rolled back the so-called ``motor voter''
law by eliminating mail-in registration and requiring prospective
voters to provide proof of citizenship, photo identification, and
Social Security numbers. The measure failed, 260-165.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most difficult challenge facing Shays and Meehan
before the vote on Monday is maintaning the support of most black
and Hispanic House members in their coalition. The minority members
are under intense pressure from 65 groups opposed to an amendment
to Shays-Meehan that would ban contributions from noncitizens who
are legal residents of the United States. The amendment passed
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shays-Meehan bill shuts legal immigrants out of a crucial
part of the political process,'' the groups stated in a letter sent
Thursday to House members.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Shays-Meehan plan is backed by a broad coalition of
groups such as Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, the
measure also has been assailed by organizations such as the
American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association
as an assault on free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, the National Right to Life Committee
plans court challenges to several provisions that would regulate
advocacy aimed at influencing federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy, Shays and Meehan have made numerous
concessions to hold together their coalition. As a consequence, the
final product has left some supporters craving more than the final
bill contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passage of Shays-Meehan addresses loopholes in the
system,'' said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign,
which favors publicly financed elections. ``But it doesn't touch
the underlying concerns the public has about the role of special
interest money and how it dominates candidate fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Shays-Meehan supporters described the package as a solid
compromise. ``It's the best we could do under the circumstances,''
said Representative Steve Horn, a California Republican. ``It's a
major step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Most rank-and-file Republicans have backed Gingrich's efforts to
scuttle the bill, including a rare procedure that created a
legislative free-for-all among every House coalition trying to
improve the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the process, known as ``Queen of the Hill,'' 12
alternative plans, including Shays-Meehan, were to be voted on,
with the measure receiving the most votes prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sponsors of several alternatives have said they
will withdraw their plans if Shays-Meehan passes. The greatest
remaining threat to Shays-Meehan would be a compromise plan by
House freshmen, but even some of the bill's freshmen sponsors have
said they will not cast a vote that kills the Shays-Meehan plan.

   STRIKES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM and UAW Settle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After nearly eight weeks that are expected to cost General
Motors $3 billion in after-tax losses, the auto maker and the
United Automobile Workers union settled strikes at two auto parts
factories in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes had shut down GM assembly plants across North
America, rippled through to suppliers, pushed hundreds of thousands
of workers into temporary unemployment and slowed the nation's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   One worker, Matthew Purzycki, and his wife, Amy, embraced in joy
at the settlement. But it is less labor peace than rapprochement _
it does not directly address issues that the union had declared
were driving the strike, like GM's push to open new factories
overseas or its effort to shrink its American work force through
attrition. Still, the two sides agreed to meet regularly in an
effort to avert future strikes. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   THE ECONOMY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Creeping Wage Inflation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of the tightest peacetime labor markets in memory, wage
inflation is rising. But it is creeping, not galloping. The Labor
Department's employment cost index _ a broad gauge that is closely
watched by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other
policy makers _ rose 0.9 percent this spring, slightly more than
the winter's 0.7 percent increase. ... The gross domestic product
increased at a modest 1.4 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The slackening after a 5.5 percent rate in the first three
months was attributed to losing trade with crisis-ridden Asian
nations and to the prolonged GM strike. ... Sales of new homes
climbed 3.8 percent in June, to an annual rate of 935,000 units,
the fastest pace since record-keeping began in 1963, the Commerce
Department said. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Bouncing Back &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices snapped out of their slump toward the end of the
week, as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed back above 9,000.
But on Friday the skid resumed, with the average ending the week at
8,883.29, down 54.07 points, and more than 450 below its high of
9,337.97, set on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over earnings, the Asian crisis and the White House sex
scandal was cited ... Despite the market's recent choppy
conditions, new and additional issues of stock so far this year are
running high, Securities Data reported. Some 600 common-stock deals
in the first seven months of 1998 brought in domestic proceeds of
about $66.7 billion, surpassed only by the $69.6 billion of
offerings in the comparable period of 1996. &QL;

   William McChesney Martin Jr., who steered an independent course
during 19 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, died at 91. He
had won the respect of five administrations, from that of Harry S.
Truman to Richard M. Nixon. ... Walter A. Forbes, chairman of the
beleaguered Cendant Corp., a direct marketer and franchiser,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The board immediately elected Henry R. Silverman, the company's
chief executive, to the additional post of chairman. ... Ron Carey,
the Teamster president who once seemed destined to clean up one of
the nation's largest but most corrupt unions, was expelled from the
union by a court-appointed review board. It said he failed to stop
an illegal scheme that siphoned more than $750,000 in union money
into his 1996 re-election campaign. &QL;

<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which dominates local telephone business from
Maine to Virginia, agreed to acquire the GTE Corp., the nation's
largest independent local and long-distance company, for $52.9
billion in stock. But stock traders made the deal look more like
the pin that burst the telecommunications stock bubble than a
megamerger.
</P>
<P>
   Most telephone stocks declined, and investors who had bought GTE
shares hoping that they would rise in a takeover saw their price
slide, too. GTE ended the week at $54.44, or $1.32 below Monday's
close of $55.75, while Bell Atlantic fell $45.44. ... AT&AMP;T and

malicious person to send a virus-laden message that could crash a
computer and destroy or even steal data when an attachment was

exploits this vulnerability, security tests have shown that the
flaw exists in three popular e-mail programs, used by perhaps tens
of millions of people around the world: Microsoft's Outlook Express
and Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. The flaw is said to result from
programmers' use of the programming languages C and C(plusplus).

   Japan's banking crisis is far worse than Tokyo has publicly

concluded, with bad debts approaching roughly $1 trillion, or
nearly twice the official estimate. Japanese banks have used
accounting tricks to hide unpaid debts, the foreign experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who has been a fixture in
American-Japanese relations for four decades, agreed to become
Finance Minister, thus landing in the center of the financial
storm. The new estimates suggest that bailing out the Japanese
banks could cost Japanese taxpayers far more than the $214 billion
that Tokyo has set aside. &QL;

Chicago's loop on Thursday, clogging streets and creating a street
festival-type atmosphere during the midday rush hour until three
police officers on horseback herded them to the sidewalk. ``This is
all just for a store opening,'' one officer said. ``Unbelievable.''
. ... Unbelievable? He should have seen the crowds in Connecticut,

a barricade during a clash with Brazilian riot police.

ATTEMPT TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE DIES IN LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A proposal to raise Massachusetts' minimum wage by this
year died a remarkable death Friday night despite broadbased
support after House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran refused to allow the
measure to come up for a vote on the last day of the legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   Both branches of the Democratic-controlled Legislature have
widely supported the idea. Even Acting Governor Paul Cellucci
conceded on the issue, saying working people deserve a break in the
booming economy of an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of all that, the bill boost the rate by 90 cents
per hour remained stuck in committee just as Finneran, the only
outspoken critic to the proposal outside of the business community,
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, as well as Finneran, have said raising the
minimum wage could cause inflation and drive low-cost jobs
out-of-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along we don't think increasing the minimum
wage is a good idea at this time,'' said Rick Lord, executive vice
president for legislative policy at the Associated Industries of
Massachusetts. ``We're certainly pleased the Speaker has decided to
hold the line on those issues and we sincerely do believe there are
other alternatives that should be looked at'' such as increasing
the earned income tax credit to help poor people, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci has been opposed to hiking the minimum wage,
he filed legislation in May to raise it from $5.25 an hour to $6.15
over the next two years, saying the increase was a much-needed
reward for working people.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, had its own plan to boost the wage to
$6.75 an hour over three years. That plan, tacked onto the budget,
got sliced on the cutting room floor by negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci's proposal, the only one left, has been stuck in
House Ways and Means where it remained right up until the stroke of
midnight when the session ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only chance for residents of Massachusetts getting an
increase is to rely on a raise at the federal level, which will set
the floor for wages across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The federal minimum wage is now at $5.15 an hour, but US Senator
Edward M. Kennedy has proposed increasing that to $6.15 an hour
over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he urged Finneran to let minimum wage come up for
a vote, knowing that House members would pass the measure, as would
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran -- who was not available for comment -- has been clear
in his opposition recently, saying Massachusetts should not stick
its neck out and increase the wage, leaving cheaper labor just
beyond the borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the Speaker of the House several times on that. I
told him I think it's important,'' Cellucci said. ``He talked about
his concern that we act alone. The fact of the matter is
Connecticut has just adopted an increase in the minimum wage that
has the exact same figures as the bill I filed. So when you put
Massachusetts and Connecticut together, that's a pretty big piece
of the regional economy of New England,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut increased its minimum wage this year with little
acrimony after years of partisan clashes on the issue. The base pay
there will inch up from $5.18 per hour to $5.65 on Jan. 1. The
second of the two-stage increase will be an additional 50 cents per
hour in the year 2000, pushing the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour
or about $12,000 annually for a 40-hour work week. That state has
the country's highest per-capita income and only about 4 percent of
the work force is paid minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bluestone, professor of political economy at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, sharply disagreed with the
Speaker's argument for staying pat on the issue, especially in a
state with such a high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Finneran's wrong and I'm surprised that a Democrat is
opposing a rise in the minimum wage. The fact is that part of the
reason why we've had a growing economy over the last two-and-a-half
years nationwide is due to the fact that we raised the minimum
wage, which put more money in people's pockets and they went out
and spent it,'' Bluestone said. ``All of the new evidence on the
minimum wage suggests that there is, at most, a very small to no
negative employment effect.''

US RESORTS FAVORED BY CANADIANS FEELING LONELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine _ Once, this was considered the summer
resort town of choice for Quebecers. But the 8,000-person town _ at
a five-hour drive, the closest ocean beach to Montreal -- has seen
a decline in Canadian tourists as the strong US dollar pushes down
Canadians' buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few,'' says Phyllis Kilfoil, owner of the 18-room
Millbrook Motel, which has had fewer than half a dozen Canadian
guests each week this summer. ``The numbers are low, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is high tourist season in the Old Orchard Beach
area, with up to 140,000 people streaming into town on a crowded
Saturday, hotel owners say the Canadians are either staying away or
making shorter trips to Maine. And those Canadians who do come
often try to use the plummeting exchange rate to wring sympathy out
of businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to use it as bargaining power to get the rate down,''
says Mitchell M. Wood, who owns the Americana Motel, right across
the street from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once they've decided to shell out expensive American
dollars for a hotel room, Canadian tourists frequently spend less
on extra amenities, local businespeople say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little more frugal,'' says James E. Harmon,
executive director of the Old Orchard Beach Chamber of Commerce.
``Instead of dining out, they might cook in their room. They go to
matinees instead of evening movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Orchard Beach has tried to capitalize on the strong US
economy by refurbishing the nearly 350-year-old town, adding
fountains and trees and renovating the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really made an investment into the town about six or seven
years ago trying to bring back the American family,'' says Harmon.
``Where we've slacked off in Canadian tourists the Americans have
filled the void.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tourist void is not yet bottomless in Maine. Their
numbers may be shrinking, but Canadians continue to visit the
state. Border crossings into Maine were up in June, according to
the Maine Office of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some local hotel owners say Maine is a deal, compared to
steep vacation prices in Canada's Maritime Provinces. ``The motel
rates up there, they're double my rates,'' says Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   And for some Canadians, the exchange rate may be more a favorite
complaint than a vacation-killer. ``They've been talking about it
for 10 years,'' Rousseau says. ``It gives them some means of
conversation.''

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The swoon of the Canadian dollar has put
a sizzle into the wallets of Americans venturing north of the
border, especially those seeking vacation bargains in
accommodations, entertainment, and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to the radio on the drive up, it seemed as though
the Canadian dollar was hitting another record low with every news
update,'' said Paul Dow of Georgetown, Mass., on a camping trip
with his wife, Maureen, through Prince Edward Island.

it meant our vacation was getting cheaper by the hour,'' he said.

national bird, the common loon, depicted on the country's $1 coin _
is in free fall, plummeting to all-time lows against the greenback.
Right now, the Canadian dollar is worth about .66 cents US, its
lowest level in history. The value is eroding so inexorably that
prognosticators say there is no way of telling where the loonie
will finally flutter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick a bottom,'' said Sal Guatieri, senior economist
with the Bank of Montreal. ``The near-term picture is not very
rosy.''
</P>
<P>
   One often-heard joke asks what do you call Canada's $2 coin?
Answer: An American dollar. But the yucks are sounding hollow as
headlines proclaiming yet another precipitous drop have become
routine front page fare _ another day, another drop. In July, the
loonie closed at seven all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relentless, it's unhealthy,'' said Sherry Cooper,
economist at Nesbitt Burns Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Canada is the victim of Asia's economic woes.
Desperate times in once-booming Pacific Rim nations from Japan to
Indonesia means a drastically shriveled market for natural
resources and other exports on which the Canadian economy is so
reliant. Meanwhile, the economic tremors in Asia have investors
scrambling to put their money into the strongest and safest
currency in the world _ the US dollar _ and selling off secondary
currencies, such as Canada's.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other factors, as well, including long-running
fear that restless Quebec may yet vote to secede from the country
before the end of the century. Additionally, high unemployment
continues to dog most of the 10 provinces despite overall
strengthening of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the news is not all bad for Canada. Exporters benefit
from cheaper Canadian products, for example. Meanwhile, the
country's tourism industry is booming on the back of the drooping
loonie as Americans flock to Canada in search of bargains _ and
Canadians, less and less able to afford vacations in Maine or
California, settle for holidays in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really prefer to spend a week in Vermont and another week
on Cape Cod, as we usually do,'' said Mary Chan of Toronto,
vacationing in Nova Scotia with her husband and two children. ``But
the weak loonie makes New England just too painfully expensive to
enjoy. Even a family lunch break at McDonald's is going to run us
$45'' in equivalent Canadian money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tourist officials say the most startling change brought
by the plunging Canadian dollar is not so much the arrival of more
Americans _ although the numbers of Yanks are up almost everywhere
_ but the hordes of Canadians who feel financially obliged to
vacation in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Canadian visitor totals are up enormously, and that more
reflects the devalued dollar than the arrivals of more Americans,''
said Sharon Martin, manager of inquiries and research for Nova
Scotia's Department of Economic Development and Tourism. ``A lot of
Canadians are choosing Canadian vacations primarily because our
dollar is so weak down in the states. But I think it's rather rare
for an American to say, `Hey, the Canadian dollar is low _ let's
go!' It's more like they find the stronger'' US dollar ``just an
added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion was echoed by most of more than a dozen vacationing
New Englanders interviewed in the Maritime Provinces and Quebec in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came looking for natural beauty, not bargains,'' said
Robert Wilson of Uxbridge, Mass., vacationing in the Maritime
Provinces with wife Elaine. ``It's nice that the our dollar
stretches farther, and some of the savings are a real surprise, but
currency was not a deciding factor. We were just looking for a
lovely place and a relaxed pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the shrunken dollar, Canada is not an across-the-board
shopper's paradise. Nearly all manufactured consumer goods, whether
cameras or chain saws, still cost considerably more in Canada than
in the United States. Gasoline is also more expensive, as is a
bottle of wine or trip to the supermarket. Taxes are stupefying,
with combined federal and provincial sales taxes ranging from 15 to
19 percent. Even taxes are taxed, as in the case of postage.
</P>
<P>
   But the weak Canadian dollar has transformed many of the things
tourists seek into remarkable deals, whether motel rooms, museum
fees, restaurant meals, high-quality handicrafts, or kitschy
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in US dollars, a ticket for a musical at a Prince
Edward Island theater costs $6 while a room at one of
Charlottetown's better hotels can be had for $50. Cheaper but
perfectly decent motel rooms can easily be found for $25 a night.
Luxury hotel rooms in Toronto, Montreal or Halifax can be found for
$120 a night, about half the cost of New York or Boston. It's
possible to play 18 holes of golf at an oceanside course for $20.
Souvenir T-shirts can run as low as $5, while exquisite handmade
quilts can be bought for $250 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same quality of quilt in Pennsylvania would be $500,
easily,'' said Maureen Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Even gambling is cheaper because, hey, if you drop $100 at the
casino in Montreal or Halifax at today's rates it's only a loss of
$66.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar has been slipping for decades. The last time
one Canadian dollar trade for one US dollar was 1976. But it wasn't
until this year that the loonie plunged below the so-called
``psychological barrier'' of US 68 cents, hitherto the lowest level
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has made no effort to ride to the rescue, at least so
far. Indeed, Prime Minister Jean Chretien enraged many citizens
earlier this month when he shrugged off the dollar's decline as
just ``a reality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy is now powerless in Canada,'' Jeoffrey Hall,
market analyst for Boston's Thomson Global Markets, told the Ottawa
Citizen. ``Stick a fork in the Canadian dollar, it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans, Canada's grim reality is cause to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Peterson, a recently graduated law student from Bristol,
Rhode Island, said she and her husband had originally planned to
travel across the US this summer to celebrate their recent
marriage. But a look at the exchange rate changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we'll have basically the same
across-the-prairies-and-over-the-Rockies experience for two-thirds
the cost,'' she said while sipping Moosehead beer at an outdoor
cafe in Montreal's Old City. ``And we're hoping it'll be just as
romantic to stroll beside Vancouver's bay as San Francisco's.''

DEMOCRATS HOST BIG FUND-RAISING EVENT ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It sounds like a dream weekend on Martha's
Vineyard: horseback riding, sailing, golfing, dining, tennis, and
an ``after-hours'' party at the Hot Tin Roof.
</P>
<P>
   But this is business as usual for Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   One year after Democratic senators hob-nobbed with senators at a
controversial Nantucket fund-raiser in the midst of the campaign
finance scandal, only the location has changed. About 100 corporate
representatives and other donors are gathering this weekend on
Martha's Vineyard with perhaps a dozen senators, including John F.
Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, in what has become
one of the sought-after and secretive fund-raising events of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the fun, there are briefings scheduled on politics and
other legislative matters _ though not on the agenda is campaign
finance reform, which died in the Senate this spring though a bill
remains alive in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said the senators were slated to
arrive on the island like most tourists, aboard commercial
aircraft. But party documents obtained by The Globe said that
numerous senators and their families were scheduled to fly aboard
corporate jets supplied by Federal Express, drug company Eli Lilly
and the AFLAC insurance firm _ three companies that have plenty of
business before the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kennedy, one of the Senate leaders on health care
insurance, flew aboard AFLAC's Falcon 50 jet, an aide confirmed.
Robb flew aboard a Gulf Stream II jet supplied by Eli Lilly, a
spokesman said. The Democratic Party reimbursed the companies only
for the equivalent of a first-class commercial ticket, far below
the value of a private flight from Washington. When Democratic
senators last year headed to Nantucket for a nearly identical
event, Kerry actively participated but called it a ``sick'' example
of selling access. But that did not dissuade Kerry from
participating once again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting at Nantucket's White Elephant Resort, the
Democrats are taking over the Harbor View Hotel in Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats aren't the only ones to put on such exclusive events,
of course. Republicans regularly put on similar extravaganzas. But
for the Democrats, the venue of choice has become a mid-summer
weekend on Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The public is not invited, unless they happen to be one of a
select group who has given $20,000 a year to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. The 100 or so donors, whose names
have not been released, are expected to pay a $5,000 installment
while attending the session.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no public announcement of the event. But several
aides said that senators were heading directly from the funeral of
slain US Capitol Police officer Jacob Chestnut to go to the
Martha's Vineyard bash.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's event on Nantucket drew about 200 people who had
given $20,000 each to the DSCC, making it worth $4 million.
Although Kerry helped organize the event and invited donors to his
Nantucket home, he said, ``I think it is sick. Do people get
access? Yes, and I think it is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's comments were not well-received by other senators, some
of whom felt he was being hypocritical for helping to arrange the
event and then criticizing it. Kerry did not return a call Friday
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker, a spokesman for the DSCC, said that about a
dozen senators are expected to attend. Aside from Kerry, the
senators include DSCC chairman Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator
Mary Landrieu of Washington, Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia and
Senator Barbara Boxer. All advocate some form of campaign finance
reform. Other senators are also expected to attend, as well as some
Democratic candidates for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While political fund-raisers are held practically every day in
Washington and around the country, the Martha's Vineyard event is
extraordinary because it provides so much ``face time'' between
senators and donors. They have two to three days together in a
relaxed, social environment, a far cry from the typical Washington
fund-raiser where donors often can do little more than exchange
pleasantries and sit through speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this entry on the Martha's Vineyard schedule, which
advises senators to leave behind their wing-tip shoes: ``Sailing.
Launches will leave the dock...for sailing at 1 p.m. sharp. A
reminder that shoes are not allowed on the deck of these sail
boats.'' As for the late-night party at the Hot Tin Roof, the
schedule notes that ``the final bus will depart at 12:30 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule also calls for some senators to give briefings to
the donors on various issues, including the status of Senate races.
``DSCC vice chairman Senator Bob Torricelli will provide a
political overview and briefing to our guests,'' the schedule says.
</P>
<P>
   While the senators enjoy the Vineyard, President Clinton will be
just down the coast, at the Hamptons _ holding a fund-raiser, of
course.

FOR EUROPE'S MILITARY INDUSTRY, THE MERGERS ARE JUST BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Military industry mergers may be history in the United
States, but in Europe they are very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   France's decision last week to privatize its aerospace giant,
Aerospatiale, shows that the process of sorting out European
aviation and military industries is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   American military companies, by contrast, have evolved into a
few giants, concentrated to the point that Lockheed Martin scrapped
its bid for Northrop Grumman a few weeks ago. The Pentagon said the
merged company would be too powerful, sending the message that
further combinations were not likely.
</P>
<P>
   European military companies, unlike their American counterparts,
remain highly fragmented, with hundreds of small competitors
struggling to pay for expensive research and development, even as
national defense budgets have shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism, European governments slashed
military budgets so much that they collectively equal only about
half the Pentagon's $270-billion allocation.
</P>
<P>
   This is the main reason why Europe wants its aviation and
military industries to group into an enormous conglomerate,
tentatively named the European Aerospace and Defense Company, with
divisions that would include Airbus Industrie, the commercial
aircraft manufacturer, as well as space and defense activities like
military aircraft, missiles and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Airbus has been a resounding success, getting half
the worldwide orders this year for new jetliners despite bitter
competition from its rival, Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Manfred Bischoff, chief executive of Daimler-Benz
Aerospace, said that Airbus, which until now operated as a loose
consortium of four European aircraft manufacturers, would be ready
to start operating as a single company, probably a corporation
under French law, by the first half of next year. The challenge now
is building the rest of the new European aviation and military
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney in London, ``is putting the monster
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to such an undertaking are large. British
Aerospace, privatized in 1981, is one of the most efficient and
profitable companies, while Aerospatiale has a history of
government largess and bureaucratic management.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as industries are merged and duplication eliminated,
jobs will disappear. Deciding who remains employed will be
particularly difficult because Europe's unemployment rate is
roughly double that of the United States'.
</P>
<P>
   For Airbus, the chance to extend its newfound momentum by
tapping financial markets and financing new products, like a
planned jet for more than 500 passengers, depends on its ability to
operate as a single company, with its own management and
bookkeeping. European governments agree. This spring, Bonn warned
Airbus there would be no German government money for the superjet
until Airbus became a unified corporation.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea for a unified aerospace and military company goes
beyond the plans for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Under a grand design proposed earlier this year by Germany,
France and Britain, the big new company would be effectively owned
by the present Airbus partners _ Aerospatiale, Germany's
Daimler-Benz Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA _ plus private investors. Run by a
single management, the company would consist not only of Airbus as
its commercial aircraft arm, but other units for space technology,
military aircraft and helicopters, missiles and weapons systems.
Italy and Sweden, though not part of the Airbus consortium, support
the plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The reasoning is that Europe's military contractors, without the
influence of such a huge group, would wilt against the powerful
American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon that
emerged from five years of consolidation in the U.S.military
industry. Earlier this year, the largest European companies _
British Aerospace, the market leader; Aerospatiale, the No. 2.; and
the No. 3, Daimler-Benz _ ratified the plan.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that plan, the French government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin agreed last week to push the government stake in
Aerospatiale under 50 percent, bring in the big defense and
publishing group, Lagardere, as a private shareholder, and give the
government a ``golden share'' to assure national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The carousel of mergers and acquisitions is now expected to
begin in earnest to form the clusters that will ultimately be the
planned European company's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Daimler-Benz announced that by year-end it will merge
its space activities into Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture
formed last year by Britain's General Electric Co. and Lagardere.
The resulting space contractor, with $2.5 billion of revenues, will
be the world's third largest, after Lockheed Martin and
Boeing-Rockwell. At the same time, Spain announced it would put 25
percent of its national aerospace group, the Airbus partner
Construcciones Aeronauticas, on the block for private investors,
and British Aerospace immediately said it would acquire a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no assurance that the proposed new aerospace
and defense group will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as Daimler and British Aerospace officials praised
the French, they said they were continuing to talk with each other
_ about first choices, like the shape of the new European company,
but also about fallback positions, such as a possible merger of
their own. ``We're always talking with each other,'' said Simon
Raynes, the British Aerospace spokesman. ``All this talking is
really about seeking solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But reports of discussions between the British and the Germans
have raised fears in Paris of a special British-German deal
designed to cut out the French.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Daimler's planned takeover of Chrysler Corp. has
contributed to speculation in France of Daimler's possible
withdrawal from the aerospace business, to focus on automobiles.
Daimler officials have denied that and said earlier this week that
Chrysler could even create aerospace opportunities for Daimler in
the United States.

ECONOMY SLOWS, BUT GROWTH IS STILL HEALTHY

(HLW)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A powerful array of forces at home and abroad
slowed the economy to a modest but still healthy pace during the
second quarter, the government said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said that the nation's gross domestic
product grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate during April, May and
June. It was the most sluggish quarter in three years, and it
marked a substantial slowdown from the blistering pace of growth in
the first quarter, which the department on Friday revised upward to
5.5 percent from its earlier estimate of 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown rattled Wall Street, where investors have become
increasingly nervous about the ability of companies to sustain
strong earnings growth. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
143.66 points to close at 8,883.29. It has fallen more than 450
points or nearly 5 percent since hitting a new high two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But growth in the second quarter was considerably stronger than
had been projected by economists. Many had expected no growth or
even a slight contraction in the nation's total output.
</P>
<P>
   Although considerable uncertainties remain, not least among them
the continued effects of Asia's financial crisis on the United
States, the consensus among analysts is that growth for the rest of
the year should be 2 percent to 3 percent, considered respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the details of Friday's report suggested that the
economy had so far weathered the Asia crisis _ plus the effects of
the now-settled strike against General Motors and a decision by
industry to prune excessively large stockpiles of unsold goods _
without much fundamental damage or any serious risk of recession.
</P>
<P>
   While export-oriented manufacturers and farmers are suffering
from Asia's problems, many of the forces that have driven the
nation's seven-year expansion remained very much intact, especially
strong growth in spending by consumers and businesses within the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that domestic final sales, an indicator of
domestic demand, surged 6.3 percent in the second quarter, compared
with a 6.6 percent gain in the first quarter, as consumers
continued to spend freely and businesses continued to invest in new
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Personal consumption increased 5.8 percent in the quarter, down
just slightly from 6.1 percent in the first three months of the
year. Capital spending by businesses rose 17.8 percent, roughly
half the rate of the previous quarter but still a vibrant pace.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that inflation remains dormant, with
the main price index rising 0.8 percent in the second quarter, down
from 0.9 percent in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has taken a lot and come through it well,'' said
Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities in New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like many economists, Rippe said it is still unclear how strong
growth will be for the rest of the year, and that much depends on
whether the situation in Asia stabilizes. So far, there are some
``very impressive'' signs in the third quarter of continued strong
demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have a clash between weakness in trade and
inventories and on the other hand very vibrant domestic demand,''
Rippe said. ``That clash is likely to continue in the second half
of the year and how it turns out will determine how much momentum
the economy has.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report was a preliminary estimate by the Commerce
Department, and it will almost certainly be revised as new data
come in, although it is impossible to say whether up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials at the White House expressed relief that the
economy, the cornerstone of President Clinton's political support,
continued to show considerable resilience.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Rose Garden, Clinton said that while
``growth in the second quarter of 1998 was more moderate than the
truly remarkable first quarter, it shows that our economy continues
to enjoy steady growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the downturn in growth reflected ``the discernible
effects'' of Asia's crisis, Clinton pressed Japan's new government
to act quickly to deal with its faltering banking system and
invigorate its economy. He also renewed his calls to Congress to
provide new financing to the International Monetary Fund to help
keep the problems in Asia and much of the rest of the developing
world from more deeply wounding the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown seems unlikely to have any immediate effect on the
Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, economists said. The
central bank's most aggressive inflation fighters will continue to
focus on the combination of low unemployment and strong demand,
while another contingent, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's
chairman, seems willing to keep rates unchanged as long as there
are no clear signs of broad-based increases in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter's 1.4 percent growth rate followed six
consecutive quarters in which growth was 3 percent or higher, a
streak that was accompanied by falling unemployment and little or
no inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the slowdown was caused by temporary factors that
are unlikely to persist. Commerce Department economists estimated
that the strike that crippled General Motors subtracted about 1
percentage point from gross domestic product during the second
quarter. Because the strike was not settled until this week, it
will also depress third quarter growth somewhat, but economists
said GM will likely try to make up for lost production, helping to
strengthen growth by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp downturn in exports to Asia and increased competition
from imports took another 2 to 2.5 percentage points off second
quarter growth rates, economists said. Decisions by companies to
reduce production to work off some of the big inventories they had
amassed in the first quarter also reduced growth by around 2
percentage points, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say the inventory adjustment is now largely
complete, removing one impediment to more robust growth. With the
GM strike settled, the big question remains how much of a drag Asia
will have on exports for the rest of the year, with some economists
saying the worst is past and others saying the deterioration will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also think there could be a downturn coming in
consumer demand, which has been fed by the strong stock market, low
unemployment and high levels of consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department report showed that the personal savings
rate plummeted in the second quarter to 0.6 percent from 1.2
percent in the first quarter and 3.5 percent in 1994. Economists at
Chase Securities in New York said in a report on Friday that the
low savings rate could leave many consumers with little financial
cushion if the stock market were to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report from the Commerce Department also included
revisions to economic growth statistics for each of the last three
years, showing that growth from 1995 through 1997 was slightly
higher than previously reported. For 1997, growth was revised up to
3.9 percent from 3.8 percent; for 1996, the revision was to 3.4
percent from 2.8 percent, and for 1995 the change was to 2.3
percent from 2.0 percent.

<P>
   Is Martha Stewart a colonialist tool? An American populist? Or
is she merely a flyspeck on the damask tablecloth of history?
</P>
<P>
   No longer simply a taste maker to millions, a successful
entrepreneur or the subject of chronic parody, Martha Stewart has
become a Text.
</P>
<P>
   Like Madonna a decade ago, Ms. Stewart is today a piping hot
offering on the cultural studies smorgasbord. In the last few
years, about two dozen scholars across the United States and Canada
have trained their gaze on the woman often described as the doyenne
of domesticity. Now, in rigorously footnoted pages, descriptions of
lavender-scented linens rub elbows with Foucault, Lacan and
Gramsci. Proposals for at least three books are making the rounds
of academic publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a wonderful clay to work with,'' said Kyla Wazana,
who recently completed a master's degree in English at the
University of Toronto and is an editor of a planned anthology, ``No
Place Like Home: Cultural Anxiety, Nostalgia and Martha Stewart
Living.'' ``She's open to so many readings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stewart scholars (nearly all women, many of them graduate
students) argue that Ms. Stewart's sheer ubiquity _ her 22 glossy
books on entertaining, gardening and decorating; her magazine,
Martha Stewart Living, with its more than 2 million readers; her
television program; her syndicated newspaper column and daily radio
spot; her Web site; her weekly segment on ``CBS This Morning''; her
line of home furnishings, and her signature catch phrase, ``It's a
good thing'' _ has lodged her in the North American consciousness
too firmly for the academy to ignore. And like taste makers
throughout history, they say, Ms. Stewart is a brilliant mirror of
the longings and anxieties of her age.
</P>
<P>
   Among more traditional academics, the emerging discipline has
provoked predictable dismissals. But the new scholars say that Ms.
Stewart carries more historical weight than meets the eye: a modern
custodian of social norms, she is the latest in a line of
professional household advisers that began with the authors of
women's domestic manuals in the 18th and 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of these early advisers was Mrs. Beeton, whose
book ``Household Management,'' published in England in 1861,
offered such homely advice as ``Menus for a Servants' Hall Dinner
for 12'' and ``How to Select a Wet Nurse.'' In this country,
Catharine Beecher, a sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe, set household
duties within the larger framework of Christian moral obligation,
providing, in ``American Woman's Home'' (1869), chapters on ``Good
Temper in the Housekeeper'' and ``Care of the Homeless, the
Helpless and the Vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides defining women's roles in terms of domestic virtue,
books like these served a larger social function: they helped
foster a collective identity for the newly emerging middle class,
defining its members as distinct from working people. One
19th-century American manual, for instance, offered suggestions for
teaching servants to read, along with the usual cooking and laundry
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not only advice books for those uninitiated in the
arts of the home, the table and decoration; they're prescriptive
texts about social distance,'' said Ann Laura Stoler, a professor
of anthropology, English and women's studies at the University of
Michigan who has written extensively on domestic manuals. ``They
map out cultural distinctions, but they also mark class, gender
and, very importantly, racial differences.''
</P>
<P>
   If the early taste makers helped construct bourgeois identity,
Ms. Stewart (nee Kostyra), the daughter of lower-middle-class
Polish-American parents, is helping to maintain it in today's
anxious age, where social roles are more ambiguous than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represents the parvenu class entering the leisure class,''
said Linda Robertson, a co-director of the media and society
program at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and the editor of
another proposed anthology on Ms. Stewart. ``She's teaching people
who have a desire to emulate or to enter a particular class, not
people who are already confident of their status in that class.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how to interpret Ms. Stewart's cultural prescriptions
is open to vigorous debate. In the introductory essay to their
anthology, ``Martha Stewart's Living: History, Fragmentation and
Late Capitalism's (A)esthetician,'' Ms. Wazana and her co-editor,
Zoe Newman, explore parallels between Ms. Stewart's work and the
psychology of colonialism. Through repeated rituals that center on
cleanliness, nostalgia and setting boundaries, they argue, both Ms.
Stewart and colonialists strive to create a safe haven in a hostile
world, demarcating the imperial ``us'' from the menacing ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave Mother England and you go into the bush and you try
to carve out a place that reflects upper-class English
sensibilities,'' said Ms. Newman, a graduate student in sociology
at the University of Toronto. ``You eat your picnic off china and
crystal in the middle of the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A similar ethos is at work in Ms. Stewart's advice, which holds
out the promise of security through grace, beauty and meticulous
order. An essay in the Newman-Wazana anthology, ``A Look at Linen
Closets: Liminality, Structure and Anti-Structure in Martha Stewart
Living,'' examines Ms. Stewart's rage for organization as
represented in an instructional article in her magazine on
arranging sheets and towels. The author, Ashley Prentice Anderson,
argues that linens are fraught with messy, primitive associations,
which trigger in Ms. Stewart _ and in everyone else _ an urgent
need for control. ``You're born on a sheet and you die on a
sheet,'' said Ms. Anderson, a graduate student in English at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newman also cited recurrent images of fences, hedges and
garden walls as well as an article in the magazine on organizing
basements that portrayed the nether region of the house as a place
of foreboding and disorder. ``I connect that to a need to regulate,
a fear of transgression and the need for clear boundaries,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   By imposing such boundaries, these scholars say, Ms. Stewart
serves to stem unease about race, class and sexuality. ``It's
people of color, it's working-class people'' who are being put at a
distance, said Ms. Newman, who stressed that she was not accusing
the literal, flesh-and-blood Ms. Stewart of racism but rather
examining her work as a symptom of the larger culture.
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars see Ms. Stewart's role as more benign. To Lynda
Goldstein and Virginia Smith, the authors of a planned book,
``Reading Martha Stewart: It's a Good Thing,'' their subject
upholds a tradition of American self-reliance that harks back to
Jefferson and Franklin. ``One of the ways in this country that we
have defined class for 150 years is, `Who does their own
housework?,''' said Ms. Smith, a lecturer in American studies and
English at the Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart does, at least in her public incarnation. Although
viewed as purveying the blue-blood good life, she does not disdain
manual labor, these scholars observe. In a given week she might be
seen on television gathering eggs from her henhouse, mucking around
in a compost heap or banging together a trellis. As a result, Ms.
Smith said, her social role is more complex than it first appears.
``There's a real working-class background and a real manual
dexterity that she's not afraid to weave into her clearly
upper-class presentation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And under Ms. Stewart, the sexual politics of domestic
instruction have been markedly altered, Ms. Robertson said. ``I
don't think she's building her advice about bourgeois taste around
issues of family, or around a woman's role within patriarchy,'' she
said. Instead, she noted, Ms. Stewart focuses on the esthetics of
objects.
</P>
<P>
   There is one point, however, on which Ms. Stewart's diverse
analysts agree: they would never have undertaken their subject if
it weren't also a labor of love. ``We're interacting with her as
consumers as well as critically,'' Ms. Wazana said. ``I made her
avocado soup last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart scholars have already weathered their share of ribbing
in the intellectual press, and a proposal by Ms. Newman and Ms.
Wazana for a special session on Ms. Stewart at the Modern Language
Association's year-end convention was recently turned down. ``It
wasn't well enough focused,'' Phyllis Franklin, the executive
director of the MLA, said in a recent interview. ``There was some
question about what you would learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one person thinks Martha Stewart scholarship is a
good thing. ``I sighed a little sigh of relief that finally
someone, maybe in a kind of overreaction, was taking me a little
seriously,'' Ms. Stewart said recently when asked how it felt to
become an academic discipline. ``Because I fancy myself closer to
that kind of study than to a parody.''

DEMOCRATS HOST BIG FUND-RAISING EVENT ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It sounds like a dream weekend on Martha's
Vineyard: horseback riding, sailing, golfing, dining, tennis, and
an ``after-hours'' party at the Hot Tin Roof.
</P>
<P>
   But this is business as usual for Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   One year after Democratic senators hob-nobbed with senators at a
controversial Nantucket fund-raiser in the midst of the campaign
finance scandal, only the location has changed. About 100 corporate
representatives and other donors are gathering this weekend on
Martha's Vineyard with perhaps a dozen senators, including John F.
Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, in what has become
one of the sought-after and secretive fund-raising events of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the fun, there are briefings scheduled on politics and
other legislative matters _ though not on the agenda is campaign
finance reform, which died in the Senate this spring though a bill
remains alive in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said the senators were slated to
arrive on the island like most tourists, aboard commercial
aircraft. But party documents obtained by The Globe said that
numerous senators and their families were scheduled to fly aboard
corporate jets supplied by Federal Express, drug company Eli Lilly
and the AFLAC insurance firm _ three companies that have plenty of
business before the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kennedy, one of the Senate leaders on health care
insurance, flew aboard AFLAC's Falcon 50 jet, an aide confirmed.
Robb flew aboard a Gulf Stream II jet supplied by Eli Lilly, a
spokesman said. The Democratic Party reimbursed the companies only
for the equivalent of a first-class commercial ticket, far below
the value of a private flight from Washington. When Democratic
senators last year headed to Nantucket for a nearly identical
event, Kerry actively participated but called it a ``sick'' example
of selling access. But that did not dissuade Kerry from
participating once again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting at Nantucket's White Elephant Resort, the
Democrats are taking over the Harbor View Hotel in Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats aren't the only ones to put on such exclusive events,
of course. Republicans regularly put on similar extravaganzas. But
for the Democrats, the venue of choice has become a mid-summer
weekend on Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The public is not invited, unless they happen to be one of a
select group who has given $20,000 a year to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. The 100 or so donors, whose names
have not been released, are expected to pay a $5,000 installment
while attending the session.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no public announcement of the event. But several
aides said that senators were heading directly from the funeral of
slain US Capitol Police officer Jacob Chestnut to go to the
Martha's Vineyard bash.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's event on Nantucket drew about 200 people who had
given $20,000 each to the DSCC, making it worth $4 million.
Although Kerry helped organize the event and invited donors to his
Nantucket home, he said, ``I think it is sick. Do people get
access? Yes, and I think it is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's comments were not well-received by other senators, some
of whom felt he was being hypocritical for helping to arrange the
event and then criticizing it. Kerry did not return a call Friday
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker, a spokesman for the DSCC, said that about a
dozen senators are expected to attend. Aside from Kerry, the
senators include DSCC chairman Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator
Mary Landrieu of Washington, Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia and
Senator Barbara Boxer. All advocate some form of campaign finance
reform. Other senators are also expected to attend, as well as some
Democratic candidates for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While political fund-raisers are held practically every day in
Washington and around the country, the Martha's Vineyard event is
extraordinary because it provides so much ``face time'' between
senators and donors. They have two to three days together in a
relaxed, social environment, a far cry from the typical Washington
fund-raiser where donors often can do little more than exchange
pleasantries and sit through speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this entry on the Martha's Vineyard schedule, which
advises senators to leave behind their wing-tip shoes: ``Sailing.
Launches will leave the dock...for sailing at 1 p.m. sharp. A
reminder that shoes are not allowed on the deck of these sail
boats.'' As for the late-night party at the Hot Tin Roof, the
schedule notes that ``the final bus will depart at 12:30 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule also calls for some senators to give briefings to
the donors on various issues, including the status of Senate races.
``DSCC vice chairman Senator Bob Torricelli will provide a
political overview and briefing to our guests,'' the schedule says.
</P>
<P>
   While the senators enjoy the Vineyard, President Clinton will be
just down the coast, at the Hamptons _ holding a fund-raiser, of
course.

SECOND CAPITOL SHOOTING VICTIM IS BURIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Almost one week to the hour after a gunman
stormed into the US Capitol, killing two guards and wounding a
tourist, police officer Jacob J. Chestnut was buried Friday with
full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   With 4,000 mourners filling every seat in a suburban Maryland
church, Chestnut's daughter, Karen _ one of his five children _
described her father as a private hero before he became a public
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he was this hero of democracy, before a (Capitol
Building) door was named after him, before he was the first African
American to be lain in state, before he was mourned all over the
world, he was neighbor, friend, husband, and to me, he was Daddy,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Chestnut, in his eulogy, said his older brother ``had a
way of bringing people together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call him a hero here _ he's always been my hero,'' he
said. ``I'm 50 years old, and he's always been a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, thousands of police officers from
around the country attended a funeral for a slain Capitol Police
guard. Detective John Michael Gibson, 42, a Waltham, Mass. native,
was buried Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery. And in a repeat
Friday, a miles-long funeral procession crept toward the cemetery,
winding past the Capitol, with police cruisers and motorcycles
displaying American flags and blue ribbons from their antennas.
</P>
<P>
   As with Gibson's funeral on Thursday, spectators lined the route
in silent tribute.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol, dozens of staff members and police remembered
Chestnut and Gibson with 13 seconds of silence at about 3:35 p.m.,
to remember the length of time the shooting lasted a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   After an honor guard fired shots in salute and two buglers
started playing ``Taps,'' Chestnut's widow, Wen-Ling, began to cry.
Capitol Police Chief Gary Albrecht held her hands and tried to
comfort her as he gave her the folded flag that had been draped
over husband's casket.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support, the Gibson family attended Friday's
funeral, and Chestnut's family had attended Thursday's services.
Friday, Gibson's wife, Evelyn, embraced Chestnut's widow after the
ceremony, and they cried together.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, 58, who retired from the Air Force after 20 years and
spent 18 years with the Capitol Police, was buried beneath a cherry
tree in a section the cemetery once known as Freedmen's Village, a
settlement in which freed slaves lived after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators building a case against the man charged with the
attack, Russell E. Weston Jr., say a security camera captured the
scene of Chestnut's killing near the Document Room door on the East
side of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The tape shows the attacker's left hand, gun drawn, and then
Chestnut, who was talking to a tourist, crumbling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, his face hidden by a wide-brimmed hat, then walks
through the metal detector Chestnut manned, and shifts his gun to
his right hand. After a few steps, his body recoils, as if he shot
or was shot at, before the attacker runs out of the picture behind
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was mortally wounded in a gunfight just down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who also was wounded by gunfire, remains hospitalized.
He is charged with killing federal officers, which could result in
the death penalty upon conviction. Weston's family said he has been
diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)

 By ANNE TERGESEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as baseball fans often look at a batter who is in a slump
and say, ``He's due,'' many analysts who follow
small-capitalization stocks are saying they are ready to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has largely been a blue-chip phenomenon, with
stocks of small companies _ those with market values of less than
$1 billion _ sometimes languishing far behind.
</P>
<P>
   And since late April, the gap between large and small has become
a gulf: The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index of big-company
stocks has fallen by less than 1 percent, while the Russell 2000
index of small-company stocks has fallen 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say, a long-term investor with a stomach for the
gyrations of small-cap stocks may find that now is a good time to
think small. They argue that once the impact of Asia's financial
crisis on American corporate earnings becomes clearer _ Abby Joseph
Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs market guru, said she expected that to
happen in ``the next few months'' _ the stage will be set for small
caps to outperform their larger peers, which are more exposed to
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since the second quarter of 1997, small companies on average
have posted superior earnings gains, and that trend is expected to
continue at least for the rest of the year, according to First
Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   And small caps are cheaper relative to large stocks than they
have been since the market downturn of 1990, said Satya Pradhuman,
director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   L. Keith Mullins, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney,
said, ``I would buy some now, because small caps are very difficult
to buy when the tide turns.'' Indeed, with trading volumes slim,
prices tend to rocket when demand rises.
</P>
<P>
   But before jumping into the market, consider this: Because small
companies are less experienced, less diversified and less analyzed
than blue chips, they are riskier investments. Moreover, limited
liquidity can make it very difficult to pull out, should disaster
strike.
</P>
<P>
   If you can tolerate the risk, should you be looking at for value
or growth stocks in the small-cap arena? Two factors suggest the
former. First, value stocks tend to offer greater protection during
selloffs _ something to worry about, given the market's overall
high valuations and recent volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Second, small-cap value stocks have achieved twice the
cumulative return of their growth-stock counterparts from 1979
through June 30 of this year, according to Frank Russell &AMP; Co., a
financial consulting firm in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some small-cap holdings of 5 of the 10 best
small-cap value managers, ranked according to their funds'
five-year records by Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A YOUNG REIT: The top-performing fund, Weitz Hickory, is not
restricted to the small-cap market, but the fund's manager, Richard
F. Lawson, says that is where the bargains are these days.
Specifically, Lawson likes Novastar Financial, a real estate
investment trust in Westwood, Kan., that he says has ``two strikes
against it'' because, as a mortgage REIT and a subprime mortgage
lender, it is in two areas now out of favor with investors.
</P>
<P>
   But with an experienced management team as well as more
conservative accounting standards and lower taxes and costs than
rivals, it should be selling for more than its current nine times
1999 earnings estimates of $2.13 a share, Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Novastar, just one and a half years old, is still in a
start-up phase, costs are likely to fall and earnings are likely to
climb, he said. And what is the fair value of the stock, now at
$16.3125. At least $30, said Lawson, who is so confident that he
has poured 4.1 percent of his fund's assets of more than $300
million into the company, which has a market capitalization of just
$150 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A COMPUTER'S PICK: One of the top 10 holdings of the Barr
Rosenberg U.S. Small Cap fund is First Citizens Bankshares, a
regional bank in Raleigh, N.C., that is trading at $100.25 a share,
or 16 times trailing 12-month earnings. First Citizens, whose
market capitalization recently reached $1 billion, was picked by
Barr Rosenberg's computer models, which look for small companies
trading for less than they are worth, predict which companies are
likely to post higher-than-expected profits over the year and
reject those on which the market has soured.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the model compiles a portfolio that mimics the
sector weightings and risk profile of the Russell 2000, but with a
lower average price-to-earnings ratio, said Floyd Coleman, the
portfolio manager. The fund, with 730 stocks, closed to new
investors in February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A CHOICE IN CHIPS: Bob Perkins now has about 15 percent of his
Berger Small Cap Value fund in an unlikely place: semiconductor,
communication and other growth stocks that have fallen so far they
now resemble value-style investments. One pick is Speedfam
International, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in
Chandler, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which accounts for 2 percent of the fund's $220
million portfolio, is trading at $16.875, or 24 times earnings
estimates for 1999. More important to Perkins, Speedfam offers
various protections: cash on hand equivalent to $9 a share, profits
and a debt-free balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said that the Asian crisis had beaten down many stocks
in this sector, but that he was confident that the turmoil would
subside. As a result, he expects the company to trade at up to 20
times the $2 a share he thinks it can earn in 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RIPE FOR GAINS: In contrast, William B. Gerlach, co-manager of
the $1 billion MAS Small Cap Value Portfolio, offers a more classic
value-style investment: Fresh Del Monte Produce, the
banana-and-pineapple distributor. At $18.75, the stock trades at 11
times its consensus earnings estimate for 1998, a multiple lower
than the company's projected average annualized profit growth of 15
percent this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the rival Dole Food trades at 16 times its 1998
earnings estimates. But Dole's earnings expectations have been
lowered, while estimates for Fresh Del Monte have been raised for
both this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   And Gerlach expects further upward revisions in light of Fresh
Del Monte's announcement on July 22, that it had agreed to acquire
the AIT Group, a company that would add other fruits and vegetables
to Fresh Del Monte's product line. Given Dole's price-to-earnings
ratio, Fresh Del Monte is worth about $23, he added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLEANED AND PRESSED: These days, Peter Larson, manager of the
$320 million Galaxy Small Cap Value fund, is bullish on Unifirst of
Wilmington, Mass., a renter of uniforms for delivery people,
mechanics and others. At $26.1666, the stock trades for about 14
times 1999 earnings estimates, substantially below the multiple of
37 for the industry leader, Cintas.
</P>
<P>
   With forecasts of 15.6 percent earnings growth in 1999, fueled
by small acquisitions, minor price increases and a new, more
efficient distribution center, Unifirst could hit $35 by year-end,
Larson said. Industry consolidation may also help the stock, which
makes up 1.1 percent of Larson's portfolio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no guarantee that either these stocks or
small caps in general will take off. Skeptics note that although a
positive climate has existed for small caps for some time, the
market has not yet rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, history suggests that patient investors will be rewarded.
According to Ibbotson Associates, the research firm in Chicago,
small caps have earned compound annual returns of 12.7 percent
since 1926, versus 11 percent for S&AMP;P 500 stocks. That may sound
like a minor difference, but over time, it adds up: $1 invested in
big stocks 72 years ago is now worth $1,828; the same investment in
small stocks would have grown to $5,520.

COYOTE THAT ATTACKED BOY HAD FRACTURED LEG, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND ABBY FUND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. -- The coyote that mauled a three-year old boy
here was not carrying rabies, but an examination of the animal's
body turned up a possibly important clue as to why the rare attack
occurred, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The coyote's right front leg had been fractured and healed some
time ago, most likely when it was very young. Rob Deblinger, the
state's assistant director for wildlife, said it's possible the
coyote was hit by a car and picked up and nursed back to health by
someone. When a coyote is accustomed to being fed by humans, it is
more likely to attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wildlife specialists confirmed that the number of
coyotes in highly populated areas in eastern Massachusetts is
increasing, and that while attacks are rare, people should avoid
any contact with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the dangers, a pack of coyotes attacked a
dog in Swansea Friday while a neighbor looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the powerball numbers, when I heard an
agonizing yelp,'' said Gina Roberts of Swansea. ``It was horrible,
so I ran to the window, and they were running thru my yard -- it
was a mother coyote and three pups, and Alby (her neighbor's
schnauzer) was in the mouth of one of the pups.
</P>
<P>
   Alby, brutalized and bloodied, survived.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote attacks on pets by coyotes are now common in
Massachusetts, specialists say, and encounters with humans have
become more menacing, though never violent before Wednesday's
attack on three-year-old Daniel Neal, as he played on his backyard
swing set. Neal was rescued by his mother, who kicked and punched
the coyote until it let her son go.
</P>
<P>
   In Hudson, Deblinger said, a young coyote has been bothering a
day-care center, where children often eat lunch outside. When the
coyote shows up, the children rush inside and the coyote jumps the
fence and eats their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellwood of People for Cats, a Falmouth group that
provides shelter for stray cats and helps people find lost cats,
said coyotes have become so prevalent on the Cape and such a danger
to cats that she would be in favor of an extended hunting season or
even a bounty on coyote pelts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds terrible, I know, but it's a means of population
control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote hunting season this year will run from November 2 to
Febrary 27, 1999, but state officials say few animals are killed
because no one is interested in the meat or the pelt. Officials say
there are between 3,000 to 4,000 coyotes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of coyotes in Massachusetts _ and particularly
into its eastern and southern regions _ has been a long time
coming. The animals began migrating to westerm Massachusetts from
the north in the 1940s. The first coyotes were spotted in southern
and eastern Massachusetts in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Langlois, a wildlife biologist with the state Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife, said reports of coyote sightings have been
``steadily increasing,'' with some fluctuations, from 81 in 1990 to
137 in 1996. The slight dip last year, to 105, was due to the fact
that the animals are now so common in some places that people have
stopped reporting them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people, after their third years of seeing coyotes,
who just don't report it anymore,'' Langlois said.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod is the most recent place to attract a large coyote
population, as the animals swam the Cape Cod Canal or walked over
ice floes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Chatham officials hired a federal
sharpshooter to kill two coyotes who had supposedly been plaguing
the town's population of endangered piping plovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only place they don't exist yet is Nantucket and the
Vineyard,'' Langlois said. ``Whatever habitat is available to them,
they'll adapt to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cocca of the Massachusetts Audubon Society in Lincoln
agrees. ``They're in Concord and Lincoln and Weston,'' Cocca said.
``Not in huge numbers, but I'll occasionally get a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes are highly adaptable, and can live off compost piles,
trash bins, or scraps of food left for them by people, wildlife
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Deblinger said his office is hampered in dealing with coyote
complaints because a law passed by voters in 1996 bars the use of
leg-hold traps. He said a trap is much more effective in dealing
with a nuisance coyote than trying to shoot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to hunt them down with a gun, you're never at the right
place at the right time,'' he said. ``So we feel very helpless when
it comes to these sitatutions.''

ELECTION VICTORY FOR PRI SEEMS LIKELY IN VERACRUZ STATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIBAZA, Mexico _ Mexico's ruling party, a beleaguered giant
weighed down by its reputation for fraud, corruption and lies, now
seems poised to win a huge vote of confidence in one of the
country's largest states Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The election results from Veracruz state, the hothouse of
Mexican politics, are expected to demonstrate why, for all its
troubles, the PRI, as the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
is known, is still the most powerful political machine in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 4 million potential voters, the Gulf coast state is
the third most populous region in Mexican politics, after Mexico
City and the surrounding state of Mexico. The party that wins the
Veracruz governor's office will gain a key foothold in the race for
the presidency in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tight national election, Veracruz can be the place where
the result is resolved,'' Sen. Adolfo Aguilar, a leading opposition
politician, said during a recent visit to the state. ``This is
politically the most important election'' of the 10 gubernatorial
contests this year.
</P>
<P>
   The state has traditionally been a stronghold of the PRI, which
has held Mexico's presidency since 1929. But its power has been
challenged here, as it has across Mexico, by the gradual rise of
the right-wing National Action Party and the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party. Between them, the opposition won control of
Mexico's lower house of Congress and the Mexico City mayor's post
last year while taking nearly all of Veracruz's key cities in
municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what has happened here in the months since is a classic
illustration of why Mexico's long-ruling party cannot be counted
out of any election.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the PRI is showing signs of reinvigorating itself,
and opponents charge that the party has returned to some of the
tactics that helped it control Mexican politics for decades _
buying votes and monopolizing the media. It has even called on
well-known entertainers to make campaign pitches at concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the PRI found a way to win the Chihuahua state
governor's race last month _ it conducted its first-ever party
primary to select its candidate and capitalized on his popularity _
the party stamped out the internal fighting in Veracruz that
threatened to scuttle its campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   The party is now firmly behind gubernatorial &UR;  &LR; candidate Miguel
Aleman, and polls show that the multimillionaire businessman and
former senator has built a substantial lead over his nearest rival,
the National Action Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even before securing the nomination, Aleman and his campaign
strategists worked to unify the state party. In one key move, the
Aleman camp persuaded his toughest PRI rival to drop out of the
race, giving him a lucrative job.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, political analysts said, PRI politicians pressured
state authorities to release a former governor, Dante Delgado, from
jail, thereby nullifying any threat posed by the politician and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   In another astute stroke, Aleman's lieutenants enlisted the help
of one of the PRI's most influential old-guard politicos to back
their boss, a decision that brought many of Aleman's potential
opponents into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The party activists in the Aleman camp have cast their lot with
one of the most recognized names in Mexico. In selecting Aleman,
66, the PRI chose not only a politician from one of the nation's
best-known families _ the candidate's father became Mexico's first
civilian president in 1946 _ but also a businessman who has made a
huge fortune through his shareholdings with the Televisa media
empire.
</P>
<P>
   But Aleman owes his success to more than just his name and
fortune. He has shown himself capable of turning around an ailing
state party, a rare skill within the PRI and one that has attracted
the attention of national bosses. Now, many experts and politicians
are mentioning Aleman as a possible presidential candidate in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He denies any interest in running for the nation's top office
but does say that his experience in uniting the state party may be
useful in bringing the fractured national party together behind the
eventual nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical to think that if we can do it in 90 days in a
difficult state that we can do it (nationally),'' Aleman said in an
interview in Orizaba, a small town in the shadow of Mexico's
tallest mountain, Pico de Orizaba. ``If I can help the party, then
I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleman's and the PRI's determination to win Veracruz is evident
in a campaign that experts and opponents say is rife with dirty
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Veracruz, politics works in the same old way it has always
done,'' said Joel Estuvillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute
of Political Studies. ``The state party simply wants to win, and
they are going to try to use whatever resources or mechanisms at
their disposal to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexico has won international praise during the last few
years for making great strides in reducing unfair campaign
practices and electoral fraud, the race here in Veracruz echoes
with shades of classic old-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in past campaigns, opponents accuse the PRI of buying
rural votes with money and food and of spending way above the legal
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman's opponents have also accused Televisa of showing a bias
toward him. They say the photogenic campaigner receives favorable
coverage on the country's highest rated TV news show, while his
opponents are all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Televisa doesn't come to see me,'' complained National
Action's candidate, Luis Pazos. ``Aleman has eight people following
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Aleman denies the charges, he admits that some of
Mexico's best-known entertainers _ all of them under contract to
Televisa _ have given concerts in the state where ``they speak well
of me on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, the son of Aleman's late
business partner, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, and the current head of
Televisa, attended one of Aleman's campaign rallies. Aleman closed
his campaign at a rally and concert attended by thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say those allegations fortify Veracruz's reputation as a
hotbed of politics and show how desperate the PRI is to retain
control of a state that in national elections has historically
provided them with around 10 percent of their total vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veracruz is the most politicized state in Mexico and if Aleman
wins decisively, he is going to be on everyone's short list for the
presidency,'' said George Grayson, author of a guide to this
weekend's election in Veracruz, Aguascalientes and Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is going to be an election that has national
significance, not only because of Veracruz's size, but more so
because a thumping victory will give impetus to Aleman's
presidential prospects,'' he said. ``Veracruz is an important state
in terms of the number of votes that are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys play for keeps.''

 &HT;    A CHILD KILLER IN THE FAMILY
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles,
 &HT;    Wendy Hundley, Lou Grieco
 &HT;    and Rob Modic
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Regina Moreland wanted 10 children, just like her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   She bore only two.
</P>
<P>
   So over the years, she and husband Phillip filled their house
with other kids _ foster, adopted, a developmentally disabled
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Regina also opened her arms to a passel of great-nieces and
nephews who visited the Moreland home at 633 Homewood Ave.
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother at age 39, Regina welcomed all as part of her
abundant and complicated extended family tree _ one that may now be
falling under the weight of its own branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children were her whole wide world,'' said Debbie Marshall,
43, one of Regina's sisters.
</P>
<P>
   But between November and June, four children died while sleeping
at the Moreland home _ three grandchildren, and a great-niece, ages
3 and younger. Montgomery County Coroner James H. Davis has ruled
the deaths homicides by suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect has emerged, but police have not said who it is.
However, family members say police have told them they are focusing
on a child in the Moreland household. It's a revelation that has
split family loyalties between those who want cooperation with
police and those who reject authorities' suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   If authorities build their case against a child, it would be an
unprecedented example of a young serial killer, according to Robert
K. Ressler, a former FBI profiler who started the bureau's
Behavioral Science Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The case has raised grave public concerns and a host of
difficult questions for medical examiners, police, social workers,
juvenile courts and others. Why did so many children die before
authorities ruled the deaths homicides? Could some of the deaths
have been prevented? Could a child have committed the murders? If
so, under what circumstances? How will the justice system respond
if a child is found to have killed?
</P>
<P>
   And will more children die?
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about a tragedy, a murder mystery and a family,
one that is fighting to remain intact in the face of unspeakable
misfortune. A suicide and a car accident have taken two more family
members this year. Children have been removed from their home.
Whatever happens, this broken family portrait will never be whole
again.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Moreland has fiercely defended the children in her house.
Police say Regina has cooperated very little with detectives and
has enlisted her extended family in a battle to discredit police.
She declined to be interviewed for this story and her lawyer,
Anthony VanNoy, was out of town and couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them kids is her babies, regardless of whether they are
adopted or not,'' said Debbie Marshall. ``If they (police) want to
insinuate that (a) child did it, Ginie is going to protect that
child with all her heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Regina's sisters, Tracy Marshall, pinched her nose
shut and covered her mouth to demonstrate the way police showed her
how the children had been suffocated. ``We can't go on what the
police believe,'' said Marshall, 34. ``We are family. We need
facts, some kind of solid proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are attempting to make a scapegoat of a child because
``the coroner himself doesn't really know what happened,'' said
Regina's mother, Cecile Marshall, 60.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, investigators say their evidence would be
circumstantial and hard to prove. There is also no clear motive,
making the case even tougher, said Dayton Police Lt. John Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Police continue to seek evidence. At the same time, some experts
question whether a child in the Moreland household could have
killed four toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have severe doubts about it,'' said Dr. Linda Norton, a
Dallas forensic pathologist who testified in the Waneta Hoyt case,
in which an upstate New York woman was convicted in 1995 of
murdering her five children _ from 1965 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a reporter's query, Norton questioned whether a
child could kill without leaving clear signs of trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Kuehnl, a psychologist in Centerville who is often
called upon to assess young defendants in criminal cases, said the
way the victims were killed _ by stealth at night _ does not seem
like the work of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would suggest willful planning,'' she said. ``Usually
deaths of this nature occur in the throes of family conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchored by Regina and husband Phillip, 42, the Moreland
household appeared stable _ a marriage of 22 years, a network of
aunts, uncles and cousins who seem closer than the typical family.
But domestic violence and financial debt were among the family
travails, police and court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Childrens Services had taken a foster child from the home. And
the Moreland's natural children became teen-age parents. Their son,
Kenyatta Moreland, fathered seven children by age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police are not saying how they arrived at a suspect, though they
have said they had ruled out Regina and Phillip because they were
not present for some of the deaths. Investigators have not
elaborated on where the couple was or who was actually present.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Regina's will to protect her family has slowed
efforts to solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   While one branch of the family tree steadfastly supports Regina,
another branch that she loved and nurtured may have reached the
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Kenyatta, now 23, said he has grown frustrated with his
mother's attitude toward investigators. Two of his children have
died while visiting her home. He said other extended-family members
have the same suspicions as police. ``But they just ain't said it.
Momma don't accept it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers of the dead children also expressed frustration
toward Regina. ``She thinks we're all wrong for thinking this,''
said Paullecia Anderson, whose 3-year-daughter was the third child
to die.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Regina has attended the funerals of six family members
since Nov. 10, when the first child died. Her husband killed
himself on March 6. Days later, her natural daughter, Jamila, 19,
was killed in a car accident. ``She has had no time to grieve,''
her former lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   And authorities have removed her three adopted children, and a
biological granddaughter, to separate foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   A custody hearing is scheduled in Montgomery County Juvenile
Court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A stout woman whose eyes are puffy and ringed with purplish
circles, Regina has railed before television news cameras and
enlisted the NAACP for support in a tireless effort to dispute
police suspicions that a child in her home has killed.
</P>
<P>
   A close-knit family
</P>
<P>
   Regina Moreland began to expand her family shortly after the
Morelands bought the house at 633 Homewood in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Morelands had two children. Kenyatta was born
in 1975 when Regina was 15 and Phillip 18. Three years later,
Jamila was born.
</P>
<P>
   The house on Homewood is in the Five Oaks neighborhood of
renovated homes. Purchased for $26,900, it was nothing fancy, a
1,984-square-foot two-story with four bedrooms, shutters, a
pillared porch and good-sized backyard where children could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regina only had two kids naturally and she wanted 10 kids,''
said Debbie Marshall. ``We all said we were going to have 10 kids,
like momma.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the Morelands adopted one child. By 1991,
when Jamila and Kenyatta were teen-agers, the Morelands became
foster parents and began adopting more children. Also, when
Kenyatta fathered a child at 16, the Morelands took in their
granddaughter, who was developmentally disabled and suffered
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social workers would bring kids in the middle of the night
with nothing, and Ginie would take them,'' said Tracy Marshall,
Regina's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Moreland household totaled eight: three adopted
children, the granddaughter as well as Jamila and Kenyatta, and
mother Regina and father Phillip.
</P>
<P>
   Regina worked as a nurse's aide at Bethany Lutheran Village, a
nursing home. And Phillip worked two jobs: at GM Moraine Truck and
Assembly Division and at USAirways in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, the Morelands went to separate churches. Regina took
the children to Zebulun Missionary Baptist Church, where her clan,
the Marshalls, proudly makes up most of the congregation. Regina's
uncle, the Rev. Willie Marshall, is pastor. Phillip Moreland
worshipped across town at Maranatha Christian Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was fun-loving, caring, dedicated. He would do anything.
If you needed something, he'd do it. He was a very religious man,''
said his brother, Ronald Moreland.
</P>
<P>
   Regina routinely visited her sister, who lives nearby. ``Bigger
families seem to be closer,'' said Debbie Marshall, one of Regina's
nine siblings. ``We're real close. That's all we do is go from each
others' houses. We never went out or nothing _ maybe skating,
wrestling, to the movies. We never been partying people.''
</P>
<P>
   In her extended family and her immediate family, Regina is giver
and taskmaster, a sturdy stalk rooted in nurturing soil, her
siblings said.
</P>
<P>
   Through a divorce that left their mother supporting a large
family on a waitress' wages, the sister whom they affectionately
call ``Ginie'' was there.
</P>
<P>
   When father, Robert Marshall, died in 1989 of a heart attack
brought on by acute cocaine intoxication, Ginie was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were wrong, she flat out told you,'' said her brother,
Otis Marshall, 33. ``Then she would help you out with your problem.
You know what? She was the strongest one in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   When her son Kenyatta's girlfriends were pregnant with nowhere
to go, Regina let them stay at 633 Homewood, the girlfriends said.
On Saturdays, Regina rose early to shop at garage sales for baby
clothes and blankets, they said.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Regina's home, the girlfriends said they
observed a mother in control of her household. The adopted children
were assigned tasks such as hauling laundry to the basement and
helping to care for the developmentally disabled child who still
wore diapers. When chores were executed poorly, Regina instructed
the children to repeat the task. When toddler-aged grandchildren,
great nieces and nephews visited, the adopted children assisted
with care, said mothers of the dead children.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would later say they observed Regina as a loving and
caring mother, attentive to her children and attuned to their
needs. They say the Morelands practiced appropriate discipline and
raised the children to be well-mannered and polite, to say grace
before meals, and to play together harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ginie, known as the family photographer, captured
frame by frame the faces of her family. Each new leaf of the family
tree. Every infant growth spurt. Every new set of front teeth.
``She camcordered everything,'' said Debbie Marshall. And on the
walls of Regina Moreland's house, those portraits chronicle an
intact family _ a smiling husband and wife, a handsome son, a
shyish daughter, plump-cheeked toddlers in ribbons, bows and polka
dots.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, strain within this private family began to
draw the attention of public agencies and authorities, according to
police reports and court documents:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1995, 911 dispatchers received at least 24 calls from 633
Homewood. At least two were calls for seizures. Several others were
for various family problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In March 1995, police and Children Services workers came to
the house after a 7-year-old foster boy who lived with the
Morelands told his teacher that bruises and a bump on his arm and
forehead were caused by his foster mother and father paddling him
and his foster father hurling him against a wall. Corporal
punishment involving foster children is against Children Services
Board policy. The child was removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By June 1995, Children Services had investigated several
reports of problems in the home and stopped placing foster children
with the Morelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some concerns about some of the children in the
home and the care they were receiving,'' spokeswoman Ann Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That same month, police responded to Phillip Moreland's call
for help to control daughter Jamila, who had begun to run away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In July 1996, police were called to 633 Homewood again. Regina
Moreland reported that her husband, Phillip, had punched her right
eye and knocked out her front tooth. Phillip pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor domestic violence and was ordered into counseling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Between November 1994 and April 1996, police were called by
Moreland family members at least seven times for reported vandalism
to family-owned vehicles, a break-in, and a stolen auto.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this, Regina's family tree continued to branch
out.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, daughter Jamila gave birth to Da'Jainae
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   And son Kenyatta, whose first child was already in Regina's
care, had begun a pattern of fathering children out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1996, the year he turned 21, Kenyatta had fathered
seven children by five different mothers who were between the ages
of 15 and 18 when they began having his children. Some had been
pregnant simultaneously, their children born within weeks of one
another: Imari Arielle Moreland was born March 3, 1993. Kenyatta
Le'Shay Moreland was born April 14, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Father Kenyatta's name appears on four of his children's birth
certificates, but he warmly acknowledges each one as his child.
Some of the mothers chose names that begin with the letter K or
that rhyme with Kenyatta, such as Danatta (pronounced Day-not-ta).
</P>
<P>
   A Belmont High School dropout who is employed off and on,
Kenyatta is unable to provide consistent financial support for his
kids, according to two of the mothers of his children. One of them
said she receives some public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Regina's house, portraits of Kenyatta line the living room
walls and shelves, displaying her affection for the wiry son who
grew into a handsome, broad-shouldered man with a penchant for nice
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no one in the extended family took issue with the
number of children Kenyatta had produced. ``A lot of kids run in
our family,'' said Debbie Marshall, Regina's sister. ``When one
person is pregnant in our family, five are pregnant. Ain't nobody
pregnant by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the mothers offered, ``What he does is his business.
I've no feelings about it at all,'' said Paullecia Anderson, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyatta is currently the defendant in three misdemeanor cases:
two for domestic violence and one for criminal damaging. Gina Reid,
25, alleged that he assaulted her on April 28 and May 26, 1997,
according to court files. She obtained two temporary protection
orders against Kenyatta at Dayton Municipal Court. In the criminal
damaging case, Reid alleges that he broke her car windows on Oct.
4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, there were two warrants active for Kenyatta's
arrest, for failing to show up at municipal court hearings
involving those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Moreland's household was also under financial stress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, three companies got judgments against the
Morelands totaling $12,360 after they failed to pay off debt,
according to court records. Regina's weekly paycheck was garnisheed
after she failed to make timely payments on a 40-inch color
television and a stereo she bought in 1996. That same year the
Morelands' car was repossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Husband Phillip was known to be prudent, said his brother Ronald
Moreland. ``Phillip hated debt. He hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such were the circumstances in Regina Moreland's household when
children began to die.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths called ``highly suspicious''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997 Jamila, then 19 and a mother, had settled down
from her days as a runaway to raise her child.
</P>
<P>
   Jamila continued to live with her parents at the house on
Homewood. They were busy caring for their three adopted children
and the developmentally disabled grandchild. But they helped Jamila
and sometimes called on the adopted children to assist with the
baby, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   A slender girl who sometimes sucked her thumb, Jamila was
worried about 1-year-old Da'Jainae Phillips. She had been sick, in
and out of the hospital several months with seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The evening of Monday, Nov. 10, Jamila went upstairs to check
one more time on her sleeping daughter.
</P>
<P>
   She was so still, her chest not rising and falling. She was not
breathing. Jamila screamed, ``My baby,'' and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Regina, a nurse's aide, applied CPR, attempting to revive the
child. Paramedics took her to Children's Medical Center, where she
was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Moreland told police that encephalitis, an inflammation
of the brain, had sent his granddaughter to the hospital in recent
months. At one point, he said, doctors induced a coma to stop
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stevens, spokeswoman for Montgomery County Children
Services, said the
</P>
<P>
   agency had provided some assistance to the family in the summer
of 1997 because of a sick infant, but could not provide any other
details.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner did not suspect foul play in the death.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later on Wednesday, Nov. 13, Da'Jainae's 2-year-old
cousin, Alexus Dashanea Marshall, died at the Moreland house on
Homewood during a family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Shenica Nicole Marshall, had been visiting Aunt
Regina and Uncle Phillip. Ready to leave, Shenica went upstairs and
tugged a coat on her still-sleeping toddler. After leaving the
house, she discovered that the child in her arms was not breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, coroner's officials told the family that the toddler was
likely dead before
</P>
<P>
   her mother left the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montgomery County Regional Crime Laboratory, medical
examiners puzzled over two small bodies wrapped in swaddling. ``Our
suspicions were there immediately,'' said Ken Betz, director of the
crime lab. ``We never came out and said these are natural deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Betz assigned an investigator to research the medical histories
of the two children, who both had histories of pulmonary problems.
</P>
<P>
   Police dispatched fire department officials to test the house
for carbon-monoxide leaks. They found none. Combined Health
District inspectors searched the house for contamination. They
found piles of clothing and debris, cockroach infestation, a sewage
overflow in the basement that had not been properly cleaned up and
concentrations of lead in dust around windows, said Mike Phillips
of the health district. Though roaches can contribute to asthmatic
conditions in young children, overall the inspection found nothing
that would have caused death by asphyxiation, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   And medical examiners asked police questions: Who was in the
house at the time? Where were they? What room was Alexus in?
</P>
<P>
   Shenica, like Jamila, the mother of the first baby to die, was a
young mother barely out of her teens. And, like Jamila, she was
nervous about infant illnesses. Three months before Alexus died,
her 4-month-old brother, Joboury, had been hospitalized at
Children's Medical Center for bleeding pneumonia and pulmonary
hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip and Regina, grandparents and great uncle and aunt to the
two children who had died, believed the deaths were due to natural
causes, pointing to Da'Jainae's hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Moreland household tried to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key and quiet, Phillip Moreland kept his grief and
puzzlement to himself as he read the Bible in his bedroom. He went
back to what he had done for years _ demanding quiet in the
household while he watched The Three Stooges on television _ and
continued to punch the clock on his two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths had shaken the children who had apparently found some
stability in the Moreland home, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were noticeably sad. The grandchild babbled barely
coherent inquiries about dead cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas was coming.
</P>
<P>
   But gifts under the Moreland tree would go unwrapped. Then, at
8:45 a.m. on Christmas Eve, death snatched a third child.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the night at 633 Homewood, Regina's
granddaughter, 3-year-old Danatta Moreland, was found not
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Paullecia Anderson, had known about the other
deaths. But those children were younger and sickly. Danatta was
healthy, known for warbling the latest nursery school tune she had
learned, and calling Kenyatta, ``Dada.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said she knew and trusted the Moreland household, where
she said she had lived during one of her pregnancies. Besides, it
was Christmas Eve. And Anderson's two children by Kenyatta Moreland
had not seen Grandma Regina for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to stay and I went ahead and left them there,''
said Anderson of Danatta and her sister, Kenyatta, 5. ``It was a
last-minute thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Danatta was pronounced dead at Grandview Hospital and Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities acted swiftly. Two deaths could be a tragic
coincidence, but three?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three children don't die like this,'' said Betz of the crime
lab. ``Three children in one house is highly unusual _ highly
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office deferred ruling on the deaths of Da'Jainae
Phillips, 1, on
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10; Alexus Marshall, 2, on Nov. 13; and Danatta Moreland,
3, on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   A conclusion of homicide
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the medical and toxicology reports on Da' Jainae
and Alexus, the crime lab sought expert input before ruling on the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need assistance to make rulings and we don't want to do it
in a vacuum,'' said Betz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy children do not die for no reason, he said. ``The
worst thing we can do is come back to the community and say, 'We
don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   The expert panel included members of the Child Abuse Response
and Evaluation team, prosecutors, police, medical experts _
including a pediatric neuropathologist _ and social service
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what the medical panel studied, Coroner Davis would say
later, is the absence of evidence that could explain how the
children had died. Nothing in heart, lung or brain tissue. Nothing
in toxicology reports. No wounds, no stabs, cuts, broken bones,
bruises or other signs of external or internal trauma, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas pathologist Norton said she doubted a child could kill
the children ``without leaving other signs of blunt trauma on their
bodies. An adult perpetrator can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no problem with Davis' homicide ruling, adding that the
odds were ``astronomical'' that all the children died in the same
household by natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is clear medical evidence that the children
suffocated, Coroner Davis said, ``There are some pathological
findings that are compatible with suffocation and some conclusions
arrived at by (process of ) elimination, but it's a mix of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Betz: ``I don't think we ever went 'Aha! This is a
homicide.' As the medical investigation unveiled itself and the
fact that we had three healthy individuals who died suddenly and
unexpectedly for no medical reasons, the conclusion is it was
homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   But what other clues did the panel of experts study? Did they
zero in on the consistent presence of one or two members of the
household? Did the panel run into difficulty piecing together who
was present when each death occurred, since the Moreland household
appeared to have frequent visitors _ adults and children?
</P>
<P>
   ``We interviewed as many people as we could find _children and
adults _ who were present in all three of the deaths,'' said Betz,
declining to say more about who was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers provided information about family history that
might give indicators or clues to look at, Betz said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, Davis ruled the deaths of Da'Jainae, Alexus and
Danatta homicides by asphyxiation or suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Betz said the three deaths could have been ``gentle homicide,''
done while the children were sleeping. There had been no struggling
and no crying out.
</P>
<P>
   Police announced they would focus their investigation on family
members.''We're looking at everybody, including children,'' said
Lt. John Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Moreland said neither she nor her husband was ever
questioned as a suspect in the deaths of the three children.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners summoned the Morelands to the downtown crime
lab to explain their conclusions. ``After the third death, we laid
it all out for them and gave them an opinion as to who we thought
was responsible,'' Betz said.
</P>
<P>
   Regina rejected the expert conclusions. No child had been killed
at 633 Homewood, she said. Illnesses and medical problems could
explain the children's deaths: Da'Jainae had had encephalitis.
Alexus had had lung problems. While playing, one of the older
adopted children had run into Danatta the day she died. The family
told reporters the coroner's office yielded to public pressure,
ruling the deaths
</P>
<P>
   homicides because it could not explain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just totally disregard it,'' said Cecile Marshall, Regina's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to disregarding Davis' findings, the Morelands have
done much to stifle the investigations into the deaths by not
cooperating, said Huber, noting that victims' families usually are
a source of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other relatives became afraid to talk,'' Huber said. ``It
pretty much puts the investigation into neutral.'' Bad information
has also been a factor. ``We've had to get through a lot of rumors
and innuendo, and that took a lot of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the third death in December, Children Services moved
quickly to remove the three adopted children and the biological
grandchild from the Moreland household to foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Regina and Phillip protested.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Juvenile Judge Michael Murphy granted Regina's
mother, Cecile Marshall, temporary custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Moreland wanted her children back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they took those kids, they took her whole wide world,''
said Debbie Marshall, Regina's sister.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4, in another hearing before Murphy, the Morelands won
the right to unrestricted visits with the children at Grandmother
Marshall's home. A victory, though a small one. No one had been
charged in the deaths of the children.
</P>
<P>
   And Regina was ready for the battle to regain full custody of
all four children. Kenyatta said at that time his father, Phillip,
expressed some reservations about one of the children returning to
the Moreland household.
</P>
<P>
   Paullecia Anderson said she discussed her daughter's death with
Phillip. He was known to sit quietly in his bedroom reading the
Bible, newspapers or magazines. He told Anderson he had been
reading up on suffocation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A suicide
</P>
<P>
   March 5 was a happy day for Regina Moreland. With Judge Murphy's
ruling, she again had at least some access to her adopted children
and grandchild. Regina and Jamila spent the night with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip was alone at the house on Homewood. Regina later told
police she talked to her husband at about 2 a.m. on March 6, all
was as well as could be expected.
</P>
<P>
   When Regina and Jamila returned home later that morning, they
found Phillip Moreland collapsed in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy ain't breathing! ... He's on the couch,'' Jamila
cried to a 911 dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   On the 911 tape, Regina Moreland also can be heard screaming in
the background. Jamila cried: ``My daddy's dead! ... Mama, get my
daddy up, please. I can't move my daddy. I can't move my daddy.''
Finally, she implored the dispatcher: ``Please help me, please help
me!''
</P>
<P>
   By this time the medical examiner's office was familiar with the
Morelands.
</P>
<P>
   When Betz arrived at 633 Homewood, he came upon a sad sight.
Phillip Moreland dead on the couch, a Christmas tree and unopened
gifts nearby, as if the Moreland's lives had been frozen in time
after the death of the third child.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the coroner ruled Phillip Moreland's death a
suicide. He had overdosed on his wife's antidepressant pills.
</P>
<P>
   Burly, quiet Phillip had been the rod and the staff of his
family. ``He held that family together,'' said Betz of the crime
lab, one of several authorities who praised Phillip's handling of a
mysterious and tragic family affair. Now, even if the adopted
children were allowed to return home, they had no father.
</P>
<P>
   An accident
</P>
<P>
   When her father died, Jamila was still grieving over the death
of her own child, who had been the first to die in the Moreland
household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamila was in a shell, a living zombie,'' her Aunt Tracy
Marshall recalled. ``She would look at you, but her mind would be
somewhere else, way off.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after her father's death, Jamila was on her way home
after an evening with friends. Driving her father's Mercury Tracer,
she pulled away from a stop sign on Frytown Road at Ohio 4 in
Jefferson Twp. She failed to yield to a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The truck hit the left side of the car and both vehicles
careened off the west edge of the road. Jamila was taken to Miami
Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Two friends in the
car survived. An autopsy report revealed a small amount of
marijuana in her system, but no alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In the Moreland household, Jamila could be counted on to cheer
everyone up. She would care for the adoptive children while her
mother worked. In one 911 call, Jamila could be heard urging a
child to bring diapers for another child who was suffering a
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide and accident were reported in newspapers, radio and
on television. All now were chronicling the Moreland's saga of
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these seemingly unrelated tragedies have taken their
toll on Regina,'' the family's former lawyer, John Rion, told
reporters after Jamila's death. ``She hasn't had time to grieve.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Too much sorrow
</P>
<P>
   After the deaths of her husband and daughter, Regina went back
one day to the house on Homewood and found herself unable to enter.
Too much sorrow was there. She moved to 4841 Marburn Ave. in
Trotwood with her mother, who had custody of Regina's three adopted
children and a grandchild. Soon after, she moved across the street
from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The court had granted Regina unrestricted rights to visit the
children at her mother's. But on a hot summer night in June,
several children stayed at Regina's to sleep in the air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Kenyatta, was on good terms again with Gina Reid, the
mother of two of his children. With 2-year-old Kelab in tow, she
came to the house late to return a car Kenyatta had lent to her.
</P>
<P>
   She had not planned to stay, she would say later. But Reid fell
asleep in a living room chair. Kelab slept nearby on the floor,
Reid said. At about 3 a.m. she woke up. She glanced over at Kelab,
then touched him.
</P>
<P>
   He had turned blue.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Children's Services clashed with Juvenile
Judge Murphy over whether the Moreland's adopted children should be
removed. Children Services argued they should be placed in foster
care. Murphy countered that they were much older than the children
who had died and therefore not likely to be victims. This time,
Murphy ordered the children into foster care pending a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the death of a fourth child in her home, Regina
attended a large NAACP protest against an alleged incident of
police brutality at a local restaurant. Before television cameras
she railed against detectives. They had mistreated her family, she
said. And they were trying to blame the deaths on a child.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral at the Bibleway Christian Church, Baby Kelab, in
a small, white ruffled coffin stuffed with teddy bears and toys,
looked as if he had fallen happily to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In sweltering midday heat, a procession of young mothers and
children filed past his casket to say goodbye. Children who had
played with the dimpled boy wailed until adults, unable to bear
their gri

HOUSE CAMPAIGN FUNDING BILL SURVIVES KILLER AMENDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Ariz., Ky., Tenn., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A steady majority of the House voted repeatedly
Friday to shield a bipartisan campaign finance bill from a final
onslaught of amendments, making it all but certain that the measure
will win final House passage next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the long, contentious debate over how to regulate
campaign fund raising now predict that the bill sponsored by Reps.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., has enough
support to emerge the winner from a byzantine voting process that
pit their proposal against 11 competing campaign finance plans and
numerous amendment attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout weeks of grueling night debate, Shays and Meehan have
regularly commanded the support of from 36 to 84 Republicans
despite intense opposition by GOP leaders. The vast majority of
Democrats also back the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would effectively ban the unlimited and
unregulated contributions to the political parties _ or soft money
_ which were at the heart of the 1996 campaign abuses. The bill
would also curb issue advocacy commercials by outside groups in
periods before an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We crossed the minefield,'' Shays said Friday, after holding
off the last of the amendments that he said could have fractured
his coalition. ``We can see the promised land. We're not quite
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, the chairman of the House Republicans'
re-election effort, who staunchly opposes the bill, conceded that
the defeat of amendment after amendment showed support for
Shays-Meehan ``looking pretty robust.'' But he said the Senate
would kill the legislation. ``I don't think the Senate will bring
it up,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the leading Senate foe of the bill,
said: ``You're more likely to see Elvis again than to see this bill
pass the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the lead sponsor of the
companion bill in the Senate, sounded doubtful that he would seek
to consider the issue again this year unless he could find the
eight additional votes needed to cut off a filibuster. His own bill
died in the Senate in February when a majority voted for it but
fell short of breaking a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and most rank-and-file Republicans have
fiercely resisted the campaign finance overhaul. They argue that it
unconstitutionally abridges free speech and that it would weaken
the political parties by pushing donors to turn to independent
advocacy groups as they looked for a way around the ban on soft
money. The Republicans have also traditionally raised more money
than the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that the House would not put pressure on the
Senate, House Republican leaders stalled the final vote on the
Shays-Meehan bill until next week, when the Senate will already be
on its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the House, the effort to cut back on money in politics
still faces a few final hurdles. To make it to final passage, the
measure must not just win a majority vote, it must command more
support than nine other competing proposals still standing.
</P>
<P>
   If the Shays-Meehan bill wins a large majority when it is taken
up for a vote Monday night, some of the remaining proposals are
expected to be withdrawn. But the Republican leaders could still
try to assemble a larger majority behind another measure drafted by
a bipartisan group of freshman which has less stringent
restrictions on use of soft money by state parties. Meehan, however
said flatly that they would not have enough votes to trump his own
bill.
</P>
<P>
   With the House set to begin its August recess next Friday
afternoon, it also remains unclear precisely when the final vote on
the issue will be taken. Under questioning on the House floor,
Majority Leader Dick Armey said, ``I don't know how, but we will
have this completed before we leave town.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bill's supporters were still wary about the lack of
a firm schedule. ``I'm concerned about delay,'' said Rep. Zach
Wamp, R-Tenn. ``I've just grown too cynical through this entire
process _ maybe I shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally House Republican leaders tried to dispense with the
campaign finance issue by holding a debate but never allowing the
Shays-Meehan bill to come to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   When that backfired politically, they switched gears and allowed
perhaps the fullest debate the House has seen on any issue. Debate
began May 22 and has taken place intermittently ever since, usually
in the post prime-time hours of the night. The opponents admitted
that they were trying to run out the clock or else attach
amendments to the bill that would drive away supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the amendments defeated Friday were several designed to
push Hispanic and black Democrats away from the Shays-Meehan bill.
One proposal, defeated 261-142, would have prohibited the use of
bilingual voting materials.
</P>
<P>
   Another, defeated 253-160, would have required candidates to
raise at least 50 percent of their contributions within their home
states. Democrats get more of their money from political action
committees than Republicans do, and this change would have made it
harder for them to rely on PACs.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures that were turned back would have tripled the
current limit on how much individuals can donate to candidates,
altered the restriction on issue advertising contained in the bill,
and made it illegal for any individual to collect contributions
from a number of people and turn them over collectively, a practice
known as ``bundling'' that has been conducted with notable
efficiency by Emily's List, a group that promotes the candidacies
of women Democrats who favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   A few amendments did pass with the support of Shays and Meehan,
including one that would soften an amendment that passed earlier
this month to ban contributions by non-citizens who are legal
residents of the United States. The amendment approved Friday would
allow resident aliens serving in the armed forces to make campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thwarted every poison pill,'' said Rep. Sander Levin,
D-Mich.

BOEING PREPARES FOR 1ST FLIGHT OF LONGEST NARROW-BODY COMMERICAL
PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. Friday chalked up two more orders for
its new 757-300 as the company prepared for the first flight Sunday
of the world's longest narrow-body commercial airplane.
</P>
<P>
   That maiden flight will be broadcast live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first live Internet broadcast of the
inaugural flight of a Boeing airplane,'' said Margaret Nomi, deputy
program manager of the 757-300 program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 757-300 customers, our suppliers, Boeing employees and
airplane buffs everywhere will be able to watch as it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet is to take off from Renton Field to the north over Lake
Washington about 10 a.m., though the time could be pushed back by
adverse weather or last-minute technical glitches. The plane will
fly for about three hours, testing various flight systems, before
landing at Boeing Field, where Boeing President Harry Stonecipher
will greet the two pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to watch the event live on the Internet will need
to go to Boeing's Web site at http://www.boeing.com. Viewing
instructions will be posted. To view the Internet broadcast,
computer users will need the RealPlayer plug-in installed on their
browser. Those who do not have the software on their computer can
download it free from Boeing's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has set up a hotline to offer up-to-date information
about the flight. The number is 425-234-4083.
</P>
<P>
   The 757-300 is a derivative of the 757-200, which first flew
Feb. 19, 1982. The development project was launched in September
1996 with an order from Condor Flugdienst, a German charter
carrier. The new model is 178.7 feet long, about 23 feet longer
than the 757-200. The extra length allows it to carry about 20
percent more passengers. It is the longest single-aisle commercial
airplane ever built. Twin-aisle widebody jets built by Boeing and
Airbus are longer.
</P>
<P>
   The 757-300 typically seats about 289 passengers and will be
cheaper to operate than the 757-200, Boeing says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, airlines have placed 17 orders for the new plane,
including two Friday from Arkia Israeli Airlines, based in Tel
Aviv. It also took options for two more planes, making the order
worth about $250 million. The list price of the 757-300 ranges from
$68 to $75 million, though customers typically receive big
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Arkia is the largest charter operator in Israel, and through its
leasing subsidiary owns a fleet of 23 Boeing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capabilities offered in the 757s fit directly into our
plan of expanding our borders and offering more international
charter flights,'' said Arkia President and Chief Executive Officer
Israel Borovich. ``The new airplanes will offer our passengers a
new level of service and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Rolls-Royce engines, the first airplane is scheduled
for delivery to Arkia in the first quarter of 2000.

CLINTON VOWS TO TESTIFY `TRUTHFULLY' ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH
LEWINSKY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton promised Friday to testify
``completely and truthfully'' about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, saying he is eager to put behind him the grand jury
investigation into their alleged affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting publicly for the first time about the Aug. 17
testimony his lawyers tried to avoid, the president said he is
``looking forward'' to the session with independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's prosecutors. The grand jury will be able to watch the
confrontation and ask questions via a closed-circuit television
link.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to get this matter behind us more than I do,
except maybe all the rest of the American people,'' Clinton said.
``I am looking forward to the opportunity, in the next few days, of
testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's agreement to appear before grand jurors did not
quiet his opponents on Capitol Hill, but there was a general
consensus that even a scathing report from Starr would not trigger
impeachment hearings until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks about his upcoming testimony came during a
brief Rose Garden appearance, a session carefully staged to allow
him to exit without having to answer questions shouted by
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the flurry, Clinton held up his hands to the
cacophony. ``Wait, wait, wait, wait! Everybody's got a question.
Let me give you the answer to all of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was ``anxious'' to meet with prosecutors, Clinton made
his vow to tell the truth and finished by saying: ``I hope you can
understand why in the interim I can and should have no further
comment on these matters. Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The president then walked back to his office as reporters again
shouted questions about reports of DNA testing on Lewinsky's dress
and whether he stands by his earlier denials of a sexual
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House aides insisted the president has no plans to
alter his sworn testimony in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit, in which he denied any sexual contact with Lewinsky.
Regarding the allegation that he engaged in a cover-up, aides said
Clinton also will be standing by his public denial of ever urging
anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Until Clinton is put under oath by Starr and his deputies Aug.
17, presidential aides said little more about the scandal would be
coming from the White House. ``There's not much on this matter in
the next 10 days or two weeks,'' said White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president already has met with his private
attorney, David Kendall, and they have begun ``mapping out the
quantity and time'' they will need to prepare for the session in
which he will be linked to the grand jury room by closed-circuit
television. While Clinton, who will have his lawyers present, and
prosecutors will be at the White House, the television link will
allow grand jurors to ask their own questions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday agreed to testify, but only after he had been
served with a subpoena,.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came a day after Lewinsky struck a deal with
Starr to avoid prosecution in exchange for telling the grand jury
that she and Clinton engaged in sex and discussed ways to keep
their relationship secret.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster that account _ which contradicts her sworn statement
in the Jones' case and Clinton's statements so far _ Lewinsky on
Tuesday delivered to prosecutors a blue cocktail dress that she
reportedly wore during a White House tryst with the president. The
dress was undergoing DNA testing by the FBI, which on Friday
reportedly found a discernible stain on the garment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opinion surveys this week found that while two-thirds
of Americans still approve of Clinton's performance as president, a
growing number of people believe he is lying when he denies having
a sexual affair with Lewinsky. In January, half did not believe the
president engaged in sex with the former intern. This week,
two-thirds do not believe the president's denials.
</P>
<P>
   And when Lewinsky's word is pitted against the president's, more
people believe her, according to a Fox News poll conducted
Wednesday and Thursday. The survey of 899 registered voters found
42 percent siding with Lewinsky if she says they had sex, and 31
percent willing to believe Clinton if he denies the affair.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a CNN/Time Magazine survey found 69 percent of
Americans willing to call an end to the matter if Clinton
acknowledges having sex with Lewinsky and discussing ways to keep
their affair secret. Fifty-two percent of the Republicans surveyed
by CNN/Time agreed that acknowledgment of wrongdoing by Clinton
should bring a close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, one Republican senator with White House
ambitions _ John Ashcroft of Missouri _ announced plans to hold
hearings on whether presidents can be subpoenaed, indicted and
prosecuted for violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the Senate floor, Ashcroft said perjury by the
president in the Jones case is ``clearly offensive to the
Constitution and constitutes an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, members of the House Judiciary Committee _ the
panel that would hold impeachment hearings _ signaled that they
would not begin work until after the November elections even if
Starr delivers a report in the next few weeks outlining alleged
crimes against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., who has no election challenge, said he
would be willing to begin studying a report and brief other
lawmakers, but said, ``The real analysis and review would not be
done until after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for any eventuality,'' said Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., whose panel will handle the report
and has already hired extra staff to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Starr announced Friday that he is taking an unpaid
leave of absence from his law firm _ the Washington office of
Chicago-based Kirkland &AMP; Ellis _ to devote his energies to
completing his investigation of the Clinton administration
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been criticized by Democrats for drawing about $1
million in legal fees from private clients while overseeing the
investigation _ which is near the end of its fourth year _ of
Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas, the misuse of FBI files by
White House aides, the death of deputy White House counsel Vince
Foster, and the Lewinsky matter.

THOUSANDS MORE FLEE KOSOVO VILLAGES AFTER SHELLING

<P>
   SEDLARE, Yugoslavia _ Out of sight of the diplomats, foreign
monitors and aid workers there were thousands of new refugees in
the Serbian province of Kosovo on Friday, fleeing attacks just one
day after the government decreed that its military offensive was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling that drove people from this village Friday will not
appear on a monitoring report for Friday night, because monitors
say they didn't know about it. Relief agencies say they did not
note the people who were leaving this valley, because agency
security regulations and police have kept the workers away from the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Faik Drenica was one of the last to leave. On Friday he turned
for a final look at the red brick houses below him in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   He was calm for a moment; then his body trembled a bit. ``We
sent the children away two days ago,'' he said. ``I don't know
where mine are, or my wife. I hope they have been taken in by kind
people. We hoped it would be safe for us here, but we knew better.
Here the regime considers us all terrorists.'' The three villages
in the valley held 20,000 people until Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that there are 50,000 people on the
road, taking refuge with strangers or living in the forests because
of the most recent Serbian government offensive against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. But officials say the number is closer to a
guess than an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the most recent wave of violence, which began last week,
the estimated number of people displaced, both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, was 150,000. The province of approximately 2 million is
90 percent ethnic Albanian. Thousands of those who have fled are
taking refuge in Kosovo, while others have crossed into Albania or
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Slobodan Milosevic sent in troops
and special police five months ago to put down a rebellion by
ethnic Albanians who once had autonomy and are seeking independence
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the government agreed it would not attack civilians
and promised to allow foreign monitors, relief workers and
journalists full access to observe combat areas. However, none of
these promises appear to have been kept.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diplomat assigned to the Kosovo conflict, Christopher
Hill, said that Milosevic promised again Friday to allow foreign
monitors and aid workers access to all areas of Kosovo. On
Thursday, before Friday's shelling, Milosevic told envoys from the
European Union that the Serbian offensive against the Kosovo
separatists was over.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours after the president's declaration, a round of
shells hit a corner bedroom of the squat, two-story home where
Aferdita Qeriqi was sleeping. It killed her outright, villagers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another shell came through the wall of the house next door. It
left a 4-foot hole and sprayed red bricks and window glass in a fan
shape that covered the dishes on the table and stopped at the
cupboards, now open and bare, as the food had been loaded on one of
the wagons going over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few guerrillas of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, the village was deserted. ``The people had no
choice but to leave,'' said a rebel soldier. They took what they
could and they set their animals free so they would not starve.
</P>
<P>
   In front of homes with their doors flung open, a horse and a
pony stood side by side, very close, as if to comfort each other in
the empty village.
</P>
<P>
   Miles up the mountain, two children about 6 years old scampered
across the smooth rocks protruding from a small stream. The
children all but disappeared behind the piles of ivy they carried.
Behind a plastic sheet that covered a hole scraped from the side of
the hill, they laid out the ivy to make beds for their family.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen members of their family are among the recent refugees
from the Suva Reka area who are living in the most primitive
conditions in Kosovo's forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how our ancestors lived hundreds of years ago, but
this is the only safe way for us now,'' said Ahmet Qerizi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Myvete Qerizi, 34, first looked at the three generations she had
to feed, and then at the family's food supply: two large bags of
flour, a few bottles of cooking oil and some salt. ``I suppose we
have enough for a week,'' she said uncertainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' she said,''I haven't had time to worry about the
food yet. The children are still in shock from the shelling; they
think it will happen again, even here. The 11-year-old,'' she said,
pointing to her eldest son, ``screams when he is sleeping, and he
keeps throwing up from the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, who was seeing patients in a thicket, said that he had
treated 14 people for wounds from the shelling. ``First aid is all
we can do here, but there are clinics in the towns nearby where we
can send the seriously wounded or the women who are about to give
birth,'' he said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying
that he had fled with the refugees but that he had relatives in a
town controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to mend the spirits of the refugees in the area was the
local rebel commander, who uses the nom de guerre ``Lion.'' ``It
was not combat that made the people run,'' he said, explaining the
attack as a Serbian government effort to clear the villages. ``I
lost only one soldier, but every village in my area has dead and
injured because of the shelling. We will take care of the civilians
and then go back to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The stream in front of the Qerizis' shelter runs into a creek
and then for several miles past canyons into a small river. Along
the stream and up every canyon were hundreds of primitive campsites
full of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees said another 20,000 thousand people, or more, who fled
the Serbian offensive in the Malisevo area, are living in
neighboring canyons. Monitors and relief workers had puzzled over
the whereabouts of the tide of refugees from the Malisevo area.
Relief workers suspect there are thousands more refugees scraping
by in other isolated parts of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us in these forests will go back home when the
shelling stops, or when they get desperate,'' said Ahmet Qerizi.
``But for me, and others, there is no way back now. We are living
like outlaws and if we go back they will arrest us or kill us. For
us, the only way to go home is as winners in this war.''

NEW ABC PRESIDENT WILL BE HIGHEST-RANKING WOMAN IN THE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC has named Patricia Fili-Krushel, the president of
the network's daytime division, to the position of president of the
ABC Television Network, and increased the duties of that position
to include oversight of ABC's news and entertainment divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The job will make Mrs. Fili-Krushel, 44, the highest-ranking
woman executive in the television business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Iger, the president of ABC Inc., announced the
appointment Friday, citing Mrs. Fili-Krushel's background in both
the programming and business sides of the television industry.
</P>
<P>
   She will succeed Preston Padden, who left as ABC president to
take a position as the chief lobbyist in Washington for ABC's
parent, Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co. Under Padden, the job of president of the
ABC network was narrowed to include mainly the ABC sales and
affiliate relations divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsibilities will remain under Mrs. Fili-Krushel, but
the heads of ABC's news and entertainment divisions, David Westin
and Stuart Bloomberg, will now also report to her. That had been
the structure at ABC before Padden's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   As president of ABC's daytime division, Mrs. Fili-Krushel helped
the network maintain the leading position among female viewers
between 18 and 49 _ the most important audience for daytime
advertisers. She also introduced the program ``The View,'' with
Barbara Walters, one of the few successful new daytime shows in
recent years. Previously, Mrs. Fili-Krushel had been group vice
president of the Lifetime cable channel, where she introduced such
original series as ``The Life and Times of Molly Dodd,'' as well as
original movies.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fili-Krushel, however, played down the significance of her
status as the highest-ranking women executive in television in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that at the Lifetime cable network, where she worked
five years, she participated in that network's switch to an
all-women's programming format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously became sensitive to women's issues while I was at
Lifetime,'' she said. ``And I understand there's a responsibility
to be a certain role model for women in a job like this.''
</P>

<P>
   In the last year, two high-ranking women executives, Kay
Koplovitz, the chairwoman and chief executive of the cable
television company USA Networks &UR;  &LR; Inc., and Geraldine Laybourne,
president of cable television operations for Walt Disney and ABC,
both stepped down from their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at Lifetime, Mrs. Fili-Krushel worked at Time
Warner's HBO, where she was a vice president for business affairs
and production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled that Bob chose to make this a bigger job,'' she
said. ``Programming is what I've done the most and what excites me
the most, but I feel I know both the programming and business sides
and can handle them equally well. I like the combination in this
new job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fili-Krushel said ``there are a lot of challenges ahead,''
citing the problems every broadcast network has faced in recent
years just being profitable. ``When you look at the 10 most
profitable networks and see only one of them, NBC, is a broadcast
network, you have to recognize the difficult time this is for
broadcasters. I had experience on the cable side at Lifetime so I
know how effective the economics are there with a dual revenue
stream.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other big problems Mrs. Fili-Krushel will face in her
new position is dealing with ABC's affiliated stations. The network
has been in tough negotiations with the stations over a proposed
plan to help ABC defray the costs of NFL football games.
</P>
<P>
   A main focus of opposition by the affiliates has been an
experiment ABC is conducting, rerunning several of its daytime soap
operas on cable channels in three test markets around the country.
Mrs. Fili-Krushel has been in charge of that test and acknowledged,
``It's a big bone of contention with affiliates that has to be
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   She also acknowledged that she had no experience on the news
side of the network business and would give Westin ``compete
autonomy'' in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fili-Krushel is part of cross-network marriage. Her
husband, Kenneth Krushel, is a senior vice president in charge of
strategic development for NBC, a unit of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten used to not talking about proprietary things at
home,'' Mrs. Fili-Krushel said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Last fall, as the wave of financial
crises surging through Asia threatened to engulf emerging markets
around the world, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
appeared to be taking swift, decisive action to distance his
country from the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He doubled interest rates to 43 percent, a move intended to
protect the real, Brazil's currency. He announced a package of 51
measures to raise $18 billion in government revenue and to cut
costs, in part by dismissing more than 30,000 civil servants,
freezing public-employee wages and clearing the rosters of dead
pensioners whose survivors, conveniently, failed to notify the
government.
</P>
<P>
   It was months before Cardoso would begin his campaign for
re-election, and Wall Street hailed Brazil's decisiveness at a time
of waffling, mud slinging and excuses from Asian leaders unable to
confront their own countries' structural problems.
</P>
<P>
   But as the October presidential election gets closer, the tough
talk of last year has disappeared, and the promises of civil
service and social security changes that backed the
fiscal-stabilization program four years ago remain half-done.
Though Brazil is still vulnerable to the strains and threats from
emerging markets half a world away, the federal government in
Brasilia has ceased moves to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 51 austerity measures, only those that involved raising
revenue were enacted, while layoffs and other cost-cutting measures
were either watered down or abandoned. Even the crackdown on
fraudulent pensioners has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make up for a series of political gaffes in recent
months, the president renounced some of the measures as
``unnecessary evils'' and instead raised civil service wages at a
cost of more than $400 million this year and an estimated $2
billion in the coming years. He spent more than $5 billion to spur
the construction of low-cost housing, and opened the tap for
billions in agricultural credits.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with polls that showed growing popularity for his
left-of-center rival for the presidency, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,
Cardoso also relaxed the pressure on government agencies to reduce
spending for the rest of the year, saying they could spend money on
the basis of projected, rather than actual revenue. The expected
cost? More than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With official unemployment running at 8.2 percent, sharply
higher than the year before, the president pledged that creating
jobs would be a priority during a second administration, unlike in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've come down off their high horse and seen what the polls
were saying,'' said David Fleischer, a political science professor
at the University of Brasilia, who writes the newsletter Brazil
Focus. Cardoso is again more comfortably ahead in voter surveys,
and most analysts expect him to win the required majority in the
first round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer and others credit the Brazilian president with acting
quickly to contain the effects of the Asian crisis. Wednesday's
auction of Telebras, which brought the government $19 billion for
its controlling stake in the national telecommunications system,
showed investors remain bullish on the country's long-term
prospects. Brazil receives the most direct foreign investment of
any emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts add that Brazil's economic health has suffered with
the president's failure to follow through. In part because of the
sharp increase in interest rates, the budget deficit climbed to 6.7
percent of the gross domestic product, with the deficit for April
nearly 80 percent higher than that for April 1997.

</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the measures were `for the English to see,''' said
Alexandre Barros, an economic consultant, using an expression
dating back to the 1800s, when Brazil, deeply in debt to England,
distracted its creditors by pledging to turn over customs revenue,
which had been falsely inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pledges to outsiders, Barros said, the government
has increased rather than cut spending since November. ``The
government did a lot, but the lot that it did was not enough,
especially with the deficit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Brasilia, Finance Minister Pedro Malan
acknowledged that the austerity measures Cardoso promoted last fall
were ``absolutely essential'' to shoring up Brazil's standing at
the time. Though they were not all carried out, he said, ``we
showed that we were firmly committed to continuing to move forward
with the real.''
</P>
<P>
   With the country's foreign-exchange reserves at nearly $71
billion, after falling to $52 billion when the government was
forced to defend the currency last fall, Malan argued that Brazil
was now ``in a better position,'' and he called a devaluation ``out
of the question.'' The real, which trades within an exchange-rate
band, is selling at 1.163 to the dollar, down from 1.10 last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and financial restructuring effort known here as
the Real Plan began four years ago. It proceeded from policies the
president instituted as finance minister in the preceding
administration, reducing inflation to less than 5 percent this year
from quadruple digits at its worst stage. And it has helped lift
millions of Brazilians out of poverty, in part by broadening access
to credit. Before the effects of the Asian crisis spread, the sales
of cars, appliances and other consumer goods had mushroomed in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan required sharp changes to modernize the economy:
privatizing state industries, removing obstacles to foreign
investment, cutting government payrolls and social security
expenses, and dismantling obstacles to the dismissal of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizations and other revenue-producing measures have taken
off, while more difficult efforts to reduce social security
benefits or civil service rolls have either stalled or been
approved but not yet enacted. Special-interest groups like judges
and politicians have maneuvered to maintain relatively lavish
pensions, for example, making it politically harder to demand
sacrifices from ordinary workers. The last ballot on social
security reform failed by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   David Rothkopf, president of Newmarket Co., an investment firm
in Washington, reflected on Brazil's defeat in the world soccer
finals by France and remarked: ``There is a growing sense that the
World Cup loss might not be the biggest disappointment Brazil faces
this year. They are not looking like they'll be able to deal with
some of the scenarios that might come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Those could include another round of devaluations in Asian
currencies, an eventual collapse in Russia or a ballooning domestic
trade deficit. And because Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay
are linked in a regional alliance known as Mercosur, a devaluation
in Brazil might well have a domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts like Ernest Brown, a senior economist for Latin
America with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who praises the Brazilian
government for strides in privatizing state industries and
reforming government, acknowledge that investors view emerging
markets in general more skeptically. Morgan Stanley forecasts 1.5
percent growth here this year, while others predict no growth. In
July, the investment house lowered its expectations for growth in
1999 to 3.5 percent from 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown blamed the government's ``failure to rein in fiscal red
ink'' for the dimmer forecast. ``From that perspective, they've
certainly come up short in terms of Wall Street's expectations,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting that the jolt Cardoso received from the
polls in June will not alter the direction of Brazil's economics
but will spur him to think more about selling his economic changes
to voters. And as fewer state entities remain to be sold off, this
argument goes, pressure will build for delivering on the promised
reforms in a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's popularity plunged after he publicly called workers
who opposed making the minimum retirement age 65 ``bums.'' A few
months earlier, he derided his countrymen as ``hillbillies.'' The
attacks reinforced a growing perception of presidential arrogance
and insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor start working early and they die early,'' Barros
said. Requiring all Brazilians to work until 65 further
concentrates wealth among the upper classes. ``It's taking the
income from the poor and giving it to the rich,'' he said. ``People
don't know if the government thought about that.''

CORPORATE EARNINGS, HURT BY ASIA CRISIS, DEPRESS SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Share prices dropped sharply Friday, more than
erasing big gains from the prior day, in a sign that investors
remain troubled by unimpressive corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After having largely dismissed the Asian economic crisis,
investors are finally awakening to the effects of a slowdown in the
Pacific region, Wall Street analysts say. That slowdown may
diminish the growth in corporate profits at home, and thereby
stifle stocks for the remainder of 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This prospect has caused several weeks of fluctuating
expectations and volatile trading, pulling the major stock indexes
down from all-time highs set earlier this summer. Many
smaller-company stocks, which have been battered for months, are in
negative territory for the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't pretty,'' Robert Dickey, a technical analyst at
Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis, said. ``We've been in a correction
since April, but the big blue chips are finally joining the rest of
the market, which has been crumbling for weeks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.66 points, or
1.59 percent, to close at 8,883.29. The sharp drop came a day after
the Dow rallied 111.99 points, or 1.3 percent. For the week, the
average fell 54.07 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes were hit harder. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 22.28 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,120.67, and the
Nasdaq composite fell nearly 2.5 percent to close at 1,872.39,
leaving that index about 7 percent below its all-time high of
2,014.25 set July 20. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The swings in trading and sentiment have more than a few
analysts worried about whether stocks can regain the momentum that
has propelled one of the greatest bull markets in history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickey and other analysts say the overriding concern among
investors is corporate earnings. And the growing consensus is that
despite a robust domestic economy, troubles in Asia and rising wage
growth at home are depressing corporate profits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With more than 80 percent of the companies that make up the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 reporting, corporate earnings are up just 1.7
percent from a year ago, according to IBES International, which
tracks earnings estimates. Analysts are lowering their
third-quarter estimates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worries about corporate profits may have been aggravated by a
government report Friday that the nation's gross domestic product
rose at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent in the second quarter.
Although stronger than expected, it was still a sharp slowdown from
the first quarter's 5.5 percent rate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a lot of nervousness out there right now,''
Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset
Management, said. ``People are worried about Asia's impact on
earnings, and this Asia problem is getting worse.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to stocks Friday, bond prices rose slightly, pushing
the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 5.71 percent, from 5.72
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because investors have low inflation expectations, long-term
bond yields have remained in a narrow range for much of the year.
The 30-year bond has hovered between 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent.

MANY CALIFORNIA HMOs LOSING MONEY, SURVEY FINDS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It turns out not all HMOs are the efficient money
machines that members may perceive them to be.
</P>
<P>
   Up to one-third of California HMOs lost money last year,
according to an annual survey released Friday. And even at that
high rate, the state's HMOs fared better than most nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is looking much better than other states, where
it's common to see 55 to 63 percent losing money,'' said Joseph
Coyne, chief executive officer of Healthcare Databank, a
Sonoma-based firm that tracks the health-care industry and
published the report.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs operated by managed-care specialist Foundation Health
Systems Inc. of suburban Woodland Hills emerged at opposite ends of
the spectrum in Healthcare Databank's 1997 report. The company's
Foundation Health HMO was the state's top money-loser -- winding up
$22 million in the red on more than $1 billion in revenue -- while
its Health Net HMO was among the most profitable, the report found.
The two plans were merged earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of challenges in the marketplace right now,''
said Health Net spokesman Ron Yukelson. ``When you look at the cost
of medical services and the cost of delivering care at hospitals,
those are clearly growing. We could wind up running on a 2 percent
profit margin for 1998, which is probably the antithesis of what
consumers and even the medical community think of'' when they
imagine an HMO's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that 1998 will be another tough year for many
players. Last year Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest HMO,
lost $270 million overall but eked out a $9 million profit in
California, according to the Healthcare Databank report. Already in
the first two quarters of 1998, Kaiser has lost $136 million in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross of California parent company WellPoint Health
Networks was another top performer in 1998, but earlier this week
reported a second-quarter net loss after writing off losses from
two money-losing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for another year of losses at many HMOs,'' Coyne
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, PruCare, Woodland Hills-based Prudential
HealthCare's HMO, lost $5.2 million last year, down from $40
million in 1996, but in the first quarter of 1998 posted a $6.4
million profit, its first in the state in five years. Prudential
achieved that turnaround in part by slashing its PruCare work force
by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry has faced shrinking margins for several years,
stemming largely from intense pricing competition as health plans
have fought for market share. Rising drug and care-provider prices
have also hurt profits. In response, many health plans have said
they will raise their 1999 premiums, in some cases by 12 percent or
more, the report said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For stock market investors, great earnings news is no
longer good enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a big reversal from last year at this time, stocks of
companies posting exceptionally positive earnings surprises are
underperforming the market rather than outperforming it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Credit Suisse First Boston, stocks of companies
posting truly upbeat earnings surprises _ those exceeding analysts'
expectations by 10 percent or more _ underperformed the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index by an average 0.6 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the comparable period a year earlier, stocks in companies
with especially good earnings news outperformed the index by 12.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout is intriguing because investors in recent years
have made a killing by buying stocks in companies whose numbers
beat the Street's. This strategy, the dogma of momentum investors
and day-traders, appears to be losing its punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chasing positive earnings surprises has worked only
occasionally over the last few quarters,'' said Christine A.
Callies, the chief investment strategist who did First Boston's
analysis of stock performance after earnings surprises. ``Something
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 84 percent of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported
second-quarter results, 24 percent posted positive surprises. Only
6 percent dropped earnings bombs.
</P>
<P>
   That is strong performance compared with last year's. In the
second quarter of 1997, 28 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 companies
reported positive surprises, while 10 percent came in well under
Wall Street estimates. The First Call Corp., which compiled these
figures, considers a surprise to be 5 percent above or below the
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, the car rental
company, with $850 million in sales. On Wednesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, almost 9
percent above analysts' expectations. Revenue grew 6.7 percent from
the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar Thrifty's stock drifted down 25 cents a share on
Wednesday, to $14.25. The shares ended last week at $13.875, down
4.3 percent on the better-than-expected earnings news.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have been reacting to a statement by Dollar
Thrifty's chairman, Joseph E. Cappy, that rental revenues in the
company's Florida operations had been weaker than expected. If so,
they were ignoring Cappy's comment that the company was seeing
improved pricing trends in the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the market may just be weakening over all. But if
investors are fleeing stocks of companies issuing great earnings
reports, several theories may explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are either becoming more distrustful of companies
reporting positive surprises or worried about the complexity of the
Asian situation,'' Ms. Callies said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may also be acting on their increasing suspicions that
much of the analysis coming out of Wall Street is superficial at
best. Or they may suspect that some of the companies reporting
earnings surprises may in fact have orchestrated them by guiding
analysts lower in their estimates earlier in the quarter. That way
the company has a better chance of beating expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sky-high stock prices may make investors nervous; good
news is as good a reason as any to take profits.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, chasing upbeat earnings news is a deal less
profitable than it once was.

CLINTON PROMISES COMPLETE TRUTH IN LEWINSKY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Friday that he would
testify ``completely and truthfully'' in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation on Aug. 17 but said that until then he would have no
public comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief remarks on the subject that has consumed
Washington for the past week came as FBI crime-laboratory
technicians began examining a navy cocktail dress that Ms. Lewinsky
gave prosecutors on Wednesday and which she told them contains a
stain that could provide evidence of a sexual encounter with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony will be transmitted live to grand
jurors on closed-circuit television, allowing the jurors the
opportunity to question him, according to an individual with
knowledge of the agreement. The interactive arrangement met a
central condition that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, set
in exchange for withdrawing a July 17 subpoena to compel the
president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Starr announced that he was taking an indefinite
unpaid leave of absence from the Chicago law firm of Kirkland &AMP;
Ellis to complete his inquiry. Starr, a former solicitor general
and federal judge, had come under criticism for making nearly $1
million a year from the firm to represent such clients as General
Motors Corp. and Meineke Discount Muffler at the same time that he
was conducting a publicly funded investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, responding to a cacophony of shouted questions about
the Lewinsky matter at a Rose Garden appearance Friday, held up
both hands and said, ``Wait, wait, wait, wait.'' Clinton has said
nothing on the subject since Ms. Lewinsky reached a deal with
prosecutors on Tuesday giving her immunity from prosecution in
exchange for testimony about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a question,'' the president said, smiling,
after delivering a statement on the domestic economy and before
departing for the Hamptons in New York for a weekend of fund
raising, golf and socializing. ``Well, let me give you the answer
to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``No one wants to get this matter behind us more
than I do, except maybe all the rest of the American people. I am
looking forward to the opportunity, in the next few days, of
testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully. I am anxious to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I hope you can understand why in the
interim I can and should have no further comment on these matters.
Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer announced on Wednesday that he would provide
videotaped testimony for grand jurors on Aug. 17, after months of
resisting Starr's requests that he answer questions on the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and advisers had been deeply split over
whether Clinton should subject himself to the risk of answering
grand jury questions in an inquiry in which he is the potential
target. But all agreed that Clinton should not speak publicly about
the matter before he gave his testimony, according to senior White
House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky spent much of the day with prosecutors from the
independent counsel's office, who are continuing to prepare for her
appearance before the grand jury. She is expected to meet with
prosecutors over the weekend as well. No date has been set for her
questioning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's attorneys will spend the next two weeks assessing
Starr's case against the president and trying to anticipate
questions Clinton might face. While Clinton plans to maintain an
ordinary schedule of official activities over the next two weeks,
he has set aside the entire weekend before the Aug. 17 testimony
for preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had not completed its initial examination of Ms.
Lewinsky's dress by day's end, according to Angela Bell, a bureau
spokeswoman. She said that a determination about whether there was
a stain containing semen or any other identifiable material would
not be made until Monday at the earliest. And she said the
information would be given to the independent counsel's office and
not disclosed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a semen stain, it would take ``several weeks'' to
identify or eliminate any individual as the source, Ms. Bell said,
although experts on DNA testing said that the matching could be
done in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials would not comment on whether Clinton would
voluntarily supply saliva or blood samples for DNA matching.
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement late Friday announcing that he would
drop his private law practice to devote full time to the
presidential investigation. White House officials have harshly
criticized Starr for continuing to represent private clients while
overseeing the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my appointment, my duties as independent counsel have
been my top priority,'' Starr said. ``I have said that I would
fulfill my obligations to my private clients and I have done so. At
this critical stage of our work, I am taking an unpaid leave of
absence from my law firm until I complete my public duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Yannucci, the firm's managing partner, said that Starr is
currently in ``no position'' to represent private clients.
</P>
<P>
   He said the indefinite leave was at Starr's request with the
expectation that he will return to work full time after the
investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Told that some Clinton allies were spreading the word that the
firm had nudged Starr out, or at least was glad to see him go,
Yannucci said, ``I'm not surprised, but that's completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. John Ashcroft, a conservative Missouri
Republican and a possible presidential candidate in 2000, said he
would conduct hearings during the August recess on legal and
constitutional questions arising from the investigation. He said he
would explore whether the president is subject to ordinary criminal
prosecution while in office, or must first be impeached and
convicted by Congress.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Guess I'm a little bit of a throwback,'' said John D.
Laupheimer Jr., 41, lead manager of Massachusetts Investors Trust.
``I wear three-button suits and bow ties. I'm a pretty conservative
fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be appropriate, for his mutual fund is the nation's
oldest, having started in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Laupheimer is the conservator of a tradition that is
palpable at the Boston headquarters of the fund's adviser, MFS
Investment Management. Lining the hall outside his 25th-floor
office are a dozen portraits of past managers of the fund, and
downstairs is a ledger listing its original investments, in
businesses like Nash Motors and the Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Laupheimer what earns a stock a place in the portfolio
today, and his answer, in an age of technical analysis and
quantitative screening, seems something of a throwback, too: its
people. ``The real key to great companies is operating
management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the savvy of corporate chieftains is just one way that
Laupheimer judges the worthiness of companies as investments for
MIT, as the fund is known. For example, he looks for low-volatility
stocks, a policy that insures that the fund's beta _ a key measure
of volatility _ remains well below that of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   This means that stocks in the $9.2 billion portfolio tend to
rise and fall less than the market does, a trait appreciated by
conservative investors.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer's vigilance has helped MIT remain one of the top
funds in its category since February 1993, when he was named lead
manager. For the five years ended July 24, the fund has returned
22.9 percent, annualized, compared with an average of 19.6 percent
for all large-capitalization blend funds, which buy large-company
stocks that have either value or growth characteristics, according
to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer works with two co-managers and the MFS staff of more
than 30 analysts. He manages a subportfolio that currently accounts
for 60 percent of the fund's assets. The two co-managers, Kevin R.
Parke and Mitchell D. Dynan, pick subportfolios that account for 20
percent each of the assets, although they overlap on 60 percent of
their picks.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Laupheimer's tenure, the managers defined a list of
investment disciplines intended to help insure quality and to
control risk.
</P>
<P>
   One is the rule that the portfolio's volatility should always be
lower than that of the S&AMP;P 500. Another is that the dividend yield
of the portfolio must be at least 90 percent of that of the S&AMP;P
500, reflecting Laupheimer's view that low-dividend stocks are
often companies lacking adequate cash flow. But interestingly for a
manager who seeks safety, he also steers away from high-dividend
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing off their cash to shareholders in large
amounts because they can't think of anything better to do with it,
so their internal growth rates tend to be fairly slow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio's ratio of share prices to earnings is generally
about 10 percent below that of the S&AMP;P, which is currently at 27.6.
</P>
<P>
   This caution has helped returns in past market downturns. In the
last bear market, from May through October of 1990, MIT fell 11.63
percent, versus a drop of 14.69 percent in the S&AMP;P, according to
CDA/Wiesenberger, a fund-tracking service based in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   As for his current choices, Laupheimer says he has found a
first-rate corporate captain in Steven A. Burd, chief executive of
Safeway Inc., the Western supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to him, you know that he knows the dynamics of
his business, really almost store by store, certainly region by
region,'' Laupheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Safeway as chief executive in 1993, Burd has
raised operating profit margins from below 5 percent to nearly 9
percent while reducing merchandise prices, Laupheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Safeway strategy is to expand by buying other supermarket
companies and then to improve their operating margins by applying
Safeway's standards in areas like coupon strategy, cleanliness,
staffing and labor relations, Laupheimer said. He predicted that
earnings would grow 18 percent annually for the next two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Over about two years of buying Safeway stock, Laupheimer said,
the fund has paid an average of about $22 a share. The stock now
trades at $44.75; he expects it to hit $50 in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer also likes Washington Mutual, the Seattle-based
savings and loan company with a market capitalization of about $17
billion. He ranks its management, headed by Kerry K. Killinger, the
chief executive, in the same league as Safeway's.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual has diversified from a regional institution
and expanded aggressively by buying big savings and loans. And
Killinger achieves big cost savings by consolidating staff and
management after mergers, Laupheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Washington Mutual had great potential as a takeover
target for a national bank but that it also had strong growth
potential on its own. He saw its stock as attractively valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a company selling for 12 times next year's earnings,
growing their earnings at 13 to 15 percent, and I don't care
whether they get bought out or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer said he has been buying the bank's stock for about a
year at an average cost of $42 a share; it now trades at $39.9375.
``I don't see why this can't be a $60 stock in a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer said Alcatel Alsthom, the European supplier of
telecommunications equipment, has also flourished under top-notch
leadership. Serge Tchuruk became chairman and chief executive in
1995 after heading European blue chips like Total, the French oil
company, and Rhone-Poulenc, the drug giant.
</P>
<P>
   Laupheimer said the chiefs of French companies were often
disappointing ``because they never manage to get the costs under
control'' but that Tchuruk had succeeded in such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The European telecommunications equipment business has lagged
behind its American counterpart, which has boomed with increases in
telephone and fax-machine use, data transmission and Internet
traffic. But Laupheimer said he was optimistic about Alcatel
because it was ``just entering the sweet spot of that growth curve
in Europe'' and because ``the management of this company has a real
track record of providing shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel stock, available as American depository shares, sells
for about 22 times next year's earnings, which Laupheimer sees as
cheap compared with similar American stocks. ``We think it's got a
growth rate of 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying shares last year; the average cost has been
$31. The stock now trades at $39.375 and Laupheimer estimates that
it will hit $60 in 12 months.

DOES A ROACH MOTEL HAVE 5-STAR POTENTIAL?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC HUBLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many value investors say their goal is to buy ``unloved''
stocks. Now an analyst with the challenge of covering an often
unloved sector _ biotechnology _ suggests going a step further,
seeking bargains among stocks that are not merely unloved, but
downright loathed.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Silverman of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens follows
genomics companies, a group within the biotechnology sector that
has had more than its share of unsuccessful initial public
offerings of late.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for this. ``When investors feel there's too
much product _ too many IPOs _ the market window closes and the
market for these stocks just dries up,'' Ms. Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is a very capital-intensive industry, so you always
have companies that need capital,'' she said. ``It just becomes a
supply-and-demand function that investors can only invest in so
many of these companies in any space of time. And when that number
gets to be too big, the capital tap, if you will, is shut off.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the stocks can fall from their initial offering
price and become so thinly traded that the Street calls them
``roach motels'' _ investors can get in, but they can't get out.
The stocks are sucked down, and big investors don't want the shares
because they are likely to be difficult to sell.
</P>
<P>
   A stock is considered a roach motel when average daily trading
volume slips below 40,000 shares, not counting the quarter just
after the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ms. Silverman mused, what happens if the surrounding
neighborhood gentrifies? Can a roach motel become, say, the
Waldorf-Astoria? Going back five years, Ms. Silverman says she has
found stocks that accomplished just that _ leaving roach motel
status by climbing 50 percent or more above their offering price.
She detailed her findings in a recent report: ``Why We Love
So-Called `Roach Motel' Stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reminder for all of us to look at history and remind
ourselves that there are stocks that didn't look like they would be
very good stocks that ended up being excellent stocks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not explicitly spelled out in the report, however, is that to
find 11 successful escapes from roach motels, she had to canvas
more than 100 stocks. Hardly inspiring odds.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Ms. Silverman singled out Gene Logic, which was
taken public at $8 a share in November 1997 and has gone as high as
$10.125, but now drifts around $6. Volume surged to 1.6 million
shares the day it hit its high, but only 25,000 shares generally
change hands daily.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverman likes Gene Logic for the usual reasons: good
management, good product pipeline, good contracts in place. ``We
think this `roach' of today is destined to be a star of tomorrow,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (The information at the end of the report notes that Robertson
Stephens was in the syndicate that brought Gene Logic public.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, Ms. Silverman says, is to identify 1998 IPOs that may
become roach motels. Although it is still early, she advises
keeping an eye on Combichem, which uses computers to discover new
drugs, and Transgene, a French gene therapy company.
</P>
<P>
   (Robertson Stephens helped underwrite Transgene, too, according
to the report.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, like emptying a roach motel, this type of investing is
best suited to those with strong stomachs. Ms. Silverman says the
average residency of her success stories in roach motel status is
seven quarters, and one took as long as 16 quarters to check out
and subsequently prosper.
</P>
<P>
   She writes that ``we don't think this is too bad,'' given the
nature of biotechnology investing, but it may lead investors to ask
whether they really want to park their money in a class of stocks
that often turn out to be, well, sticky.

MAPPING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo will be sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)  
 (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For investors, the tectonic shifts in the telecommunications
industry in recent years have come not from fundamental changes in
the business _ as numerous as they have been _ but from corporate
mergers, alliances and spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was no exception. The biggest phone companies in the
United States and Britain, AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications,
last Sunday unveiled a $10 billion venture to serve multinational
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Bell Atlantic the nation's No. 1 local
communications company, announced a $52.9 billion agreement to
merge with GTE, a big local and long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Mahoney, a big fan of European stocks and wireless
companies, has managed the $1.7 billion AIM Global
Telecommunications fund for more than five years, shared his
insights on the business. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)What are the main thoughts that investors should take
away from last week's flurry of telecommunications news,
particularly the merger agreement between Bell Atlantic and
GTE?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably the main thing they should look at is the
consolidation that's going on in the industry. We've been talking
about it for a long time. It's finally coming to pass. We're going
to see this continuing at the top tier of telecommunications in the
U.S., and, I think, globally as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)How should investors approach that process?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Bell Atlantic-GTE deal showed you don't necessarily make
immediate money in a takeover, but we should also remember that the
structure of the U.S. industry is somewhat inefficient. It's a lot
like the banking industry, where for regulatory reasons, a
historical accident, you end up with a number of organizations
where a smaller number would be more efficient. And that's good for
investors because the industry has a lot of opportunity to increase
efficiencies and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these companies have more corporate overhead than they
need. How many people are on the legal and regulatory staffs of
Bell Atlantic and GTE? I wouldn't be surprised if there are 1,000
highly paid white-collar people working on legal and regulatory
issues. If they're each making $100,000, which is conservative,
that's $100 million. They're talking about $2 billion in cost
synergies for Bell Atlantic and GTE, and that's pretty reasonable.
So you may see quicker earnings growth for the combined company
than you would see from them separately.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)More generally, which particular segments of the
telecommunications market are attractive?(end itallics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Our belief is that wireless remains the fastest-growing
engine in the telecom business. I would always be looking at
wireless for both services and equipment. On the wire-line side,
enhanced services, basically data services, are certainly the
fastest-growing. We thought Worldcom's data business would grow by
about 60 percent in the last quarter, and it grew by 75.
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)Why is wireless so attractive?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fundamentally, I believe ultimately that people will cut the
wire. I don't see the reason for wire-line phones for voice
service. If the price was the same, I don't see why anyone would
have a wire-line phone. I think they would just put something in
their pocket and carry it around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)But haven't wireless stocks suffered recently?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They have. Part of that is AT&AMP;T's new Digital One Rate plan,
which is aimed at Nextel. But if you take a look at European
wireless, where they have the technical problems worked out and
everyone is on the same system, they have been great.
</P>
<P>
   The ones that come to mind are Telecom Italia Mobile and
Mannesmann, which is our largest single position; Vodafone and
Orange in the U.K., then the Nordic wireless stocks, like Netcom
and Europolitan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)In the United States, one of the concerns has been
that with five and six wireless competitors in some markets, it's
hard for anyone to make any money.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The U.S. has some things to work out. I don't think the U.S.
is as attractive as Europe right now, but I think you'll end up
with three to four stable national carriers here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)Over all, what percentage of the fund have you
invested in Europe?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. About 40. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.(italics)If Germany's Mannesmann is your single best idea,
what do you think is overrated? What do you not own, and why
not?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't own Sprint. Even though I like the Sprint wireless
business, I think the stock is very aggressively valued now, and
that's partly on takeover speculation. It might happen, but it
might not happen for a long time. One of the companies that people
thought could acquire Sprint was GTE, and that's not going to
happen any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

are best positioned?(end italics) &QL;

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Worldcom-MCI is clearly the best-positioned carrier in the
world right now, but AT&AMP;T-BT is right there with them. The problem
is that AT&AMP;T-BT hasn't been put together yet. &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have an organization that doesn't have a clear ``buck
stops here.'' I don't believe in dictators, but I believe there has
to be a single person who bears ultimate responsibility. If two
people think they are each running the show, they will start to
focus on battling each other instead of on growing the business. &QL;

telecommunications equipment stocks?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would say Nokia is the best place to be and Alcatel just a
bit behind. Nokia, obviously, because of their wireless business;
the reason I like Alcatel is that it's a big restructuring story,
and there is a lot of leverage there going forward.

 U.S. WARNING, OR SORTS, ABOUT FEES AND 401(K)s   (af)  
 By ABBY SHULTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidden by the dazzling returns of many 401(k)s in recent years
are the costs of running these plans _ everything from investment
management and record-keeping fees to the expense of maintaining a
toll-free phone line for customer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The costs, which can climb to more than 2 percent of assets, can
add up to big dollars in lost retirement savings, but plan
participants are often left in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Labor Department wants to shed light on the subject. It
has begun by releasing a 17-page booklet describing the range of
fees levied on 401(k)s. The booklet also discusses the higher costs
of actively-managed funds, versus passive ones, and tells
participants that ``brand name'' mutual funds that are sold to
individual investors typically charge higher fees than accounts
that are separately managed for an employer's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet, ``A Look at 401(k) Plan Fees,'' is part of a
broader examination of plan fees that the department will conclude
in the fall and that could irk employers and plan providers.
</P>
<P>
   The department is studying whether 401(k) savings are being
eroded by excess or undisclosed fees, whether companies are meeting
their legal responsibilities in choosing and monitoring 401(k)
service providers and whether participants are being informed about
the effect of fees on their investment results, said Meredith
Miller, deputy assistant secretary in the department's Pension and
Welfare Benefits Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there's a lot of competition among service providers,
the market is pretty inefficient,'' Ms. Miller said. ``They are
competing not on the basis of cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But the information provided in the booklet is hardly
groundbreaking. The booklet, for example, advises plan participants
to ``make informed investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And some suggestions are recurrent: Can't calculate your fees?
Ask the plan administrator. Have questions regarding rates of
returns? Ask the plan administrator. More questions about your
401(k)? Ask the plan adminstrator. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the 401(k) fees can be confusing. And there is
no doubt that informing people about the role they play in building
wealth over time is worthwile.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the booklet describes two hypothetical people, each
with 35 years until retirement and $25,000 in a 401(k) account.
Each employee averages an investment return of 7 percent a year and
makes no additional contributions to the plan. One person pay fees
and expenses averaging 0.05 percent a year and ends up with
$227,000 at retirement. The second pays fees and expenses averaging
1.5 percent a year and ends up with only $163,000. So a 1 percent
difference in fees adds up to $64,000 by retirement day.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet goes on to explain the different types of fees. Plan
administration fees, like legal costs or daily valuation services,
rise with the number of services offered, and typically are paid by
the company. But the Labor Department has found that companies are
increasingly shifting these costs to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we thought participants should have an
understanding of it,'' Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Most fees charged to a 401(k) plan go toward investment
management _ the cost of managing money, whether invested in mutual
funds or separate accounts run by a money manager. These costs are
deducted from the returns of the 401(k) participants and in effect
are an indirect charge against their account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your net total return is your return after these fees have
been deducted,'' the booklet states. ``For this reason, these fees,
which are not specifically identified on statements of investments,
may not be immediately apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   The booklet does a good job of raising the fee issue, said David
E. Morse, a partner at the law firm of Whitman, Breed, Abbott &AMP;
Morgan in New York, but he believes that most employees will not
understand much of the text. The terminology is too technical and
requires too much prior knowledge of 401(k) plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A paragraph on ``surrender and transfer charges,'' for example,
describes them as ``fees an insurance company may charge when an
employer terminates a contract (in other words, withdraws the
plan's investment) before the term of the contract expires or if
you withdraw an amount from the contract.'' Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my clients have trouble getting their employees to read
something that's two pages long when they are talking about
investments,'' Morse said. ``To get them to read something this
dense on fees is an impossible task.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed in the
month since its release, through the Labor Department's Internet
site (www.dol.gov/dol/pwba) and through a toll-free hot line (800
998-7542), Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   David Castellani, senior vice president for retirement and
investment services at the Cigna Corp., the insurance giant, said
the booklet would at least give administrators of 401(k) plans the
tools to talk about fees with their participants. But he also
thought this first effort fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the average participant has a fair and deep
understanding of what they pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ms. Miller said, is the reason for her department's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complicated area,'' she said. ``What we did is take
a cut at a simplified explanation. It's our hope workers can get
more concise information from their employers.'' In other words,
ask the plan administrator.

 &HT;    Sexual predator returns to Ohio town
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- In late June, a 20-year-old Sidney man,
classified by a judge as a sexual predator, returned to town after
serving a year in prison for corruption of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   In most places in Ohio, deputies would have notified neighbors
about his criminal record. They also would have informed nearby
schools, day care centers, and children's services agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen in Sidney.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals that governs Shelby County and the rest of
northwest Ohio has ruled that parts of the sexual predator law are
unconstitutional. That means the sheriff's department can't notify
anybody about felons who were convicted before the law took effect
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got our opinions on the law, but I have to go by
what the prosecutor and courts decide,'' said Sheriff Mark
Schemmel.
</P>
<P>
   The episode illustrates the uncertainty still surrounding the
predator law's authority over incarcerated sex offenders. The
situation is so murky that some criminals, considered predators by
the prison system, may be able to escape the label for good.
</P>
<P>
   When the law took effect at the start of 1997, it pertained not
only to people who would be convicted in the future, but also to
those already incarcerated. Defense attorneys called that
retroactive punishment _ prohibited by Ohio law _ and immediately
challenged the provision in court.
</P>
<P>
   State prisons nonetheless began screening hundreds of inmates,
trying to determine who met the profile of a predator. They
forwarded the names to local judges, who were supposed to hold
hearings and make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the law was in dispute, most counties started
hearings immediately. Montgomery County, which hired a staffer in
the probation department to do nothing but sexual predator work,
has held more than 130 so far.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami County, though, judges in the Court of Common Pleas
decided to delay hearings until the 2nd District Court of Appeals
ruled on the issue. That didn't occur until March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, at least three men prison officials believed
were predators _ they had sexually abused children in their care _
were released.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe those men will be able to avoid the predator tag
for good. David Berenson, director of Sex Offender Services for the
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said that ``it is
my understanding that if a guy has been released from prison and a
sexual predator hearing hasn't been held, (then) they cannot hold
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been backed up by the Court of Appeals in Franklin
County. In March, it erased the predator status of a former
Catholic priest who admitted having sexual contact with an
11-year-old boy. The judges ruled that the man had not received
proper notice of his hearing before he was released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Miami County Judge Robert J. Lindeman said he would hold the
hearings anyway and let the appeals courts sort it out.
</P>
<P>
   The predator problems are different in Shelby, Logan, Mercer and
Auglaize counties. The appeals court overseeing that area has ruled
the predator law should not apply to those convicted before it took
effect.
</P>
<P>
   That means those counties can't notify anybody about released
convicts who were tried before Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Supreme Court is deliberating on the appellate judges'
decision. It heard arguments in June and could decide at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Until it does, prosecutors such as Mercer County's Paul Howell
must wait. He said the county has three sex offenders who were
jailed before the law began, but none has been released yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some counties say they've had a relatively easy time
with the law. Warren County Prosecutor Tim Oliver said his office
handled a glut of inmate hearings just after the ordinance took
effect, paused until the appeals court in Middletown upheld it,
then began again.
</P>
<P>
   The county has held about 45 hearings, he said, and as far as he
knows, no one has slipped through the cracks. 1 Offenders and
predators
</P>
<P>
   While Miami Valley counties have held dozens of sexual predator
hearings, only a few have actually gained that status. All
convicted sex offenders in Ohio must register with local sheriff's
departments when they get out of prison. But those whom judges find
to be predators must have their names, addresses and photographs
distributed to neighbors and nearby schools and day care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Greene County _17 offenders, 1 predator
</P>
<P>
   Miami County _22 offenders, 0 predators
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County _102 offenders, 7 predators
</P>
<P>
   Preble County _ 4 offenders, 0 predators
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County _ 8 offenders, 0 predators
</P>
<P>
   Warren County _ 7 offenders, 0 predators

JAPAN'S NEW CHIEF VOWS TO ACT ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ On his first day as Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi
once again tried to reassure the world that he would move swiftly
to address Japan's economic problems, hiring a new adviser whose
stature as a financial heavyweight rivals those of many in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement Friday that the unemployment rate climbed
to a record 4.3 percent in June while the yen hovered at below 144
to the dollar, Obuchi admitted his naivete regarding economic
matters but told reporters that there is no ``superman'' who can
single-handedly pull the country out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tackle this problem boldly and speedily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his pledge to abandon the austere fiscal policy
that many blame for hampering economic recovery, saying he would
finance a $42 billion tax cut to boost spending by issuing
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   He trotted out his oft-stated hopes of completing a peace treaty
with Moscow and repeated a pledge to put together a $70 million
supplementary budget to pump up the economy.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior official in the prime minister's office said Friday
night that the new government is ready to deal out the tough love
needed to fix the faltering banking system. ``We have to be
prepared to suffer some bankruptcies,'' he said. ``Some bad banks
are going down.''
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi said little that he has not said before, he
surprised the public by announcing at a news conference that he had
chosen Toyoo Gyohten, a legendary Japanese financier known for
candidness and a tough negotiating style, as special adviser to his
Cabinet, and more specifically, to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and his advisers are tentatively trying their hand at
spin control, having suffered, among other indignities, an
unscientific television poll that showed his popularity to be
dramatically lower than two rivals for the nation's top job.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry official disclosed that he had asked the
Philippine president, Joseph Estrada, a former actor known for
playing a tough guy in B movies, to teach him a few things about
popular appeal when Estrada called to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   And Obuchi is considering using Japan's vaunted rail system _
the debts of which will be one of the many headaches he has to deal
with _ to make weekend forays into the heart of the country to hear
what his new spokesman described as ``views, opinions and grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gyohten's appointment is meant to assure foreign investors and
world leaders that Obuchi, who is regarded as somewhat of a
financial novice, is serious about fixing Japan's sick banking
system and pulling its economy out of the worst slump in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gyohten earned the respect of luminaries like Paul Volcker, the
Federal Reserve Board chairman during the Reagan administration,
and Karl Otto Poehl, a former Bundesbank president, for holding his
and Japan's own in Western-style negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He has represented Japan at both the International Monetary Fund
and the Asian Development Bank. And he was a leading participant in
negotiations that led to the 1985 agreement by the Group of Seven
nations to end the dollar's supremacy and boost the value of the
yen. The accord, which was expected to curb the rise of Japanese
economic power, seriously backfired.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the accord was signed, Institutional Investor
wrote in a profile of Gyohten that ``for all his storied
internationalism and open-mindedness, Toyoo Gyohten may well be the
most formidable Japanese adversary the West has ever faced in the
financial arena.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another effort at spin control Friday, Obuchi introduced his
newly named deputy press secretary, Akitaka Saiki.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Saiki began to do his job, making some surprising
statements and then backtracking on them almost to the point of
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Obuchi does not intend to stay in power too long,'' Saiki
said at one point. ``That is another indication of his strong will
to do something good for the nation, good for the region and for
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said he thought that Obuchi would survive in the job
longer than many people believe he will.
</P>
<P>
   Saiki also said Obuchi did not have much time to bail out the
economy before the opposition and the public start calling for his
head.
</P>
<P>
   But he nonetheless cautioned against a quick turnaround in the
country's fortunes. ``We should not be thinking things will be
looking brightly in the next two or three months,'' he said,
speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   Saiki offered another word of caution. ``Of course, it is an LDP
government,'' he said, referring to the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, ``so things aren't going to change that
dramatically.''

A REMEDY FOR THE ROOTLESSNESS OF MODERN SUBURBAN LIFE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Md.) (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attacks on suburbia are as old as cul-de-sacs. Suburbs have
always been derided as bourgeois, consumerist and conformist. But
now they have become the enemy of family values, too. That's right.
Karl Zinsmeister, editor of the conservative magazine The American
Enterprise, has written that ``suburbia is actually a fairly
radical social experiment,'' one that can be linked to ``the
disappearance of family time, the weakening of generational links
... the anonymity of community life, the rise of radical feminism,
the decline of civic action, the tyrannical dominance of TV and pop
culture over leisure time.''
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done?
</P>
<P>
   A group of architects and planners who have named themselves the
Congress for the New Urbanism have vowed to halt the spread of
faceless, car-centered suburbs by promoting friendly,
people-centered towns with corner stores and public greens.
</P>
<P>
   They call for some old-fashioned things: walkable neighborhoods
with a mix of residences, businesses and public places, straight
and narrow streets, wide sidewalks and no cul de sacs. They believe
houses should be built close enough together and close enough to
the sidewalks to define streets and public squares. Above all, they
want strong town centers and clear town boundaries. No one, they
believe, should live more than a five-minute walk from most of
their errands. (Otherwise, what's to stop people from getting in
their cars and driving?) And like their British counterpart, the
Urban Villages Group _ architects whom Prince Charles supports _
they want to preserve old towns and cities through ``infill,''
building on abandoned or unused urban lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can be opposed to those principles,'' said Alex
Krieger, a professor of urban design at Harvard University. They
are like ``mom and apple pie,'' he said. Yet many new-urban towns
have been scorned as cutesy, regressive and un-urban. The new
urbanists, some say, should be called the ``new suburbanists,''
because they are less interested in planning principles than in
porches, picket fences and gabled roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Seaside, designed in the early 1980s by Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk
and Andres Duany, two of the founders of new urbanism, is the
oldest new- urban town. Built on a stretch of the Florida
panhandle, Seaside was meant to foster community life and beach
access. The houses _ a pastiche of historical styles in pastel
colors _ are set close to one another and connected by straight
brick streets and a network of sand walkways cutting through the
middle of each block. When the town is finished, it is supposed to
have 350 houses and 300 apartments, a school, an open-air market, a
town hall, a tennis club, an amphitheater, a post office, and a
number of shops, offices and beach pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble picturing it, think of the idyllic town
in the movie ``The Truman Show.'' That was no movie set. That was
Seaside.
</P>
<P>
   Since Seaside was built, new urbanism has won a lot of fans and
building contracts. There are dozens of new-urban towns and
projects built or under construction, including Celebration in
Florida, Laguna West in California, and Kentlands in Maryland. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development is renovating some of
its public housing according to new urbanist principles: more
porches, more fences, lower buildings, narrower streets. Jane
Jacobs, the author of ``The Death and Life of Great American
Cities,'' has praised the movement as ``sound'' and ``promising.''
And publications from The Sierra Club Yodeler to The American
Enterprise have smiled on the new urbanists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is their particular vision of urbanization an innovative
model appropriate to the 21st century,'' Michelle Thompson-Fawcett
asked in the journal Urban Design International, ``or is it
regressive nostalgia?''
</P>
<P>
   New urbanism is, by definition, nostalgic. Towns built on a
human scale, with strong centers and clear edges, have been around
for 5,000 years, said Robert Davis, the developer of Seaside and
the chairman of the new-urban congress. It is only in the last 50
years, with the rise of modernism, he said, that we have forgotten
how to build them.
</P>
<P>
   The new urbanists want to induce neighborliness with
architecture. In this sense they are utopian. Like the modernist
master planners of the 1930s, they believe social change can be
created through architecture and planning. The difference is that
most of them hate modernism.
</P>
<P>
   While the modernists ``tried to get to the future by destroying
the past,'' as Robert Fishman, the author of ``Bourgeois Utopias,''
said, the new urbanists ``are reviving the past in order to
change'' the present. That, the new urbanists think, is why many
architecture schools view them with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools of architecture are ``so in the grips of the
modernist ideology and so defensive of the avant-garde that they
see the Congress for the New Urbanism as fundamentally
conservative,'' said Daniel Solomon, a founder of the movement.
Peter Katz, the author of ``The New Urbanism: Toward an
Architecture of Community,'' said the most powerful architects,
particularly those in New York, ``laugh at the poor souls who live
in suburbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Frampton, an architecture professor at Columbia University,
agrees that many architecture schools (though he excludes Columbia)
have ignored some questions about land settlement patterns. But
what bothers most professors about the new urbanists, he says , is
not their critique of suburbia or land settlement. It is their
design ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to look for the demon that destroyed Main Street
in America,'' Frampton said, ``it is not the modern movement but
the American bureaucracy that opened the way for freeways and
suburbanization.'' The railroads were deliberately undermined by
the automobile industry, he said, adding, ``That was an economic, a
capitalist, operation,'' not an architectural one.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   New urbanism has not attacked the root of the problem
sufficiently, suggested Alex Marshall, who has often written about
new urbanism for Metropolis magazine. ``What new urbanism tries to
do is imitate older communities that existed before the
automobile'' without getting rid of the automobile. But if you want
to return to these older forms of life, he said, you ``have to
bring back the transportation system.'' If you simply change the
way houses are built, he added, ``it's like changing hemlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-urbanist charter says nothing explicit about what styles
are acceptable. Yet because many new urbanists believe modernism
ruined American cities, nearly all of their designs rely heavily on
building styles from the past. Kentlands in Maryland is full of
Georgian houses. Celebration, Disney's village in Florida, is full
of brand new Victorians and Colonials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's upsetting'' about new urbanism, said Frampton, ``is
that the imagery is so retrograde.'' It is based on a ``sentimental
iconography'' as if there were something inherently good about
Victorians, Georgians and Colonials and something inherently bad
about modernism. To be fair, there were a lot of modernists in the
1930s who advocated low-rise, high density housing, he said.
Besides, the kind of modernism that the new urbanists see as their
enemy is a straw man. No one is advocating tearing down whole
cities to make way for skyscrapers. New urbanists like to see
themselves as radicals, said Krieger, who was once a supporter of
the movement and is now a critic. But, he added, they are ``no
longer the radical fringe but conventional wisdom.'' Developers
have begun using the term new urbanism to sell their projects.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the movement hasn't had a good effect, Krieger
said. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has dedicated
$2.6 billion to ``Hope Six,'' a nationwide plan to rebuild
mid-century public housing according to new urbanist principles.
From Boston to Cleveland to Helena, Mont., high-rise projects are
being replaced by town houses with porches and fences. ``That is
the part of the movement that most impresses me,'' said Krieger.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Marshall noted, is that most new-urban developments
are not urban at all. They are rich developments on the town's
edge. ``They are sprawl under another name.'' And they are as
restrictive as any suburban development, he said. Most are
privately run by homeowners' associations that give developers
extraordinary control.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Celebration, Disney's new-urban town, the deed
restrictions specify what kind of drapery, roofing tiles and
political signs are allowed. ``Disney has a history of making warm
and fuzzy dog movies,'' said Evan McKenzie, the author of
``Privatopia,'' a book on housing associations, but ``they can take
your dog if it makes too much noise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the people are saying, `Who needs democracy? It's
utopia already!' '' said McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   People are looking for hominess and safety and they don't mind
giving up some freedoms for it. In Kentlands, there is a gate in
front of each entry into the development, Krieger said. ``It's a
decorative gate but it evokes the same associations as a real gate.
It's a subtle form of `Keep Out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If decorative gates can evoke the same response as real gates,
then maybe the look of neighborliness _ porches, wide sidewalks and
village greens _ can evoke real neighborliness. Or can it?
</P>
<P>
   The one big criticism about new-urban towns is that they are
fake towns. Given that, it's curious that the developer of Seaside
agreed to let ``The Truman Show,'' a movie about a real man in a
false world, be filmed in Seaside. The movie all but said, ``This
is not really a town but the shell of a town, an image of a town,''
Krieger said.
</P>
<P>
   After the filming was over, the painted plywood storefronts that
had been put up for the movie stayed up for months because the
developer liked the way they looked, Krieger said. After all,
looking like a real town is the next best thing to being one.

   Nigerians lament &QL; 
what could've been
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ No Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   But still a Dream.
</P>
<P>
   As the muscular, swift, but mostly inept Nigerian national team
ran through its warm-ups at one end of the vast Olympic Stadium
prior to its game against Australia, a tall, familiar figure
emerged from a tunnel entrance and took a seat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, for a few hours, at least, was home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be around the guys,'' he said. ``I went to
the shootaround this morning and talked to them. I know many of
them because they play college basketball in the States. But this
is a different situation, where the team is all together in an
international competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumor circulating through the World Championship of
Basketball had been that Olajuwon was invited to sit on the bench
as an assistant coach for the Nigerian team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said chuckling. ``I'm not doing any coaching. I don't
need the aggravation. I'm just here for support, to provide some
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the floor, filling a section of the stands, a group of
nearly 200 Nigerian fans caught sight of him and erupted with
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hak-eem! Hak-eem! Hak-eem! We still love you! Please remember
us!''
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived in Houston in 1980, this was the first time
Olajuwon had seen the Nigerian basketball team play in person. And
while his NBA exploits have been a point of pride in his native
land, it has at the same time been a source of frustration for many
fans he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Dream with Olowokandi
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if we had Olajuwon and (1998 No. 1 NBA draft pick)
Michael Olowokandi playing for the Nigerian team,'' said Suleiman
Habiba, 25, an immigration officer who was leading cheers in the
middle of the section. ``Who would beat us then? Who would touch us
in the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could bring on your American NBA stars. Bring your Dream
Team. With Olajuwon and Olowokandi, we would rule the world.
Instead, all we can do is to hope for a miracle and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Always dance. Always sing. Always move and shake and sway and
chant and do anything to keep the atmosphere in the arena more like
a carnival than a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   There are rhythmic drums, piercing horn blasts and songs for
virtually every situation. Fans from other countries come wearing
T-shirts. The members of the Nigerian Basketball Supporters Club
wear green-and-white dashikis and hats with pointed horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh-shay-oh-shay-oh-oh-shay-habba!'' they sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means `thank you,' or just about anything you want,'' said
Nasiru Isa, 28, who is painted green and white from his chest up,
including his mustache, and has been a virtual dancing machine
going up and down the long flight of stairs almost nonstop
throughout the game. ``This is not just a basketball game. It is a
celebration of our athletes and a way for us to tell them how much
we care.''
</P>
<P>
   Passionate about sports
</P>
<P>
   The sound at a Nigerian game is like listening to a live version
of Paul Simon's Graceland album. It's a cultural experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nigerian fans have always been passionate about their
sports,'' Olajuwon said. ``I remember getting that kind of support
when I was young playing on the junior national team. Did you see
them at the World Cup in France? I don't think any country had a
better time.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no other fans packed more celebrating into every
minute. They cheered every move, every dribble by Yinka Dare, the
renowned NBA flop with the New Jersey Nets. They hung on every move
of Obinna Ekezie, the young star at the University of Maryland.
This is a nation that produces abundant raw basketball talent.
</P>
<P>
   Isa coaches a team in Lagos, the Gunners Basketball Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, gunners as in shooters,'' he said, giggling. ``We all can
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   And they all can fantasize about what it might have been like if
Olajuwon had chosen to represent Nigeria in the Olympics instead of
becoming an American citizen and playing for the United States in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It is still a touchy subject, and it seems every time he
comments, Olajuwon touches off another controversy. He has not been
back to Nigeria to visit in nearly a decade, fearing the political
unrest. But he was traveling this summer to Mecca and to Jordan,
and he didn't want to miss this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Hakeem regrets not playing for us,'' Habiba said. ``I
know the Americans swindled us and exploited him. That's OK _ we
still love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh-shay-oh-shay-oh-oh-shay-habba!
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't this fun?'' Olajuwon said.
</P>
<P>
   For a night, at least, he is home again and they can dream.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officially, the double-crested cormorant is a protected species,
its safety guarded by federal law. But on the Lake Ontario
shoreline west of Watertown, N.Y., the long-necked black birds have
become a pest to anglers, who say the growing colonies of
cormorants are devouring smallmouth bass and, along with them, the
livelihood of people who sell bait and run charter fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   This week, wildlife officials visiting an island nesting ground
discovered an unusually shocking environmental crime: more than 800
cormorants slaughtered by shotgun fire. Although they have no
suspects, officials say they believe the festering conflict between
conservation and commerce is responsible for what they are calling
one of the worst mass killings of a federally protected bird
species in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   State biologists said that when they went ashore on the
uninhabited Little Galloo Island on Wednesday they encountered
heaps of carcasses of fledgling cormorants, piles of shotgun shells
and starving chicks squawking weakly among the carnage. Clifford
Schneider, who directs Lake Ontario projects for the New York state
Department of Environmental Conservation, said ``you see a young
chick still laying there alive among all the others that had been
wiped out, and you can't help but be moved emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting appeared to be the latest of several recent
instances where a once rare species has recovered to the point
where it comes into conflict with local interests. On July 23, the
town of Carrollton, Texas, without a federal permit, bulldozed a
rookery filled with nesting little blue herons, snowy egrets, and
other species protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The count of dead birds from that incident could be more than
1,000, said Pamela McCroskery, a spokesman for the Texas Audubon
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Around eastern Lake Ontario, fish-eating cormorants have staged
a dramatic recovery since the 1950s, when they were nearly wiped
out by pesticides and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In Henderson and other fishing towns near Little Galloo Island,
owners of charter boats and other fishing related businesses,
joined by some officials, have been pressing the government for
several years to allow legalized hunting of cormorants, which they
claim are responsible for a drop in populations of smallmouth bass
and other popular gamefish.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline in the sport fishing industry being blamed on
the birds, there has been more and more talk along the shore lately
of taking action, said Ron Ditch, a charter boat owner and guide
for 43 years in Henderson Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty instrumental in trying to do this in a proper
and legal manner,'' Ditch said Friday. ``But everyone's been
hearing rumblings forever about how people are going to go out and
take care of the situation. Apparently, someone finally wouldn't be
talked out of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing threats against the birds first turned to action in
April, when eight cormorants were killed, federal wildlife
officials said. In June, about 100 cormorants were killed. But this
week's massacre, which left 840 birds dead and more than 100 others
injured, transformed the local issue into an extraordinary
environmental crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Snow, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service
headquarters in Washington, said that a quick survey of officials
there turned up no past mass killings of a protected species that
compared with the cormorant shooting, except perhaps for the
incident in Texas. ``I've been with the department for almost 20
years and this is certainly the biggest in my memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked diving birds have been protected for 25 years
under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the
killing of ducks, geese, egrets, cormorants and other migrating
birds without a permit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as the colony on the island grew to upwards of 8,000 active
nests in recent years, it was increasingly perceived as a threat to
the local sportfishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The uninhabited island contains the largest rookery for the
cormorants in eastern Lake Ontario, with as many as 8,400 active
nests counted there in recent years. The island is owned by the
Phillips Petroleum Co. but essentially is used only as a bird
preserve, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing guides and charter captains in the area have
increasingly pressed members of Congress to write legislation
authorizing controlled, legal hunting of the cormorants to reduce
their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John McHugh, a Republican who represents the lakeshore
portion of upper New York state, complained last fall that the Fish
and Wildlife Service was taking too much time to assess the impact
of the birds on local fish stocks. Along with Rep. Colin Peterson,
D-Minn., he introduced legislation last October that would
authorize states to establish hunting seasons to control the
cormorants.
</P>
<P>
   The birds can be legally hunted in only a few places where they
pose a clear economic threat; for example, at catfish farms in
Louisiana, federal wildlife officials said. But research on their
impact, if any, on the fish in Lake Ontario is still in early
stages, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists have estimated that cormorants eat between
400,000 and 1.2 million smallmouth bass a year in the eastern part
of the lake. But the significance of that number depends on the age
of the bass, said James Farquhar, a biologist for the New York
state Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those are newborn bass, that's a drop in the bucket,''
Farquhar said. ``There are literally billions. But if those 1.2
million fish have already lived through several years, that is a
significant number.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, officials were continuing their investigation.
Conservation officers were interviewing anglers and others who
might be able to pinpoint suspects in and around the fishing town
of Henderson and other spots along the Lake Ontario shore. Offers
of cash for information were being made, but no specific reward was
posted.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Environmental Conservation Commissioner John
Cahill said, ``We're making an all-out effort to find these people
and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. ``This was an act
of savage brutality.'' Killing a bird protected by the federal
migratory bird act can bring a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and
six months in prison for each count, said Adam O'Hara, the special
agent in charge of law enforcement for the Fish and Wildlife
Service in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara said that evidence collected on the island, including
more than 100 shell casings and some bird carcasses, was being sent
to state pathology laboratories and a federal forensic laboratory
for investigating wildlife crimes in Ashland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Miller, the executive director of the National Audubon
Society's New York state chapter, said the shooting harked back to
the turn of the century, when waterfowl and gulls were shot by the
million for sport and to supply feathers to the hat industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dark act that takes us back to that time,'' he said.
He called for a swift investigation and aggressive prosecution of
the shooter or shooters. ``The message has to be strong that people
really can't take the law into their own hands.''

COMMENTARY: SHALL WE DANCE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Leonard Bernstein's memorial service in 1990,
playwright Arthur Laurents brought down the house when he said,
``There were only two things Lenny was afraid of _ God and Jerry
Robbins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins, the choreographer who died this week at 79, was
not one of the most beloved figures in the theater. The first time
I saw him in action _ when, as a 15-year-old, I sneaked into a
``Fiddler on the Roof'' rehearsal in 1964 _ the show's cast was
snickering with approval as the star, Zero Mostel, made lewd
gestures mocking him behind his back. The Mostel-Robbins feud was
rooted in the McCarthy era _ Robbins had named names during the
witch hunts while Mostel had been blacklisted _ and yet most of the
animosity Robbins aroused was non-ideological. He was greedy about
billing and royalties. He could be monstrous _ the posthumous
euphemism is ``perfectionist'' _ toward performers.
</P>
<P>
   But much as we might wish otherwise, there is no correlation
between the character of an artist and the quality of his art. No
less than Sinatra _ to take the handiest recent example _ Jerome
Robbins was a giant of our culture.
</P>
<P>
   His was a quintessentially American two-track career that
unfolded, simultaneously for a time, in both the slangy show biz of
Broadway and the poetic realm of dance. ``He brought the vitality
and energy of this country into the ballet,'' said Laurents Friday.
I had asked him and Stephen Sondheim _ the last two survivors of
the creative team that changed the theater forever with the
cinematically staged ``West Side Story'' in 1957 _ to put aside
Robbins the man and evaluate his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's really the only genius I ever met,'' said
Sondheim. ``Genius is a word people sling around, but my
understanding of that word is endless invention _ and Jerry had
that. ... He had style and substance, but he also knew how to turn
it into entertainment, to bridge the gap to the audience. He had a
way of dealing with the high and the low and a way of combining
them. He could even do television revues _ like the Merman-Martin
special _ and did.''
</P>
<P>
   That mixture of high and low is intrinsic to a young, democratic
culture whose signature achievement may well be ``The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn.'' Robbins' repertory extended from a Mack
Sennett-inspired Keystone Kops ballet (for Broadway's ``High Button
Shoes,'' 1947) to the Noh theatrics of ``Watermill'' (New York City
Ballet, 1972), from witty recreations of burlesque striptease
routines (``Gypsy,'' 1959) to the Bach classicism of
``Brandenburg'' (City Ballet, last year). His recurrent
choreographic vision of a community coming together in a circle and
splintering could be set to ``Tradition'' in ``Fiddler'' or Chopin
in ``Dances at a Gathering'' (City Ballet, 1969). And what more
epitomizes the fusion of high and low than ``West Side Story''
itself, in which Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet'' is re-imagined
for the seething urbanscape of New York?
</P>
<P>
   Like some other American artists of Russian Jewish stock that he
worked with, including most especially Irving Berlin, Robbins at
times defined the way the country pictures itself. The image of the
three sailors on 24-hour shore leave he created in 1944 for his
breakthrough ballet ``Fancy Free'' and its Broadway follow-up ``On
the Town'' are as much a part of World War II iconography as the
Iwo Jima statue. The insouciant pose he created (initially for Mary
Martin) for Peter's flight in the musical ``Peter Pan'' is a
permanent totem of American childhood, much as the panther-like
leap of the Jets in ``West Side Story'' on their way to the rumble
is a staple of the national adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins saw to it that his voluminous work was meticulously
documented; it won't die with him. But his death nonetheless leaves
a vacuum. ``An era hasn't ended,'' says Sondheim, ``but an era of
people I was awed by has ended.'' For myself, I think of the end of
the Robbins ballet paying tribute to Fred Astaire, ``I'm Old
Fashioned.'' After the dancers finish executing Robbins' many
exhilarating variations on an old Astaire duet with Rita Hayworth,
they retreat to the shadows, making way for a huge movie screen
that flies down for a humbling replay of the black-and-white clip
of the dazzling original. The young dancers salute Astaire with a
farewell wave _ but what had been a mood of celebration is now
tinged with loss. As the curtain falls, the realization dawns that
some artists can never be replaced.

LAWSUIT OVER PAINTING BY HENRI MATISSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Heirs of a French art dealer whose collection was
looted by the Nazis sued the Seattle Art Museum Friday, seeking
return of the Henri Matisse painting ``Odalisque.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle nine months
after the heirs of Paul Rosenberg asked the museum to provide proof
it rightfully owned the painting or to return it.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed, SAM's lawyer, said Friday that consultants for the
museum are still investigating ownership history of the Matisse
during World War II and the years immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Joice, SAM's chief registrar, said the museum was ``willing
to enter mediation with all parties involved.'' But she refused to
comment on the heir's contention the museum sent them a letter June
12 saying it wouldn't return the painting unless ordered to do so
by a court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum told us to sue, so we're suing,'' said Camden Hall,
of the Seattle law firm Foster Pepper &AMP; Shefelman, who represents
the Rosenberg heirs. Hall refused to provide a copy of the museum's
June 12 letter, as did Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he doesn't know what the museum wants to mediate.
``The museum needs to give the painting back,'' he said. ``For the
museum, the painting is part of its inventory. For the Rosenbergs,
it's their heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1927-1928 oil painting titled ``Odalisque'' was featured in
a 1995 book by Hector Feliciano titled, ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi
Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art.'' Originally
published in France, the book was translated into English and
published in this country last year by Basic Books. In the book,
``Odalisque'' (17{ inches high by 21} inches wide) was listed as
``whereabouts unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The original owner, Paul Rosenberg, was considered Paris' most
important dealer in 19th and 20th century art between the World
Wars.
</P>
<P>
   After the Nazis invaded France in 1940, Rosenberg and his family
fled to New York, leaving more than 300 major paintings in France,
including works by Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard, Ingres, Delacroix,
Courbet and Cezanne. All of Rosenberg's holdings in France
disappeared into Nazi vaults. ``Odalisque'' was one of the
paintings in Rosenberg's personal collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Seattle's Prentice Bloedel bought ``Odalisque'' from
New York's Knoedler Gallery. In 1991, he donated it to SAM, where
it has been frequently on view since.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of two paintings, two prints and a sculpture by the
French artist owned by the museum. Although the museum declines to
put a monetary value on ``Odalisque,'' Christie's auction house in
Los Angeles said a rough approximate value could be as high as $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, of the Seattle law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said in a
prepared statement that the museum is still researching the history
of the painting's ownership, a task that has dragged on due to the
complexity of the subject. ``We have assured counsel for the
Rosenbergs that we will share the results of that research once it
has been completed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Rosenberg, widow of Paul Rosenberg's son, Alexandre,
expressed frustration that the museum is forcing her and her
sister-in-law, Rosenberg's daughter Micheline Nanette Sinclair, to
sue.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through her attorneys, she said there is
``no genuine doubt that `Odalisque' was part of the collection of
Paul Rosenberg that was stolen by the Nazis. There is no
justification for the Seattle Art Museum's forcing the Rosenberg
family to incur the expense and delay of bringing a lawsuit to
recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the family isn't asking for damages at this point.
``My feeling is if we get the painting back quickly without a lot
of spear throwing we'll probably just fade into the sunset, but if
the museum makes us spend a lot of money and engage in a battle
royal, we might be forced to seek damages.''
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, the Rosenbergs allege ``Odalisque'' was sold in
1954 by Galerie Drouant-David in Paris to Knoedler &AMP; Co., which
then sold it to Bloedel.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Knoedler Gallery were not available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs say they do not know how Galerie Drouant-David
acquired the painting. If Rosenberg himself had recovered it and
sold it to the gallery, the museum would own it legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   The family claims that isn't the case, said Hall, and that
Rosenberg and his family have made diligent efforts to recover his
property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the West German government concluded ``Odalisque'' was
illegally seized by the Nazis in 1941 and traded by Hermann Goering
for other art in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Feliciano's book, Nazi war booty has become a
subject of renewed interest and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Art Museum Directors formed a task
force this year to ``recognize and deplore the unlawful
confiscation of art that constituted one of the many horrors of the
Holocaust and World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   However, museums in the United States and Europe are proving
reluctant to part with specific artworks or help heirs obtain such
artworks when they are on tour. Mimi Gates, director of the Seattle
Art Museum, is a member of this task force. She was not available
for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the museum regrets that ownership of ``Odalisque''
could not have been resolved without a lawsuit but is eager for the
matter to be determined so that ``relative rights and obligations
of the parties, including obligations of the Knoedler Gallery, can
be decided in one forum.''

CLINTON PROMISES COMPLETE TRUTH IN LEWINSKY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes 3rd graf to eliminate statement that jurors will be
able to question Clinton. Minor changes in wording elsewhere.)  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Friday that he would
testify ``completely and truthfully'' in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation on Aug. 17 but said that until then he would have no
public comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief remarks on the subject that has consumed
Washington for the past week came as FBI crime-laboratory
technicians began examining a navy blue cocktail dress that Ms.
Lewinsky gave prosecutors on Wednesday. Lawyers say she told
prosecutors that the dress contains a stain that could provide
evidence of a sexual encounter with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony will be transmitted live to grand
jurors on closed-circuit television, according to an individual
with knowledge of the agreement. The arrangement met a central
condition that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, set in
exchange for withdrawing a July 17 subpoena to compel the
president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Starr announced that he was taking an indefinite
unpaid leave of absence from the Chicago law firm of Kirkland &AMP;
Ellis to complete his inquiry. Starr, a former solicitor general
and federal judge, had come under criticism for making nearly $1
million a year from the firm to represent such clients as General
Motors Corp. and Meineke Discount Muffler at the same time that he
was conducting a publicly funded investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a question,'' the president said, smiling,
after delivering a statement on the domestic economy and before
departing for the Hamptons in New York for a weekend of fund
raising, golf and socializing. ``Well, let me give you the answer
to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``No one wants to get this matter behind us more
than I do, except maybe all the rest of the American people. I am
looking forward to the opportunity, in the next few days, of
testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully. I am anxious to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I hope you can understand why in the
interim I can and should have no further comment on these matters.
Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer announced on Wednesday that he would provide
videotaped testimony for grand jurors on Aug. 17, after months of
resisting Starr's requests that he answer questions on the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and advisers had been deeply split over
whether Clinton should subject himself to the risk of answering
grand jury questions in an inquiry in which he is the potential
target. But all agreed that Clinton should not speak publicly about
the matter before he gives his testimony, according to senior White
House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky spent much of the day with prosecutors from the
independent counsel's office, who are continuing to prepare for her
appearance before the grand jury. She is expected to meet with
prosecutors over the weekend as well. No date has been set for her
questioning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's attorneys will spend the next two weeks assessing
Starr's case against the president and trying to anticipate
questions Clinton might face. While Clinton plans to maintain an
ordinary schedule of official activities over the next two weeks,
he has set aside the entire weekend before the Aug. 17 testimony
for preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had not completed its initial examination of Ms.
Lewinsky's dress by day's end, according to Angela Bell, a bureau
spokeswoman. She said that a determination about whether there was
a stain containing semen or any other identifiable material would
not be made until Monday at the earliest. And she said the
information would be given to the independent counsel's office and
not disclosed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a semen stain, it would take ``several weeks'' to
identify or eliminate any individual as the source, Ms. Bell said,
although experts on DNA testing said that the matching could be
done in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials would not comment on whether Clinton would
voluntarily supply saliva or blood samples for DNA matching.
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement late Friday announcing that he would
drop his private law practice to devote full time to the
presidential investigation. White House officials and others have
harshly criticized Starr for continuing to represent private
clients while overseeing the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my appointment, my duties as independent counsel have
been my top priority,'' Starr said. ``I have said that I would
fulfill my obligations to my private clients and I have done so. At
this critical stage of our work, I am taking an unpaid leave of
absence from my law firm until I complete my public duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Yannucci, the firm's managing partner, said that Starr is
currently in ``no position'' to represent private clients.
</P>
<P>
   He said the indefinite leave was granted at Starr's request with
the expectation that he will return to work full time after the
investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Told that some Clinton allies were spreading the word that the
firm had nudged Starr out, or at least was glad to see him go,
Yannucci said, ``I'm not surprised, but that's completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. John Ashcroft, a conservative Missouri
Republican and a possible presidential candidate in 2000, said he
would conduct hearings during the August recess on legal and
constitutional questions arising from the investigation. He said he
would explore whether the president is subject to ordinary criminal
prosecution while in office, or must first be impeached and
convicted by Congress.

NEW EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE: SO LONG, SCIENCE KITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (from `Education Life' special section)  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drops of sweat were building up on the edge of my neck as I
pored over the instructions that came with the science kit. I stuck
another wire into the tiny clasp on a cardboard circuit board.
Nothing. The eyes of both eager children began to drift away. The
Morse code key would not buzz. Mr. Science was unmasked once again.
</P>
<P>
   Foolish me. That was some months ago. Now I see that I could
have just left the problem of encouraging scientific inquiry in my
children to the educational software publishers. With the shelves
glutted with reading and math software, the industry is turning to
science. Children _ and adults _ can explore light, sound,
electricity, perception and optical illusions right at their
computer screens, without losing a part or breaking a wire.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this works brilliantly. Children can learn concepts,
play games and engage, perhaps, in a bit of scientific inquiry. And
yet, there is something sad and lacking about exploring nature and
the physical sciences through computer simulations and animations,
and never getting to see, touch or, yes, even break the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   It is like watching 50 episodes of ``Nature'' without once
walking through the woods or visiting a zoo. After watching a child
build a hundred circuits with bells and batteries on a computer
screen, I began to wish the publisher had included a few wires in
the box.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers, Circuits and Bad Jokes
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinkin' Science Series: ZAP!'' by Edmark, which is owned by
IBM, lets children explore color, lenses, sound waves, electrical
gadgets and lasers through a series of computer games _ or
``learning laboratories,'' as Edmark puts it _ grounded in
scientific concepts.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the program, you are told that you have been
selected to be the guest director of a performance by the musical
group ZAP! in a cartoonlike concert hall. Before the concert can
begin, however, you must learn how to repair wiring, laser lights
and the sound system _ because they all have been struck by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In the electricity lab, you learn to construct simple electrical
circuits by adding and cutting wires, and attaching bulbs, fans and
bells. The exercises become increasingly complex, covering basic
electrical concepts like current, voltage, resistance and parallel
circuits. You can follow the lesson plan step by step, or putter
around with your own circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The laser lab explores light rays and colors. Mirrors, lenses,
filters, prisms and color-splitters are used to direct beams of
light around obstacles. When the correct beams strike the target _
an egg _ it hatches into a chick that flies across the screen. You
can experiment with the properties of colors, filtering and
reflecting colored beams of light. And when you solve a problem,
the members of ZAP! reward you with bad jokes and puns that only an
8-year-old could enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Edmark says all this activity helps children ``discover science
through inquiry, observation and experimentation _ just like real
scientists.'' For my taste, there is too much simulation and not
enough reality. On the other hand, many scientists spend their days
staring at computer screens, analyzing mounds of statistical
evidence and simulations.

   Maybe You Shouldn't Believe Your Eyes
</P>
<P>
   At the start of ``Scientific American Library: Illusion,'' the
narrator says: ``We put a great deal of trust in what we see. But
how much of that trust is justified?''
</P>
<P>
   This CD-Rom explores how the eye sees: how space, color, light,
motion and form affect how we see the world around us, and how what
we see is shaped by distortion and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two Scientific American Library Books, ``Perception,''
by Irvin Rock, and ``Eye, Brain and Vision,'' by David H. Hubel,
and brings them to life with animated, interactive illustrations
and exercises that let you explore illusions right before your very
eyes. There are also interviews, text and illustrations, as well as
50 games and 3-D illusions.
</P>
<P>
   You can explore the inner workings of the eye, discovering how
hard it is to put together a jigsaw puzzle when your mouse moves
the way your eye sees objects before they are inverted by the
brain: upside down and backward. You can also see a crate that
looks as if its back legs were intertwined with the front legs,
even after you are shown how the illusion was done. And you can
listen to a psychologist explain how the blind can draw.

   Has Carmen Finally Lost Her Way?
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world is Carmen Sandiego in a high-tech space-age
mystery? To teach children math. So what does that have to do with
geography?
</P>
<P>
   When Carmen Sandiego was introduced in the mid-1980s, a
generation ago in the life span of the personal computer, it opened
new vistas in interactive learning. ``Where in the World is Carmen
</P>
<P>
   Sandiego?'' was, in its time, a magical tool that allowed
children to explore the world.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, ``Carmen Sandiego Math Detective'' seeks to
extend the franchise to new territory. But here, there is nothing
magical, or even particularly clever. It is a conventional
math-drill program, and like many such programs the drill is
sugarcoated in the form of a game or of a mystery to solve. (There
is also ``Carmen Sandiego Word Detective'' and a more plausible
``Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``Math Detective,'' Carmen Sandiego has stolen 12 world
monuments and shrunk them into tiny crystals. Using the
transporter, you visit hideouts and locate codes that can only be
decoded by completing one of five basic sets of math drills. After
you complete a set of drills you can recover one monument. Alas,
far more imaginative thinking went into the concept than into the
drills. Nervous parents can log on and inspect their child's
progress through the game, click for click, and then decide whether
or not they are ready for the Ivy League, without having to wait
for the SATs.

STUDENTS ABROAD FIND A WEALTH OF CHOICES, AND EVEN BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (from `Education Life' special section)  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation ago, American collegians going abroad were
typically well-bred women with rich or indulgent parents, students
whose commitment to mastering the pluperfect sometimes wavered
before the myriad enticements of Paris or Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   While distractions remain, foreign study these days is a far
different proposition. No longer confined largely to language
courses, study abroad offers a vast array of places and subjects
from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   And students have no need for investment-banker lineage. In
fact, they may save money by spending a semester or two abroad _
perhaps as much as 50 percent off the cost of a private American
college, which can range from $20,000 to more than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any country that has colleges as expensive as
here,'' said Paulo Sotero Marques, a Brazilian journalist who lives
in Washington and has three college-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Nissa Petersen spent the 1997-1998 academic year studying
sociology at University College in Cork, Ireland. The cost,
including housing and one-way air fare but not meals, came to
$15,200 _ not inexpensive but significantly less than the $20,000
or so she would have paid to Salem College in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
where she was enrolled back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' said Virginia Petersen, Nissa's
mother. ``I thought it would end up costing more.'' For her part,
Nissa Petersen said the savings gave her the sense ``that I wasn't
gallivanting around at my parents' expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Janes, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., who spent her freshman
year at Reed College in Portland, Ore., heads off this month to
Capital Normal University in China. She needed to stretch her
resources, since her parents had set aside a specified amount for
her education. She looked to China for a bargain year expected to
cost $7,500, including room and board, far less than the $28,000
she would have paid to stay in Portland. ``She believed she had to
do something like this to be able to graduate from Reed,'' Heidi's
mother, Elizabeth, said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the possible savings is the fact that students can
sometimes apply their financial aid to foreign studies. While state
aid and grants and scholarships from the home college cannot always
be applied, federal aid like Stafford loans and Pell grants can; in
fact, it's a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much less a foreign program appears to cost,
students need to check whether they still have to pay their school
at home the full domestic tuition. Among the increasing number that
do are Wesleyan and Columbia Universities, Swarthmore College, the
University of Pennsylvania and, beginning in the 2000-2001 academic
year, Smith College.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutions are ``shutting the doors,'' said William
Hoffa, a foreign-study consultant in Amherst, Mass. ``The new
compact is, `You owe us eight semesters worth of tuition,
regardless.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Students do tend to remain enrolled in a college or university
at home while studying abroad, and American schools generally grant
full credit for their foreign study. But because methods of
evaluation vary widely by country, grades are normally disregarded
in calculating grade-point averages.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of students enrolling in foreign-study
programs do so through their own schools or other American
colleges. They can also apply on their own directly to foreign
universities, taking a route that is becoming somewhat more
popular, largely because it is the least expensive option. But
undergraduates don't always have this choice. Some colleges will
not let their students go independently and still have the work
blessed with home-school credit.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of foreign-study programs, finding the right one
often involves one of the two dominant placement bureaus that have
made a business of linking American students with appropriate
courses in foreign institutions. One is the Institute for Study
Abroad at Butler University in Indianapolis; the other is Beaver
College in Glenside, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The broker, who takes care of all arrangements and continuing
supervision, is paid a fee that varies by place and situation and
is built into the total cost quoted.
</P>
<P>
   Students seeking the widest options may want to consult one or
more of the standard references published by the
</P>
<P>
   Institute of International Education in New York (Web site:
www.iie.org). These include ``Academic Year Abroad'' ($44.95),
``Vacation Study Abroad'' ($39.95) and ``Financial Resources for
International Study'' ($39.95). A free pamphlet called ``Basic
Facts on Study Abroad'' is also available. All can be ordered by
writing to IIE Books, P.O. Box 371, Annapolis Junction, Md. 20701;
by calling (800) 445-0443, or by connecting to the institute's
online catalog (www.iiebooks.org). Another useful reference is
``Peterson's Study Abroad'' ($29.95), from Peterson's, P.O. Box
2123, Princeton, N.J. 08543; (800) 338-3282 (www.petersons.com).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, students study abroad for reasons that transcend
finances: to expand their cultural horizons, and their resume. The
following choices meet those criteria, but also are regarded as
good value.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britain and Ireland
</P>
<P>
   Studying in foreign countries is not a guaranteed bargain.
London and other major cities in Western Europe can be expensive.
But Britain is still the most popular choice for Americans,
attracting more than 25 percent of those going abroad, and it
offers a wealth of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver College, which places the most American students in
Britain, deals with 28 universities there, including University
College London, known for its economics department ($19,900 for the
full year, including housing but not meals). City University in
London offers a popular program in which students attend classes
two days a week and intern three days a week in places like the
London Zoo and Parliament ($18,000 a year, including housing but
not meals).
</P>
<P>
   Beaver also places students in Ireland. University College
Galway exerts the strongest pull on Americans, especially those of
Irish descent, because of the sizable Irish-speaking community and
its idyllic, west-country bayside location. (The cost is $8,700 for
the fall semester, $15,200 for a full year, including lodging and
one-way air fare but not meals.)
</P>
<P>
   Other highly regarded places are University College in Cork,
which specializes in Irish studies and music, and the Institute of
Public Administration, where students work as unpaid aides to
members of Parliament.

<P>
   Rutgers University has a junior-year program for study at one of
10 English and Scottish universities that students are assigned to
after they are accepted into the program. Students from other
colleges and universities get secondary consideration. Costs range
from $14,280 a year for New Jersey residents to attend the
Universities of Bristol and Sussex to a high of $21,370 for
students from other states who attend University College London.
The prices do not include room, board or air fare.
</P>
<P>
   The other universities are those of Exeter, Manchester, Reading,

</P>
<P>
   Germany
</P>
<P>
   Germany has some of the biggest potential bargains because all
its institutions of higher education are government-financed. Under
an increasingly rare policy, as more countries end or sharply limit
subsidies for noncitizens, foreigners are not charged tuition.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, however, this policy has led to an
emphasis on one-for-one exchanges between American and German
students, making arrangements more difficult. A good source of
information on scholarships, visas and other foreign-study matters
is the New York office of the German Academic Exchange Service, 950
Third Ave., New York 10022; (212) 758-3223 (www.daad.org).
</P>
<P>
   One seasoned American operator, the Institute for the
International Education of Students in Chicago, has setup its own
programs instead of brokering students. One is in Berlin ($9,000 a
semester, $16,200 for a full year, including lodging but not
meals), and two are in Freiburg. One Freiburg program, on the
European Union, costs $8,400 for the semester, including lodging
but not meals.

   The University of Maryland University College runs sizable

<P>
   Italy
</P>
<P>
   Florence, not Rome, is the most popular Italian destination for
American students, with Georgetown University, Smith College and
Sarah Lawrence College offering programs of some renown. But the
program that educators usually mention first is run by Syracuse
University, which for more than 30 years has been a sizable
presence with its own campus in this arts capital, a virtual museum
without walls. Art history and architecture are the chief subjects
of study for the American contingent _ 200 strong last semester.
</P>
<P>
   This program is unlikely to be a money-saver, though, because
Syracuse charges the same amount, about $13,000 a semester, that
students pay at its campus in New York state. The price includes
housing, some meals and one-way air fare. Students who join the
program from higher-priced universities might find Florence cheaper
than, say, Yale or Princeton, but even as a financial wash, the
sunny seat of the Medicis is hard to resist.

   An intriguing new Arab-studies program is being offered this
fall in Sana, capital of newly unified Yemen in the southwestern
corner of the Arabian peninsula, along ancient trade routes for
spices and luxury goods. The 10-week program consists of Arabic and
two other courses: one on the country's 5,000-year history, the
other on its current political science. Study of Arabic is
recommended before starting the program, but it is not required.
Registration is through Portland State University in Oregon, which
has more than 30 years of experience in the Middle East. The Yemeni
program costs $5,500, which covers tuition, lodging and at least
one meal a day.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When one of the nation's richest people _ a
headstrong Texas oilman _ is accused along with his family of
bilking the government of more than $100 million in taxes; when his
former accountant says in a court document that one tax dodge
involved claiming a business deduction for a private jet used
mainly to fly to vacation retreats in California and Colorado; when
the oilman agrees in the end to pay millions in back taxes and his
company offers to plead no contest to criminal tax fraud, one might
think there would be little public sympathy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, when Republican senators needed taxpayers who had
been outrageously mistreated by the Internal Revenue Service to
trot before a congressional committee considering an IRS overhaul,
W.A. (Tex) Moncrief was front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief, in his testimony, was duly outraged, accusing the
agency of Gestapo-like tactics in a 1994 raid on his Fort Worth
office building, then of extorting $23 million from his family to
settle the case. He got plenty of sympathy from Republicans on the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief, long a generous supporter of Republican candidates,
was more than happy to help build a case against the current tax
system. Like many members of Congress, Moncrief, still a commanding
presence at 78, wants the income tax abolished and replaced by a
national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the fairest of all,'' he said in a recent
interview in the office of his late father, the legendary Texas
wildcatter W.A. (Monty) Moncrief _ although even some backers of
this idea acknowledge that it would shift more of the tax burden to
the poor and middle class.
</P>
<P>
   But is his really a case of IRS agents running wild, or of one
of the super-rich paying his due _ perhaps even getting off easy?
That is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, though, is that this Texas saga provides a
colorful glimpse at the powerful momentum that has built in the
effort to demonize the army of IRS accountants and lawyers charged
with making sure that Americans pay up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Moncrief did pay $23 million to the IRS, but he did not
admit defeat. He and two of his sons are suing the accountant who
blew the whistle on them, and the lawyers who advised him, saying
they unethically conspired to harm the Moncrief family. And the
criminal plea that one of Moncrief's sons signed for the family
company, Montex Drilling, was, in a controversial move, never filed
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, meanwhile, has refused to pay the whistle-blowing
accountant a promised reward, saying he violated his contract with
them by telling Moncrief's nephew, a state senator, about
Moncrief's dealings and allowing the nephew's accountant access to
tax records.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle-blower is suing the government for the millions he
says he is owed while he tries to fend off Moncrief, whose net
worth was estimated at $300 million in 1995 by Forbes magazine.
Moncrief's civil suit against him was scheduled to go to trial
tomorrow in state court but has been delayed while a federal judge
decides whether the accountant should be considered a federal
employee.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS overhaul on behalf of which Moncrief testified was
signed into law by President Clinton in late July. The measure
makes it clear that Congress no longer wants quite so hard-fisted a
tax collector, providing for outside oversight of the agency and
increased taxpayer leverage against property seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will indeed make the agency more customer-friendly,
said John Berthoud, president of the National Taxpayers Union, a
nonprofit organization that lobbies for lower taxes and supports a
House effort to abolish the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a perception,'' Berthoud said, ``that the IRS is
more interested in serving the needs of government than in serving
the needs of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   But there could be hazards in taming the agency.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sheldon S. Cohen, an IRS commissioner in the 1960s,
any new protections would shield tax dodgers, too. ``And there are
more deadbeats,'' he said, ``than nice taxpayers at that level'' _
the level at which the agency gives up on coaxing and moves to more
onerous methods.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Moncrief, Cohen said: ``It defies my imagination why
the Congress would let him portray himself in a sympathetic way.
Why, he paid $23 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief's version is that he did nothing wrong but was forced
to pay because ``the IRS told my attorneys that unless they got
some kind of substantial payment from us, they were not going to
leave us alone.'' The $23 million was one of the largest
noncorporate IRS settlements ever, said Doug Gastorf, chief of
criminal investigations for the agency's North Texas district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known then what I know now,'' Moncrief said recently,
``I would not have paid them a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax troubles began in 1993, when Billy W. Jarvis, Moncrief's
in-house accountant, began talking to the IRS about his suspicions
of tax fraud. Jarvis, a Moncrief employee for 14 years, would be
dismissed for unrelated reasons a few months after the first IRS
contact.
</P>
<P>
   In November of that year, Jarvis met with IRS agents and signed
an agreement to provide information in return for a
whistle-blower's reward of up to $25 million, depending on how much
was collected.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis worked with the IRS over the next 22 months. But after
only a few months, in the spring of 1994, perhaps frustrated by the
agency's inaction, he also opened up a new front against his old
employer. He met with Tex Moncrief's nephew Mike Moncrief, the
state senator, and shared information and documents that Jarvis
said would prove that Tex was cheating Mike's side of the family in
dealings involving oil and gas interests they had inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Moncrief says this was a breach of Jarvis' professional
obligations. Jarvis says he came to believe he had a duty to
disclose a possible violation of Moncrief's fiduciary
responsibility to the nephew.
</P>
<P>
   There had long been friction between Tex Moncrief and the three
children of his late brother, Richard B. Moncrief. While Tex and
two of his four sons had followed his father, Monty, into the oil
business, Dick Moncrief had gone his own way. Tex's side now
controlled most of the family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The IRS raided Tex Moncrief's business on Sept. 1, 1994 _ almost
a year after its first meeting with Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, in March 1995, Mike Moncrief, and his siblings
sued their uncle and two of their cousins, contending they had been
cheated in dealings involving oil and gas interests handed down
from their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Through testimony and filings in that suit, the IRS soon figured
out that its informant had begun working with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It also became clear that Jarvis had agreed to split his
informants' reward with lawyers handling the Mike Moncrief suit and
that he was being paid a consultant's fee of $5,000 a month to help
in that litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Moncrief promptly countersued, contending that his nephew
had made false claims against him in an attempt to injure him and
his business. The elder Moncrief also soon learned that it was
Jarvis who had reported him to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 raid on his three-story, white-marble-and-glass office
building in downtown Fort Worth had made the front page of The Fort
Worth Star-Telegram as well as national headlines. Sixty-four IRS
agents swarmed through his offices, carting away more than a
million pages of company and family documents.
</P>
<P>
   The raid and its aftershocks shut down his business, Moncrief
said, costing at least $100 million _ most of which, he said,
represented a loss to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Texas longhorn bull poked with a stick, Tex charged.
</P>
<P>
   First he got his relatives to back down, negotiating to suspend
their litigation and extracting an apology from his nephew, a much
more taciturn man with a penchant for donating to the arts and to
social causes like helping AIDS patients and abused women.
</P>
<P>
   Of his nephew, a rare family Democrat, Tex said recently, ``As
far as I know, Mike has never worked a day in his life outside of
being a county judge and a politician,'' adding, for good measure,
that he was an ``ingrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of such comments, Mike Moncrief, now 54, chose not to
respond, citing an agreement not to discuss the settlement _
intended to apply to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Moncrief then turned his attention to Jarvis and the lawyers
who had worked with him on the case or advised him in his dealings
with the IRS, filing a suit contending that they had conspired
unlawfully to instigate the nephew's lawsuit and the IRS
investigation, thereby damaging Tex Moncrief's family and causing
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis says that although he has paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars in legal bills and now has only an 1989 Cadillac and his
retirement plan, Moncrief is still chasing him through the state
courts in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tex, as we know right now, is a pretty mean-spirited person,''
Jarvis said in a recent interview at his lawyer's office. ``He's a
person that does not like to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, 61, balding with wire-rimmed glasses, said he started
worrying back in 1991 about the way the Moncriefs handled their
personal and business taxes. He said he talked to his brother, Don,
now a rural county judge, and became convinced that he could be
charged with a crime if he did not act. He was also afraid, he
said, that Moncrief would blame him if the tax problems were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit recently unsealed in the case, an IRS
criminal investigator swore that after looking into Jarvis'
information, he found ``probable cause'' that Tex Moncrief and
others had conspired to defraud the government and evade taxes. In
the affidavit, used to obtain the warrant to search the Moncrief
offices, the IRS set out five ways it suspected that the Moncriefs
had cheated on their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   They were suspected of deducting as business expenses personal
items like a jet used to fly to Moncrief's Palm Springs homes and
Colorado retreat; salaries for a personal chauffeur, handyman and
other household help and losses from family ranches used primarily
for pleasure. (Tex Moncrief, in an interview, talked of a
15,000-acre Texas ranch where the family keeps zebras and other
exotic animals.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also focused on what they suspected was a 1984 bailout
of one of Tex Moncrief's sons, with Tex and other family members
supposedly paying the son $40 million for properties worth only $8
million to $10 million _ essentially giving him a gift without
paying gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, the IRS cited an allegation that Tex
Moncrief transferred an interest in a gas property to another son
without paying gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth allegation was that Tex Moncrief diverted money that
should have gone to his elderly mother by keeping her portion of an
$80 million court settlement involving a gas property. This, the
agency said, allowed her $40 million share to pass to Tex and his
sons without payment of gift or estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And in a possible tax dodge that could have saved the family the
most money, the IRS said it suspected that oil and gas properties
worth up to $190 million and belonging to his mother were
undervalued by Tex Moncrief before her death and sold to her seven
grandchildren for around $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief called the allegations a ``figment of Bill Jarvis'
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane, he said, was used only for business, and the
properties bought from his son were purchased for less than the
value the banks had placed on them.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the $40 million the IRS said should have gone to his
mother, that was totally his, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IRS itself had agreed to the value of the oil
and gas properties sold by his mother to the grandchildren, he
said, citing a valuation made after the death of his father two
years before the sale.
</P>
<P>
   For such defensible items, Moncrief said at the congressional
hearing, the government initially wanted him to pay $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciling Jarvis' contentions and the IRS affidavit with
Moncrief's assertion that he never cheated is hard, since the
matter never resulted in criminal charges or went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The coming civil trial in the Moncriefs' suit against Jarvis,
however, may shed light on the story.
</P>
<P>
   What is known from the court record in that lawsuit is that
sometime in October 1995, Tex's son and business partner, Charles
B. Moncrief, and the family's high-powered lawyers agreed to enter
a no-contest plea to tax fraud for Montex Drilling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the Moncriefs' lawyers were Robert S. Bennett, better
known for representing President Clinton in the Paula Jones case;
James A. Bruton III, former acting chief of the Justice
Department's tax division, and Dee J. Kelly, an influential lawyer
in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the signed criminal plea agreement, Montex had
shifted $900,000 in business expenses to Tex Moncrief, which he
then improperly deducted on his 1990 federal return.
</P>
<P>
   No other allegations were addressed in the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After being negotiated by the United States Attorney's office in
Dallas, the plea bargain was sent to the tax division of the
Justice Department for approval, according to Gastorf, the district
IRS official, and two other government officials.
</P>
<P>
   There, said the two officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the confidential nature of tax cases, the plea
was killed. Gastorf would say only, ``We thought it would be
accepted when we sent it up there,'' referring other questions to
Loretta C. Argrett, the assistant attorney general responsible for
the tax division.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Argrett, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the spokeswoman, Obern Rainey, said that while
decisions are made case by case, the policy is to oppose no-contest
pleas in all cases; she pointed out a written Justice Department
policy to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal action was taken. On Jan. 4, 1996, Tex Moncrief's
family settled the IRS case by agreeing to pay $23 million ``for
deficiencies in income, excise, and gift taxes for taxable periods
from Jan. 1, 1989, through Aug. 31, 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why no criminal action was taken, Paul E. Coggins,
the United States attorney in Dallas, said: ``You're looking at a
bunch of factors. One was the amount of resources the case was
burning in your district. One was clearly, obviously, you know, the
age of one of the subjects. And then, of course, any issues you
have with the informant is another factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Mason, an IRS inspector called in last year to investigate
complaints by Moncrief about the way the case was handled, said in
a deposition that the agency was able to confirm some of the
allegations raised by Jarvis, as well as ``things that the
investigators were able to get on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Jarvis' actions compromised the investigation,
stopping it prematurely. The IRS wound up investigating Jarvis
himself, Mason said, and considered filing charges against him for
providing Mike Moncrief's accountant with access to Tex Moncrief's
tax returns, but in the end decided he had not violated federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jarvis call many of the complaints ``red herrings.''
Other witnesses could have verified Jarvis' account, they say, and
the government had documentation to substantiate the allegations
after its raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to me that there's some political overtones to
the case,'' said Jarvis, citing the only reason he could think of
for the way the case was handled. ``As you know, the Moncriefs are
well-heeled and perfectly capable of wielding a lot of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Moncrief's lawyers, meanwhile, said they signed the plea
agreement only because they knew it would not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attorney said it was a very innocuous situation and it
never came to fruit anyway,'' Moncrief said of the never-filed
criminal plea. ``I didn't pay any more attention to that than I've
paid to you in the last half-second,'' he told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief, who said the government extracted the $23 million from
him ``to save face'' after its well-publicized raid, vows to keep
speaking out against the agency and to keep pursuing those who
conspired to break him. ``I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I
couldn't conduct business,'' Moncrief said. ``It was the worst
thing that's ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tex Moncrief's lawsuit against him and the fact that he
hasn't been paid his reward, Jarvis said he would go to the IRS
again if he could do things over. ``I was witness to what I
believed were illegalities,'' he said. ``I didn't have a choice as
to what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the truth of this case might depend on your
perspective. ``You get criticized for being too tough on Tex,'' one
government official said. ``Then, on the other hand, you can say
Tex bought his way out. There's no way you can win.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one thing is certain: the government will not be sued.
The United States attorney's office included a clause in its $23
million settlement protecting it from litigation by Tex Moncrief.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said his office did a preliminary check of the Moncrief
situation to establish the facts as best it could but saw no reason
to present the IRS's side at the hearing. ``We had agreed that the
purpose of these hearings was not to retry these cases,'' he said.
The committee has received thousands of complaints about IRS
practices since last year, when it announced its investigation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the former IRS commissioner, said that ``the tax man is
never going to be a beloved person.'' The Roth committee
``orchestrated this set of hearings so there was a groundswell of
public opinion,'' he added. ``But I think it's shallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an April 15 poll by Louis Harris &AMP; Associates found that
76 percent of Americans who have had direct contact with IRS
employees said they were treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins, the Dallas prosecutor, said he would gladly have given
the government's side, if called. ``I sat by the phone thinking,
`Surely someone from Washington will call and get our opinion on
this,' '' he said.

TRANSGENDER ATHLETES CHARGE GAY GAMES WITH DISCRIMINATORY
PRACTICES

<P>
   The Gay Games, founded 16 years ago as way to bring together
through sports competition people who were being excluded from
mainstream life, has found itself on the eve of the fifth ``Gay
Olympiad'' in Amsterdam, Netherlands, being accused of the very
thing it was created to fight: sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   From within the games' ranks, newly vocal sexual minorities _
led by athletes who have changed their sex _ have arisen to
denounce what they say is bias against them by tradition-minded Gay
Games organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are in many ways a result of success. The games
began in San Francisco in 1982 as a purely local event with 1,300
athletes and a budget of $120,000. Since then the event has evolved
into perhaps the most visible vehicle for gay pride and identity in
the world _ an institution of sport and culture that is expected to
draw 15,000 participants from 64 countries, beginning in full this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But along with growing impact has come a conflict over what the
games are meant to achieve _ what face for gay culture the event
should present to the world and how the complications of becoming
an institution, from the protection of the event's image to the
consciousness of potential legal liabilities, should be managed.
Rules about gender are where that conflict plays out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, local organizers in the Netherlands have
banned mixed-sex couples from competing in the ballroom dance
competition _ an event that will be a demonstration sport at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The goal, they say, is to
present the event as a kind of international showcase for
homosexual athletes: men dancing with men, women with women. What
that means, however, is that a lesbian school teacher from New York
City and her gay male dance partner will not be allowed out onto
the floor. Gay or not, they are of the opposite sex, and that has
been deemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The change that is drawing the most fire and discussion among
the gay participants, however, is a rule that affects only a tiny
minority: A requirement that athletes who have changed their sex
provide, for the first time, proof of what the rules call
``completed gender transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say that concerns over fairness and legal liability
have made it imperative that so-called ``transgender'' athletes be
put into the proper category especially so that men, with their
greater body strength _ whether born or created _ do not compete
unfairly, or perhaps even dangerously, against women. A man on the
path of becoming a woman, but not there yet, they say, might still
have a superior physical strength and weight that could provide
decisive in an event like powerlifting or tennis, or potentially
dangerous to opponents in single-sex women's team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the soccer field, a 100-pound waif of a girl has the right
to participate in a safe environment,'' said Roz Quarto,
co-president of the Federation of Gay Games.
</P>
<P>
   But while critics of the new policies agree that fairness and
safety are important, the central issue, they say, is larger: Who
is allowed to participate freely in the games without being
challenged about their private lives, and who is not?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gay Games were formed because gay athletes could not
compete openly _ how ironic that they are now forcing another group
of athletes to go back into the closet or face a barrage of
stigmatizing obstacles,'' said Riki Anne Wilchins, the executive
director of Gender PAC, a public advocacy coalition for the
transgender community and author of ``Read My Lips, Sexual
Subversion and the End of Gender,'' (Firebrand Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Games officials said that rules about ``gender transition'' were
initially proposed by the Federation of Gay Games, the event's
governing body, when the games were last held, in New York in 1994.
The idea was ultimately scrapped in favor of a policy that let
applicants simply declare their sex with no further questions
asked. The re-emergence of the issue _ local officials in the
Netherlands, unlike their New York counterparts, decided to
implement the federation's more restrictive proposals _ has made
the games an object of attack even from traditional gay rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is their sense of fairness and justice _ where does
discrimination stop?'' said Sydney Levy, research and advocacy
director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission, a San Francisco-based organization. ``Singling out
transsexuals means singling out people who vary from the norm and
asking a lot of private questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay Games, which has from its inception been a mix of sport
and pageantry, has 29 athletic events this year ranging from
ice-hockey to a foot- race marathon along the route of the 1928
Amsterdam Olympic games, plus numerous cultural and arts workshops.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policies, transsexuals must provide documentation
that includes, for example, a letter from a doctor stating that the
transgender applicant has undergone hormone treatments for at least
two years without interruption, and other proof, through
photographs, correspondence or an employer's declaration, that the
applicant has lived actively in his or her new sex for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The dance competition rules on gender are even more exacting.
Officials have said, for example, that a man may legally dance with
another man who is dressed as a woman. It's also fine if both are
dressed as women. Two women can similarly compete looking like a
mixed sex or same sex couple so long as both are, beneath their
costumes, of the same gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is quite unique in a dance competition to have all
same sex couples _ it will be one of the most interesting things in
the Gay Games,'' said Niek van der Spek, the director of operations
for the Gay Games 5.
</P>
<P>
   And while games organizers say they expect only about two-dozen
transgender participants at this year's games, gay rights officials
say there are probably many more like Loren Cameron who were
dissuaded from going at all. Cameron, a professional photographer
and author who changed sexes from female to male, trained for six
months preparing for the body-building competition. He said he felt
the gender documentation requirement was intrusive and that he
could not in good conscience comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they're singling out certain people. They're not
asking every competitor for proof of gender identity, and I felt
that was wrong,'' Cameron said. ``Isn't it the whole spirit of the
games to celebrate inclusivity out of the `normal standard?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Sharmat, the New York City school teacher and erstwhile
dance competitor who was also on the board of directors for the
1994 Gay Games in New York, said that striking the right balance
between the role of the games as a showcase for gay culture and its
function as unifying force for gay men and women was hard then,
too. The New York event, she said, wase harshly criticized by some
people who said it had become an event for mainstream society.
</P>
<P>
   Sharmat, even though she disagrees with the policy that is
keeping her out of the dance competition, said she thinks that
bringing the games into broad acceptance, thus helping break down
barriers between homosexuals and heterosexuals, is important. ``You
do want to mainstream it. The question is, to what extent?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilchins, the transgender group leader, said the opposite
question is more germane: What elements of the mainstream should
you avoid taking with you?
</P>
<P>
   ``When minorities set up their own structure, they take the best
_ and the worst _ of the majority culture with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of athletes to determine their actual sex is also, of
course, nothing new to sports. In the 1970s, a battle raged in the
courts over whether Dr. Renee Richards, who underwent a sex change
to become a woman, could legally compete in the women's division of
the U.S. Open tennis tournament without taking a chromosome test.
Richards won her legal case and didn't have to take the test, but
she lost in the tournament's first round in 1977. The Olympics has
required chromosome testing since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Games officials also said that ballroom dancing plays a
bigger symbolic role in Europe, where the image of hundreds of
ballroom dancers, all same-sex pairs, would be a powerful statement
that gay men and women had fully, and openly, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Games officials are divided among themselves about the gender
rules, especially on the dance competition. The tradition of the
games has been to allow wide latitude by local organizers, but
officials at the Federation of Gay Games said the time may have
come to start exercising more centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people unhappy about not being able to
perform, heterosexual and homosexual,'' said Scott Mandell, the
federation's executive director. ``But they are the host city and
hopefully when we move on to Sydney in 2002 it will be a different
story.''

U.S. `HEALTH IDENTIFIER' PLAN SHELVED PENDING PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Vt.)   (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has temporarily backed
away from its plan to assign every American a computerized code
that would be used to track medical records, saying the ``unique
health identifier'' will be delayed until Congress adopts
legislation to protect patients' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, coming on the heels of a week of controversy about
the identifier, was announced by Vice President Al Gore on Friday
as part of a broader proposed ``electronic bill of rights'' that
would cover not only medical records but also financial data as
well as information gathered from children over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a nation where people can get access to your bank
account and your medical records more easily than they can find out
what movies you rent at the video store,'' Gore said in a ceremony
at the White House. ``Even worse, some patients'' worried about the
potential for privacy infringement ``will not tell their doctors
the whole story, and doctors are now afraid to keep full and
accurate medical records in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy experts have argued that creating a national health
identification system, which could be used to develop a huge
database following every American's medical history from cradle to
grave, would only inflame those fears.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the code say it could save lives by assuring
doctors complete medical records of their new patients and also
helping those patients track their own records, frequently as they
move from one insurance plan to another. Scientists also like the
idea, saying it would create research opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The identifier was mandated by a 1996 law that allows patients
to take their health insurance with them when they switch jobs.
But, Gore said Friday, carrying out that mandate ``before Congress
has enacted strong, tough, meaningful medical-records-privacy
legislation could compromise the privacy of Americans in too many
ways.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement brought praise from some who had worried that
the controversy could scuttle the plans for the electronic code
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The privacy issues absolutely have to be addressed so that we
can have a discussion about the benefits of helping consumers link
their medical history over time,'' said Elliot Stone, chief
executive of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, a nonprofit
group that builds large health care databases.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates, who are pressing for the 1996 provision
to be abandoned, were sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delaying the ID number is not what the public wants,'' said
Dr. Denise Nagel, a physician who is executive director of the
National Coalition for Patient Rights. ``It needs to be repealed.''
</P>
<P>
   By leaving the future of the health identifier in the hands of
Congress, the administration may not get a speedy resolution to the
debate. With at least five bills to protect patient privacy
circulating on Capitol Hill, the lawmakers are in the midst of a
bitter argument over how to accomplish that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in passing a Republican bill that would expand the
rights of millions of patients who are dissatisfied with their
medical care, the House included a privacy provision. But that
provision, which would overturn stronger state protections, has
drawn harsh criticism from privacy advocates, the White House,
congressional Democrats and even some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican bill would require doctors, hospitals and
insurance companies to provide notice of their confidentiality
practices to patients, it would not require patient consent for the
release of records. And though it would prohibit the sale of
confidential medical information, it would permit the release of
patient records for ``health care operations,'' a term critics say
is so broad that it could apply to anything, including, for
instance, the transfer of patient information to companies
marketing new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican bill does very little,'' said one Republican
congressional aide who spoke on condition that he not be otherwise
identified. ``It is too narrow of an approach. We need to insure
that patients' medical records are protected by a strong and
uniform federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Kahn, chief operating officer of the Health
Insurance Association of America, which favors the health care
identifier as a way to cut costs and simplify record keeping, said
that requiring patient consent for the release of all information
would be too burdensome. The Republican bill, Kahn said, ``does
guard access to records.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate will now shift to the Senate, which is not expected
to take up the issue until September. In the meantime, some members
of Congress, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has
introduced a tough privacy bill, are arguing that the 1996
provision requiring the computerized identification code should be
repealed rather than delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to simply say we will put it on hold,'' Leahy
said in an interview Friday. ``We ought to repeal it, and then the
Congress ought to sit down and do its work along with the
administration to determine what makes sense.''

BIGGEST GERMAN BANK ADMITS AND REGRETS DEALING IN NAZI GOLD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, acknowledged on Friday
that it had dealt in Nazi gold during World War II and said it
``regrets most deeply injustices that occurred.'' But it declined
to say whether its wartime officials knew that some of the gold
might have come from concentration camp victims.
</P>
<P>
   The publication on Friday of a historian's report commissioned
by the bank, and the bank's response to it, seem certain to
strengthen, and possibly expand, a class-action suit brought by
lawyers in New York on behalf of Holocaust survivors against both
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. Both banks have long been regarded
by other historians as having played key roles in the financing of
the Nazi war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course these transactions took place,'' said Ronald
Weichert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, referring to the report's
conclusion that the bank had bought more than 4.4 tons of gold from
the Reichsbank, the onetime central bank. ``This gold business was
normal business during the war.'' At wartime values and exchange
rates, the gold was worth some $5 million, about one ninth of its
estimated worth today.
</P>
<P>
   The bank commissioned historians from Israel, the United States,
Britain and Germany to produce an independent report on its wartime
gold dealings _ part of a wave of inquiries inspired by
developments in Switzerland. The Swiss central bank was the biggest
single purchaser of looted gold acquired by Nazi Germany from
countries it occupied and from individual Jews robbed as they faced
death in extermination camps.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Deutsche Bank channeled gold transactions with
the Reichsbank through branches in occupied Austria and Turkey,
then a self-avowed neutral power. Of purchases totaling 4,446
kilograms of gold, the report concluded, 744 kilograms were dental
gold taken from Jews' teeth, wedding bands and personal jewelry
amassed in Berlin by an SS officer named Bruno Melmer.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue for the class-action suit, however, is whether there
is proof that Deutsche Bank's Nazi-era officials _ particularly the
director, Alfred Kurzmeyer, a Swiss citizen, and a board member,
Hermann Abs, a leading financier in the Nazi war effort _ had
direct knowledge of the gold's origins.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank base their rejection of the New
York class-action suit on the assertion that their wartime
officials had no knowledge of the origin of the gold, an assertion
that leaders of German Jewish groups reject.
</P>
<P>
   The historians' report said there was ``no unequivocal record''
that Deutsche Bank's wartime directors ``had knowledge of the
origin of the victims' gold that was purchased from the
Reichsbank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, it said, Abs ``was in possession of far-reaching contacts,
and it is possible that he and perhaps other members of the board
were aware of the existence of victims' gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on that, it is possible they were aware that the gold
was originally the property of the victims of Nazi Germany,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid the same opprobrium that has befallen Swiss
banks for their longtime refusal to acknowledge a moral
responsibility, the German bank said in a statement that it ``fully
acknowledges its moral and ethical responsibility for the darkest
chapter of its history.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not, however, satisfy some German Jews. Ignatz Bubis,
the head of the main Jewish representative body in Germany, said
Deutsche Bank was part of a ``pact of silence'' and had not
divulged all available material to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazi trade in looted and stolen gold was critical to
Hitler's war effort because it provided military purchasers with
hard currency to acquire raw materials for munitions and armaments
factories. The historians' report on Friday said Deutsche Bank's
participation in the trade amounted to only about 1 percent of the
total.

SEEKING REDRESS FOR THE COSTS OF A DEFENSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Okla.)  (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first test of a 1997 federal law that allows people to
recover legal costs of fighting ``frivolous'' criminal charges, a
federal judge in Oklahoma has ordered the Internal Revenue Service
and the Justice Department to turn over their records in a tax
fraud case that collapsed before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case is extraordinary because the Justice Department dropped
all 21 tax and bankruptcy fraud charges against Richard Gardner, a
tax preparer in Tulsa, Okla. According to former tax prosecutors
and criminal tax defense lawyers, once an individual is indicted on
federal tax charges, prosecutors generally insist on a guilty plea
to at least one charge, however minor.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1997 measure sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
individuals who prevail against federal prosecutions that are
``vexatious, frivolous or in bad faith'' can recover their legal
costs from the government.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sven Erik Holmes ruled on July 7 in Tulsa
that Gardner had prevailed over the Justice Department, which
dropped the last three charges in January. That move came just as a
hearing was scheduled to begin on Gardner's motion to dismiss the
three charges on grounds of ``prosecutorial vindictiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The record in the case ``does not inspire confidence'' in the
Justice Department and the IRS, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was one of three businessmen, including the oilman W.A.
``Tex'' Moncrief, who testified in April at Senate Finance
Committee hearings about IRS abuse of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner prepares the sixth-highest number of tax returns in
Oklahoma, filing as many as 4,500 a year. In March 1995, at the
height of the tax season, armed IRS agents and federal marshals
raided his office, seizing all of his computers and files. Gardner
resumed business the next day with new computers, to the
astonishment of one IRS agent who told one of Gardner's employees
that he thought the IRS had closed the business.
</P>
<P>
   R. Thomas Seymour, Gardner's lawyer, said his client's office
was apparently raided because Gardner was chronically late paying
his income taxes and remitting taxes withheld from his employees'
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local IRS office regarded this as an affront,'' Seymour
said. He contended that the agency concocted false charges to
punish Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS would not comment on its conduct, but a Justice
Department prosecutor told Holmes that the new law was a ``radical
departure'' from two centuries of federal prosecution policies and
would invite a host of reimbusement claims by defendants who are
acquitted or against whom all charges are dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes set Aug. 14 as the deadline for the government to turn
over the records, which he will examine in chambers before deciding
whether to turn them over to Gardner. Whether Gardner could recover
his legal fees would be determined at a later hearing.

GORDON STILL SAYS NO TO OPEN-WHEEL RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ To the absolute delight of his card-carrying
bashers, Jeff Gordon admittedly has considered abandoning his
lifestyle as a NASCAR rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the reigning Winston Cup champion and current points
leader, has been approached during the past year about the
possibility of racing against Europe's elite in Formula One. He
also has seriously considered his open-wheeled options in American
Indy-car racing, only to reach this conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it pretty obvious that I'm happy where I'm at and
with what I'm doing,'' said Gordon, lead driver for Hendrick
Motorsports' three-car Chevrolet stable and marquee personality of
the country's fastest-growing spectator sport. ``I've had several
phone calls and I have returned calls (about F1), but I think they
were well aware of what my position is and what my plans are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon reiterated his desire to continue racing with fenders all
around while preparing for today's fifth annual Brickyard 400 at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But the rumors concerning his
foreign intrigue, and vice versa, offer a fresh view of Gordon and
the attention his accomplishments have generated globally.
</P>
<P>
   Gunning for his third Cup championship in the past four years
and second in a row, Gordon will take a 62-point lead over Mark
Martin into the Brickyard 400. Winner of a series-leading five
races in 18 starts this season, and two of the past three, Gordon
and crew chief Ray Evernham appear poised to put a major
second-half points-hurt on perennial Ford nemeses Martin and Dale
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his five victories, Gordon has racked up 12
top-five finishes in 18 starts. His average finish of 8.61 is best
among all drivers. He also has posted 16 top-10 qualifying efforts,
including five poles in 19 sessions. He has qualified on the front
row for eight of the past 10 races, and will start third in the
160-lap event today.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who turns 27 on Tuesday, has posted 32 of his career 34
Cup victories since 1995, the year of his first title.
</P>
<P>
   With all of that going for him, why would Gordon even consider
making the huge career transition represented by Formula One, or
Indy-car racing?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the mega-million contracts, like the three-year, $35
million-a-year deal F1 icon Michael Schumacher signed with Ferrari
recently, Gordon widely is perceived as the only Winston Cup driver
capable of a make-over from Cup to F1. There has also been
speculation that Gordon and wife Brooke have grown weary not only
of the jealous boobirds among spectators who routinely greet them
on race days, but also of the loss of privacy created by their
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Green, owner of Team Kool/Green in the Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Championship Series, thought enough of Gordon to
approach him about driving one of his Indy-cars for the 1996
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not? Is it still possible for Gordon? You're damn right,''
said Mario Andretti, the 1969 Indy 500 winner and 1978 F1 World
Driving Champion. ``I mean, the guy obviously has exceptional
talent. He would need the proper training. But top talent will show
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the winners, there's not that many guys that
are a factor week in and week out. He fits into that category. He
may not win every week, but he is a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could have punched his ticket into F1 last year when Ford
Motor Co.'s Special Vehicle Operations division presented Gordon an
offer to go F1 racing last summer. The move would have served Ford
on two fronts _ by getting Gordon out of a Chevy Monte Carlo and
into a Ford-powered F1 car, and removing him from the Winston Cup
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, according to reports, was prepared to launch an
F1 program for Gordon _ just to keep him in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The wilder the rumor, the more pragmatic Gordon has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was making a serious effort at Formula One, I would have
been driving a Formula Ford about 10 years ago,'' said Gordon, who
rose through the U.S. Auto Club's open-wheeled, oval-track ranks to
become its Silver Crown champion in 1990. ``You just don't go and
compete with those guys. It would be like asking Michael Schumacher
(a two-time F1 champion) to run at Charlotte next week. It's
unheard of. It's not reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I'd like to drive a Formula One car, just to see
what it's like, I don't plan on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reigning powers in CART, Gordon said, dropped the ball on
his services after the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get into it at the first level, like Toyota
Atlantic or Indy Lights,'' Gordon said. ``But every time I talked
to a team or to somebody about driving a car, it was, `Yeah, you
can drive our car if you can fund it.' They weren't interested in
putting somebody in there just with the potential to win races.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony George's rival Indy Racing League did not exist then. So
Gordon pursued and landed a NASCAR Busch Grand National ride and
won rookie of the year honors in 1991. Two years later, Gordon
began racing for Hendrick Motorsports full time and full bore.
</P>
<P>
   John Hendrick, who is running Team Hendrick while his brother
Rick serves a probation for his part in a bribery scandal, said
Gordon has not allowed the buzz about his open-wheeled offers to
distract him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal this year was to win a fourth championship for Rick,''
said John Hendrick, whose brother also is undergoing treatment for
bone marrow cancer. ``We know that we have struggled in the second
halves of the season. So we have refocused ourselves, Jeff and Ray
and that team. They started off by winning and really dominating
the race at Pocono last week. They were awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led 164 of 200 laps around Pocono Raceway, where he also
became the only driver to lead at least one lap in 14 of the 18
races run to date. Gordon also extended his streak of leading at
least one lap to 11 consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   That's extremely bad news for Gordon bashers, and for the rival
drivers who believe Gordon and the No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Refinishes Chevy are operating in a whirl of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much there now,'' said Jarrett, driver of the No.
88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus, and runner-up to Gordon
by 14 points last season. ``But the NBA doesn't stop Michael
Jordan. (Gordon is) an exceptional talent with a really good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan, pole sitter for today's race, said he is counting
on Gordon to run strong at the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, anything Jeff sits in he runs really good,'' said
Irvan, driver of the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac Grand Prix. ``They
have figured out something to make that Monte Carlo run better than
all the others, and better than almost all the other Fords and
Pontiacs, too. They've hit on something.''

   Despite win, U.S. downcast
</P>
<P>
   Victory over South Korea tempered by setback against Lithuania
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ There was lingering disappointment on the faces
and in the body language of the U.S. players Friday.
</P>
<P>
   WoodAnd that was after they clobbered the South Koreans 88-62 in
the preliminary-round finale of the FIBA World Championship of
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Putting their first loss in the tournament behind them proved to
be a difficult task. Even after pounding South Korea, the Americans
talked about missed opportunities 24 hours earlier in a two-point
loss to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, South Korea was probably the weakest team we've played,
so we were supposed to beat them,'' said shooting guard Jimmy
Oliver. ``And Lithuania was the strongest team we've played, and we
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm not really overjoyed. People always talk about Michael
Jordan and guys like that who hate to lose. Well, there's a lot of
guys in the world who hate to lose, and I'm one of them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up, I was thinking about that loss. When I had
lunch, I was thinking about it. We felt like that was a game we
were supposed to win, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States finished the first round 2-1 in its
group. That is good enough to qualify for the second round, but
Lithuania (3-0) has a leg up on the United States going into the
second round, in which 12 of the 16 teams in the tournament have a
chance to advance to the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little disappointed that we're not the No. 1 seed
after the first round,'' David Wood said. ``We're the least
experienced team in this tournament, and it showed in the close
game the other night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment, but I'm not discouraged. We realized
after Italy played us close (in the final exhibition game) that
this wasn't going to be a cakewalk. It's a gift that the loss
doesn't hurt us. We're in the second round, so we go on from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he hopes the loss has therapeutic value for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any coach would tell you that it's probably good to
have a loss once in a while like that,'' he said. ``It's like a
high-seeded college team losing right before the NCAA Tournament.
Sometimes, that can help.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt against the South Koreans. The United States was
in a tie at 15, then pulled away and was never in danger after a
15-6 surge put the U.S. ahead 30-21.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sasser had 17 points to lead all scorers. But as usual, it
was a well-rounded effort by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to this tournament, our goal was to win the gold
medal,'' Sasser said. ``We'd be selling ourselves short if we
didn't think we could still do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the U.S. team goes into the second round as the No. 2
seed from Group C. Three teams each from groups C and D will vie
for four spots in the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, Spain and Australia advanced from Group D. The United
States will play Argentina on Sunday, Spain on Monday and Australia
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team must look ahead, as its record after six games
will provide its seeding when the round of eight begins play
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans couldn't help but look back after the first
round and fret about what went wrong against the Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel like we're a better team (than Lithuania),''
Oliver said. ``If you don't think you can win the gold medal, you
shouldn't be here. If I didn't think we were a world-championship
team, a loss like we had to Lithuania wouldn't bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wood said: ``The problem we had against Lithuania is that we
heard the game plan but it just went in one ear and out the other.
We didn't stick to it. We have to play smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where we have a good chance to win. And I
believe we're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said the way his team responded to the
tough loss against Lithuania made him optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the way our team dealt with the
loss,'' he said. ``I could see the disappointment after that loss.
And we had a film session this morning to go over things that went
wrong. That's never an easy thing for a player. I didn't like those
things as a player. But you have to address the breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were breakdowns Friday, the South Koreans were
incapable of capitalizing on them. They lost all three of their
preliminary games, and the average margin of defeat was 23 points.

CAMBODIANS WHO OPPOSED RULING PARTY ARE FLEEING THEIR HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ For many Cambodians, a vote against the
ruling party in last Sunday's parliamentary election was an act of
physical bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the party has apparently won, a growing number of its
opponents are fleeing their villages for the capital, Phnom Penh,
saying they have been threatened with reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports portray a climate of intimidation in the country's
thousands of isolated villages that political analysts said could
have contributed to the victory of the incumbent leader, Hun Sen.
The frightened villagers said they were supporters of Hun Sen's
chief rivals, Prince Norodom Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   Though two dozen people were reportedly killed during the
month-long election campaign, human rights groups said Friday that
they had not received any confirmed reports of violence since the
election. But given Cambodia's history of political killings,
threats alone appeared to have been enough to sow fear.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary vote counts give Hun Sen's party a commanding lead,
but not enough to form a government without forming a coalition.
The three parties are engaged in a round of negotiations and mutual
recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The reported threats included harassment by armed and sometimes
drunken men, nocturnal visits and reminders of past political
killings. Many of the threats were made in advance of the vote,
promising reprisals later.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition member who said he had received death threats told
a human rights investigator that he stayed in his village just long
enough to vote, then fled to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told, `If you lose, you had better get out of here _
otherwise we'll kill you,''' the investigator said. ``It's the same
story again and again, except that it comes from all around the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   An opposition organizer named Chay Chum, a 64-year-old farmer,
said he had fled because village officials told him, ``When we win,
we'll take you into the field and turn you into fertilizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, Choeng Khemera, said he was told, ``When we win, we're
going to kill all you dogs and eat you.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Heng Layheang, who had organized an opposition
rally, fled her village Friday when armed men began driving back
and forth in front of her house on motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, she said, a man tried to keep her from voting
by telling her that because the polling place was in Hun Sen
School, it was closed to opposition members.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, she said, her children were turned away from the
home of a neighbor who has a television set and were threatened
with being shot.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat said one opposition organizer received a call on his
mobile telephone and heard only the music of a funeral dirge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to judge whether these people are
legitimately afraid or are jumping at shadows,'' said a U.N.
official who spent Friday afternoon interviewing villagers who had
taken refuge at Ranariddh's party headquarters. ``A lot of it is
the history of this country. When someone makes a threat, they take
it seriously.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the villagers who fled here are old enough to remember
the mass killings that followed the takeover by the Khmer Rouge
Communists in 1975. All of them have watched the reprisals of Hun
Sen's forces, who have killed at least 100 opponents since a coup
one year ago in which Ranariddh was ousted as Hun Sen's co-prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the reports of violence and threats, information
is accumulating from opposition party election monitors of a broad
pattern of small-scale cheating that favored the ruling party
during the vote count on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   These reports included accounts of barring opposition monitors
from some polling places and miscounting some opposition votes as
votes for Hun Sen's party. The two opposition leaders have
protested against election irregularities, and Sam Rainsy has
demanded a review of some of the results.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and political analysts said it was impossible
to know how much effect either the threats or any election
irregularities may have had on the outcome. But they said they cast
doubt on the clean bill of health that a number of foreign
monitoring groups have given the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that July 26 and 27 did not in any
way demonstrate an improvement in the human rights and political
climate in this country,'' a Western diplomat said. ``That
assessment is still pending, and premature judgments are not
helpful in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Hun Sen's campaign of political intimidation since
the coup, the diplomat said, ``It is impossible to determine with
scientific precision what impact the past year did or did not have
on the electorate. But we cannot ignore the context of the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cambodian human rights worker, Sophearath Khay, said she was
discouraged at the quick arrival and departure of foreign election
monitors who proclaimed the election a success, then left the
people here to face its frightening aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the foreigner,'' she said. ``Their life is
always assured. If something happens, they can take an airplane and
leave the country. But the Cambodians, where can they go? I'm sorry
to have to say this. But it is important in creating human rights
and democracy to protect the people who believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of about 20 villagers she interviewed Friday at the
headquarters of Ranariddh was a farmer from Kratie province who
said he had fled because members of the ruling party said they
would kill opposition organizers ``one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to transplant my rice crop, but I am afraid to go
back,'' he said. ``My wife was weeping when I left. She said, `What
will I do without you? We have nothing to eat.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she won't tell the children why I left because she
didn't want to scare them,'' he said. ``I am happy to suffer to
help the prince. But when I think of the fate of our nation, I want
to cry.''

 &HT;    Need to replace tanks may shut gas stations
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- About 15 percent of service station owners who have
undergone recent fuel tank inspections say they'll go out of
business rather than pay for the costs of upgrading or replacing
underground storage tanks, a state regulator says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those stations are owner-operator businesses, many of
them hanging on with thin profit margins in locations with less
traffic, said Randy Williams, manager of the underground storage
tank management program at the state's Department of Environmental
Protection. Larger operators are more likely to have prepared for
the year-end deadline for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took care of it years ago,'' said Charles Allen, who
operates a BP station on Roswell Road. ``Most of the big oil
companies have taken care of their people, but the mom and pops out
in the country are going to have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of compliance with various state and federal
regulations is steep:
</P>
<P>
   Upgrades of existing tanks average about $15,000; replacing a
tank costs up to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up leaks costs, on average, about $125,000 and can
reach $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to meet the Dec. 22 deadline for required upgrades could
result in fines of $11,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Those potential costs, plus the requirements for $1 million in
liability insurance, can be a business-killing burden for some
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mom and pop operations in rural Georgia don't have the
volume or the money to cover these costs,'' Williams said. ``Up
until now, about 50 percent of service stations have been
independents, but that will change over the next year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   While there's a proliferation of retail gasoline and convenience
store chains around metro areas and along interstate highways,
don't expect to see them take the place of closed stations on back
roads, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to stay away from the low-volume areas,'' Williams
said. ``If you want to take a ride in the mountains, you'll have to
keep a closer watch on your gas gauge.''

LUYENDYK IROC CASUALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Two-time Indy 500 champion Arie Luyendyk was
scheduled to spend last night under observation at Methodist
Hospital downtown after suffering a ``slight concussion'' in an
explosive crash two laps into the International Race of Champions
finale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two spectators also were struck by debris from the wreck, but
they suffered only minor injuries before, according to some
reports, [ reportedly]claiming the debris as souvenirs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The carnage began when reigning Trans-Am champion Tommy Kendall
brushed the outside wall exiting Turn 4. His car bumped into
Luyendyk's, prompting a half-spin and heavy right-side contact with
the inside wall in front of the pit entrance. Luyendyk's car shed
its bodywork upon impact with the Speedway's new PEDS
energy-absorbing barrier, creating a shower of shrapnel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk's orange car shot back across the track, where it
narrowly was missed by the oncoming Firebirds of Indy Racing League
champion Tony Stewart and seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion
Dale Earnhardt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The race was red-flagged to a halt for 39 minutes, 58 seconds to
clear debris from the cars and the wall. But Kevin Forbes, the
Speedway's director of engineering and construction, said the new
barrier performed as predicted. The wall was installed before the
82nd Indy 500 in May, but yesterday's crash was the first time it
had been slammed into during a race. &QL; 
FRANCE LIKES REVISED TMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR president Bill France Jr. said he was ``pleasantly
surprised'' by reports on the improvements made to Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth for the Craftsman Truck Series race on June
5.
</P>
<P>
   France informed TMS owner Bruton Smith during the Texas 500 on
April 5 that he wanted the water seepage problems in turns 1 and 4
corrected before the nighttime truck event. Smith responded with a
massive rebuild of the 1.5-mile trioval, a project that included a
reconfiguration of the controversial 24-degree banked turns and a
complete repaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read what some of the truck drivers said (postrace), and
apparently there was quite a bit of improvement,'' France said
yesterday. ``We didn't have any water problem there. I was
pleasantly surprised. Our issue when I was down there was the
leakage on the track, not the configuration or the transitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, TMS officials announced that the newly sponsored
Primestar 500 will run on March 28, 1999, preceded a day earlier by
the Coca-Cola 300 NASCAR Busch Grand National race. &QL; 
SCHRADER TOPS PRACTICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader posted the fastest lap of the final Happy Hour
practice for today's Brickyard 400, touring the Speedway at 171.363
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round qualifying saw reigning Brickyard 400 champion
Ricky Rudd and 1995 race-winner Dale Earnhardt elect to stand on
their Thursday qualifying speeds, rather than requalify. They will
start alongside one another in Row 14.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven drivers burning provisionals were 1988 Cup
champion Bill Elliott (37th); inaugural Brickyard pole winner Rick
Mast (42nd) and three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip, who will
start 43rd and last in his debut for car owner Tim Beverley of
Tyler.

 &HT;    Playing at a higher level
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Monday was ``Biscuit Night'' at the Falcon Inn in
Suwanee, where you could come listen to the testimony of a man who
had sinned a great sin and lived not only to tell about it but to
teach from it.
</P>
<P>
   The only criteria for entry was that you be under contract with
the Atlanta Falcons and check your skepticism at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius ``Biscuit'' Bennett, an 11-year NFL veteran and the
Falcons' weakside linebacker whose offseason was the envy of no
one, attended the team's training-camp Bible study group, and,
brother, did he have a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   You know Bennett, the longtime Buffalo linebacker who was
outstanding at Alabama, played in four Super Bowls, five Pro Bowls
and consistently played well enough, including the past two seasons
in Atlanta, to rank 16th in NFL history in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation took a pounding in the offseason, when he was
found guilty of sexual abuse and ended up serving 35 days in jail
for a May 1997 incident in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Good player, bad man.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Biscuit, so named as a toddler who gobbled up his mother's
baking while growing up in Birmingham, is reborn, and he's here to
tell you the presence of Jesus Christ in his life has turned him
straight. Not only that, but he's not drinking anymore, which, he
says, means he doesn't have to battle through practice anymore
after belting down beers the night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through that little struggle, I became a Christian, and that's
the greatest change in my life,'' he said. ``What comes with that,
you can't ask for anything better. I'm a 100 percent better person
that I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Bennett was talking about what the Lord has done
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bennett, who will be 33 in a few weeks, said he was
reborn almost a year ago. ``I surrendered at a preseason game in
Detroit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was about three months after the incident involving a
female acquaintance and one month before he pleaded guilty. He
later was sentenced to 60 days and ended up serving a little more
than half when he was rewarded for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett did his time quietly, but only after some confusion; he
told the judge he had a problem getting his airline tickets
straightened out, only to be referred to as a ``fugitive'' on
Buffalo television. Other than playing some basketball, the man was
a monk.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the jail in handcuffs, all he had with him was a
Bible and guilt. Friday, as he walked from the Falcons' locker room
to a linebacker meeting just hours before the team flew to
Jacksonville for a pair of scrimmages, he wasn't carrying a
playbook. Again he was carrying a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``(While in jail,) I had a lot of visits from pastors in Buffalo
I know,'' he said. ``I started a Bible study in my unit. I fasted
for two weeks. At breakfast and lunch, I didn't eat anything and
just stayed in, praying and reading the word. Sometimes, good is
persecuted and evil prospers. I think that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility remains of a civil trial in connection with
Bennett's case, and he won't go into detail about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil is a smart spirit. When you're trying to do
something to get away from him, he'll put all kinds of obstacles in
the way,'' he said. ``When you think you're strong, he'll put
something in your face a little different from what you're used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly the way things went down. I thought I was past
the point in my life where I had to go out and seek other
pleasures. But I found out I wasn't strong enough yet. The whole
incident was a misunderstanding. The truth is going to come out
someday. I'm never going to speak about my side of it, because it's
going to come out on it's own.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying an outward change in Bennett. He's quieter.
Perhaps a little more intense. More giving of his time to young
players. Fullback Bob Christian, one of the leaders of the Falcons'
Bible study, became a born-again Christian in eighth grade, some 15
years ago. He's been impressed by what he sees in Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for him as a veteran who has played
on an extremely high level for a very long time,'' he said. ``But
coming to our Bible studies, he's very humbled to say, `Hey, I'm
just a baby at this; you're going to have to help me out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown this humility, which I think is a beautiful thing.
It's hard for us as football players and men in general to humble
ourselves and say, you know, `Where do I need help?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves has been helpful, sending Bennett in
the direction of team chaplain Charles Collins, who has been an
important person in Bennett's life the last year as he and wife
Kimberly work to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has some things working against him as he tries to make
the roster. He and middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, 33, both will
carry salary-cap charges of $3.45 million this season, the two
highest on the team. Together, the linebackers' $6.9 million in cap
charges make up more than 13 percent of the team payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Bennett had 115 tackles last season, the
second-highest total in his career, and he added seven sacks. Plus,
the only alternatives are third-year man Craig Sauer, who has just
21 career tackles, and rookie Keith Brooking.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, Reeves said, Bennett's off season will not be held
against him. ``To me, it's done with; he's paid his dues. All I
want to do is see him not have any more problems. (The conviction)
really won't have anything to do with it. Talent, salary cap, all
those things figure into it,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling has always been when someone is part of your
football team ... you're going to treat them just like you would
your family,'' the coach said. ``If they got in trouble, or have a
problem, I'm going to do everything I can to get them help, rehab
or whatever. They make that mistake again, I'll get them the help,
but they're not going to be part of our football team anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett insists he was not among the legion of professional
athletes who saw himself as bullet-proof before, only to end up
fearing for their careers later. ``I've always been a cautious
person. I was a sinner, though. Now, however, with Christ in my
life, I can make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to say, but Tuggle sees some proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see anything negative when you're around him. He
doesn't drink anymore, doesn't go out anymore. I think he's more
focused,'' Tuggle said. ``I don't think you'd change your life as
dramatically as he did because you're worried about your career
ending. I think he just looked in the mirror, saw that man and
wanted to make a change. He found himself.''

 &HT;    Falcons, Jaguars scrimmage today
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When the Atlanta Falcons scrimmage the
Jaguars twice today in the shadow of Alltel Stadium, it will in
most ways be an extension of training camp. That is to say, it will
be a teaching camp.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves and Jags' coach Tom Coughlin plan to
run players through many of the same drills they've been doing in
camp, except that the Falcons' offensive players will match up
against the Jags' defensive players and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   That means a lot of one-on-one, two-on-two, and passing drills,
in which receivers and defensive backs go at it without linemen on
the field. There will be some full-squad work, but there are no
drills scheduled that would involve tackling.
</P>
<P>
   In short, both teams are looking for an opportunity to have
players practice technique on people with whom they aren't
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really and truly, you shouldn't see a lot of difference in
what we've been doing,'' said Reeves, whose team opens the
preseason Friday with a 7:30 p.m. game against the Tennessee Oilers
in the Georgia Dome. ``What I'd like to see is guys ... just play
their techniques and don't worry about playing somebody new.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempo shouuld pick up today, when the Falcons take the
practice fields next to Alltel at 8:15 a.m. and 2:15 p.m. The Jags
will join them a little later both times, as Atlanta gets in extra
special-teams work.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of Falcons, the trip will be old hat. Center-guard
Dave Widell and defensive tackle Esera Tuaolo played for
Jacksonville last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Tom Coughlin, and knowing Dan Reeves as well as I do,
it's going to be a very intense two practices,'' Widell said.
``It's going to be almost a game tempo, without any chop-blocking.
For me, it's not going to be much different, because I'm going to
be practicing against the same guys I practiced against for three
years ... although I won't be giving (Jags' tackle John) Jurkovic
the snap count all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will spend most of his time with the Falcons offense and
might pay special attention to quarterbacks and rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Reeves said, ``some of the guys who've caught
your attention ... will carry that (intensity) over when ...
they're not covering somebody they've been covering, or blocking
somebody they've been blocking.''

 &HT;    Falcons scouting team ready to hit the road
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It will be a while before the Atlanta Falcons start
cutting players, nearly four weeks in fact, but the look of things
in Suwanee will begin to change next week nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Falcons' scouts will begin hitting the road as the
NFL preseason starts, and college programs kick into gear.
</P>
<P>
   These carpetbagging men have been hanging around most of the
last 10 days as training camp has gotten under way, but the time
has come for them to hit the road. They will trickle back into
Suwanee one or two at a time once in a while the rest of the
season, but never again will they all be in the same place at the
same time _ at least not until the NFL draft approaches next April.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to an exception will be when several scouts
show up for some Falcons' home games in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Area scouts Ken Blair, Melvin Bratton, Dick Corrick, Boyd
Dowler, Elbert Dubenion, Bill Groman and Bob Harrison and director
of player personnel/college Reed Johnson spend most of the time
scouting college talent through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But during the NFL preseason, each man will be assigned two NFL
teams to scout. This kind of scouting normally is the province of
director of player personnel/pro Chuck Connor, national scout Mike
Hagen and assistant pro scout Les Snead.
</P>
<P>
   Their jobs will be to attend scrimmages and preseason games to
scout the ``bottom 30'' players on each pro team, or players ranked
higher whom are known to be trade material or on the verge of being
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: If somebody who gets cut is better than what the
Falcons have, and the team can afford him, they might try to sign
him.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will scrimmage the Jaguars today at 8:15 a.m. and
2:15 p.m. on fields adjacent to Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville. The
work will consist largely of drills similar to those the team has
worked on the first week and a half of training camp. No tackling
is scheduled, but that doesn't mean there won't be some. Slow and
easy
</P>
<P>
   There was only one practice Friday, a one-hour, 50-minute
morning session in which players wore helmets and shorts, but no
shoulder pads. Much of the practice was spent on special teams
work, and a little bit of situational practice where offensive
lineman practiced their assignments against stunting defensive
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: Today's change of scenery. Everybody needs it, though
flying is no fun.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: The two fake field goals the Falcons tried Friday morning.
On the first, first-string holder Dan Stryzinski took the snap from
Adam Schreiber _ which was fine _ and yelled ``fire.'' He rolled
out right, and threw a pass to right tackle Corey Louchiey. He was
covered by safety Eugene Robinson, but the ball was in Louchiey's
breadbasket. He dropped it. Oh, the heckling. When the second unit
tried it, holder Steve DeBerg overthrew left tackle Travis Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Rookie Keith Brooking's nose. It's been broken at least
four times over the years, and when it takes a beating, it gets to
looking nasty. There's a big bump in the middle, and since
Brooking's been mixing it up, he's got quite a knot on his schnoz.
He says offseason surgery is likely.
</P>
<P>
   QB controversy
</P>
<P>
   This borders on ridiculous, but it was a very slow day. There
were a few notes in this space Friday about quarterbacks throwing
interceptions and there was hysteria among the prima donnas because
of it. Yesterday it was noted that DeBerg threw a pick to Jessie
Tuggle when there was no offensive player within 10 yards, and that
Chris Chandler had one get away from him, only to have wide-open
defensive end Lester Archambeau drop it. Well, DeBerg -- not
Chandler -- threw the gimme to Archambeau, and both passes, and
four others, were designed to be interceptions. Chandler wants the
world to know he didn't throw anything remotely resembling an
interception, and DeBerg wants it made clear to his legion of fans
that he was only doing what he was told. The Falcons were one of
just a handful of NFL teams not to return an interception last
season and coach Dan Reeves said, ``That was my brilliant idea,
trying to get the quarterbacks to throw interceptions without
telling anybody else so we could set up the blocking and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``230! Man, your lower body weighs 230. I'm not talking about
your rookie year, either.'' _ Safety William White, responding to
linebacker coach Don Blackmon's contention that his NFL playing
weight was 230 pounds when he was with the Patriots from 1981-87.
Oops! Dronett's cool
</P>
<P>
   You won't find any surgical scars on the knees of defensive
tackle Shane Dronett. It says in the Falcons' media guide that he
had a surgically repaired knee in '95, the last of his four seasons
in Denver. Didn't happen. Neither Dronett, nor the Falcons are sure
where the information came from, but it was included in the
seventh-year veteran's file when he came over from Detroit last
year. More research on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Four Falcons did not make the trip to Jacksonville, and trainer
Ron Medlin has gotten to know them well. Cornerback Randy Fuller,
who has missed seven straight practices with a badly sprained
ankle, starting cornerback Ronnie Bradford (hamstring), who has
missed six straight, defensive end Barry Mitchell (quad), who has
missed six straight, and receiver Keith Crawford (hamstring), who
has missed two in a row, stayed in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The boss talks
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Falcons president Taylor Smith doesn't always meet GQ
standards when he shows up at practice in his workout clothes. But
he had good things to say after practice one day this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year ... the coaches didn't know the new players, or even
the players we already had. The players didn't know the coaches.
Nobody knew the offense,'' he said. ``This year, there's no
worrying about switching from the run-and-shoot, and no worrying if
we can understand the new defense. Everybody just seems much more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving life
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Swayda is a happier man these days. He was drafted in the
sixth round last year by the Bears after playing defensive tackle
at Arizona State. But the 6-foot-5, 290-pounder played only at end
in Chicago's camp, and got cut. He started out at end in the
Falcons' camp, but since switching to tackle Saturday, he's working
at No. 2 right tackle behind Dronett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better suited to play inside,'' he said. ``(The Bears) ...
didn't give me a chance inside. I wasn't very happy. I can handle
not making it as long as I get a fair shot at where I think I
should play.'' ... On the flip side, tackles Henry Slay and Mark
Campbell are getting some reps at end, where they're both way out
of position, because Mitchell's absence fouls up the rotations.

 &HT;    EPA steps up hunt for leaky tanks
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Environmental Protection Agency has dispatched
inspectors throughout Georgia because service stations and other
underground fuel tank owners are not meeting federal and state
standards for monitoring tanks for leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Gas station owners have faced increasingly strict regulations in
recent years on underground storage tanks, which can leak fuel into
ground water and streams. The EPA has found 358,000 leaking tanks
nationwide over the last 10 years, including 6,500 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 33,000 underground storage tanks in Georgia,
most of them owned by gas stations and convenience stores. Other
tanks are owned by wholesale suppliers, fleet owners, car rental
firms and others.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of inspections is primarily a check on whether
proper inventory records are kept that would indicate fuel
disappearing from tanks. But the EPA action also is a prelude to
enforcement of a more forceful regulation that requires upgrading
or replacing tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the requirements is expensive, with costs ranging from
$15,000 for an upgrade to $90,000 for replacement. Ten years ago,
the federal government mandated upgrades for tanks to improve
corrosion protection and add catchment basins, automatic shutoff
devices and overfill alarms to prevent spills when fuel is
transferred from tanker trucks to the underground tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old deadline for making the changes _ December 22 _
is fast approaching. As of June 30, about half of the 12,000
properties in Georgia that have underground storage tanks _ many of
them gas stations, which usually have several tanks _ had notified
the state that they have made the upgrades, according to the state
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Tank owners who don't upgrade by the end of the year face fines
of up to $11,000 a day per violation, and fuel distributors are
prohibited from filling their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up federal inspections in Georgia began as the
result of an EPA review last year that indicated the state didn't
have enough inspectors to handle the workload on a timely basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at all the states in the Southeast and at how
frequently a state could inspect all of its stations, and Georgia
was at the bottom of the list,'' said Mike Hollinger, manager of
the EPA's underground storage tank enforcement and compliance
program.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate Georgia had been inspecting underground tanks, a gas
station operator could go nine to 10 years without an inspection,
Hollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the EPA's review, the state increased the frequency of
inspections enough to visit all facilities with underground tanks
once every four years. But that still wasn't enough to satisfy the
EPA, which says stations should be inspected at least every two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply don't have enough inspectors,'' the EPA's
Hollinger said. ``All state governments are short-handed, but
Georgia is probably in worse shape than others in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has 13 full-time equivalent inspectors, said Randy
Williams, manager of the EPD's underground storage tank management
program. This year, state inspectors have checked 3,000 facilities
with underground tanks, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA wants the state to consider setting up a third-party
inspection program similar to how automobile emissions tests are
handled, Hollinger said. The EPA's inspections initially are
targeting service stations near interstate highways, then moving to
stations in rural areas near drinking wells, ground water and other
vulnerable environmental locations. The EPA plans to inspect about
300 gas stations in Georgia through January and can impose
on-the-spot fines of up to $1,000 if a facility isn't properly
monitoring its tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal and state inspections will also serve to warn owners
of the upcoming deadline for upgrades. ``A lot of owners are
waiting until the last minute to upgrade,'' Williams said. ``It's
going to be tough to meet the deadline at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The state won't begin inspecting for that compliance until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure they know this deadline is coming up,''
Hollinger said. ``Time is getting tight, and it's possible there
could be a shortage of contractors to make the upgrades.''

 &HT;    Gordon vs. the Fords
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS -- If the momentum Jeff Gordon brings to the
Brickyard 400 today has anything to say about who wins, Fords,
Pontiacs and other Chevrolets need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is excited about the prospect of taking home a second
Brickyard trophy, not to mention a generous chunk of the $5 million
purse and a No Bull Five $1 million bonus if he should win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have some confidence coming out of the Pocono
race, going to Indy for the Brickyard,'' Gordon said, referring to
last week's victory at Pocono. ``I love this track, love being in
Indianapolis and racing at this facility and winning here again.
Getting back into victory lane is what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've brought a great race car here,'' he said. ``It
kind of brings back memories of '94 to me. We qualified third then,
had a good race car with good horsepower and won the race. We've
got those things again. Hopefully, it'll pay the same results
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Only thing wrong with that scenario is that this one seems
likely to be a Ford parade, led by Dale Jarrett, Mark Martin, Rusty
Wallace, Jeff Burton and Jeremy Mayfield. In Gordon's favor,
though, is that his has been the only Chevrolet able to stay close
in points, and now leads through the first 18 Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chevrolet teams each have won eight races this year,
with Gordon taking five of them. Pontiac has two, both by Bobby
Labonte. The Brickyard, however, has been even between Chevrolet
and Ford. Gordon and Dale Earnhardt won the first two 400s,
followed by the Fords of Jarrett and Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this should make for an interesting race,'' said Jeff
Burton, who won at New Hampshire three weeks ago. ``I really
believe this is going to be as competitive as any race we've had. A
lot of guys can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of those guys _ the No Bull Five of Gordon, Jarrett,
Martin, Wallace and Bobby Labonte _ have more incentive than any of
the others. There's the $1 million bonus waiting if one of them
wins Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll probably see someone win that million,'' Gordon
said. ``There are too great a chance for that not to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no given, however. The keys to running fast at the
Brickyard are being able to charge off the equally shaped second
and fourth turns and then to use the long straightaways. Gordon
showed at Pocono last week that his engine is superior on the
straights.
</P>
<P>
   The aerodynamic drag is more pronounced in the Fords, but the
Taurus makes up for it with increased downforce, allowing them to
shoot through the corners cleaner than the Monte Carlo or Grand
Prix..
</P>
<P>
   ``All these cars are very difficult to drive in traffic, but the
Fords are better,'' Darrell Waltrip said. ``When I got behind a
Taurus at Pocono last weekend, I was stuck.''

   Five in the hunt for $1 mil bonus
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers are in position to win $1 million with a victory in
the Brickyard 400 today. Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace, Bobby Labonte,
Mark Martin and Dale Jarrett were the top five finishers in
Charlotte's Coca Cola 600, making them eligible for the Winston No
Bull incentive program.
</P>
<P>
   If one of these five drivers wins the Brickyard, he will pocket
an additional $1 million from Winston.

finished a career-best third on four occasions this year.

RED SOX WANT VAUGHN, HARRINGTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Harrington has kept his silence about Mo Vaughn and the Red
Sox first baseman's accusations about general manager Dan Duquette
long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be out in the public about all of this
because I didn't want to fan any flames,'' the Sox' chief executive
officer said Friday. ``But it's time for me to step up and say
something about Dan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing personal between Dan and Mo from Dan's side.
It's just not true, and if I thought there was anything of a
personal nature, I'd move in and do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make the final financial decisions for this organization.
It's my call on what we offer Mo for a contract, not Dan's. I have
input from Dan and from Elaine Weddington, but in the end, I have
to approve it, as I do with all of the 40 players on our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington also said the Red Sox never have hired a private
investigator or asked anyone to look into Vaughn's private life.
``We have had Mo for 10 years,'' he said. ``If we don't know what
Mo is like by now, we are in the wrong business. I don't know where
(Vaughn) gets this stuff about being tailed by a private eye, but
it is dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that in spite of all the stories circulating up
to the trading deadline Friday night, the Sox have not tried to
deal Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the best thing to do so people can follow it is to go
back to last season,'' he said. ``We made an offer (on a new
contract) to Mo, and he turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the year was over, we sat down as an organization and
mapped out the future. We set our priorities. Our No. 1 priority
was getting Mo signed. And that's the first thing we set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Thanksgiving, we thought we had a deal. It was inches from
the goal line. When we couldn't get it done, we decided that we
couldn't wait any longer to get our business done. We did that with
(Roger) Clemens, waited for him to make up his mind, and it cost
us. A lot of free agents that year made other deals while we were
waiting for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Dan went down and signed Pedro (Martinez). It was
expensive, but we made the commitment. Then we signed our own
people that we wanted as a nucleus _ (John) Valentin, (Tim)
Wakefield, (Troy) O'Leary, (Nomar) Garciaparra, (Tom) Gordon,
(Jeff) Frye, and some others. They were key to us and on our list.
Then we went out and got (Darren) Lewis and (Damon) Buford and some
of the other players that have helped us out. Everything we set out
to do _ except one, sign Mo _ we got done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I gave Dan a three-year extension in the spring.
Because he got done what we wanted him to do. And I think the
results are showing. He's done an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington says the Red Sox have not given up on signing Vaughn
and will take one last shot at reaching a long-term agreement when
the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offer we made to him last Thanksgiving ($30 million over
three years) would have made him the highest-paid first baseman in
the history of the game. He turned it down. The offer we made to
him in Denver at the All-Star break would have made him the
highest-paid first baseman ever. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say we gave him an offer he couldn't take, one he
had to turn down. I consider both of those offers great deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last January, I went down to Mo's house one morning and had a
cup of coffee with him. I told him that we wanted him to stay with
the Red Sox. That hasn't changed. Right now he wants more money and
more years on his contract than we are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk we are willing to take. Rather than try to trade
him for a couple of prospects, we decided it was better to keep
him. We figured on the last year of his contract, heading toward
free agency, he'd try to have a big year, and if he did, it would
be great for our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To trade Mo Vaughn would have been folly. Last fall (after
negotiations stalled) a couple of clubs inquired, but then they
didn't do any more than that (after Vaughn was arrested in January
on a charge of drunken driving, of which he was later acquitted).
</P>
<P>
   ``When the year is over, we will lock in on getting Mo signed.
But it is my responsibility to do what is in the best interests of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mo decides not to sign here, then we will use that money to
go out and get some other good player or players to make this team
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are either third or fourth in the major leagues
on average in payroll spending. This year we are in the mid-50s
(million dollars). Next year, without signing anyone else, we will
go into the 60s with the contracts we gave out last year. We have
made the financial commitment to have a winning team and we will
continue to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has fulfilled every ounce of strategy we had, except
signing Mo. And he has worked his tail off to do that. It's unfair
for him to be taking all of the criticism that some people have
(directed at him) for this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Friday, ``All these stories about us trying to
trade Mo this week at the trading deadline are just newspaper talk.
We never had any substantive discussions on trading him to anyone.
Every offer we have made to Mo has been based on the economics in
the game at that time. We did this with all of the other players we
wanted, and they signed. I have nothing personal with Mo. We never
asked anyone _ private investigators, Major League Baseball, or
anyone _ to spy on his private life. It's simple. He wants more
money and more years than we have offered him. There's no more (to
the impasse) than that.''

   Bob Long, a retired Massachusetts state trooper now running an
investigative agency, LCF in Braintree, finds it hard to understand
all the noise about background checks on some players about to make
tens of millions of dollars. ``It is done all of the time in big
business,'' says Long. ``That is what our company does. We are
hired by banks, financial institutions, big businesses to look into
the background of people that they are about to make a big
financial commitment to. If they are stockholders in the company
like the Red Sox have (limited partners), then whoever is in charge
has a fiduciary responsibility to make sure that everything is done
to check out that there are no problems that might expose the
company to serious risk.''

   Bob Kraft has said in the past that he would not stay in
Foxborough for the long term if he did not get state help in his
efforts to build a new stadium there, so you can expect talks with
Hartford to heat up in the coming weeks. People within the NFL had
asked Kraft to hold off in trying to move to Connecticut until the
Massachusetts situation played itself out. He did that. Nothing
happened. Now Connecticut has a clean shot to get the Patriots ...
We told you several months ago that Bruins owner Jerry Jacobs came
to Boston to meet with club personnel about a new campaign to sell
tickets to fill the FleetCenter. That is why you have seen
newspaper ads featuring NHL coach of the year Pat Burns and rookie
of the year Sergei Samsonov promoting a special advertising section
on the Bruins in Sunday's Globe. The Bruins never have mounted an
aggressive ticket-selling campaign in the past.

   Congrats to Medford's Jack Riley, recently inducted into the
International Olympic Hall of Fame in Lausanne, Switzerland. Jack,
who had a great hockey career at Dartmouth, played for the US
Olympic team in 1948 and was a player-coach in 1960 when the
Americans won the gold medal at Squaw Valley. Riley coached hockey
at West Point for more than three decades. To date, only a handful
of Americans have received the international Olympic honor ... NFL
officials think the Dallas-Patriots exhibition game in Mexico City
this month has a legitimate shot at being the most watched ever.
Dallas played Houston in front of 112,376 fans in Aztec Stadium
four years ago, but the early indications are that this game could
top it ... For years, the local NFL Alumni chapter has used an
annual golf tournament at Indian Ridge (to be held Monday) to raise
big money for charity. So president Dave O'Brien and his board came
up with a great idea. Why not give something back to golf? So this
year a ``Team Spirit'' scholarship will be given to a Ouimet
Scholar who overcomes unique challenges to succeed on the golf
course. A group of Ouimet Scholars will be used to score this
year's tourney.

IMF TEAM BACKS A $2.2-BILLION LOAN FOR HARD-UP UKRAINE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ An International Monetary Fund team announced
on Friday that it would recommend a $2.2-billion loan to Ukraine,
where the United States has showered assistance for much of this
decade but where the economy remains crippled by corruption and a
lack of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The loan, small by the standards of recent bailouts by the fund
but significant because of the political implications, will help
Ukraine cover foreign and domestic debt payments due in August.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative loan package is subject to a vote of the fund's
board on Aug. 24, and the expected approval would clear the way for
a first payment of $200 million to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced on Friday followed visits to Ukraine
last week by American officials, including Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, Gore said that
Ukraine would find it difficult to get an agreement with the fund
unless the country made bolder economic reforms. Ukraine has a poor
record in keeping its pledges, and in January the fund suspended a
$542 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question whether the steps announced by the
Ukrainian government this week to comply with the fund's conditions
would translate into action.
</P>
<P>
   Among the IMF's demands for the latest loan is a requirement to
cut the Ukrainian budget deficit to 2.5 percent of its economy. In
response, Kuchma has issued a series of decrees to raise revenue
and slash expenditures. But these decrees could be overruled by
Parliament, which is headed by an avowed opponent of the monetary
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best face on the situation, an American Embassy
official said Kuchma had told Gore that he would push hard to
insure that the fund's conditions would be met. The embassy
official said that lately the Ukrainians had been presenting a
``very different tone'' to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming independent in 1991, Ukraine has been a critical
focus of Washington's policy toward the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early successes of American diplomacy in the region
was persuading Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal, which was
the second-largest in the Soviet Union after Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sent about $250 million in aid a year to Ukraine
in an effort to insure its independence and bolster its economy, an
amount that has made Ukraine the third-largest recipient of
American foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has justified the assistance by
asserting that it would be difficult for Russia to become an
imperial power again without Ukraine falling back into its
clutches.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign investors, citing rampant corruption, have largely
stayed away from Ukraine _ the country has attracted a paltry $2
billion in outside direct investment. Industry and agriculture
remain almost entirely state-run.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But under Kuchma, Washington says, Ukraine has followed through
on two important counts.
</P>
<P>
   First, Kuchma is ambivalent _ but unlike Russia not hostile _ to
NATO expansion. And this spring he agreed, under pressure from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to cancel the sale of two
turbines destined for a nuclear reactor in Iran. That made
Ukraine's record on deterring the spread of nuclear arms much
better than Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   In canceling the sale of the turbines, Kuchma found an effective
negotiating tactic with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Kuchma has complained that his country was not
compensated sufficiently for the loss of the $45-million order or
for the loss of other commercial opportunities in Iran. Privately,
Kuchma has told Washington that Ukraine should be rewarded for the
cancellation in ``units of IMF funding,'' a Clinton administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the fund's mission, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi, who has
been in Ukraine all week, said on Friday that Kuchma had agreed to
one of the fund's key conditions but that it would take time for
his agreement to have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   The fund demanded that the Ukrainians close a major loophole in
their tax code that allowed energy companies to escape the value
added tax, a kind of sales tax. Shadman-Valavi said at his news
conference that a decree issued this week by Kuchma closing the
loophole was subject to parliamentary veto.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that some of the most powerful members of
Parliament are managers of Ukraine's major energy companies,
including Yulia Timoshenko, who is head of the Parliament's budget
committee and president of Unified Energy Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, American officials said they were counting on the sudden
good will of the speaker of Parliament, Alexander Tkachenko, an
avowed leftist and opponent of the monetary fund. In a letter last
Friday, Tkachenko ceded Parliament's authority to pass the budget
to Kuchma's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But there was debate among some financial analysts and diplomats
about the legality of the move, since the Ukrainian Constitution
says Parliament must pass the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachenko, who was elected speaker earlier this month, has
spoken repeatedly of his disdain for the fund, calling it of
``dubious charity'' and intent on swallowing Ukraine's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials were somewhat optimistic that Tkachenko
would keep his word and allow the executive branch to decide the
budget, if for no other reason than a special deal between the
President and the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Tkachenko was elected speaker, Kuchma rewarded him
with a big favor. Tkachenko was charged by prosecutors three years
ago with embezzling about $70 million of Ukrainian and U.S.
Export-Import Bank money. The government issued a decree that wiped
away the debts of Tkachenko's agro-industrial enterprise.

MARTIN CHARGES TO FOURTH IROC TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When it comes to the IROC series, nobody rocks
like Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   That became official yesterday in the first appearance of the
22-year-old True Value International Race of Champions Series at
the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Starting from the rear of
the 12-car field by virtue of his points lead, Martin methodically
worked past CART stars Al Unser Jr. and Jimmy Vasser to clinch the
victory and an unprecedented fourth series championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me. It is the pride of my career,'' said
Martin, who has also won the title matching 12 drivers from various
forms of motorsports for a record-setting third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of great days this year, and this one was
special,'' said Martin, ace driver for Roush Racing in the NASCAR
Winston Cup Series. ``I've been sweating this championship a good
bit. I wanted to make it four, because I can't believe this is
anything but luck. My luck's going to run out one of these days in
IROC. When it does, I'll be able to say I had my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who began the day with a 12-point lead over Roush
teammate Jeff Burton, needed only to finish fourth in his aqua blue
Pontiac Firebird to clinch. Martin moved into fourth on lap 16 of
the scheduled 40 making up the 100-miler. He passed reigning Busch
Grand National champion Randy LaJoie on lap 19, leaving two-time
Indy 500 champion Unser Jr. and 1996 Championship Auto Racing Teams
champion Vasser in his way.
</P>
<P>
   Martin drove under Unser, who was racing at the Speedway for the
first time since his Indy 500 victory in 1994, in Turn 3 on lap 28.
Vasser's lead at that point was 0.750 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Running laps at 155-plus mph and exploiting his drafting savvy,
Martin shaved Vasser's advantage to 0.175 seconds on lap 36. Martin
set up Vasser for a pass exiting Turn 4 on lap 37 and neatly moved
into the lead down the long front straight. Unser followed Martin's
draft, dropping Vasser _ who led a race-high 36 laps _ to third.
</P>
<P>
   Unser closed to within two car lengths over the final three laps
but fell 0.247 seconds short of what would have been a storybook
return victory before a series record crowd of 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, whose IROC titles have come in 1994, '96, '97 and '98,
finished with 86 points _ 29 ahead of Burton. Martin earned
$225,000 from a total purse of $760,000.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 31 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, July 21, the Senate voted, 61-39, to table, or set
aside, an amendment that would have required handguns to be sold
with child-proof safety devices. Supporters said the amendment
would protect children from handgun accidents. Opponents said the
amendment was an unnecessary federal regulation and would not
accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside, or
rejecting, the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, July 22, the Senate voted, 69-31, to table, or set
aside, a measure that would have allowed federal prosecution of gun
owners whose weapons were used by children in a crime, if the guns
were stored insecurely. Supporters said the measure would have kept
guns out of children's hands by requiring people to keep their guns
out of reach. Opponents argued that innocent people could have been
held responsible if children found a way to access the guns, even
if the weapons were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors setting
aside, or rejecting, the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 24, the House approved, 216-210, a
Republican-sponsored patients' rights bill that would allow
patients to seek pediatric and gynecological care, complain when
they believe they have been denied adequate care and require
insurances to pay for reasonable emergency room visits. Supporters
said the bill would provide greater access to managed care and
allow people to set up tax-free medical savings accounts. Opponents
criticized the bill for not allowing chronically-ill patients to
visit medical specialists and for not protecting people who buy
individual insurance plans. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GAYRIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 214-212, an amendment that
would effectively end federal housing support for San Francisco.
The measure would amend a housing appropriations bill by
prohibiting the use of federal funds ``to implement'' a San
Francisco regulation that requires all employers doing business
with the city to provide health and other benefits to same-sex
partners. Supporters said businesses should not be forced to adopt
policies they find morally objectionable. Opponents argued the
amendment was bigoted. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 259-164, a $94 billion veterans
and public housing spending bill that overhauls federal housing
policy and restricts spending on environmental programs. Supporters
said the bill provides needed spending for veterans' programs and
maintains the commitment to providing access to housing for
low-income families. Opponents said the bill fails to go far enough
to meet the needs of the environment and welfare-to-work programs.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TRANSPORT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 391-25, a $46 billion
transportation spending bill that provides more highway money,
increases funding for aviation improvements and supports Amtrak's
recovery plan. Supporters said it will help ensure that
transportation and safety needs will be met in the next century.
Opponents criticized the bill because it increases funding for air
and rail systems but reduces funding to the U.S. Coast Guard. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

Singletary making Hall enshrinement a family affair
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CANTON, Ohio _ For the first time in the history of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, a wife will present her
husband today in the nationally televised event at 2121 George
Halas Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Singletary, whose husband, former Chicago Bears middle
linebacker Mike Singletary, will be immortalized as one of the
greatest ever to play the game, will make history when she steps to
the podium and makes her speech before a crowd of about 15,000 and
an ESPN2 audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not nervous about it,'' Kim said. ``Actually, I'm
very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband grew up in Houston, played at Worthing High School
and became a three-time All-America selection at Baylor before
playing 12 years for the Chicago Bears, who lead the NFL in Hall
enshrinees with what will now be 24.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary set a Bears record with 10 Pro Bowl selections and
earned a Super Bowl ring with the 1985 Bears. He was voted NFL
Defensive Player of the Year in 1985 and 1988 and NFL Man of the
Year for his involvement in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Singletary would select Grant Teaff, his former
coach at Baylor, or Buddy Ryan, his former defensive coordinator in
Chicago, as his presenter. But there was no indecisiveness about
his choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is Kim my wife and mother to our seven children, but
she's been my best friend since we met at Baylor,'' Singletary
said. ``She was my biggest fan. I wouldn't be where I am today
without her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singletarys reside in Barrington, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He
sits on the board of several prominent Chicago companies and spends
much of his time traveling the country making motivational
speeches. He also has authored a book on fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary's mother, father, brothers and sisters reside in
Houston. All are in Canton for today's ceremonies, which precede
tonight's game between Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh. The game at
Fawcett Stadium is being played in prime time for the first time.
</P>

Philadelphia receiver Tommy McDonald will be enshrined, increasing
the membership of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to 194.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no greater honor that a football player can have,''
said McDonald, who was recommended by the veterans committee and
voted in by the 36-member board of selectors.
</P>
<P>
   Like Singletary, McDonald and Munoz made unusual choices for
their presenters.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald chose former Philadelphia Daily News sportswriter Ray
Didinger, who now works at NFL Films. Didinger covered McDonald and
worked hard lobbying voters to convince them to vote for him. Munoz
selected his son, Michael, who at 16 is already larger than his
father, who is 6-6 and 285 pounds. Walter Payton is the only other
inductee to be introduced by his son.
</P>
<P>
   Krause, who played 16 years and is still the league's career
interception leader with 81, will be presented by former Vikings
coach Jerry Burns. Former Dolphins coach Don Shula, who was
inducted last year, will introduce Stephenson.

CLINTON IN NEW YORK'S HAMPTONS TO GOLF AND RAISE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ Having tried in the White House Rose Garden to
blunt questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
President Clinton flew to East Hampton on Friday afternoon to relax
on the golf course and raise money on the rubber-lobster circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was traveling with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
introduced him Friday night at the Long Island home of investment
banker Bruce Wasserstein. Over not only Long Island lobster but
also tuna and lamb, the Clintons raised $600,000 for the Democrats
from guests that the party calls ``major supporters'' who have
``the highest level of commitment to the ideals of the Democratic
Party.'' Each couple contributed $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed determined to shake his woes in Washington
and have a good time. After boarding Air Force One, he stuck his
head in the aft cabin where reporters sit and said, ``Guys, you got
to have fun this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are guests at the estate of filmmaker Steven
Spielberg, who recently screened his movie ``Saving Private Ryan''
at the White House. Saturday morning, Clinton planns to deliver his
weekly radio address, pushing legislation that he calls the
Patients' Bill of Rights for people enrolled in managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, a Republican from Long Island, is scheduled
to join the president as he delivers the address _ evidence, one
White House aide said, that Clinton has not been rendered
politically ``radioactive'' by this week's developments in the
Lewinsky investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The president plans to spend most of Saturday golfing before
starring at two more fund-raisers. The first, a party at the home
of Jonathan Sheffer, founder of the Eos orchestra, is expected to
raise $400,000 from business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton plans to raise $300,000 more at the Amagansett home
of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, the actors. That fund-raiser is
one of the Democrats' ``Saxophone Club'' events, aimed at a much
broader audience. Guests were asked to contribute $250, and the
Democrats are expecting about 1,100 people to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spend Sunday on Long Island, as originally planned,
the Clintons appeared to be leaning toward returning to Washington
on Sunday morning in time for church, White House aides said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton has managed for the most part to shake his large press
contingent this weekend, and only the small, rotating ``pool'' of
journalists that is always nearby has stuck with him.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many reporters, camera crews and others travel with
the president, whose plans are disclosed on short notice, a central
White House office reserves rooms for them. In this case, it placed
almost all of them here in Hauppauge, more than an hour's drive
from East Hampton. There simply were not enough rooms available
closer to Clinton's retreat, aides said.

JUDGE REJECTS TWO SEPARATE DRUG MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio)  (lh) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge has blocked two mergers involving four of the
nation's biggest drug wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Sporkin of U.S. District Court in Washington ruled
Friday that McKesson Corp.'s $1.72 billion purchase of Amerisource
Health Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc.'s $2.41 billion takeover of
the Bergen Brunswig Corporation would violate federal antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sided with the Federal Trade Commission, which argued
that the two combinations would create too much market power for
McKesson and Cardinal and would substantially reduce competition.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson, based in San Francisco, said Friday that it was highly
unlikely that it would pursue plans to merge with Amerisource,
based in Valley Forge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cardinal, based in Dublin, Ohio, declined to
comment on the possibility of an appeal. Both companies said they
would review the decision, which was announced after the stock
market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Parker, deputy director of the FTC Bureau of
Competition, hailed the decision. ``Competition in the market for
drug wholesaling is protected as a result of this decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the commission asked Sporkin to issue a preliminary
injunction blocking the mergers, arguing that they would lead to
higher prices and reduced service for hospitals, pharmacies and
other drug purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   The two mergers were announced within five weeks of each other
last August and September and could have given the combined
companies control of 67 percent of the $64 billion domestic market.
The Cardinal-Bergen merger would have created the biggest drug
wholesaler, displacing McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated then that the merger announcement by
McKesson, which followed the Cardinal deal, might prompt government
action and ultimately sabotage both mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies argued that their profit margins were declining.
They said their customers would still have had ample choices by
creating their own warehouses and buying directly from
manufacturers, as some big drugstore chains do.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP;
Co., noted that the manufacturers were the big earners in the
pharmaceutical industry, not the distributors or retailers. He said
consumers would have benefited from the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials questioned whether smaller retailers
would have been able to defend themselves against the market power
of the giant wholesalers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, before Sporkin's ruling, shares
of McKesson fell $2.9375, to $80.625; Cardinal was down $1.578125,
to $96.0625; Amerisource rose $1.8125, to $76.125, and Bergen fell
$1, to $53.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said that many investors had taken account of
the possibility that the mergers might be thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   They said the share prices of McKesson and Cardinal already
reflected that possibility but that shares of Amerisource and
Bergen Brunswig, based in Orange, Calif., might decline somewhat
when the market reopens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence C. Marsh, a health care analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney, said that even without the mergers, McKesson and Cardinal
were emerging as ``the two industry superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson has expanded into the hospital supply business,
reaching deals with two big hospital groups, Premier Inc. and the
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. McKesson has also announced
agreements with the Rite-Aid drugstore chain and American Stores,
another big retail group.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal, for its part, recently said it would acquire the R.P.
Scherer Corp., which makes drug delivery products such as gelatine
capsules, in a $2.2 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said McKesson and Cardinal might look for acquisitions
among smaller drug wholesalers such as Bindley Western Industries,
which might cause government regulators less alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But David Risinger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said he doubted that the four companies would soon aggressively
pursue other major acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All four companies are worn out'' after their yearlong duel
with the FTC, he said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2)  
 (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's mind-boggling to consider what $1 trillion is worth. It
makes up the total gross domestic product of Britain. It could buy
the majority of California's seven million single-family homes and
condominiums. It is also the value of all announced
merger-and-acquisition activity in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   On average, there have been 29 deals a day. You can't turn on
the television without hearing some executive extol the benefits of
the latest strategic combination. But one thing seems missing:
Where are the investment bankers who are brokering all these
mergers?
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the 1980s, when self-described ``masters of the
universe'' hired publicists to make sure that Fortune and The Wall
Street Journal touted their feats. These days, if you ask a merger
professional to name a larger-than-life personality in the field _
someone on the order of Bruce Wasserstein, the creative takeover
strategist renowned for courting the press, or Robert F. Greenhill,
the Morgan Stanley deal maker who later became chairman and chief
executive of Smith Barney _ the telephone line nearly goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone,'' one lawyer said. ``That's tough,''
a banking executive said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, publicity is out and modesty is in. The flamboyant
power brokers of a decade ago have been supplanted by the likes of
Gene T. Sykes, a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. partner whom you probably
have never heard of but has been involved in 4 of the top 15 deals
this year. Or Thomas C. King, the Salomon Smith Barney banker who
was chief strategist for Worldcom when it outmaneuvered British
Telecommunications with a $37 billion bid for MCI Communications
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need this,'' King said one afternoon in June, fretting
about a press interview. Colleagues could interpret it as
grandstanding to bolster his own career, he complained. It might
antagonize his bosses, who value teamwork. And clients don't like
press hounds. ``Anyone who thinks they are a one-man show in M&AMP;A.,
you don't want as a banker,'' King said. ``There are more issues
than any one man can deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   With the volume of mergers and acquisitions climbing ever
higher, his is a common sentiment on Wall Street. And as the taste
for mergers has changed, the investment banker's style has shifted
with it. Investment banks have transformed themselves from
deal-making and deal-breaking factories _ which companies hired to
shield themselves from the likes of Carl C. Icahn or Henry R.
Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts _ into institutions where the
patina of a brand name attracts business for a multitude of
services offered to clients.
</P>
<P>
   What has emerged is the 90s banker _ an expert in his client's
industry who values teamwork over public aggrandizement and takes a
backseat to the companies and corporate executives he represents.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the bankers are playing the role of trusted adviser
because companies are doing the swashbuckling themselves. For all
the deals being forged, fewer companies, on a percentage basis, are
enlisting the help of investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11,119 domestic deals announced last year, about 80
percent were negotiated without a banker on either side, up from 59
percent in 1988, according to the Securities Data Co., a research
firm in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   As one might guess, the bulk of the transactions are at the
smaller end of the spectrum, deals valued at less than $250
million. And there is still a bonanza of work to go around because
the number of deals has increased threefold.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at large companies have taken to negotiating
their own terms, too, like Sanford I. Weill of Travelers Group, who
talked directly to Citicorp's chief executive, John S. Reed, when
those companies decided to merge last spring.
</P>
<P>
   That is because today's deals are more likely to be friendly;
the raging bull market has made corporate stock a currency that
acquirers dole out generously and few targets are inclined to turn
down. As a result, the brash strategist who fended off cash-toting
raiders in the 80s is passe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a period where bombast counts,'' said Joseph H.
Flom, a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom who was a
pioneer in offering legal advice about takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible to identify pre-eminent deal makers. But
instead of a list of bold strategists who conjure up deals and then
sell companies on their virtues, the lineup is full of smart
tacticians who help executives weigh the companies that will be
their best long-term partners. An examination of this year's
biggest deals and interviews with dozens of merger professionals _
and the executives who hire them _ produced a list of four bankers
who are widely recognized as at the top of their field.
</P>
<P>
   As the merger activity of 1998 might suggest, these are the
bankers who dominate deal-making in the financial services,
technology and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, deal makers were a tightknit group of heavy hitters
who dined in stylish restaurants after days of pounding the
conference room table. It was hard to find an empty bar stool at
Harry's at Hanover Square, a favorite Wall Street hangout, where
traders buzzed about the latest takeover battle. There was no
e-mail, so breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Manhattan's East Side
was a must for bankers hoping to swap gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bankers' numbers have swelled and they are wired _
literally. Voice mail and e-mail are favored ways to communicate
with colleagues, especially with the global merger wave forcing
more bankers onto airplanes to visit clients. Teams in New York now
work with specialists in Europe and Asia. As a result, bankers are
less clubby, and their frenetic pace is more grueling than
glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   One thing hasn't changed. Deal-making is still very much the
boys' club it was 10 years ago. Few women have emerged into
prominence, although more are showing up at the table, like Jill
Greenthal, the lead media and telecommunications banker at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, who represented Tele-Communications
Inc. in the negotiations that led to its deal to be acquired by
AT&AMP;T for $36 billion.

 &HT;    Burt Reynolds bankruptcy plan nearing approval
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Burt Reynolds is on his way out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors for the actor ``still have some terms that we're
arguing over but we're substantially in agreement'' on his plan of
reorganization, their lawyer, Bob Gilbert, said from West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds declared more than $10 million in debts when he filed
for Chapter 11 protection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now goes before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Hyman for
approval at a hearing tentatively set for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Reynolds would be out of bankruptcy protection and could
get on with his life,'' Jim Leshaw, one of Reynolds' lawyers, said
from Miami. ``Mr. Reynolds is very happy that the committee is
supporting the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the proposed plan, creditors would get up to $500,000 of
Reynolds' future earnings over two years, Leshaw said. An earlier
plan had offered $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds will still probably lose his beloved BR Ranch in
Jupiter Farms. His original plan would have given him the option to
keep the 160-acre ranch and tourist attraction for $4.65 million.
In the new plan, should a buyer make an offer, Reynolds would be
allowed to match the sales price. If he couldn't, the ranch would
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements filed by his lawyers, Reynolds'
financial problems started in the late 1980s when he lost $15
million invested in the Po-Folks. Gross revenues to Burt Reynolds
Productions Inc., which ran $8 million to $12 million a year in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, dropped from $6.2 million in 1992 to
$725,000 in 1995, his lawyers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   And don't mistake bankers' public humility for an ego deficit.
In that regard, they are still very much like their predecessors.
``The difference between you and me is you observe history, I make
it,'' one deal maker told a reporter, in a nod to his own
self-importance. The difference is that such behavior is largely
kept behind closed doors. ``If you are perceived as a publicity
hog,'' warned Joseph R. Perella, head of the global investment
banking arm of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, ``you will be ostracized
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers today are all too cognizant of the antics of their 1980s
counterparts, some of whose reputations crashed along with the
market in 1987, and a few of whom went to jail for insider trading.
With the kind of salaries and bonuses that bankers are raking in _
anywhere from $150,000 for a first-year associate to $3 million to
$5 million for a seasoned professional _ no one wants to be a
reminder of those gluttonous days. Especially now, industry
executives say, because most bankers earn even more than Wall
Street types did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients recognize that they are paying big fees, but they
would be offended if they saw it flaunted,'' said one banker who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. `If you look at compensation,
most of the people we work for, our clients, don't earn what we
earn.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a late afternoon in July, and Scott D. Sullivan, the chief
financial officer of Worldcom, is describing one of his worst
encounters with a banker. ``He had every company in the industry in
his pitchbook,'' Sullivan groaned, ticking off a few of the 100
companies the banker was promoting as potential merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes into the pitch, Sullivan realized that his visitor
had not studied Worldcom's business plan. He quickly showed him the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like throwing 10 strands of spaghetti at the wall and
seeing what would stick,'' he said of the banker's proposals.
``They discredit themselves when they do that, and I have a long
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a different game a decade ago, when serving up a friendly
partner was enough to get you hired. Then, buyout firms borrowed
money, with help from the likes of the junk-bond merchant Drexel
Burnham Lambert, to buy companies in distress. The most valuable
bankers fended off those unwelcome advances, either through clever
financing or finding a ``white knight'' to save a company from a
predator's clutches. But now that only 1 of every 200 deals is
hostile _ a tenth of the proportion in the late 1980s _ those
skills are out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to ask yourself, `What does an investment banker
bring?' '' said Steve Stetz, corporate vice president for mergers
and acquisitions at the Monsanto Corp., which agreed earlier this
year to merge with American Home Products in a $34.4 billion deal.
``It's certainly not valuation skills. We can do that. It's clearly
not negotiating skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Bankers can offer detailed knowledge of an
industry's players and share insight about what corporate strategy
will prevail in the years ahead. That is why Merrill Lynch recently
hired Alan J. Biloski, who has a PhD in chemistry and worked in
Merck's research department, to join its team of pharmaceutical
deal makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 80s, M&AMP;A advisers were mainly execution specialists,
called in by the client to get a deal done,'' said Jack Levy, head
of global mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch. ``Now a key
part of our value-added is getting with the client at a far earlier
stage to assist in their forward strategic thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate executives grew up in the merger era, and so they
are more familiar with deals than their predecessors were. For
instance, Peter Currie, chief administrative officer of Netscape
Communications, worked in media and telecommunications M&AMP;A at
Morgan Stanley. William M. Wicker left his job as co-head of the
energy mergers team at Credit Suisse First Boston to head up the
corporate development group at Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you are going to open your pitchbook and they
are going to say, `We never thought of that,' '' said King, of
Salomon Smith Barney. ``You have to show the clever structure. You
have to have a tax angle to get their attention. Or you need some
special color about what the seller is thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of advice that companies are happy to pay for.
But as mergers become an almost universal path to growth for
companies, increasing numbers of them, like Bay's rival Cisco
Systems, are choosing to do without expensive advice. Since 1993,
Cisco has made 24 acquisitions without a banker.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to Mike Volpi, Cisco's vice president of business
development. Before joining the company in 1994, Volpi, 31, worked
as a mechanical engineer at Hewlett-Packard; he also earned
bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering and then
an MBA from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our strategy better than any investment banker,''
Volpi said. Twenty-five people report to him, including a former
investment banker for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and a former
analyst for Morgan Stanley. Volpi relies on a network of venture
capitalists for ideas, as well as on tips from Cisco's vast sales
force. He also tracks the efforts of 200 entrepreneurs for
potential acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco usually buys companies valued at $50 million to $300
million that are willing to accept its stock as payment _ all of
which keeps deals simpler, Volpi said. New recruits to his
department are teamed with more experienced staffers, and once they
have a few purchases in their portfolio, they get their own small
deal to work on. ``I teach them how to do acquisitions,'' he said.
``The way to learn is through experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean bankers are irrelevant? Hardly. But to remain
profitable, investment banks have had to become bigger, broader
institutions, selling advice alongside other products.
</P>
<P>
   McClatchy Newspapers' recent acquisition of Cowles Media is a
good example of the one-stop shopping trend. First, McClatchy was
advised by a team in the media group of Salomon Smith Barney,
including a banker with experience running a British cable and
telephone company.

<P>
   Salomon also underwrote a $1.3 billion loan to finance the
transaction. When the deal closed, McClatchy announced that it sold
the Cowles book and magazine properties it didn't want, a deal also
brokered by Salomon. Lastly, the bankers set up the road show in
which management toured the country to sell the deal to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-stop shopping is more acceptable to corporate clients
today than it used to be,'' said Brian D. Finn, the former co-head
of mergers and acquisitions for Credit Suisse First Boston who now
works at Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice. ``They used to be more skeptical
and less trusting of investment bankers. But clients recognize now
it is more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the key business strategy for investment banks has
been to build a brand. When the bank itself possesses the star
quality, it isn't so beholden to the whims of individual
celebrities who can take a book of business with them if they
defect.
</P>
<P>
   The First Boston Group learned that lesson firsthand. Perella
and Wasserstein were among Wall Street's highest-profile deal
makers when they worked at the firm, involved in the takeover
battle between the Bendix Corp.and the Martin Marietta Corp. and
the war for control of Conoco. So when they announced in 1988 that
they were leaving to start their own venture, it was a blow to
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers defected. Competitors sympathized, then poached clients.
Only recently has the bank, now Credit Suisse First Boston,
re-emerged as a competitor to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Perella, for his part, left Wasserstein for the comfort of
Morgan Stanley. And Wasserstein still heads Wasserstein Perella,
although it hasn't recovered the glory of its early days. In a
further indication of how times have changed, the once voluble
Wasserstein did not return phone calls requesting an interview for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms are clearly thriving in the new environment. Merrill
Lynch, for instance, which ranked seventh in merger activity as
little as a decade ago, clocked in at No. 1 last year. But Lazard
Freres &AMP; Co., which depends on rainmakers with long-term
relationships to bring in business, has seen little growth in its
market share in deals, according to Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many bankers who made headlines in the 1980s can
still be found on Wall Street. Greenhill, the former Morgan Stanley
banker, started his own shop in 1996 and was involved in this
year's merger between Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment. Felix
G. Rohatyn, of Lazard fame, was still making deals on the Street
until last year, when he left to become ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a media darling that investment banking has
spawned in this generation is Frank P. Quattrone, the flamboyant
technology maven who in 1996 defected with a team from Morgan
Stanley to establish a high-technology unit for Deutsche Bank in
Silicon Valley and just recently moved to Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone uses his personality almost as a calling card, a tool
to remind clients that he's there. ``At the end of the day, clients
are people,'' he said. ``If you come across as a down-to-earth guy
with a sense of your own being, they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even more essential in the competitive world of
high-technology banking. Silicon Valley has a distinct culture, and
bankers often play to that _ keeping offices on tony Sand Hill
Road, spending weekends in the Napa Valley, calling on venture
capitalists as often as companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to understand the community you are going to serve,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Quattrone nods to the notion that the institution _ the
likes of Goldman or Morgan Stanley, or his new firm _ is necessary
to land the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can combine the personality with the platform, than
maybe you have the best of both worlds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world you can only wonder how bankers will evolve in
the 21st century. If the market continues its current pace, they
could look a lot like they do now, only a little more weary.
</P>
<P>
   But if stocks crash and 80s-style corporate raiders decide that
companies are ripe for takeover, the profile could change. Then,
corporations will need defensive strategists to help fend off
predators.
</P>
<P>
   And executives will be back on television, this time explaining
why they shouldn't be bought. Corporate America will need a new
style of deal maker. And those larger-than-life masters of the
universe may roam Wall Street yet again.

SECOND OFFICER SLAIN IN CAPITOL SHOOTOUT IS BURIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mo., Texas)  (lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officer Jacob Chestnut of the Capitol Police was
buried in Arlington National Cemetery on Friday under skies
streaked with gray after a funeral in which hundreds of police
officers wept and laughed alongside dozens of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the way he died that made him a hero,'' Gary
Albrecht, the chief of the Capitol Police, told the more than 3,000
people who had gathered to mourn, ``but the way that he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral took place a week after Chestnut and John Gibson, a
detective with the Capitol Police, were gunned down in the Capitol.
Russell Weston Jr., identified by law-enforcement officials as the
gunman, remains in serious condition at D.C. General Hospital,
recuperating from wounds he suffered in an exchange of gunfire with
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   At Chestnut's funeral on Friday, the sounds of music and
mourning filled the Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Md.,
where a choir of more than 300 in white robes sang hymns that
echoed off the building's vaulted ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Many pews were filled with uniformed officers from police forces
throughout the United States. Members of Congress sat in one
section and Chestnut's widow, Wenling, and his children, as well as
Gibson's widow and children, sat in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's flag-draped coffin at the front of the church was
surrounded by elaborate floral arrangements sent by police across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. Chestnut did not see people as white or black, as liberal
or conservative, as rich or poor,'' said the Rev. Grainger
Browning, pastor at Ebenezer. ``He saw them as God saw them.'' His
remarks were punctuated by shouts of ``Amen!'' and ``You tell it!''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's younger brother, Henry, remembered him as someone who
had encouraged him and inspired others. ``He had a way of putting
his hand on people's shoulder even when he wasn't actually touching
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Chestnut noted that his brother's funeral had even brought
together resolute political opponents. When Browning asked those in
the congregation to turn to the person beside them and hug, the
Democratic House leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and the
Republican majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, embraced warmly.
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., found himself hugging Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the church, Attorney General Janet Reno and
Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, embraced.
</P>
<P>
   To the strains of ``Amazing Grace'' from a Chicago police pipe
and drum corps, Chestnut's coffin was placed in a hearse.
Accompanied by dozens of police officers on motorcycles and in
other police vehicles, the hearse traveled more than 20 miles to
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route, hundreds gathered and saluted as the cortege
passed. Chestnut, 58, a Vietnam veteran who served in the Air
Force, was given full military honors. Gibson, 42, who was not a
veteran, was buried at Arlington on Thursday with the permission of
the secretary of the Army.
</P>

<P>
   Weston's lawyers said they expected him to be able to appear in
court on Aug. 18 to face charges of killing two federal
law-enforcement officers. Judge Deborah Robinson authorized four
mental health experts, two for the prosecution and two for the
defense, to examine Weston in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said Friday that a security camera
inside the Capitol's Document Room entrance had captured part of
the action that resulted in Chestnut's death. The tape shows an
attacker's left hand, gun drawn, and then the officer, who was
talking to a tourist, collapsing to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, whose face is obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, is
seen walking through a metal detector and then moving the pistol
into his right hand. After a few steps, his body contorts, as
though he shot or was shot at, before he runs out of the picture
frame.

AMERICAN AND IRANIAN TRY TO BRIDGE DECADES OF PAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ A former hostage from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran came
together here Friday with one of the former Iranian students who
directed the seizure of the embassy for 444 days from November 1979
to January 1981, for what the organizers hoped would be a dialogue
of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rosen, a 54-year-old New Yorker who was the embassy press
spokesman when he was seized and is now executive director of
public affairs at Teachers College of Columbia University, shook
hands after two-and-a-half hours of debate in the UNESCO
headquarters in Paris with Abbas Abdi, his 42-year-old former
captor who later became an influential political journalist in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But about all they actually agreed on, at least in public, was
that it would take a lot more talks like theirs to overcome the
hostility of the last 20 years and build a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we call the hostage crisis was actually something closer
to a defeat for both sides,'' Rosen said, ``but must both sides be
bad losers? Let's not dwell constantly on who did what to whom, and
when.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen acknowledged that U.S. support for the coup that ousted
Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and restored the shah to
power from 1953 to 1979 had alienated many Iranians, but said that
neither Americans nor Iranians could overcome the past without
acknowledging mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi did not agree that occupying the embassy was a mistake, and
said it was a spontaneous decision made by students who feared the
United States was trying to thwart the Islamic Republic that had
replaced the shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation deserves more apology than a handful of hostages,''
he said, but concluded, ``I hope the relationship between Iran and
the United States should go back to what it was before 1953, before
the coup.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men talked privately in Paris for the last two days
under the auspices of the Center for World Dialogue, a group based
in Cyprus. Hooshang Amirahmadi, president of the American-Iranian
Council, Inc., a Princeton, N.J., group that promotes understanding
between the United States and Iran, said his organization had
supported the dialogue as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said he had decided to come because, he said, ``I sensed
the time had come to put a close to the 444 days that had caused me
great pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can replace a direct dialogue between the two
governments,'' he said. ``I'm convinced that two decades of
animosity between our two countries is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The past cannot be altered _ instead we must focus on the
years ahead and endeavor to build a better future,'' said Abdi, who
was imprisoned in Iran for eight months in 1993 but would not
discuss that Friday. ``While the rhetoric of the U.S. government
has softened, deeds remain far behind,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami called for
cultural exchanges to bring down what he called a ``wall of
mistrust'' between the two nations, and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright indicated June 17 that Khatami might be a man
the United States could talk with.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's public talk was held under tight UNESCO security, but
even so four people who had managed to make their way into the
auditorium were forcibly expelled after shouting anti-Iranian
slogans and calling Abdi a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Britain reportedly refused to grant Abdi a visa so that the
encounter could be held there, but France has been urging the
United States for months to adopt its view that Khatami's election
marked a fundamental change in Iran. French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine plans a visit to Tehran later this summer.

SENATE APPROVES MILITARY SPENDING WITH CURBS ON RIGHTS ABUSES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate has approved a $252-billion military
spending bill that includes an amendment barring the Pentagon from
conducting training missions with foreign soldiers who have
committed human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military conducted training exercises with 102 foreign
armies last year, according to Pentagon records. Some of those
armies _ for example, the Indonesian military _ have a record of
abusing their own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would bar
the Pentagon from holding joint exercises with human rights abusers
unless the secretary of defense finds an extraordinary need to
waive the law. The Pentagon did not oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill, passed by a 97-2 vote late on Thursday,
includes $1.9 billion for the open-ended U.S. military mission in
Bosnia. The House version of the military spending bill provides no
money for military operations in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected a bipartisan effort to reduce the American
military presence in Bosnia and neighboring countries to 5,000 from
more than 8,500 by October 1999. The Senate also moved to require
that President Clinton consult Congress before committing any
military forces to the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' military budget is by far the highest of any
nation. While the final spending figures must be negotiated in a
conference among members of the Senate and the House, the spending
bill passed by both chambers would increase overall military
spending by about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on developing and buying weapons would increase to
about $84.8 billion in the coming year from about $79.5 billion
this year, according to Pentagon figures. Most of the rest of the
budget is spent on military operations and training, equipment
maintenance, and salaries for the nation's military officers,
soldiers, sailors, pilots, support personnel and civilian
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House bills call for military pay to increase 3.6
percent next year, instead of a 3.1 percent raise sought by the
Clinton administration. The higher salaries would be financed by
cutting operations and maintenance costs in the Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also includes a provision to deny visas to
foreign officials who have engaged in religious persecution, forced
abortions or forced sterilizations, a measure directed largely at
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment barring U.S. soldiers from conducting joint
training exercises with military officers who have engaged in human
rights abuses arose from news reports about the Pentagon's liaison
with the Indonesia military, according to Senate staff members.
</P>
<P>
   In March, The Nation and The New York Times reported that the
Pentagon had been training Indonesian military forces in
specialized acts of warfare and counterinsurgency, despite a
congressional ban intended to curb human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian forces included a commando unit that, according
to human rights groups, had a history of torturing and killing
civilians. The Pentagon said at the time that the purpose of the
exercises, known as Joint Combined Exchange and Training, was ``to
train and engage and interact and gain influence with successive
generations of Indonesian officers,'' as one Defense Department
official put it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who said they had been unaware of the
program moved to end the instruction and ban the Pentagon from
``training an army that has been implicated in cases of torture,
murder and disappearance,'' in the words of Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.

 &HT;    McGwire homerless but Braves still lose
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- They ducked Mighty Mark. They never saw Real Ray
coming.
</P>
<P>
   While Greg Maddux kept Mark McGwire in the infield all night,
Ray Lankford reached Maddux for a three-run homer in the sixth as
the St. Louis Cardinals opened a weekend series with the Braves
with a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With a Turner Field record crowd of 50,662 cheering even
McGwire's foul balls, the Braves succumbed in part to a Walt Weiss
error, that kept the sixth inning alive and brought Lankford to the
plate. The victory went to ex-Brave Kent Mercker (7-8), who beat
his old club on his fourth try, allowing Atlanta just one infield
single through the eighth after a two-run Tony Graffanino homer had
given the Braves a 2-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three runs against Maddux (14-5) were earned but the
Braves No. 1 starter is 2-3 since the All-Star break, despite
giving up just eight earned runs in 38 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals threatened in the seventh after shortstop Placido
Polanco singled and Brian Jordan made it to first on a two-out
chopper off the plate. McGwire worked a full count against Maddux
and then missed a knee-high fastball on the outside corner to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis went ahead 3-2 in the sixth, though the inning should
never have gotten to that point. With Jordan at first with one out,
McGwire hit an soft 1-1 grounder to shortstop which should have
resulted in a routine inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss, in his first start since July 19, dropped the ball as
he took it from his glove to throw to second, giving Jordan second.
He still had a shot at the heavy-footed McGwire at first but Weiss
lost the ball again and wound up lying face down in the infield
grass. Lankford then fouled away one pitch before sending his 18th
homer of the year over the wall in the deepest part of right.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has only yielded five homers this year and had gone 84
innings since giving up his last one. That came June 4th in
Milwaukee, a ninth-inning shot by Jeromy Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's first encounter with McGwire was classic. The big first
baseman pulled Maddux's first breaking ball into Cardinals bullpen.
Maddux next served a change-up that McGwire hit into the second
deck but foul. Maddux then came inside with his cut fastball that
froze him as umpire Bill Hohn called the third strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went ahead 2-0 in the third on Graffanino's fifth
homer of the year. Weiss singled in his first at-bat, moved to
second on Maddux's sacrifice bunt and was still at second when
Graffanino came up with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   He took a ball from Cardinals starter Mercker before pulling the
next pitch just over the fence.

 &HT;    Pride is sent to minors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Curtis Pride's first surprise when he came to work
was he was being sent to Richmond. The second biggest surprise was,
the Braves still had the option to send him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very surprised,'' said Pride. ``But I can see their reasoning.
I'm the only player with options left. What about Chipper Jones?
Doesn't he have options? ... I'm kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride took it well, but the bottom line is the Braves have to
demote their leading pinch-hitter (7-for-33) to create a roster
spot for the newly acquired Greg Colbrunn. The team gains a more
potent pinch-hitter (9-for-26 or .346) who can handle right-handers
and as well as left-handers and can play catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost speed off the bench,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``That
kid (Pride) can go. Lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been assumed, even by Pride's agent Joe Strasser, that
the outfielder's minor-league options had expired after his
three-plus years of major-league service. Braves research showed
otherwise. While outfielder Danny Bautista, who like Colbrunn is
right-handed, might have been an easier choice to send down, the
club did not want to risk losing him to waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get (Pride) back before (Aug.) 31, he's on everybody's
playoff roster,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Pride had made 16 starts with the Braves, hitting .275 with five
doubles and three homers and had gone 4-for-4 for stolen bases.
Since coming off the DL July 15 where he recovered from a lacerated
finger, Pride was hitting .476 (10-for-21), a heck of an average to
ship to Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back September 1, but I'd like to be back up before
that,'' Pride said, ``because I want to contribute. I want to help
the team. They need a left-handed hitter with some power and speed.
I have no control over the situation but to go down to triple-A and
play hard and whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get on that plane
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies had bussed to new Denver International
Airport Thursday evening to board a charter for Chicago, when a
club official approached Colbrunn and said, ``Hold on for a
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus played out the Braves' re-acquisition of their former top
right-handed reserve hitter, who walked into the Braves clubhouse
Friday to find his same old uniform (No. 23) he left behind when
the club failed to retain him last winter. After the Braves made a
low opening offer to Colbrunn, he turned to the open market where
he found a buyer's market for free agent first basemen. With Andres
Galarraga and Hal Morris finding the big contracts, Colbrunn wound
up signing a minor-league deal worth only $600,000 with Colorado
(after making $750,000 in 1997) as an insurance policy behind
rookie Todd Helton.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing in 61 games with the Rockies, he found himself
in the role he has tried to avoid _ right-handed bench player. As a
Brave, he'll get less time behind Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have more playing time but, I mean, its a job and
it's a role,'' Colbrunn said. ``As a player who's done what I've
done the last couple years, you don't ever want to say you're a
role-player or a bench player because then you become used to it.
You always want to strive for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers job secure
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz said the club intends to keep
Mark Wohlers on the active roster in Atlanta. Then he reiterated
that with Wohlers' five years of experience, the club has no other
option. Wohlers stated Thursday he has no intention of returning to
the minors to find his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the reality,'' Schuerholz said. ``There's nothing
to do about that but hope that he gets better and hope that he
makes progress.''

 &HT;    Johnson left out of dealing

<P>
   ATLANTA -- The trades came fast and furious Friday night and
should have a big impact not only on the rest of the regular season
but also in October.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline approaching at midnight, all of baseball was
waiting to see where Seattle Mariners starter Randy Johnson would
land.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams were still in the hunt, the front-runners being
the Yankees and Indians. But the Dodgers were making a late run, as
were the Astros and, reportedly, the Braves. Another possibility
had Mo Vaughn going to the Mets for catcher Mike Piazza. The White
Sox were dangling third baseman Robin Ventura. Tampa Bay was
talking about dealing Roberto Hernandez, while the Cardinals,
involved in the first deals of the day, were considering moving
outfielder Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of early deals with the Texas Rangers
perhaps gaining the most. By 8 p.m. there were already seven deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were major players, getting starter Todd Stottlemyre
and shortstop Royce Clayton from the Cardinals and third baseman
Todd Zeile from the Marlins. Clayton and Zeile give Texas a better
left side of the infield while Stottlemyre (9-9, 3.51 ERA) is
having the best year of his career. The Cardinals got third base
prospect Fernando Tatis, disappointing right-hander Darren Oliver
and a player to be named. The Rangers had a chance to get Roger
Clemens from Toronto but did not want to give up outfielder Rusty
Greer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt our direction with what we've done today is
to win our division and go beyond,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, with general manager Tommy Lasorda talking boldly
about making the playoffs, acquired second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek and starting pitcher Carlos Perez from the Expos for
second baseman Wilton Guerrero and three prospects. The Braves had
been interested in Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who picked up Jose Mesa and Shawon Dunston last
week, continued upgrading, getting outfielder Ellis Burks from the
Rockies for outfielder Darryl Hamilton, minor leaguer James Stoops
and a player to be named.Making a second-half run at the wildcard,
the Orioles picked up starter Juan Guzman from Toronto for pitcher
Nerio Rodriguez and minor league outfielder Shannon Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets acquired starter Willie Blair and catcher Jorge
Fabregas from the Diamondbacks for outfielder Bernard Gilkey and
minor leaguer Nelson Figueroa. Why would the Mets acquire a catcher
when they already have Piazza and Todd Hundley? Many felt this deal
would lead to another one involving Piazza.

WASHINGTON, July 31 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, July 21, the Senate voted, 61-39, to table, or set
aside, an amendment that would have required handguns to be sold
with child-proof safety devices. Supporters said the amendment
would protect children from handgun accidents. Opponents said the
amendment was an unnecessary federal regulation and would not
accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside, or
rejecting, the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, July 22, the Senate voted, 69-31, to table, or set
aside, a measure that would have allowed federal prosecution of gun
owners whose weapons were used by children in a crime, if the guns
were stored insecurely. Supporters said the measure would have kept
guns out of children's hands by requiring people to keep their guns
out of reach. Opponents argued that innocent people could have been
held responsible if children found a way to access the guns, even
if the weapons were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors setting
aside, or rejecting, the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 24, the House approved, 216-210, a
Republican-sponsored patients' rights bill that would allow
patients to seek pediatric and gynecological care, complain when
they believe they have been denied adequate care and require
insurances to pay for reasonable emergency room visits. Supporters
said the bill would provide greater access to managed care and
allow people to set up tax-free medical savings accounts. Opponents
criticized the bill for not allowing chronically-ill patients to
visit medical specialists and for not protecting people who buy
individual insurance plans. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GAYRIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 214-212, an amendment that
would effectively end federal housing support for San Francisco.
The measure would amend a housing appropriations bill by
prohibiting the use of federal funds ``to implement'' a San
Francisco regulation that requires all employers doing business
with the city to provide health and other benefits to same-sex
partners. Supporters said businesses should not be forced to adopt
policies they find morally objectionable. Opponents argued the
amendment was bigoted. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 259-164, a $94 billion veterans
and public housing spending bill that overhauls federal housing
policy and restricts spending on environmental programs. Supporters
said the bill provides needed spending for veterans' programs and
maintains the commitment to providing access to housing for
low-income families. Opponents said the bill fails to go far enough
to meet the needs of the environment and welfare-to-work programs.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TRANSPORT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 391-25, a $46 billion
transportation spending bill that provides more highway money,
increases funding for aviation improvements and supports Amtrak's
recovery plan. Supporters said it will help ensure that
transportation and safety needs will be met in the next century.
Opponents criticized the bill because it increases funding for air
and rail systems but reduces funding to the U.S. Coast Guard. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   Race puts Indy back on map
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's popularity, storied speedway boost Brickyard 400
stature
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ While talking to a group of reporters on pit row
Friday, Rusty Wallace said he thought the Brickyard 400 soon would
equal the Indianapolis 500 in importance and interest.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted one reporter to say, ``No, Rusty. I don't think
the Indy 500 will ever be this popular again.''
</P>
<P>
   In its fifth year, the Brickyard 400 has become one of the
biggest races in America. Only the Daytona 500 still could be
considered more important and more prestigious than today's Winston
Cup event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 rabid NASCAR fans will fill the historic
speedway to see the 160-lap race every driver dreams of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can describe what it would mean to win this
race,'' said John Andretti, who also has raced here in the Indy
500. ``It would be an emotional high you can't get anywhere else.
It's like trying to describe what it's like when you have your
first child. You don't know what a wonderful feeling it is until
you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd experienced that feeling last year when he won the
event in his Tide Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something special about Indy that you don't feel at
any other track,'' Rudd said. ``It's kind of like walking into an
old ballpark, realizing all the greats who have played there. I
know one day when I'm through driving, I will come back and see my
name in that infield museum and be proud. It's something special to
win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Four drivers _ Jerry Nadeau, Steve Park, Buckshot Jones and
Kenny Irwin Jr. _ will be competing at Indianapolis for the first
time. For Irwin, who grew up in Indianapolis, just competing at
Indy is a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has wanted me to race here since the day I was born,''
said Irwin, who will start on the outside of row 2 in the Texaco
Ford. ``It's so special to me and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving here is just as challenging as I thought it would be.
Turn 1 takes a lot of nerve. It's like a tunnel because you can't
see your way out when you enter it. This track really lends itself
to experience. Starting in front is important, but it's only half
the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the front of the 43-car field today will be Ernie
Irvan, who won the pole for the second consecutive year. But Irvan
has yet to win this race.
</P>
<P>
   The clear favorite to win today would have to be Jeff Gordon,
who will start on the inside of row 2. Gordon, the defending
Winston Cup champion and the points leader this season, won the
inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994. He is coming off a victory last
week in the Pennsylvania 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has set the standard, and it's up to us to go out there
and beat him,'' said Wallace, who will start on the outside of row
7 today. ``His team has it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has a 62-point lead over Mark Martin and a 128-point
advantage over Dale Jarrett, the only two drivers who are within
one race's points value of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't slip much and still have a shot at it,'' Jarrett
said. ``We have to do like we did last year when we won five of the
last 15 races.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett won the Brickyard 400 in 1996 and came close to winning
two other times at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two thirds and a first, I feel like I know what it takes
to get around this place,'' said Jarrett, the only driver who has
won the Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400 in the same year. ``It's
a fun race track for us. The last three years really have been good
here.''
</P>
<P>
   A win today would be better financially for Jarrett than any
victory in his career. The winner will earn more than $500,000 out
of a $5 million purse, but five drivers have a chance to take home
an extra $1 million in the Winston No Bull 5 promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The top five finishers from the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in
May _ Gordon, Bobby Labonte, Rusty Wallace, Martin and Jarrett _
can win the $1 million bonus if they win at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't let something like that cause you to take
chances you normally wouldn't take,'' Jarrett said. ``We still have
to focus on the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's incentive enough here just to try to be the first
two-time winner of the race and add to the history of Indianapolis
Motor Speedway. It's just an exceptional place to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, who won here in 1995, still finds it hard to
believe that the good old boys of stock car racing are driving at
Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought NASCAR would ever race here,'' Earnhardt said.
``But I think racing fans everywhere are glad we came. It's just a
tremendous feeling to say you've won a race at Indy.''

CHINA'S PHANTOM OPERA HOUSE MAY FINALLY MATERIALIZE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a city where real estate prices have skyrocketed,
where developers compete to put up glitzy apartment complexes and
shopping centers, it is little short of stunning that this
capital's best-located empty lot has remained just that _ empty _
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Situated across the street from the Great Hall of the People and
a stone's throw from Zhongnanhai, the secretive compound where
China's leaders live and work, this parcel of land is about as
prime as you can find in all of China. Today it serves as a sunken
parking lot for mail trucks, and is surrounded by dilapidated
shacks where a few dozen itinerant workers bunk.
</P>
<P>
   The news is that Beijing's leaders, in keeping with their
current efforts to appear more cultured than their predecessors,
are finally going to do something. They plan to build a world-class
opera house in this abandoned lot.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story is that the first plans to build an opera
house were made 40 years ago, then buried, revived, debated,
revoked and almost forgotten in an astounding maze of bureaucratic
wrangling. When approval finally came through for a theater
complex, the core of the plan was _ you guessed it _ the same as it
was 40 years ago: an opera house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the torturous and winding path of China,'' said Wu
Zuqiang, a composer and advocate of the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese like to say they invented bureaucracy, and perfected
it over the centuries. In popular colloquy, there are innumerable
ways to describe official dawdling, like ``kick the leather ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for experts in bureaucratic procrastination, the
phantom opera house is an eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a reminder of how complex even the simplest task can
become in China. Or maybe Chinese people just feel that way.
Wherever national, municipal and legislative bureaucracies mix it
up, there is bound to be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it remains a question how long it will take to
construct an opera house, what with the political sensitivity and
national pride surrounding selection of an architect and a design
suitable for such an illustrious address.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese leaders say they are serious this time. Current
plans, with a budget of $400 million, call for the work to be
completed in 2002. The project, to include a 2,700-seat opera
house, as well as a music hall and two smaller theaters, is called
the National Theater.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To gauge public opinion about the design, or perhaps to assuage
it in case an unpopular one is chosen by the committee so
entrusted, the authorities recently invited Beijing residents to
voice their opinions on 44 models. About half the proposals were
made by Chinese architects, and half came from overseas, including
four from the United States, three from Italy and three from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   All were displayed at the Museum of Revolutionary History, which
abuts Tiananmen Square. Shown in identical booths, the models
varied enormously, from an inventive bubble-shaped design to many
block-shaped designs. One looked like a near-replica of Lincoln
Center, another mimicked the Greco-Stalinist design of the
neighboring Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the display opened, it was jammed with thousands of
curious viewers, and hundreds took the time to write out opinions
on blank white forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a momentous decision for our nation,'' said Yuan
Wenwu, one of the exhibition's organizers. ``It's important for our
leaders to know the opinions of the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   The first plan to build an opera house in Beijing came in 1958,
championed by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, and was approved the next
year. Several lanes of low-lying residential homes were torn down,
and digging began on a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But famine befell China in 1960, caused in part by a scheme by
Mao to speed industrialization in one Great Leap Forward by
creating backyard steel furnaces at the expense of farming, and
public spending on the arts seemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Digging resumed in the mid-1960s, only to be derailed again in
1966 by the fanatical politics of the Cultural Revolution, when Mao
and his leftist allies banned all traditional Chinese opera
performances, not to mention Western ones.
</P>
<P>
   It took until 1979 before efforts to build an opera house
resumed, and several more lanes of old homes were torn down. But in
1982, members of China's pro forma legislature, the National
People's Congress, pushed a plan to use the site for their own
office building. Proposals, counterproposals and
counter-counterproposals were submitted for discussion, yielding
little more than, yes, more discussion.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, as a building boom enveloped Beijing, the
legislators were stymied by concern from the security-conscious.
The outpouring of protesters who had filled Tiananmen Square in
1989 made it seem unwise to create a place that would draw large
crowds of theatergoers to such a central location. The lot remained
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, a proponent of the arts who is a member of an advisory
council called the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said he tried to break the deadlock in 1996 with a
detailed proposal for reviving the idea of an opera house. He
credits President Jiang Zemin with pushing through the current
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Three finalists in the design competition are scheduled to be
chosen by Aug. 7, with a winner to be selected in the fall.
Construction is scheduled to begin next February. Then again, with
the history of the phantom opera house, it is anyone's guess if and
when that will actually happen.

GORE OUTLINES PLANS FOR STRONGER ONLINE PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced a new privacy
initiative Friday aimed at protecting children and medical
patients, among others. But while the proposals were ambitious, the
administration can enforce few of them without the consent of
Congress or private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic
American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore
made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to
tighten the security of financial and medical records and to
protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals are simply endorsements of bills already
wending their way through Congress. Others require new
congressional action that is, in some cases, uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas
for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to
many in Congress and to public-interest groups. Gore announced
instead that, for now, the administration would leave industry to
regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   The government's privacy rules are of special concern now
because the European Union plans to enforce a new electronic
privacy program in October and has threatened to stop doing
business with companies in other countries that have looser rules.
In congressional testimony earlier this week, Commerce Secretary
William Daley said the administration's new proposals would bring
the United States into compliance. But some experts in privacy law
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives
proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of
medical and banking records.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services
would propose a new rule next week to enhance the security of
electronic medical records, but offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   And federal bank regulators will strengthen the enforcement of a
law that sets limits on how easily banks can share information
about their customers and their accounts with related business,
such as insurance companies, according to a senior administration
official.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Gore said, was ``to ensure that account-holders have
the chance to give a thumbs-down or a thumbs-up before banks hand
out sensitive information about their accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to
others to implement. For example, Gore said he wanted to discourage
``profiling'' _ the practice by some companies of building dossiers
on the activities of private citizens using a variety of databases
and then using or selling that information to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a
new challenge to companies that use information technology to piece
together personal profiles of American citizens and then sell those
profiles for profit,'' the vice president said. ``And here is the
message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively
regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you
protect the privacy of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending
legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity
theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card
numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such
as credit-card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also urged Congress to pass a law that would forbid
companies running sites on the World Wide Web to collect
information about children under 13 visiting the sites without
permission from their parents. ``Before children innocently forfeit
personal information, parents should have a say,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Experts in privacy regulation found few new ideas in the White
House initiative. David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a private research group based in
Washington, said, ``We didn't hear much here that we haven't heard
before, and the gaping hole in their policy continues to be
Internet privacy'' for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times newsletter, said:
``In form and ceremony, it's a great day. But in substance this
leaves a lot wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel also said the proposals ``still leave us out of step with
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks agreed, saying: ``This does hardly anything to deal
with the coming problem with Europe. It leaves us on a collision
course with the EU.''

INDIA AND PAKISTAN FAIL TO NARROW DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ An effort to open regular talks between
India and Pakistan on divisive issues including nuclear weapons and
Kashmir collapsed in acrimony Friday, with the two countries
accusing each other of setting conditions that made a sustained
dialogue impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to agree on terms for the talks came 48 hours after
Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Mohammed Nawaz
Sharif of Pakistan met briefly during a regional summit conference
in the Sri Lankan capital, their first encounter since both nations
conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, said by aides on both sides to have been stiff and
unsympathetic, ended with instructions to their officials to
discuss terms for reopening diplomatic talks that have spluttered
on and off through much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreign secretaries of the two countries announced
Friday that they had ended three rounds of discussions here without
breaking a deadlock over procedures for the talks. The sticking
point was the divided territory of Kashmir, as it has been
throughout the 50 years since the partition that created India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments pledged to continue diplomatic contacts in
the hope of breaking the deadlock and set an informal deadline for
reaching agreement, a summit meeting of the nonaligned states that
Vajpayee and Sharif are to attend in Durban, South Africa, in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was particularly blunt, saying in an interview published
Friday in The Island, a Sri Lankan newspaper, that his meeting with
Vajpayee had accomplished ``zero.'' Sharif came into the talks here
apparently convinced that heightened international concerns over a
possible nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan could be
used as a lever to force India to make concessions on Kashmir, or
at least to approach the issue more flexibly.
</P>
<P>
   He said in the interview that Vajpayee had rejected Pakistan's
demand that new talks should focus on Kashmir, a territory with a
Muslim majority that has been divided between India and Pakistan
since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   India's position, restated forcefully Friday, was that putting
Kashmir at the center of the talks would only ``highlight
differences, vitiate the atmosphere, and, therefore, likely disrupt
and jeopardize the entire process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sharif was adamant. ``If that was the position, what was the
point in having talks, because Kashmir has been the root cause of
all the conflicts between India and Pakistan,'' he said in the
newspaper interview. ``We did not want to hold talks for the sake
of talks but for the talks to succeed.'' Asked if there was a
stalemate, he replied: ``Yes, it is a stalemate. We are not here to
waste each others' time.''
</P>
<P>
   By ending the regional conference Friday without a formula for
broaching the issues between them, the leaders disappointed many in
the subcontinent and elsewhere who saw the nuclear tests, and the
angry polemics from India and Pakistan that accompanied them, as a
dangerous watershed. The United States, leading diplomatic efforts
to persuade New Delhi and Islamabad not to deploy nuclear arsenals,
has urged the two governments to open direct talks as soon as
possible to relax tensions and lower the risk of war.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony brought a jarring end to the summit meeting of the
South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, which also
includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The
meeting was held here under extraordinary security precautions
because of fears of violence by the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group
that has fought a protracted ethnic war for an independent state in
the north and east of this tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns prompted Vajpayee, for example, to bring in two
Indian air force helicopters for his own transport, along with a
force of several hundred Indian security personnel. Colombo, a city
of 2 million, was virtually paralyzed as entire areas of the city
were closed off, as well as a 50-mile stretch of ocean highway
connecting the capital to an Indian Ocean resort at the town of
Bentota, where the regional leaders met informally on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several summit meeting leaders, including Vajpayee, struck a
note of self-reproach over the fact that the 1.3 billion people
represented at the meeting constitute a large proportion of the
world's poorest people. Vajpayee caught the mood with a phrase that
ended his speech to the conference Wednesday. Urging an end to
estrangements that have characterized the relations among almost
all of the countries meeting here, he declared: ``Let us grow rich
together!''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, officials of the smaller countries at the
conference said the energies that could be released by burying
historic differences would remain bottled up until the two
heavyweights of the region, India and Pakistan, made a turn away
from confrontation. One among many examples these officials gave
was the snail's pace that the seven countries have achieved so far
toward their goal of establishing a free-trade area by the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian statistics, only 3.7 per cent of more than
$140-billion in annual trade between the seven countries is
accounted for by trade among them, but efforts to create a
tariff-free zone seem likely to be doomed as long as India and
Pakistan refuse to even discuss ways of developing their minuscule
levels of trade.

UNION PACIFIC TRACK-SHARING ORDER IS LIFTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Kan., Neb.)  (js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that rail congestion in the Houston area had eased
considerably, the Surface Transportation Board announced Friday
that it would not extend its six-month-old emergency service order
on Union Pacific Corp., the nation's largest railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the order, issued in October, Union Pacific
was directed to share track in Texas with two competitors, Texas
Mexican Railway Co. and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. In addition,
Union Pacific was required to file special performance reports with
the board.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first emergency order issued by the board since it
assumed regulatory responsibility for the railroads in 1996,
following the dissolution of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Huge rail traffic jams, which were costing shippers more than
$100 million a month at certain points last year, led the
government to act. The tie-ups were chiefly a result of Union
Pacific's difficulties in absorbing Southern Pacific Transportation
Corp., which it bought for $5.4 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover has slowed traffic all around Union Pacific's
system, but the problems have been most pronounced around the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Union Pacific-Southern Railroad combination created a road
that in the Houston-Gulf Coast area didn't work,'' said Edward
Emmett, president of the National Industrial Transportation League,
the nation's oldest and largest shippers organization. ``It created
gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   While traffic has recently improved in the Houston area, he
said, ``some people are worried that if the Surface Transportation
Board pulls the remedies out, the problems will return.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Davidson, chairman and chief executive of Union Pacific,
said in a statement that the board's decision ``certainly confirms
that there is no longer a service crisis in the Houston Gulf
area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we aren't kidding ourselves about what's
ahead,'' Davidson added, saying that the company's job ``is far
from finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shuster, a Union Pacific spokesman, said traffic between El
Paso and Tucson, Ariz., had been snarled recently because of train
derailments, but that the problem had been corrected. And a $400
million construction project, scheduled to be finished in October,
has slowed traffic in Nebraska and Kansas. But he said conditions
are clear elsewhere in Union Pacific's system.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the Surface
Transportation Board, said ``operational monitoring'' of service in
the West would continue, adding that rail service in that part of
the country ``is not at uniformly improved levels.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To insure a smooth transition, the board said shippers would be
allowed to use Texas Mexican Railways and Burlington Northern in
the Houston-Gulf Coast area for an additional 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Three shippers requested an extension of the emergency service
order, which is set to expire Saturday. But Ms. Morgan said the
board had no legal grounds on which it could extend the Houston
provisions of the order. The shippers that requested permission to
get additional emergency alternative rail access were Entergy
Services Inc., an electric utility, and Entergy Arkansas, Inc.,
both units of Entergy Corp., and Cemex USA Management Inc., a
cement and aggregates shipper.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors said they recognized the board's problem. But they
expressed skepticism that the problems in and around Houston had
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are better, I readily admit that,'' said Larry Fields,
president and chief executive of Texas Mexican Railway. ``But they
are not better than they were pre-merger. And the reason things are
better right now has more to do with the General Motors strike,
which has slowed things down. But we are about to enter our busiest
time of the year, and I hope the board does more than just watch
what is going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sabourin, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe, said
his company had not taken a position on whether the emergency order
should have been extended.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``We remain convinced that the problems at
Houston and along the Gulf Coast have not yet been resolved.
Further action by the STB is required to assure that shippers are
able to receive, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe and other rail
carriers are able to provide, reliable and consistent rail
service.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the Surface Transportation Board lifted its
emergency order, Union Pacific said it had postponed a planned
initial public stock offering for its Overnight Transportation Co.
</P>
<P>
   A poor market for initial offerings and labor unrest at the
trucking concern have weakened demand for the new issue.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a sale would be reconsidered when the market
for initial offerings improved.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Union Pacific rose $1.75 Friday, to $42. Still, in the
last 12 months, the shares have fallen 41 percent.

   The New York Times News Service has moved the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 2,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-FILMS (Hong Kong) _ As recently as eight years ago,
Hong Kong was second only to Hollywood in exporting movies, and
Hong Kong films were among the most exciting things happening in
cinema. Talented directors were casting charismatic stars in movies
that were by turns stylishly violent, breathtakingly magical,
beautifully tender or silly kung-fu comedies. Slowly, Hong
Kong-style art direction, action choreography and even plot
elements began to appear in American films. Today, audiences here
are flocking to Hollywood films, especially ones filled with
special effects, and ignoring ones made in Hong Kong. By Neil
Strauss. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ Attendance at American art museums
is skyrocketing, but upstairs in the director's office, the desk
chair is often unoccupied and an eerie silence prevails. At last
count, there were about 20 openings for directors at prominent
museums, and trustees are insisting, with only partial
exaggeration, that they can't find anyone for the job. By Deborah
Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  RYAN-FILM-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ Though the landmark film event
that is Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' opened last
weekend to strong attendance and critical cartwheels, it also set
off a flurry of talk-show trepidations. Worries spread about the
violence level in this already famously harrowing World War II
epic. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BENOIT-JACQUOT-FILMS (New York) _ Benoit Jacquot is not about to
write his autobiography. ``I'm not interested in recounting my life
through my films,'' the famously reticent French director said
recently. ``I'd rather they teach me something about my life.'' His
presence in his work is close to transparent: a finely tuned eye
and intelligence, focused on the intricate, oblique entanglements
of human beings. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MINNIE-DRIVER-FILMS (New York) _ Minnie Driver is equally at
home telling an off-color joke or spelling Aeschylus correctly on a
crossword puzzle, as she did recently in a rare moment of repose at
a midtown Manhattan hotel. The British actress, 27, who has made a
career for herself in the United States in hit movies like ``Big
Night,'' ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' and ``Good Will Hunting,''
displays a dizzying array of attributes: she's intellectual and
earthy, statuesque and spirited. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Some film reviews and their suitability
for children. This week: ``Mark Twain's America in 3-D''; ``The
Parent Trap''; ``There's Something About Mary''; ``Mafia!''
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VIEWPOINTS-DANCE (Undated) _ Invented in the 1970s by two dance
choreographers, Mary Overlie and Wendall Beavers, Viewpoints has
recently become part of the contentious debate currently going on
in America about actor training. In the last five years, there has
been an explosion of interest in new ways to train American actors.
Some people in the theater believe the itch to explore different
theories is a reaction to the longtime dominance of the Method,
preached by the controversial teacher Lee Strasberg, who died in
1982. By Rachel Shteir. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Many things about the Russian
Symphony Orchestra seem to resonate of formative youth. The
ensemble was organized just six years ago, and the average age of
its members is 25. But to judge from a collection of exceptionally
well-produced recordings, the sapling Russian Symphony might be as
old as its musical roots. Indeed, the youth of its players is
belied by an intensity, insight and precision that usually come
with more years on stage than most of these musicians have lived.
By Lawrence B. Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DON-GIOVANNI-OPERA (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Peter Brook's
production of ``Don Giovanni'' is at the Festival Internationale
d'Art Lyrique this summer. Brook gives us not much of a production
at all: a few benches on the big courtyard stage of the
Archbishop's Palace, the Don in a vanilla suit and Panama hat, his
colleagues in street clothes and party dresses. Yet Mozart has been
treated exceptionally well: not with visual effects or theatrical
coups that draw us into the events, but by an attempt to look at
the opera's people from the inside out. By Bernard Holland.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-OPERA (Undated) _ In the 15 years since its
premiere, Olivier Messiaen's opera ``St. Francois d'Assise'' has,
like a classic of older times, gone on growing through repeated
performances.
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-DRUMMER (New York) _ In barely a decade, the percussionist
Leon Parker has gone from stints with the pianist Kenny Barron to a
chair in the pianist Jacky Terrasson's fine trio to a major label
contract. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-COMPOSERS (New York) _ The last quarter century has seen
the emergence of female composers as serious professionals. Opera
and the bigger forms of `serious music' require both practical
experience and real opportunity to learn (and earn) from
performance, as Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, the Pulitzer Prize winning
composer of large scale instrumental works, points out. It has been
easier for women to compose pop. But successful women are often
more readily co-opted by commercial forces than men. By Albert
Innaurato. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-FILMS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Hollywood-crazed collectors
have long been willing to pay handsomely for original props like
Dorothy's red shoes. But reproductions of collectibles? Chronicle
Books, a medium-size San Francisco publishing house, is betting
that there is a market out there for such items, and somewhat
closer to earth than the Tatooine desert. Chronicle has just issued
``Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential Collection,'' by Stephen J.
Sansweet, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is
revered by other collectors for having one of the world's largest
collections of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia. By James Barron. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHOCK-ART (New York) _ With art, there are three forms of shock:
the shock of recognition, the shock at something merely appalling
and the shock of the new. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ITALIAN-GESTURES-TV (Undated) _ In the documentary ``The
Italian-Americans II: A Beautiful Song,'' which has its premiere on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WLIW, Nick Stellino, a New York cookbook
author of Italian descent, describes the way he and family members
used hand gestures when speaking to one another. By Warren Berger.

   Stocks Resume Slide on Worries About Profits
</P>
<P>
   Share prices dropped sharply, more than erasing big gains from
the day before, on persistent concern about unimpressive corporate
earnings. Wall Street analysts said investors were finally
awakening to the effects of the slowdown in Asia, which could
diminish growth at home and stifle stocks for the remainder of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.66 points, or 1.59
percent, to close at 8,883.29. The sharp drop came a day after the
Dow rallied 111.99 points, or 1.3 percent. Broader indexes were hit
harder. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.28 points, or
1.95 percent, to 1,120.67, and the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 2.5
percent to close at 1,872.39.
</P>
<P>
   Economic Growth Slowed in Spring
</P>
<P>
   The United States' gross domestic product grew at a 1.4 percent
annual rate in April, May and June, the most sluggish quarter in
three years. But economists said the performance still showed the
economy's resilience in the face of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   New Microsoft-Justice Skirmish
</P>
<P>
   The government accused Microsoft of resisting requests to
provide technical information and to make 17 executives including
the company's chairman, Bill Gates, available for depositions as
part of the antitrust case against the software company. The trial
is set to begin Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital to Buy Reinsurer
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital plans to acquire Kemper Reinsurance Co., in a deal
estimated to be worth as much as $500 million. The acquisition will
broaden GE Capital's already strong presence in insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Crackdown on Options Trader
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators in Texas, Ohio, Idaho and California,
aided by the FBI, have moved to shut down the Cleveland-based
Options Trading Group, a firm accused of defrauding investors of
millions through the sale of foreign-currency options.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Fined in Russia Export Case
</P>
<P>
   An IBM subsidiary pleaded guilty to illegally exporting 17
advanced computers to a Russian nuclear-weapons laboratory and
agreed to pay an $8.5 million fine. It is believed to be IBM's
first criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Mass Layoffs at Korea Automaker
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, South Korea's leading automobile manufacturer,
dismissed 1,569 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, making
use of new labor laws to cut wages and weaken powerful unions.
Hyundai is the first big South Korean company to dismiss workers en
masse, and other employees have gone on strike in protest.
</P>

   French Gamble on TV Sale
</P>
<P>
   For years, France's state-owned Thomson Multimedia was known
mostly for color television sets and losses. The government is
betting this will end with its deal to sell part of the company to
an international corporate alliance of Microsoft, Hughes
Electronics, NEC and Alcatel.
</P>

<P>
   Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce a basic value
that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore announced
initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and
medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the
Internet. But many of the proposals are simply endorsements of
existing bills, while others require new congressional action that
is, in some cases, uncertain at best.

STUDY SAYS TRADING POLLUTION PERMITS WOULD BE ECONOMICAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paying other countries to cut their pollution could
be the cheapest way for the United States to help control the
heat-trapping gases that cause global warming, the Clinton
administration said in a new economic analysis released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A system of buying and selling pollution permits
internationally, as proposed by the administration, would cut the
costs to the United States at least in half and possibly by as much
as 85 percent, according to a study by the White House Council of
Economic Advisers. Many economists favor the trading of pollution
permits as a free-market mechanism that reduces the costs of
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is filled with unbelievably cheap opportunities to
reduce emissions abroad,'' said Janet Yellin, President Clinton's
top economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The study was intended to substantiate Ms. Yellin's recent
testimony before Congress that the United States could meet the
targets of a new international climate change protocol, negotiated
last year in Kyoto, Japan, at a modest cost. She has estimated that
the typical household's annual energy bill might rise as little as
$70 per year, although others insist the amount would be far
higher.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate balking at approving any treaty that does not
include a substantial role for developing countries in the control
of emissions, the administration has struggled for more than a year
to produce a comprehensive analysis of its proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The study released on Friday was attacked by critics on several
sides of the climate debate.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Holmes, the chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, a
group representing large companies that oppose the treaty, called
the report ``smoke and mirrors.'' The administration, Ms. Holmes
said, had not faced up to the fact that many foreign nations oppose
the idea of pollution trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who opposes the global warming
treaty, said the report ``gives every appearance of being a post
hoc rationalization, full of tautologies and self-fulfilling,
unrealistic or unprovable assertions and assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups strongly criticized the
administration, saying the study suggested that the United States,
which emits more heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide than any
other country, is seeking to avoid much of its responsibility for
solving the problem of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their plan is to buy reductions abroad,'' said Gary Cook,
legislative director for the climate campaign at Greenpeace. ``We
need to take the first steps largely at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's study was based on computerized economic
models, including one developed by the Battelle Laboratory in Ohio
to estimate the economic costs of actions to reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide, the principal heat-trapping gas produced when
fossil fuels are burned.
</P>
<P>
   The models suggested that the United States could meet its
emissions targets, which require reductions of 7 percent below the
1990 level over the next 10 to 15 years, at an annual cost of $7
billion to $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices would increase by amounts equivalent to about 5
cents per gallon of gasoline, according to these projections.
</P>
<P>
   The models suggested that about one-fourth of the reductions in
emissions would actually be accomplished within the United States.
The rest of the reductions would be bought from other countries
that were cutting emissions more than the treaty required, and
therefore had surplus pollution permits to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yellin and Todd Stern, the White House's senior aide on

underestimated how much the administration's policies would reduce
emissions at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yellin said the model did not take into account any of
several initiatives the administration favors to reduce domestic
emissions of carbon dioxide. Among these are elements of its
proposal to restructure the electric utility industry, to provide
tax incentives for energy-saving investments, and to subsidize
research into new technologies like solar power and fuel-efficient
automobiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Officially, the double-crested cormorant is a protected species,
its safety guarded by federal law. But on the Lake Ontario
shoreline west of Watertown, N.Y., the long-necked black birds have
become a pest to anglers, who say the growing colonies of
cormorants are devouring smallmouth bass and, along with them, the
livelihood of people who sell bait and run charter fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   This week, wildlife officials visiting an island nesting ground
discovered an unusually shocking environmental crime: more than 800
cormorants slaughtered by shotgun fire. Although they have no
suspects, officials say they believe the festering conflict between
conservation and commerce is responsible for what they are calling
one of the worst mass killings of a federally protected bird
species in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   State biologists said that when they went ashore on the
uninhabited Little Galloo Island on Wednesday they encountered
heaps of carcasses of fledgling cormorants, piles of shotgun shells
and starving chicks squawking weakly among the carnage. Clifford
Schneider, who directs Lake Ontario projects for the New York state
Department of Environmental Conservation, said ``you see a young
chick still laying there alive among all the others that had been
wiped out, and you can't help but be moved emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting appeared to be the latest of several recent
instances where a once rare species has recovered to the point
where it comes into conflict with local interests. On July 23, the
town of Carrollton, Texas, without a federal permit, bulldozed a
rookery filled with nesting little blue herons, snowy egrets, and
other species protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The count of dead birds from that incident could be more than
1,000, said Pamela McCroskery, a spokesman for the Texas Audubon
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Around eastern Lake Ontario, fish-eating cormorants have staged
a dramatic recovery since the 1950s, when they were nearly wiped
out by pesticides and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In Henderson and other fishing towns near Little Galloo Island,
owners of charter boats and other fishing related businesses,
joined by some officials, have been pressing the government for
several years to allow legalized hunting of cormorants, which they
claim are responsible for a drop in populations of smallmouth bass
and other popular gamefish.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline in the sport fishing industry being blamed on
the birds, there has been more and more talk along the shore lately
of taking action, said Ron Ditch, a charter boat owner and guide
for 43 years in Henderson Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty instrumental in trying to do this in a proper
and legal manner,'' Ditch said Friday. ``But everyone's been
hearing rumblings forever about how people are going to go out and
take care of the situation. Apparently, someone finally wouldn't be
talked out of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the cormorants has centered on Henderson
Harbor, a hamlet on a peninsula several miles from Little Galloo
Island. The docks are a magnet for fishermen from across the
country, some of whom spend $300 a day to charter boats and pursue
smallmouth bass, salmon and other trophy fish.
</P>
<P>
   The hamlet has nine marinas and more than 60 professional
captains, and for many years, fishing has been about the only
source of jobs or revenue, said Grover Moore, captain of the
Charter II. ``When I was growing up, there were signs at both ends
of the harbor that said, `The Home of the Black Bass.'''
</P>
<P>
   But black bass, including smallmouths, have been hard to come by
for several years, he said, and the fishermen say the birds are the
only obvious culprit.
</P>
<P>
   He said anglers had shot videotape of cormorants devouring
freshly stocked brown trout to persuade state officials to press
for a hunting season. ``You can see them eat so many that they
couldn't fly off the water,'' Moore said. ``But nobody wants to
listen to the fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing threats against the birds first turned to action in
April, when eight cormorants were killed, federal wildlife
officials said. In June, about 100 cormorants were killed. But this
week's massacre, which left 840 birds dead and more than 100 others
injured, transformed the local issue into an extraordinary
environmental crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Snow, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service
headquarters in Washington, said that a quick survey of officials
there turned up no past mass killings of a protected species that
compared with the cormorant shooting, except perhaps for the
incident in Texas. ``I've been with the department for almost 20
years and this is certainly the biggest in my memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked diving birds have been protected for 25 years
under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the
killing of ducks, geese, egrets, cormorants and other migrating
birds without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   But as the colony on the island grew to upwards of 8,000 active
nests in recent years, it was increasingly perceived as a threat to
the local sportfishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The uninhabited island contains the largest rookery for the
cormorants in eastern Lake Ontario, with as many as 8,400 active
nests counted there in recent years. The island is owned by the
Phillips Petroleum Co. but essentially is used only as a bird
preserve, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing guides and charter captains in the area have
increasingly pressed members of Congress to write legislation
authorizing controlled, legal hunting of the cormorants to reduce
their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John McHugh, a Republican who represents the lakeshore
portion of upper New York state, complained last fall that the Fish
and Wildlife Service was taking too much time to assess the impact
of the birds on local fish stocks. Along with Rep. Colin Peterson,
D-Minn., he introduced legislation last October that would
authorize states to establish hunting seasons to control the
cormorants.
</P>
<P>
   The birds can be legally hunted in only a few places where they
pose a clear economic threat; for example, at catfish farms in
Louisiana, federal wildlife officials said. But research on their
impact, if any, on the fish in Lake Ontario is still in early
stages, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists have estimated that cormorants eat between
400,000 and 1.2 million smallmouth bass a year in the eastern part
of the lake. But the significance of that number depends on the age
of the bass, said James Farquhar, a biologist for the New York
state Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those are newborn bass, that's a drop in the bucket,''
Farquhar said. ``There are literally billions. But if those 1.2
million fish have already lived through several years, that is a
significant number.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, officials were continuing their investigation.
Conservation officers were interviewing anglers and others who
might be able to pinpoint suspects in and around the fishing town
of Henderson and other spots along the Lake Ontario shore. Offers
of cash for information were being made, but no specific reward was
posted.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Environmental Conservation Commissioner John
Cahill said, ``We're making an all-out effort to find these people
and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. ``This was an act
of savage brutality.'' Killing a bird protected by the federal
migratory bird act can bring a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and
six months in prison for each count, said Adam O'Hara, the special
agent in charge of law enforcement for the Fish and Wildlife
Service in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara said that evidence collected on the island, including
more than 100 shell casings and some bird carcasses, was being sent
to state pathology laboratories and a federal forensic laboratory
for investigating wildlife crimes in Ashland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Miller, the executive director of the National Audubon
Society's New York state chapter, said the shooting harked back to
the turn of the century, when waterfowl and gulls were shot by the
million for sport and to supply feathers to the hat industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dark act that takes us back to that time,'' he said.
He called for a swift investigation and aggressive prosecution of
the shooter or shooters. ``The message has to be strong that people
really can't take the law into their own hands.''

DRAFT BILL DEFINES OPTIONS FOR PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska)  (lb) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Puerto Rico prepares for a plebiscite in
December, a Senate committee chairman on Friday released a
scaled-back draft bill that defines the three options:
commonwealth, statehood or independence.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was released by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who
heads the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Murkowski said
he had tried to use ``accurate'' and ``neutral'' definitions in the
bill for the plebiscite, which is to be held on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Rico's governor, Pedro Rossello, said he did not
expect the plebiscite to be approved by Congress, because the
Senate would probably not pass a bill this year. The House has
narrowly passed its version of legislation that would recognize a
plebiscite, and Rossello has said he will use the House language in
the plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's bill makes clear that whether Puerto Rico is a
commonwealth, or a territory of the United States, Puerto Ricans
are citizens by federal law, not by constitutional right, a
definition that commonwealth supporters vigorously oppose because
they argue that citizenship should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   But Murkowski sought to allay concerns Friday by emphasizing
that Puerto Ricans should not fret about losing their citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Puerto Rico remains under U.S. sovereignty,'' he
said at a news conference here, ``its residents will remain U.S.
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said his committee would consider the bill in
September, after the August break. But he cautioned that few
legislative days remained for the Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917 and their
island was incorporated as a commonwealth in 1952. They can be
drafted into the military but they cannot vote for federal elected
officials, do not pay federal taxes and cannot collect most federal
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the bill in March, and while it
includes definitions similar to those in the bill offered by
Murkowski, there are differences. His language is narrower and does
not direct Puerto Rico to hold a plebiscite or compel Congress to
act on it. Critics say both bills favor statehood, although
Murkowski tried to blunt that accusation with language in his
version.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, who advocates statehood, has asked the Puerto Rican
Legislature in its special August session to approve his bill for a
plebiscite. If no U.S. law is enacted by December, Rossello asks
that the language from the House bill serve as the foundation for
the plebiscite, since it has already cleared that chamber. The
governor also said he favored the House bill, which Murkowski has
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello visited Capitol Hill on Friday to lobby for
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Senate feels that this is a better version,'' he said,
``then the minimum the Senate should do is approve its version.''

JAIL TERM FOR EX-MAYOR REVEALS A TOUGHER CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH FAISON  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The 16-year sentence given Friday to Chen Xitong, the
powerful former mayor and Communist Party boss of Beijing, is
intended to show that China's leaders are serious about cracking
down on the corruption that is eating away at the core of their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was found guilty by a Beijing court of corruption and
dereliction of duty, the state news media reported. He is the only
member of the party's ruling Politburo to be jailed since the show
trials of the so-called Gang of Four, the leftists who were ousted
from power 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chen's demise is also the last chapter in a bitter,
long-running political rivalry with President Jiang Zemin. The fact
that it took three years to bring Chen to court reflects the
political sensitivity of his case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, an intense power struggle led to the ouster of Zhao
Ziyang, then the party chief, after a military crackdown on
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Chen was known to be hungry for
the job, doing everything he could to distinguish himself to Deng
Xiaoping and other elder leaders who chose the new general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was the first among China's second tier of leaders to
publicly praise the army's crackdown, a ritual of kowtowing that
the rest of the nation was forced to follow in subsequent months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the top job went instead to Jiang, then party boss of
Shanghai, a position that Chen apparently saw as inferior to his
own. The two men became intense rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a political culture that demands traditional displays of
deference and respect for top leaders, Chen was known for failing
to act appropriately with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   As the top man in Beijing's city government, and the man with
final say over building permits during a construction boom in the
early 1990s, Chen personally amassed a fund of $24 million, as well
as an extensive collection of private homes where he indulged his
taste for entertaining young female television presenters,
according to an internal report on his activities that emerged last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He was also implicated in a series of far larger financial
schemes that may have totaled as much as $2 billion, although the
sophistication with which officials shield their activities, and
the secrecy that guards senior leaders, makes an accurate total
impossible to ascertain.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's personal empire crumbled only after a financial scandal
in 1995 implicated one of his closest aides, a deputy mayor who was
soon found on the side of a hill outside Beijing with a bullet hole
in his head. His death was officially deemed a suicide, but the
exact circumstances were kept secret and inevitably stirred
speculation about the true cause of death. Chen was forced to
resign in April 1995.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chen's son, Chen Xiaotong, president of a hotel in Beijing, was
sentenced last year to 12 years in prison for taking bribes and
misusing public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Chen's personal secretary, Chen Jian, is serving a
15-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The court sentence orders Chen to serve 13 years in prison on
the charge of corruption and four years for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the official New China News Agency said Chen will
serve 16 years in total, but it did not explain whether this total
reflected a year of detention he had already served.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said Chen would be ordered to return bribes he
had accepted to the State Treasury, but did not specify an amount.
The state news media reported that, technically, Chen can appeal
the verdict in the next 10 days.

<P>
   HELENA, Mont. _ Montanans are learning that their ``last best
place'' label cuts two ways. It attracts land investors as
prominent as Ted Turner and Charles Schwab. But it also attracts
runaway loners as troubled as the Unabomber and Russell Weston, the
man charged with killing two Capitol Police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Montanans are now saying it is unfair for the nation to judge a
little-known state by its delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't judge L.A. by O.J.; we don't judge New York by the
World Trade Center bombers,'' Andrew Malcolm, the spokesman for
Gov. Marc Racicot, said in the state's capital. ``Montana shouldn't
be judged by its kooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Montanans emphasized this week that many of their state's
notorious residents moved here from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Weston and Theodore Kaczynski, the convicted Unabomber, grew up
in Illinois. In trials of members of the anti-government Freemen
movement, based in eastern Montana, the state's juries have
convicted people who came here from Canada and from Arkansas,
California, Colorado, North Carolina and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a sect based in California, the Church Universal
and Triumphant, moved to a ranch north of Yellowstone National
Park, dug bomb shelters and waited for the world to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy Weston isn't a native _ it doesn't have anything to
do with Montana people,'' Jim Allison, a retired cowboy, said this
week as he read a newspaper on Last Chance Gulch, the central
pedestrian mall in this former gold- and silver-mining city. ``They
had the same problem in Texas after the Civil War. Every renegade,
every outlaw, moved there. It got so bad they had to develop the
Texas Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a little prodding, Allison, a grizzled man in a straw
cowboy hat, admitted that he, too, moved here from out of state _
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first time in decades, people who moved here
from other states now outnumber native-born residents of Montana.
Moreover, second-home owners are flocking to a state that is nearly
the size of California, but has only 900,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters of Big Sky Country would prefer that Montana's name be
tied to these glamorous second-home owners: Stephen E. Ambrose, the
author and historian; Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, and a slew
of Hollywood actors: Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Keaton,
Jeff Bridges, Andie McDowell, Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid.

   ``A lot of people are drawn to Montana and Idaho because of the
isolation of the mountains, because there are fewer rules and
regulations, because there is a kind of mind-your-own-business
ethic out here,'' said Robert Balch, a sociology professor at the
University of Montana in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Montana is the nation's fourth-largest state in area (after
Alaska, Texas and California), but it ranks 44th in population. In
this state with only six people per square mile, automobile drivers
can cruise the Interstates in Montana during daylight unencumbered
by speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montana has a certain mythical attraction to it that allows
for 10 times as many people who live here to visit, to pass
through,'' Racicot said, referring to the 9 million tourists who
are drawn to the state every year, largely in the summer. ``The
fact about Montana is that a huge amount of open space provides for
a lot of privacy.''

   Some people say the Western penchant for self-reliance and small
government might have been why the state mental hospital apparently
did not conduct follow-up contacts with Weston in the 20 months
since he was released, in December 1996. Doctors at Warm Springs
State Mental Hospital released Weston after concluding that he was
not a threat to himself or to others, and with the understanding
that he would return to his family home in Illinois and continue
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montana has no more mentally ill than the rest of the nation,
but being so rural it is hard to keep up with them,'' said Dr.
Nathan Munn, a psychiatrist in Helena.
</P>
<P>
   But Racicot said the state was not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the Illinois authorities did not reach a
conclusion that was distinctively different from Montana's,'' the
governor said. ``Apparently, the FBI and the Secret Service did not
see the need for a higher level of security.''
</P>
<P>
   T.H. Watkins, a professor of Western history at Montana State
University in Bozeman, also would not tar the region for its
deviants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, like Kaczynski, is an anomaly,'' Watkins said of
Weston. ``He's a paranoid schizophrenic. I don't think the West did
it to him. Why do we simply assume that the West breeds these
characters? It doesn't.''

4 PROFILES OF TOP INVESTMENT BANKERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Va., Mass., Minn.)   (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A decade ago, it was easy to name Wall Street's top
mergers-and-acquisitions specialists. They were swashbucklers who
craved the spotlight, and their role in major deals was often as
big as the chief executives'.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with investment bankers playing more subdued roles as
advisers and tacticians, identifying the cream of the crop is more
challenging.
</P>
<P>
   In an examination of the 25 biggest mergers this year and in
interviews with dozens of professionals in the mergerbusiness, a
handful of bankers emerged as standouts; by virtue of the year's
merger activity, their specialties are financial services,
technology and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   (Not included on the list are the heads of the
mergers-and-acquisitions departments of various banks; they can be
as much administrators as deal makers.)
</P>
<P>
   If these four bankers are not the best in the business, they are
certainly having the biggest impact. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gene T. Sykes may be the best-kept secret of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. And if it were up to him, he would keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes is having the kind of year that most investment bankers
can only dream of. Since Jan. 1, he has: advised Royal Philips
Electronics on its pending $10.6 billion sale of Polygram to
Seagram; helped counsel Monsanto in the talks that led to its
merger deal with American Home Products; sat at the table on not
one, but two big acquisitions by AT&AMP;T, and helped defend the
Computer Sciences Corp. against a $9.8 billion hostile takeover bid
from Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   But the banker has not sought out the glory that this track
record might afford. Since his college days at Harvard, he has
known that he is constitutionally more comfortable behind the
scenes: although he was interested in politics, he was too
self-effacing to run for student office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to campaign for myself,'' he said. ``I like the
idea of having influence _ of taking responsibility for making
decisions _ but doing so with less public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That preference led him to Wall Street instead of Washington.
Sykes, now 40 and a Goldman partner, counsels executives who make
bold moves without drawing himself into the spotlight. And his
desire to be near powerful people is a boon for Goldman's merger
business.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when C. Michael Armstrong was named chairman and
chief executive of AT&AMP;T last year, Goldman's telecommunications
bankers asked Sykes _ who knew Armstrong at Hughes Electronics _ to
arrange an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes did more. He read up on AT&AMP;T _ a company he did not know
well _ steeping himself in research before the team's meeting in
early November.
</P>
<P>
   At the session, the team convinced Armstrong that it could aid
him in his new venture _ which historically had been a Morgan
Stanley client. The bank ended up helping to advise AT&AMP;T in its
deals to acquire Teleport for $11.3 billion and Tele-Communications
Inc. for $31.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes can be elusive; he never reveals more than is absolutely
necessary. For two years, he chatted almost daily with Steve Stetz,
corporate vice president for mergers and acquisitions at Monsanto _
from ski slopes, airplanes, even a London hotel room at 3 a.m. But
when Stetz was asked to share a personal detail about the banker,
it took him a few minutes to recall that Sykes recently had
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene is so confidential he doesn't even tell you what other
companies he works with,'' Stetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes is at times clinical in his approach, and not inclined to
board-room histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only saw him lose his temper once _ at 1:30 in the morning _
in a dispute over the TCI exchange ratio,'' said Laurence
Grafstein, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston who
worked with Sykes on both of the AT&AMP;T deals this year. ``The
episode lasted only 10 seconds and, although he raised his voice,
he still kept smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every deal works out as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, Sykes and bankers from Morgan Stanley
worked several months on a large technology transaction when, the
night before they were set to announce the deal, his client wanted
out. That deal was never struck.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes grew up in Los Angeles, the son of a World War II fighter
pilot who gave him the middle name ``Tiger.'' His father told the
young Sykes that he himself had wanted to be a tiger as a boy. But
that was just one of four explanations for the unusual name that he
heard growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it on my business card,'' Sykes said, laughing. ``What
do you think that says about me?''
</P>
<P>
   That he is anything but a Wall Street drone. Indeed, it doesn't
take long for a conversation to digress into his true obsession _
outdoor sports.
</P>
<P>
   He was not athletic as a child; Michael Roberts, a Harvard
classmate who was best man at Sykes' wedding, said he used to tease
his friend that ``he must have been the last person picked on his
fourth-grade kickball team.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But since joining a rowing team in college, Sykes has been an
avid sportsman. As a young banker at Goldman in New York, he spent
lunch breaks running on traffic-heavy Third Avenue. He has also
competed in several triathlons, including two Ironman events, one
in Hawaii and the other in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He backpacks for weeks at a time in Alaska, where he is on the
Nature Conservancy's board. He hang glides in Rio de Janeiro. For
his bachelor party last year, 23 friends from as far as Rome and
London joined him for a kayaking trip down the lower Salmon River
in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would depress me terribly to think I wrapped up my whole
life in business,'' he said, clearly proud of his athletic
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes spends half his time in New York. But his home and his
wife, Tracy, who just finished her doctorate in physical therapy,
are in Los Angeles, where he has lived since 1987. He also has an
apartment in San Francisco, near Goldman's technology headquarters.
During their two-week honeymoon to the south of France last summer,
his wife requested that he confine himself to one business call a
week. He did.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes is thoughtful about his future. He is committed to
Goldman, Sachs, but might consider a job with a venture capital
firm one day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, being a master of the 90s universe won't be his
legacy for the next century. ``We'll have to see what role fits me
then,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Frank P. Quattrone left Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to head
up Deutsche Bank's technology unit in 1996, the industry all but
wrote off Morgan Stanley's high-technology effort. Enter Chuck
Cory, 43, the banker who moved to Silicon Valley from New York to
take his place.
</P>
<P>
   How is he doing? So far this year, Morgan Stanley ranks No. 1 in
overall dollar value for high-technology mergers, according to the
Securities Data Co. Cory had a hand in such recent deals as the
pending $9.1 billion acquisition of Bay Networks, the data
networker, by the telephone equipment maker Northern Telecom, and
the pending $7.1 billion acquisition of the Ciena Corp. by Tellabs
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's performance is quite a feat, given the sniping
nature of Silicon Valley, where bankers take pride in poaching one
another's clients. But Cory's no-nonsense approach clearly is
working in the fast-moving technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one recent merger negotiation. Cory and his client were
stuck debating price one night with the opposing company's bankers.
With no end in sight and the clock ticking to midnight, Cory stood
up, closed the briefcases of his colleagues and told the opposing
bankers he was going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chased us down the elevator,'' Cory said. ``Clearly there
are other ways that are more conciliatory. But you can't define the
middle ground unless you define what the ends are.''
</P>
<P>
   A lover of language and debate, Cory set out to be a politician
when he was a college student at the University of Virginia. But
after a summer internship at an investment firm, he completed his
MBA and obtained a law degree, then moved to New York City to work
for Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extremely verbal,'' said Jane A. Risser, the corporate
treasurer for Bay Networks, who has known him for five years. ``He
is able to express the essence of issues very crisply.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory is a perfectionist who demands as much of others as he does
of himself. Once, when an associate failed to prepare a client
pitchbook to Cory's exacting standard, the book was redone several
times in a short 36 hours. And colleagues joke that it is difficult
for him to find a secretary who will stay for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Cory said, somewhat defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of technology banking is grueling, even for a
high-energy deal maker like Cory, who has been known to take not
one, but two red-eye flights from San Francisco to New York in a
week. That is because deals today are measured in days, not months.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, it took nine days to negotiate the $460
million merger of two technology companies, Scopus Technology and
Siebel Systems, and three weeks for the Bay Networks-Northern
Telecom deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small companies have a way of becoming the big companies,'' he
said, ``not in a metal-bending time frame, but in Internet
years.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, on Thomas C. King's second day in the
mergers-and-acquisitions department at Salomon Brothers, his boss
gave him his first assignment: to help the BellSouth Corp.in its
bid to acquire a license to operate a telecommunications network
for the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
   King, then barely 29 and fresh out of business school, packed
his suitcase and, along with 30 executives from BellSouth, left for
the first of what would be eight trips to Sydney over the next year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, BellSouth had a $680 million deal, and King was on
the road to becoming one of a new generation of specialists in
telecommunications mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Ice Man'' by one of his colleagues, King is known
for keeping his cool under pressure. It is not surprising, then,
that he has been involved in some of the highest-profile deals this
year; he was part of the Salomon Smith Barney team that helped
broker the $53 billion merger agreement last week between Bell
Atlantic and GTE, as well as the earlier $62 billion merger pact of
SBC Communications and Ameritech. He also represented Southern New
England Telecommunications when it agreed in January to be acquired
by SBC Communications for $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But he is probably best known for his work with Worldcom in its
$37 billion unsolicited bid for MCI Communications. On the Thursday
before Labor Day last year, King received word that the chief
executive of Worldcom, Bernard J. Ebbers, was coming to New York to
discuss the possibility of breaking up the pending merger of MCI
and British Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   King quickly pulled together a team of experts. It included a
proxy solicitor, to examine if the British Telecom deal was
vulnerable to breakup; lawyers, to evaluate the regulatory issues,
and bankers, to study several ways to value the companies. After
five days, they came up with a 125-page document that became the
blueprint for the Worldcom deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the meeting, Bernie went around the table and
asked us what we thought,'' King remembered. ``We said, `Yes, we
can do this.' '' On Oct. 1, Worldcom announced its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Shassian, chief financial officer for Southern New
England Telecommunications, said he talks to King monthly, not only
to hear his suggestions about potential alliances, but also to
bounce ideas off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only reactive, but he's proactive,'' Shassian said.
</P>
<P>
   King grew up near Boston and worked as a broker for Smith Barney
before getting his acceptance letter to the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania on the day after the stock market
crashed in 1987. Being a retail broker ``was really tough,'' he
said with a groan.
</P>
<P>
   But banking is no less stressful. To deal with that stress, King
runs _ including six marathons in the last decade. He has long been
a competitive athlete; he was recruited by the ice hockey coach at
Bowdoin College in Maine. He still plays on a team _ the Outlaws _
in a league at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan where, at 37, he says he
is one of the oldest players.
</P>
<P>
   King has a surprising aw-shucks quality more commonly associated
with Mayberry than Wall Street. A testament to his character?
Competing bankers actually like him, a rare situation among deal
makers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important deal that J. Christopher Flowers
will work on this year is the one that affects him most personally
_ the initial public offering by his firm, Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Months before Goldman's partners voted to go public in June,
Flowers and a team of colleagues holed up to study the
partnership's options. But he took time out to represent Norwest in
its planned $34 billion takeover of Wells Fargo and helped defend
Mellon Bank when the Bank of New York announced its unsolicited
offer to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, a Goldman partner, has been head of the firm's
financial-institutions group since 1996, after serving as co-head
for two years. His team has been involved in almost all the largest
recent deals involving financial and asset management companies _
including the planned merger of BankAmerica and Nationsbank and the
pending combination of First Chicago NBD with Banc One.
</P>
<P>
   It was his idea to hire away Kendrick R. Wilson III from Lazard
Freres &AMP; Co., almost guaranteeing Goldman a place at any
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Kovacevich, chief executive of Norwest in
Minneapolis, has been on the other side of the table from Flowers.
``I always felt at least Chris was listening,'' he said. ``He's a
good strategic thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Flowers' work in 1991, when Goldman was urging Banco
Santander of Spain to invest in what was then the First Fidelity
Bancorp., a big New Jersey bank. At first, the Spanish bank was
cool to the suggestion, but Flowers flew to Spain _ a trip he
thought was risky, because it was two days after the start of the
Persian Gulf war _ and persuaded company executives that an initial
$220 million investment would be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Banco Santander acquired even more shares and hit
it big when First Fidelity was acquired by the First Union Corp. in
1995. It sold the last of its investment for $2.13 billion in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers plays chess and squash and enjoys sailing _ an interest
he acquired while growing up near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And what does a man who can afford almost anything ask his
mother to buy him for his 40th birthday? Last October, she
delivered a box of books about New England, including the one that
he has been reading lately: ``The Country of the Pointed Firs,'' a
series of stories written in the late 1800s about life in Maine.

NO REJOICING FOR JOYCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The world's 547th-ranked player just missed making
the semifinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup. And Michael Joyce was
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, who had the shortest commute of any player this week _
from Brentwood to the Los Angeles Tennis Center at UCLA _ had
reason to be upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica native was ranked 64th as recently as two years
ago, and his expectations are high despite the struggles of the
last 12 months. A freak wrist injury last summer knocked him out of
action for eight months and nearly dropped him off the face of the
tennis world.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was Friday, taking Guillaume Raoux to three sets in
a quarterfinal match, eventually falling to the Frenchman, 6-7
(7-9), 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce's best week of tennis in a year? Easily. Reason to
celebrate? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure later on tonight or tomorrow I'll probably look back
on the week and realize it was a great week for me,'' Joyce said
afterward. ``Right now it's disappointing after losing such a tough
match. If I would have lost 6-2, 6-2 or something, maybe it
wouldn't have been so upsetting, but to know I was so close at
getting to the semifinals, it's very disappointing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he noted, ``This is definitely a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The incredible part is that he was in a position to be
disappointed in the first place. This was just his third tournament
since March, when he returned to competition. And he had to play
his way in via three qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce then went through Australia's Michael Tebbutt and Armenian
Sargis Sargsian, both in three sets, to advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The arduous week took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like my eighth match in a week,'' Joyce said of the
marathon with Raoux. ``I felt pretty tired in the third set.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first set that nearly gave him a heart attack,
though. Lunging for a ball, he fell to the pavement, clutching his
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Joyce said. ``My knee locked, hyperextended. I
didn't feel that much pain, but it was such an awkward fall that I
got kind of scared.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pain subsided during the match, and Joyce later said the
knee felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence is recovering nicely as well, and he looks
forward to the climb back to the top 100. Not that he's thinking
about rankings just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm more relaxed on the court now, because I know
now how lucky I am to be able to be out there competing and doing
what I love to do,'' he said. ``I don't even think about the
rankings and the money and all those things as much as I used to,
because I'm just happy to be out there playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's taken away from you, you realize how fortunate you
are to have this life.''

PAULA JONES' LAWYERS ASK THAT HER SUIT BE REINSTATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Mo.)  (js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones asked a federal
appeals court Friday to reinstate her sexual misconduct suit
against President Clinton, arguing, among other things, that a
lower court should never have excluded evidence about any
relationship he had had with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, Ms. Jones' lawyers maintained that Susan Webber
Wright, the federal district judge in Little Rock, Ark., who threw
out the suit four months ago, exceeded her authority in ruling
earlier that any evidence of a sexual liaison between Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky was not material to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones legal team said evidence of a Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship would have helped them show a pattern of how Clinton
treats subordinate women in the workplace. The lawyers said Clinton
had used his position of authority to engage in sex with Ms.
Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said evidence about Ms. Lewinsky was relevant to ``the
core issue of whether he engaged in the conduct alleged by Ms.
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' suit maintains that in 1991, at a Little Rock hotel
where a state economic conference was under way, a state trooper
summoned her to meet in a suite with Clinton, who was then the
governor. By the account of Ms. Jones, who at the time was a state
employee, Clinton propositioned her there, dropping his trousers
and asking her to perform a sex act. The president has vehemently
denied such an occurrence, although he does not dispute that he may
have met Ms. Jones at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a sensational trial was averted on April 1
when Wright ruled that Ms. Jones had not presented any tangible
evidence of damage, even if the encounter had occurred as she
contended. ``While the alleged incident in the hotel, if true, was
certainly boorish and offensive,'' the judge wrote in dismissing
the lawsuit, ``the governor's alleged conduct'' constituted neither
sexual assault nor actionable harassment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Jones lawsuit had already caused enormous damage to Clinton,
both politically and legally. It became the basis for the current
investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
into whether Clinton had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and then colluded with her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition taken by Ms. Jones' lawyers in January, Clinton
denied under oath that he had had a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Starr is investigating whether Clinton committed perjury
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' appeal on Friday was filed with the U.S.tates Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The court has a
generally conservative cast of judges who have been consistently
unhelpful to Clinton in other cases. But those judges have also
been notably reluctant to entertain complaints of workplace sexual
discrimination like the one brought by Ms. Jones.

   NEW YORK _ Rex Lardner, a humorist who spent the better part of
his life doing what he did best and enjoyed most, writing, playing
tennis and making people laugh, died July 27 at the top of his
game, playing mixed doubles with his usual tenacious skill at a
court near his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 80 and the author of
more than a dozen books and hundreds of magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a storied literary family, Lardner, a nephew of
celebrated humorist Ring Lardner and a cousin of acclaimed New
Yorker critic and Newsweek columnist John Lardner, could have been
forgiven if he had chosen a different line of work.
</P>
<P>
   But as a man who was funny by nature and competitive on
principle, he did not shrink from the challenge. And if he never
achieved spectacular success, he more than held his own. As the
chief radio and television writer for the innovative comedian Ernie
Kovacs, for example, he won a Sylvania Award in 1956 for creative
television technique.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first books, ``Out of the Bunker and Into the
Trees,'' a 1960 parody of golf and golfers, was considered so funny
that various chapters have been widely reprinted in sports
magazines. Although he wrote other golf books, including ``The
Great Golfers,'' and ``Downhill Lies and Other Falsehoods,'' golf
was never his game, perhaps because he claimed to have discovered
the reason people played golf: ``to destroy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lardner, who also wrote ``Ten Heroes of the '20s,'' ``The
Legendary Champions,'' ``Ali'' and ``The Lardner Report,'' a
humorous account of life in the suburbs, was more in his element
writing about tennis and other racquet sports. He wrote
instructional books on squash and badminton and several books on
tennis, among them, ``The Complete Guide to Tennis,'' ``How to
Attack Your Opponent's Weakness'' and ``Tactics in Women's Singles,
Doubles and Mixed Doubles,'' all of which mixed humor with
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Lardner, the son of an itinerant newspaperman, was born in St.
Paul, Minn., and grew up in Great Neck after his father, also named
Rex, got a job as an editor at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He developed the two great themes of his life, writing and
sports, at the University of Michigan. He majored in journalism and
won two Big 10 wrestling championships.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as a free lance in New York, he served in
the Army in World War II, then returned to New York, where he
became a reporter for The New Yorker and began turning out articles
for such magazines as Esquire, Look, Holiday, World Tennis and The
New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was through tennis that he and Kovacs met and discovered such
a mutual offbeat humor that Lardner became the comic's chief writer
for a succession of radio and television shows in New York and
Hollyood.
</P>
<P>
   After Kovacs' death in 1962, Lardner worked for several years as
a staff writer for Sports Illustrated, but the strictures of a
regular job with erratic travel schedules did not appeal to him,
and he retired from the rat race to work out of the attic of his
home as a decidedly prolific freelance magazine writer and author.
</P>
<P>
   A man for whom writing came easy, Lardner worked out an
agreeable regimen for himself. Getting up early to work out with
weights in his basement (he believed in preparation), he would then
play tennis, come home to type for a while before lunch and,
perhaps after a nap, play some more tennis followed by more typing,
dinner and still more typing.
</P>
<P>
   For all his sense of humor, Lardner was a stickler for semantic
accuracy and a master at solving crossword puzzles, which was
hardly surprising for a man who once used a review in The New York
Times to sum up a book by humorist S.J. Perlman as ``a gallimaufry
of harrowing experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Martha; two sons, Rex Jr., of
Chicago, and Michael, of Garden City, N.Y.; a daughter, Lonnie, of
Los Angeles; and five grandchildren.

HARVIE BRANSCOMB, 103, A SHAPER OF VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ala., N.C., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Harvie Branscomb, the chancellor of Vanderbilt University
from 1946 to 1963, who put the institution on the path to national
prominence, died July 23 at his home in Nashville. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Branscomb was the first chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission
for Education Exchange, whose purpose was to keep alive the spirit
of cooperation among Western nations and to combat communism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he was chairman of the Commission on Education and
International Affairs of the American Council of Education. He
later was educational consultant to the World Bank and a chairman
of the U.S. Commission for UNESCO as well as a member or officer of
other international conferences and organizations formed to counter
illiteracy and foster education.
</P>
<P>
   When Branscomb was named chancellor in 1946, he was only the
fourth person to hold the office since Vanderbilt's founding in
1873. He proved an energetic and engaged leader.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired, Vanderbilt was on its way to the top
tier of American research universities. The number of full-time
faculty members had doubled, faculty salaries had almost tripled
and the number of buildings on the campus had more than doubled.
The university's annual budget increased by more than 400 percent,
and the endowment jumped to $88 million from $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 to 1962, the schools of engineering, divinity and law
all acquired their own buildings and 15 additional residence halls
were constructed. A history of the university, ``Gone With the
Ivy'' (University of Tennessee Press, 1985), by Prof. Paul Conkin,
asserted that at the end of Branscomb's tenure, Vanderbilt could
count itself among the top 20 private universities in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his long tenure, he was a leading fund-raiser. In
1960, Branscomb became caught up in a fierce conflict that drew
wide attention, over the expulsion of a black student from the
divinity school. The student, James M. Lawson Jr., had been
dismissed on grounds that he advocated civil disobedience as a
leader of a civil rights sit-in in Nashville. At least a dozen
faculty members, arguing that local ordinances had been used to
deny blacks their constitutional rights, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Branscomb tried to negotiate a compromise, but wound up angering
many African-Americans and their supporters on the faculty with his
statement, ``The law has been the basis for much of the Negroes'
progress in the past and is the guarantee of their continued
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the dean of the divinity school, who had supported
Lawson, was forced to resign, and Lawson completed his studies at
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   In a memoir published in 1978, Branscomb acknowledged that
``with the advantage of hindsight, it appears to me now that the
best course might have been to bury the issue in administrative
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Rev. Dr. Lawson, who had become a Methodist pastor
in Los Angeles, returned to Vanderbilt to receive the divinity
school's Distinguished Alumnus Award, at which time he was warmly
greeted by Branscomb.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Birmingham College, later named Birmingham-Southern
College, Branscomb won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, where he
began his career as a New Testament scholar in 1914. He later
published four books on the cultural and religious roots of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   While at Oxford, Branscomb was among the group of American
student volunteers who worked for Herbert Hoover's Commission for
Relief in Belgium. He and a fellow student daringly smuggled a
letter out of Belgium addressed to Belgian religious leaders
encouraging resistance to the German invasion then under way. The
letter, published in The Times of London, led to the decoration of
Branscomb and his fellow student by the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   After Oxford, he earned a doctorate in philosophy at Columbia
University and later became dean of the divinity school at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Huntsville, Ala., he is survived by three sons,
Harvie Branscomb Jr., of Corpus Christi, Texas., Dr. Ben Branscomb
of Birmingham, Ala., and Lewis M. Branscomb, of Concord, Mass.; a
brother, Lewis C. Branscomb, of Columbus, Ohio; two sisters, Dr.
Louise Branscomb and Mrs. Charles L. Dill, both of Birmingham; nine
grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Branscomb's wife of 71
years, Margaret, died in 1992.

BABY SWITCH IN VIRGINIA IS INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The authorities in Virginia are investigating
whether two girls born three years ago at a Charlottesville
hospital were deliberately switched and sent home with the wrong
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was discovered several weeks ago, after the mother of
one of the girls received the results of a genetic test for
paternity and learned that the child, who was born on June 29,
1995, was not related to her or to the girl's presumed father. (The
couple are not married.) Two subsequent genetic tests confirmed the
results.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's lawyer contacted the hospital, the University of
Virginia Medical Center, on July 16. After tracking down girls who
might have been switched with her client's child, hospital
officials took a blood sample from another child who was born
around the same time, and it matched the blood type taken from the
first girl at birth.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital notified the police in what they now consider a
criminal case. In a statement this week, the university said it
``does not believe an accidental misidentification of infants could
have taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Switches shortly after birth are rare but not unheard of. In one
of the best-known cases, a Florida teenager, Kimberly Mays, became
the focus of a heated custody fight after it was found that she and
another baby girl, who died at the age of 9, were sent home from
the hospital with the wrong parents. Without admitting any
wrongdoing, the hospital settled lawsuits by paying the families a
combined $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Custody became an issue when Kimberly's biological parents,
Ernest and Regina Twigg, sought to reclaim her. But in 1993, a
judge in Sarasota, Fla., ended seven years of litigation when he
ruled that she could remain with Robert Mays, the man who had
reared her. His wife, Barbara, died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Virginia medical center said an inadvertent
mix-up was virtually impossible because of procedures used to
identify infants and their mother moments after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Beck, a spokeswoman for the medical center, said
identification bracelets _ blue for boys, pink for girls _ bearing
the same number are placed on the baby's ankle and wrist and on the
mother's wrist in the delivery room. It is a common procedure
throughout the country, she said, and one that had been used at the
hospital for at least 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never leave the mother's arm or the baby's,'' Ms. Beck
said. ``Their numbers are even noted at discharge. We do not take
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing issues of privacy, the hospital declined to make public
the names of the babies' mothers. But a news article in The
Richmond Times-Dispatch Friday identified the mother who sought the
genetic tests as Paula Johnson of Greene County, north of
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper described her as bearing up well under the
circumstances and wanting to wish the parents of her biological
daughter well. ``I don't want to scare the other family in any
way,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left for Ms. Johnson was not returned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Cynthia Johnson, who is not related to her, said in
an interview Friday that her client was going through ``tough
times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty makes everything so difficult,'' the lawyer
said. ``We don't know what's going to happen next. We just hope the
investigation concludes quickly so that everybody can make sure
that the little girls involved have normal lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And what might ``normal'' mean for them, Ms. Johnson was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Child psychologists say neither the status quo nor a reunion
with biological parents can shut out the emotional pain for a child
living since birth with other parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you have attachments to a biological family, but
attachments to a psychological family run very deep,'' said Nadine
Kaslow, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Emory University in
Atlanta. ``Either way you go, it's a huge loss. The child is losing
something. It will be painful no matter what happens.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A GAME? BUSINESS SIDE IS EVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On this bright afternoon, three groups of young
ballplayers assembled in the outfield of Shea Stadium to hear
baseball talk from major-league players. This was the teaching
portion of the the Junior Mets-Emigrant Bank baseball program.
</P>
<P>
   In left field, Tom Robson, the hitting coach, talked about the
importance of balance. In right field, the conditioning coach,
Barry Heyden, talked about building strength. In center field, Turk
Wendell, the 31-year-old relief pitcher, talked about the game of
baseball. What was it like to be famous? What was it like to be a
major-leaguer?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell told them about when he was their age, growing up in
Massachusetts, how he sat and listened to Jim Rice and Carlton
Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell hadn't told them the entire story. He had not talked
about the fragility of being a major-league player. Wendell came to
the Mets in a trade last year. Why hadn't he talked about how it
felt to be traded? The jolt to self-esteem, the ruptured roots. He
did not mention that Friday was the no-waiver trading deadline, and
he could have told them that some of the Mets and Dodgers they had
been watching Friday night could be Marlins or Diamondbacks by
evening's end.
</P>
<P>
   Why hadn't he told them how it felt like to be dealt like one of
their trading cards? ``I wanted to keep it simple,'' Wendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Mets' clubhouse there was a happy pre-game scene of
players lounging, watching television. Bernard Gilkey and Butch
Huskey sat at a table in the middle of the room playing a spirited
game of dominoes. Two hours later, shortly before game time, Gilkey
learned that he was no longer a Met but an Arizona Diamondback.
Gilkey and a minor-leaguer were traded for a pitcher, a catcher and
a player to be named. Now in the Mets' clubhouse, Gilkey exchanged
farewells with teammates. For all the money-grabbing, hard-hearted
images of the modern professional athlete, this was a touching
scene. Lenny Harris hugged Gilkey and asked, ``Where you going,
dawg?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going out there with the cactus, dawg,'' Gilkey said. ``Going
to Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let it get you down,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing but business,'' Gilkey said, ``Nothing but business.''
OK, business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that baseball was a sport,
not a business, and therefore not subject to antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years ago, Curt Flood challenged baseball's reserve
clause. He lost his battle before the Supreme Court in 1972, but
three years later the reserve clause was thrown out and players
could move from one team to another without being traded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate passed a bill acknowledging that
baseball is indeed a business and is subject to modified antitrust
restrictions. But baseball is also a game. A game with deep-seated
emotional attachments that find themselves at odds with business
decisions that move players around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Bohanon got traded to the Dodgers; he has five kids,''
Wendell said, referring to the former Mets pitcher who was dealt
about two weeks ago. ``How do you pick up five kids in the middle
of the season, and then you're starting in two days? How do you go
from New York to L.A. in two days with five kids? A lot of people
don't see that. They see the money, the glitz, the glory, the
fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine remembers that by the time he was traded from
the Padres to the Mets for Dave Kingman in 1977, he was a hardened
veteran and greeted the news with a ``ho-hum.'' But when he was
first traded, from the Dodgers to the Angels in 1972, ``I had all
the emotions,'' he said. ``Elation, sadness, anxiety, anger _ the
whole gamut when it happens the first couple of times. If you're a
good, young player, it makes you question whether or not this was
because someone wanted you or someone didn't want you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gilkey said his goodbyes, Mike Piazza, the Mets catcher who
has been the subject of trade talks, sat off by himself. There was
a time when Piazza thought he would be with the Dodgers forever. He
was rookie of the year in 1993, the fair-haired boy. Then, this
season, he was gone: from L.A. to the Florida Marlins to the Mets.
Piazza thought the team would fork over millions for all he had
done. The team said for him to do it somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie,'' Piazza said. ``It's definitely been a
tough year, mentally. Maybe in a year or two when everything is
boring, I can look back on all this and joke about it, remembering
how everything was so up in the air. Boring would be good right
now.''

WEST VIRGINIA'S DISPIRITED REPUBLICANS STRUGGLE FOR A FOOTHOLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Fla., Va.)   (js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. _ Sally Kay is running for Congress this year.
But hardly anyone in her home state of West Virginia knows it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican challenger to Rep. Robert Wise , a popular
Democrat who has held his seat since 1982, she has no money, no
campaign staff, not even a bumper sticker of her own. She has yet
to make her first campaign speech and remains a virtual stranger to
groups that typically support Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that I'll start to get checks and I'll have to
return them because I don't have a treasurer,'' she said, sitting
in the cramped office of West Virginia's Republican Party
headquarters here in the state capital. ``I'm not abdicating, but
without a treasurer, it's hard to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kay's inability to find a campaign treasurer is only one
example of the hard lot of Republicans in West Virginia, one of the
last remaining examples of a one-party state, and a stark contrast
to Republican gains elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Democrats rule. As a legacy of strong coal-mining unions,
the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and family
traditions of party loyalty, Democrats have held sway over most of
West Virginia's political institutions for more than 60 years. And
it is unlikely Republicans will achieve parity anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by
more than 2 to 1, a disparity that almost always works to the
Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is Gov. Cecil Underwood, who also served as
governor from 1956 to 1960. He won a narrow victory in 1996 by
defeating a Democrat who was widely perceived as even more liberal
than the out-going governor, Gaston Caperton, who had served two
terms. But since 1932, voters have elected only one other
Republican governor, Arch Moore , who served two terms from 1968
through 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's three members of the U.S.House of
Representatives, only Wise faces opposition in the general election
this year, as he did in 1996 when he won easily. Rep. Nick Rahall
II, who was first elected in 1976, faced his last challenger in
1992. Rep. Alan Mollohan, who succeeded his father in 1982, faced
his last in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican has not held a House seat since 1980, and Democrats
have held both Senate seats since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, Democrats have controlled the House since
1928 and the Senate since 1930, a dominance that was fairly common
among Southern states until recently.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, for example, Republicans won control of the state
Senate in 1994 for the first time in 120 years and now have a
majority in both chambers. Three years ago in Virginia, Republicans
pulled even with Democrats in the Senate and with consecutive
Republican governors as a potential tie-breaking vote, now control
it for the first time since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, Republicans have made marginal gains in the
Senate, picking up eight seats since 1990, when they had a record
low of one. But House seats have been harder to come by.
Republicans picked up six in 1990 to reach 26 but no more since.
</P>
<P>
   And it is unlikely they will make significant gains in this
year's elections to fill all 100 seats in the state House of
Delegates and half the 34 seats in the Senate. For the second
election year in a row, the party failed to find candidates in more
than 50 races.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The lopsidedness of a two-party system here has resulted in a
state Republican Party that seems to exist in name only. Betty
White is the executive director and sole full-time employee with an
annual salary of $19,000. She has a desk but no computer. Not that
she needs one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone wiped our computer out in March 1995,'' she said,
hinting at sabotage to erase the list of the state's Republican
voters. ``There were rumors about a virus, but I don't believe
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The size and shape of the state party office reflects a grim
reality for Republicans throughout West Virginia despite the recent
efforts of a new state party chairman and a new group, the
Republican Legislative Committee, to raise money and recruit
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of credible Republican challengers in more state and
federal elections reflects two chronic political conditions in West
Virginia, one feeding the other. The first is the star status of
the state's leading politicians. The popularity and tenure of Sens.
Robert Byrd and John D. Rockefeller IV have deterred potential
challengers from both parties, including the three House members.
And the House members' popularity has discouraged many state
legislators from taking the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the overall dynamic has ushered in a certain
ennui among Republicans, who have felt helpless to change the
political balance, such as it is. In a long conversation, Ms. White
spoke several times of her unsuccessful efforts to raise money and
to encourage people to run against entrenched, well-funded
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has been pretty weak,'' Underwood, who is 75,
conceded in an interview. ``I feel it needs to rebuild its base in
the legislature. That's the only way we can build. We just can't
depend on dissatisfaction from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gould, a 40-year-old lawyer and state lobbyist, said the
party's lack of elective success led him to create the Republican
Legislative Commission in 1994 as a vehicle to identify new
candidates at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   He said his narrow loss in the 1992 state attorney general race,
his first run for public office, convinced him that many Democrats,
despite their party affiliation, are more moderate than liberal and
would be willing to vote Republican in certain elections. That
belief, he said, was bolstered two years ago when Underwood's
opponent, Charlotte Pritt, was widely perceived as a candidate too
far removed from mainstream voters. On the strength of his
political connections, Gould began arranging fund-raisers with the
goal of spreading the money among Republicans in elections where a
Democrat appeared vulnerable. Through this year's elections, he
said, the new group will have contributed $150,000 to Republican
candidates for the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's new party chairman, David Tyson, who
was recently elected to a four-year term, said he has made great
strides in raising money and generating new interest among
Republicans across the state. He said he is planning six
fund-raisers to assist Gould's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But tugging against this kind of progress is the aversion of
Gould's organization and Ms. White to work together even though
Tyson insisted that he, not Ms. White, is doing the bulk of the
work for the state organization and that he enjoys a good working
relationship with Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, sparks have flown, leaving at least a perception of
party disunity. Ms. White, who said she intends to resign soon,
contended that Gould has intentionally undermined her efforts by
``promoting his own candidates while shoving others aside'' and by
tapping Republican donors for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said his group is merely performing where the party has
failed, searching out viable candidates and helping them
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever direction the Republicans are heading, Tyson and other
Republicans say any real measure of party progress will not come
before one of the Democratic congressmen resigns or runs for higher
office, creating a rare opening. Wise has acknowledged that he is
seriously considering a run for governor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the wait is longer, party leaders acknowledge that
they have to do a better job raising money, finding candidates and
convincing voters that Republican positions are more in tune with
their moderate views than the Democrats'.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is changing,'' Underwood said, referring to a
diversifying economy that no longer depends solely on the coal
industry. ``With new jobs and new people, we have a different mix
now. My instincts tell me that if we can capture that growth, we
can build a new party.''

TRADE DAY: DODGERS AND RANGERS SHAKE UP RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While everyone in baseball waited breathlessly to learn where,
if anywhere, Randy Johnson was going, some teams engineered their
own trades Friday, the last day players could be traded without
clearing waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers, scratching and clawing their way through the
American League West race, were the busiest club, creating half a
new infield and swapping starting pitchers. But the Montreal Expos
and the Los Angeles Dodgers executed the biggest and most
intriguing transaction, a seven-player deal that makes teammates of
the Guerrero brothers, Wilton and Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, intent on winning the National League wild-card
race, acquired Carlos Perez, the Expos' best pitcher, for their
starting rotation and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to shore up their
weakened infield. The Expos gained Wilton Guerrero, a second
baseman-outfielder, who at 23 is 16 months older than Vladimir, the
Expos' hard-hitting right fielder, and three minor-league
prospects. The Dodgers also got a minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who were one game behind Anaheim when they made
their trades, acquired pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce
Clayton from St. Louis for pitcher Darren Oliver and third baseman
Fernando Tatis. The Rangers also obtained third baseman Todd Zeile
from Florida for two minor-league players. They then released
shortstop Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had talked with Toronto about Juan Guzman for their
rotation but preferred Stottlemyre, so the Blue Jays sent Guzman to
Baltimore for two young players.
</P>
<P>
   In what was basically a swap of center fielders, the San
Francisco Giants tried to improve themselves for the remainder of
the NL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who recently added Joe Carter to their outfield, got
Ellis Burks from Colorado for Darryl Hamilton. Burks, with 16 home
runs to one for Hamilton, hits with more power, which is what the
Giants were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had talked with the Cardinals about Stottlemyre,
whose father is the Yankees' pitching coach, but the Cardinals
apparently asked for Hideki Irabu and the Yankees said no. Brian
Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not confirm Irabu's
involvement in the talks but said, ``A lot of clubs have asked me
about Irabu.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman added: ``I was talking to them just like I was talking
to everyone else. Nothing seemed to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade with the Cardinals made sense to the Rangers because
they were looking to improve their starting pitching and their
defense at short. Oliver, a left-hander, had been a disappointment
with a 6-7 record and 6.53 earned run average, and Elster had lost
a lot of range at short.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   General Manager Doug Melvin, who two weeks ago acquired Esteban
Loaiza from Pittsburgh for the starting rotation, was especially
pleased to add Stottlemyre, a 33-year-old right-hander, who has a
9-9 record and 3.51 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Todd's track record and competitiveness, we
feel he's going to help our ball club,'' Melvin said on a
conference call. ``We feel when you go down to the last 45, 50
games, it's important to have someone with that kind of attitude.
It's almost an arrogance, and it's good to have down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had hoped to sign Stottlemyre to a contract
extension and keep him, but he rejected their last offer of $21
million for three years because he wanted a fourth year. The
Cardinals had already come up from two years and an option year for
$16 million and were not willing to go to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, operating out of a hotel room in Toronto, where the
Rangers had played the night before, said he had juggled the hotel
phone and his cell phone, talking to two general managers at the
same time. Dave Dombrowski, the Marlins' general manager, was on
the cell phone and Walt Jocketty of St. Louis was on the hotel
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make sure I could do both deals,'' Melvin said. ``I
couldn't give up Tatis without getting Zeile.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, who at 23 is nine years younger than Zeile, is a better
defensive player but does not hit as well as Zeile. Tatis is
batting .270 with 3 home runs and 32 runs batted in while Zeile is
hitting .276 with 13 homers and 66 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile compiled those figures for two teams, the Dodgers and the
Marlins. He was traded to the Marlins with Mike Piazza on May 15
for five players in the Marlins' continuing payroll purge.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza left for the Mets a week later, but Zeile remained for
two and a half months. Zeile was nearly traded to Boston, where he
would have played first base, with Mo Vaughn becoming the
designated hitter. But the Red Sox instead acquired Mike Stanley
from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' payroll, which they slashed from $53 million as
World Series champions at the end of last season to $33 million at
the start of this one, now is about $14 million. In trading Zeile,
the Marlins received a pair of Class A players, third baseman Jose
Santo and pitcher Daniel DeYoung.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, who in recent starts has been a much better pitcher than
his  &QC; 6-12 season record would indicate, did not cost the Orioles
significant major-league talent.
</P>
<P>
   Nerio Rodriguez has pitched in six games, four of them starts,
for the Orioles this season with a 1-3 record and 8.05 ERA. The
other player the Blue Jays got is Shannon Carter, a Class A
outfielder.

RELIGION COLUMN: UNITARIANS DISPUTE BOY SCOUTS ON EMBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many religious bodies in the United States, the
Unitarian-Universalist Association has long stood to the left.
</P>
<P>
   An organization with no creed that proclaims that each person
has a right to seek spiritual truth, the 215,000-member association
embraces members who call themselves humanists, deists, Christians,
and even agnostics and atheists. In recent years, it has also been
outspoken in supporting the rights of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, its stands have put it at odds with the Boy Scouts
of America, which has told the association that it can no longer
award a religious emblem to Unitarian boys in Scout troops.
</P>
<P>
   Such emblems are given by national religious organizations to
Boy Scouts who have completed a period of study about their own
faith. The emblems may be worn like merit badges. Until now, the
Boy Scouts have never forbidden a religious body from awarding such
emblems to its youths, a Scout spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed in May, when the association's headquarters in
Boston received a letter from the Boy Scouts Religious Relations
Committee objecting to a Unitarian manual that explains how a Boy
Scout who belonged to a Unitarian church might attain the
association's ``religion in life'' emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The manual outlines a course of study and written projects about
Unitarian history and principles. The problem, from the Boy Scouts'
standpoint, is that the manual says some boys may have ``trouble
with the religious language'' in the Boy Scout oath, in which a
Scout pledges duty to God and country.
</P>
<P>
   The manual also contains a resolution, adopted by the
association's General Assembly in 1992, disapproving of the Boy
Scouts' policy barring homosexuals from being Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, the Boy Scouts committee called the manual's
passages inappropriate and said it viewed ``with considerable
dismay'' the criticism of the policy against gay Scouts. Until the
manual is ``redrafted to a form acceptable to the committee,''
Unitarian youths may not be awarded the religious emblem, nor can
they wear one on a Scout uniform, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John A. Buehrens, the association's president, said he
regarded the decision as an effort to interfere with
Unitarian-Universalist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responding to a demand for a change in our curriculum and
our practice with our own young people by saying no,'' Buehrens
said. ``I'm saying, `That's not your purview.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the controversy was a test of the association's ``First
Principle,'' which declares that all people have equal worth and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Shields, a Boy Scouts spokesman, said the organization
was not telling the association what to believe. ``The Unitarians
may teach their youth what they wish,'' Shields said. ``We never
presume to impose our beliefs on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The manual's statements about the Boy Scout oath and the ban on
gay members, he said, ``directly contradict Scouting's values.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement between the Boy Scouts and the Unitarians goes back
to a resolution passed by the association in 1992. In it, the
association protested the Boy Scouts' ban on homosexuals by
withdrawing from the religious bodies that are chartering, or
sponsoring, troops or similar organizations in the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to remove themselves from Scouting,'' Shields
said. But individual Unitarian congregations can still be
chartering organizations, capable of sponsoring a Scout troop, he
added, ``if they feel their aims and purposes are compatible with
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Unitarian boys are welcome to join other troops, Shields said,
but the Scouts will not recognize the association's religious
emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Weiner, a Unitarian-Universalist spokeswoman, said the
1992 resolution was intended to be symbolic, not to create a
rupture between the Boy Scouts and Unitarians. ``There are so many
Boy Scouts within our organization,'' Ms. Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in Ohio, Buehrens said, he was a member of a Scout
troop, and as a minister in New York in 1990 he helped organize a
troop for boys living in welfare hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens fondly recalled his troop in Ohio as a demanding group
that required members to spend 30 days a year camping. As a
12-year-old, he said, he attended the 1959 Boy Scout Jamboree in
Colorado Springs, meeting Scouts from around the world. It was his
first time away from home without his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of training and preparation in the Scouts just opened up
the world for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens said that he had exchanged letters and telephone calls
with Boy Scout officials, and that he hoped to meet with them in
September to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``I think I would encourage people to understand
that teaching kids to treat others with fairness, teaching kids not
to discriminate just on the basis of someone belonging to a
particular group, requires the stand we have taken vis-a-vis the
Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Boy Scouts also wanted to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working to resolve this since '92,'' he said.
``We've been hoping we can come to an amicable resolution.''

BUYING A CAMPAIGN FOR VERY LITTLE DOWN  
 LOUISIANA TINKERS WITH CALENDAR AGAIN  
 GAY ISSUES ARE A PROBLEM FOR ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Iowa, N.H., Mo., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generally accepted rule in California politics is that the
state is so big and its television markets are so expensive that it
takes a minimum of $10 million to make a good run for the U.S.
Senate. And that doesn't include the $5 million or so, maybe even
$10 million, that can be spent winning a primary to get on the fall
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Matt Fong managed to win this year's Republican
primary by spending a paltry $2.5 million. His main opponent,
Darrell Issa, spent more than four times as much, $11 million, most
of it from his electronics fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders figure that a candidate who can overcome a
rival's 4-to-1 spending edge in a primary deserves better backing
in the general. So they have ordered a full-court press for money
on behalf of Fong, a moderate, confident he has a real shot at
unseating the Democratic incumbent, Barbara Boxer, a liberal whose
job-approval rating has seldom pushed above 50 percent in her six
years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Latest polls have the race almost a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' money-raising goal for Fong: no less than $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, intent on
expanding the party's hold on the Senate, has called Boxer's seat a
No. 1 target and is considering contributing $3 million. An
additional $1 million or so may be spent on the race by the
Republican National Committee, party officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Republican luminaries are holding fund-raisers
for Fong in places as distant as New York and Washington, while
others are beginning to head for California.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, worked a
San Diego crowd the other day, hailing Fong as a ``21st-century
Republican.'' Other high-profile figures who have agreed to make
pitches around the state include the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott; Speaker Newt Gingrich; Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for Boxer, who is pretty good at raising money
herself, have a different take on the money press for Fong. They
contend it is a measure of how much trouble he is in.
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that the senator has a special ally when it
comes to putting the arm on Democrats for donations: President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tinkers With Calendar Again
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential campaign, Louisiana Republicans moved
the date of their caucuses to the front end of the election year in
a brassy effort to steal some of the attention and influence
usually accorded the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and New
Hampshire primary. But when jealous Republican leaders in Iowa and
New Hampshire hinted that the party faithful in their states might
punish candidates who participated in the Louisiana caucuses, most
of the big names heeded the warning and avoided them.
</P>
<P>
   Now Louisiana Republicans are once again talking about
scheduling early caucuses, this time for Election 2000. And in the
absence, thus far, of any dark talk in Iowa and New Hampshire about
voter retribution, some White House prospects are beginning to make
appearances in New Orleans and elsewhere down on the bayou,
especially those eager to test-run their particular brand of
conservatism in one of the nation's most conservative states.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, the magazine executive Steve Forbes, Gary
Bauer, the head of the Family Research Council, and, perhaps most
telling, Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Issues Are a Problem for Illinois Democrat
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment he won the Democratic nomination in this
year's race for governor in Illinois, Rep. Glenn Poshard, a
downstate moderate, has been under pressure to move to the left on
issues like gun control, abortion and gay rights. If he does not,
party leaders say, he may not run well in the more liberal Chicago
area to the north, which is where Illinois Democrats seeking
statewide office tend to win or lose elections.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the party leaders warn, if Poshard remains fixed in the
ideological middle _ his social conservatism is balanced by
economic liberalism _ he risks the loss of some of his Democratic
base to his Republican opponent, Secretary of State George Ryan.
Ryan, also a moderate, supports gun controls and recently
participated prominently in a gay-pride parade.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard, who in the past has opposed same-sex marriage and
expansion of anti-discrimination laws to protect homosexuals,
skipped the parade, a decision roundly criticized by the relatively
large and politically powerful Illinois gay community. State Rep.
Larry McKeon, the only openly gay member of the Illinois
legislature, announced that he would not join other Democrats in
endorsing Poshard _ just the kind of defection party leaders
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with polls showing Ryan out front in the race by better
than five points, Poshard seems to be moving toward repairing some
of his fences on the left. His campaign manager, Josh Silverman,
says Poshard plans to ``open a dialogue'' over the next few days
with leaders of gay groups. Further, he has been discussing
possible campaign strategies with Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who,
as the first openly homosexual member of Congress, is probably the
most powerful gay politician in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that one early way to begin repairing the damage,''
Frank said, ``would be to vote in favor of bills now before
Congress that would extend and strengthen gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders are skeptical about Poshard moderating his views on
the issue. But Rick Garcia, a gay Democrat who is the political
director of the Illinois Federation for Human Rights, said the
congressman would deserve ``high marks'' should he open a
meaningful dialogue.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 2, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SCANDALS-REVIEW _ No less an authority on Watergate than
Richard M. Nixon proclaimed President Clinton's Whitewater affair
more grave than the scandal that ended Nixon's presidency and
ruined his reputation. ``Can you believe it?'' Nixon said to Monica
Crowley, the young researcher who chronicled his thoughts in the
final years of his life. ``They said it's nothing like Watergate. I
say it's worse. In Watergate, we didn't have profiteering, and we
didn't have a body.'' He was referring to the 1993 suicide of
Vincent W. Foster Jr., Clinton's close friend and deputy White
House counsel. Nixon's comment came in April 1994, nine days before
his death _ and four years before the appearance of the telltale
dress, the talking points and the Tripp tapes. By John Broder.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DELUSIONS-REVIEW _ Other countries produce terrorists and
murderous psychopaths, but experts say the United States clearly
leads the world in the production of deranged people with paranoid
delusions who commit public acts of violence. By Joe Sharkey. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PFEIFFER-TV-REVIEW _ If any entry signals the now desperate need
for network television to find something to break though the
clutter of blandness that many network executives cite as a
significant factor in the ever-increasing erosion of their
audience, it is surely ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a
comedy series being unleashed this fall by UPN, one of the two
mini-networks currently vying to join the ranks of the big four,
ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. By Bill Carter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW _ For 40 years, China's Communist leaders could
wield absolute authority to launch political campaigns with
quaint-sounding names like the Great Leap Forward or Let 100
Flowers Bloom or the Cultural Revolution. At the whim of the
leadership, opponents were killed en masse or purged, new standards
of behavior were proclaimed and enforced, and the central authority
emerged more centralized and more authoritarian than ever. China's
leaders are still launching political campaigns. The difference now
is that they are no longer signs of the central authority's
strength but rather of its weakness. By Seth Faison.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-REVIEW _ As if defying the laws of politics _ and some
might even say logic _ the pitched battle over what seems an arcane
subject, the census, has not been marked by the regional divisions
that normally define fights over how to count the country's
population. Instead, the current imbroglio has been a purely
partisan affair; so much so that some of the principals seem to be
putting party loyalty above the interests of their state or region.
By Steven A. Holmes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-WAR-FILMS-REVIEW _ Russians take World War II seriously.
This is not to say that American do not. Perhaps to its credit,
America has been bowled over, emotionally and viscerally, by
``Saving Private Ryan,'' the new Steven Spielberg film that is
being hailed as a corrective to Hollywood's glorification, even
trivialization, of combat. By Michael Wines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOMINO-THEORY-REVIEW _ In another era, the domino theory was
used to justify why America was risking lives in Southeast Asia and
other battlefields of the cold war. Lose one country to communism,
and others would fall. Historians will long argue whether the
theory was right, or a politically convenient fiction. By David E.
Sanger. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOLITA-TV-REVIEW _ Sunday night, a new R-rated movie version of
Lolita, the story of a seductive adolescent girl by Vladimir
Nabokov, starring Jeremy Irons and directed by Adrian Lyne, will
have its American premiere on Showtime cable television and open in
theaters next month. By Anthony Ramirez.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOMOSEXUALITY-REVIEW _ Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader,
sounded harsh when he likened homosexuality to kleptomania and
alcoholism. But through a prism of pragmatic politics, his comments
seemed to make sense: The latest Gallup Poll shows that 59 percent
of Americans say that homosexual behavior is morally wrong. By
Richard L. Berke. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM-STRIKE-REVIEW _ The 54-day General Motors strike erupted over
local issues, like the auto maker's push to speed up work at a
plant in Flint, Mich., but the strike shared a theme with walkouts
as far away as Denmark and South Korea. Underlying these strikes
and others is labor's push to resist what many economists say is an
irresistible force: globalization, which opens markets to fierce
competition. By Steven Greenhouse. &QL;

WATCH THE BIRDIES: HURST'S 65 SEEMS PICTURE PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ With Se Ri Pak grabbing so many headlines in
women's golf, Pat Hurst has been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   It has nearly been forgotten that Hurst won the year's first
major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore, and that Hurst could join Pak as a
two-time winner of a major this year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Pak fell seven strokes off the lead Friday at the du
Maurier Classic, Hurst reminded everyone that she is among the best
players on the LPGA Tour. Shooting a 7-under-par 65, which included
a streak of six consecutive birdies, Hurst soared into a
first-place tie with Brandie Burton at 12 under (132) after
second-round play. Burton had Friday's best round (64), including
an eagle on the final hole at the Essex Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the final women's major of 1998 has hardly been a brutal
test of golf. The 36-hole cut was 2 under par, the lowest in
history at an LPGA major, breaking the previous mark of 1 over par
at the 1987 LPGA Championship. It was only one stroke more than the
lowest cut in LPGA history, set last year at the State Farm Rail
Classic. Aren't birdies supposed to be precious at majors? Not this
week, with ideal weather conditions on a 6,308-yard course that is
playing much shorter.
</P>
<P>
   It may take 20 under par or lower to win the tournament. And
with 41 players at five under or lower, the outcome was very much
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are much softer than in most majors,'' said Annika
Sorenstam, who was two strokes off the lead after shooting a 66
Friday. ``You can go right at the pin, which will make scores go
lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's score will have to go much lower to win her third
consecutive major. After Friday's 70, Pak was 5 under for the
tournament and tied for 36th place.
</P>
<P>
   Pak's driving and iron play has been erratic, and she may be
fatigued from playing in her sixth consecutive tournament, coupled
with the fanfare surrounding her attempt to win three majors as a
20-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Pak is too talented to write off, but if she wins this weekend,
it will be the most phenomenal comeback of her phenomenal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a chance,'' said Pak, who has won four times this
year, including three of her last four starts. ``My game is not
good, but not bad. Maybe today or tomorrow, I can find solid
shots.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hurst and Burton hit solid shots all day, and it will take more
of the same for them to hold off their pursuers. Betsy King, the
first-round leader, was in third place at 11 under, one stroke
behind after a 69 Friday. Sorenstam and Meg Mallon, who also shot
69 Friday, were tied for fourth place at 10 under.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurst had the most impressive run of the day, making birdies
on hole Nos. 5 through 10. Hurst, a 29-year-old from San Leandro,
Calif., made putts from 8 to 40 feet in the birdie run.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed as if her ball was being drawn
magnetically toward the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got on a roll where it felt like the hole was a garbage
can,'' Hurst said. ``I felt like I could make it from wherever I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst is sixth on the tour's money list this year with $443,424,
and she is enjoying the best season of her career. Winning a second
major would bring Hurst far more recognition, yet the limelight is
not something she craves, and she does not feel snubbed by the
attention Pak has received.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take it away from Se Ri,'' Hurst said. ``The run she
has had the past few weeks has been amazing. I like being in the
background. But I wouldn't mind winning a second major.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton has also won a major during her career, winning the 1993
du Maurier by defeating King on the first hole of sudden death. But
Burton has not won on the LPGA Tour since 1993, and she would like
to end that drought this weekend. The way Burton finished Friday
should boost her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Starting her round on the 10th hole, Burton completed her day
with a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 8, followed by a 30-foot putt for
eagle on the par-5, 450-yard ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the scores being this low when I practiced
earlier this week,'' Burton said. ``I guess we're beating the
course.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the LPGA's top 20 money-winners, Lorie Kane and
Kelly Robbins, missed the cut.

SCHIZOPHRENIC SUSPECT'S MENTAL STATE IS DEBATED IN SLAYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Michael Laudor, the schizophrenic man
accused in the stabbing death of his pregnant fiancee, Caroline
Costello, continues to show signs of unrelenting mental illness,
including confusion about whether Ms. Costello is actually dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not certain he understands that,'' said Andrew Rubin,
Laudor's attorney, after a brief court appearance here Friday in
which defense and prosecution attorneys argued over whether Laudor
is competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kenneth Lange of Westchester County Court said at the
hearing that Laudor, who is confined to a mental health unit at the
county jail, remained intransigent about taking the medication
meant to curb his delusions. Rubin described the refusal of
medication as a classic symptom of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand,'' Rubin said, ``you are dealing here
with someone who is very, very ill.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense team is considering asking the court to move Laudor
to a secure psychiatric hospital because the county jail can
prescribe only a limited number of drugs, and they do not include
an anti-anxiety medication that he had successfully taken in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital, Rubin said, Laudor would have better psychiatric
supervision, would be more likely to comply with his medication
regimen and thus would be fit to stand trial more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester district attorney's office said it would not
oppose such a move if the safety of others could be assured. But a
lawyer in the district attorney's office who spoke on the condition
of anonymity said that Laudor continued to behave violently, citing
a recent assault on a corrections officer at the jail. Laudor was
arraigned on that assault charge on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, heavily bearded and manacled at the wrists,
Laudor seemed disoriented, staring straight ahead with glazed,
unresponsive eyes. He did not speak _ Rubin entered a plea of not
guilty on his behalf _ and he did not appear to acknowledge one of
his brothers, who sat near the front of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, 35, a Yale Law School graduate who for a time mastered
his schizophrenia, deteriorated in recent months when he stopped
taking the medication that had previously stabilized him. That
deterioration led to the fatal stabbing on June 17 in the apartment
he shared with Ms. Costello in nearby Hastings-on-Hudson, law
enforcement officials say. Laudor is also accused of assaulting a
police officer in upstate New York after he fled the murder scene.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Psychiatrists say that only a small portion of schizophrenics
are ever violent, and that those cases usually happen when a halt
in medication allows a resumption of delusional voices that urge
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor has already been found unfit to stand trial by two
court-appointed psychiatrists, and at Friday's court appearance,
the district attorney's office requested a third examination by a
doctor of their choosing. The judge agreed to the request on the
condition that Laudor's attorney be present along with a
psychiatrist chosen by the defense, who could observe but not
participate.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution's doctor finds Laudor fit to stand trial in
his Aug. 11 exam, a competency hearing will be held, probably in
early September. But the district attorney's office said it will
waive that hearing if the doctor agrees that Laudor is unfit.
</P>
<P>
   If Laudor has not yet been moved to a psychiatric hospital, he
would be moved to one at the point when he is found to be unfit,
and his competency would be reviewed periodically. Even if he is
eventually found competent, it is likely Laudor will employ an
insanity defense at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in psychiatry and the law say that most schizophrenics
can be stabilized in a matter of months on proper medication and
are thus able to understand the charges against them and assist in
their defense, which is the legal definition of competence. If they
are not stabilized ``after a reasonable period of time,'' according
to a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, they must be released or civilly
committed to a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very rare that a person is found to be unrestorable,''
said Richard Bonnie, a criminal law professor at the University of
Virginia. ``The expectation is that he would be ready to go forward
in a number of weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   If Laudor does go to trial and is convicted of the two counts of
second-degree murder he is charged with, he could be sentenced to
25 years to life.

MISSING-PERSON SUSPECTS CHARGED WITH FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors charged a mother-and-son team with
credit-card fraud Friday, a move that will help ensure that the
suspects remain held in New York while their possible role in the
disappearance of an Upper East Side widow is investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the pair, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, are
unrelated to the case of the woman, Irene Silverman, but
prosecutors said they considered the Kimeses the lead suspects in
her Aug. 6 disappearance. The Kimeses were arrested the same day on
a warrant from Utah, where they are accused of passing a bad check.
Court hearings were to have begun next week that could have sent
the pair to Utah to face that charge or freed them on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's indictment, which charges the Kimeses with 17 counts of
credit-card fraud, is the first formal charge against the pair in
New York, but the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau,
said that they were likely to face many more as the police and
prosecutors continue to delve into the Kimeses' past and search for
Mrs. Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses became suspects in Mrs. Silverman's disappearance
because they were carrying her identification when they were
arrested on the Utah warrant. Kenneth Kimes, 23, had been renting a
suite in Mrs. Silverman's East 65th Street mansion and had been
seen arguing with her shortly before she disappeared. And in the
days that followed, detectives discovered papers linking the
Kimeses to a scheme to buy Mrs. Silverman's house.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses are also suspects in the March 14 death of their
former business partner, David Kazdin, whose body was found in a
trash bin in Los Angeles. And the authorities in the Bahamas are
interested in questioning the pair about the disappearance of a
Middle Eastern bank auditor.
</P>
<P>
   The New York credit-card fraud charges stem from a buying spree
the Kimeses are accused of going on after fraudulently obtaining a
credit card in the name of a Florida businessman, Max Schorr, whom
prosecutors said they did not know.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses have made several unsuccessful requests for bail on
the Utah charges, and have a bail request pending in the Appellate
Division of state Supreme Court. While that court was unlikely to
grant the request, prosecutors said, such a move could have
happened as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that possibility is foreclosed by the new charges
in New York City, prosecutors said. They said the charges would
also help to forestall the possibility that they would be
extradited to Utah. That issue is set to be discussed in criminal
court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Kimeses said that the charges were intended only
to prevent their clients from winning next week's bail hearing.
``They were brought for the sole purpose of holding the Kimeses in
a form of preventative detention,'' said Mel Sachs, one of the two
lawyers hired by the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau denied that the charges were a ruse: ``If my credit
card, if my name was forged, I would not consider that a flimsy
charge. I would take that very seriously.''

YANKS PONDER TRADE FOR RANDY JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Randy Johnson is regarded as one of the greatest
pitchers of his generation, and as Brian Cashman, the New York
Yankees' general manager, sat in his Yankee Stadium office Friday
evening, some six hours before the midnight Eastern trade deadline,
he had the opportunity to add the extraordinary Johnson to his
extraordinary team.
</P>
<P>
   All Cashman had to do was make one phone call, utter one word _
yes _ and meet the demands of the Seattle Mariners. Baseball
officials said the Mariners would trade Johnson for pitcher Hideki
Irabu and Mike Lowell, a minor-league infielder regarded as the
Yankees' best position prospect. One phone call, one word and
Johnson would be in pinstripes for the final two months of the
regular season and for October, when the Yankees will attempt to
establish themselves as one of history's most successful teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Cashman wasn't sure. Others said that in these hours leading
up to the deadline, he was trying to figure out a way to replace
Lowell in the deal. The Yankees were considering whether to add
outfielder Ricky Ledee and/or second baseman Homer Bush to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman wouldn't discuss his options, but he acknowledged being
torn by them. He had the choice of trading a large portion of the
Yankees' best young and inexpensive talent for a dominant pitcher _
Johnson _ he may have for only three months, or staying pat and
gambling that Jeff Nelson will recover from his back trouble, a
risk that could leave the Yankees' bullpen extremely vulnerable in
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm literally on the fence with this,'' Cashman said. ``It
could go either way. There's a good chance I'll do something, and
there's a good chance we won't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, too, has discussed the idea of trading for Toronto's
Roger Clemens, and at least one club representative was confident
Thursday evening that the Yankees had a chance to get Clemens. But
Irabu, initially proposed as part of a deal for Clemens, has a
contract clause that prevents him from being traded to Toronto. The
Blue Jays are among five teams Irabu cannot be traded to, according
to an American League official, and that stalled the negotiations.
Cashman apparently was still in contact with Toronto Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Johnson deal was there for the taking for Cashman, whose
primary competition for the pitcher seemed to be the Cleveland
Indians (possibly a deal built around outfielder Brian Giles) and
Houston Astros (outfielder Richard Hidalgo). Adding a twist, the
schedule happened to place the Yankees here in the Northwest. It
could be that by midway through Friday night's game, Johnson is to
be traded to the team on the other side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Should Johnson come to the Yankees, he would join a rotation
that already includes the left-handers Andy Pettitte and David
Wells and the right-hander David Cone _ a group that would contend
with any team, including the Atlanta Braves. The Yankees may face
either the Boston Red Sox or Cleveland Indians in the playoffs, and
both teams rely on left-handed hitters. Johnson lords over
left-handed batters, holding them to a .169 average, with 35
strikeouts in 65 at-bats and only two extra-base hits, both
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   If Irabu is part of the Johnson trade, then Orlando Hernandez
could remain in the rotation. Presumably, however, Hernandez would
be moved to the bullpen, in preparation for the postseason, because
of his strong ability against right-handed batters. Hernandez would
effectively replace Nelson in the bullpen, if Nelson can't come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, spent part of his day on the
phone with Cashman, discussing potential trades that could fill the
hole in the bullpen. Torre didn't say as much, but it's safe to say
the Johnson deal came up, as it did two months ago. ``This has been
building up all year,'' Torre said Thursday, referring to the
anticipation of a Johnson trade. ``This was just a natural. He's a
marquee guy. It doesn't matter what he does, he's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, most of Torre's players were oblivious to
all the trade talks. In recent days, however, curiosity has drawn
out the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're curious,'' said Andy Pettitte, who pitched
seven innings in the Yankees' 10-inning, 3-0 victory against
Anaheim on Thursday night. ``We've been together all year, and
we're wondering who might be the three or four guys'' who might be
included in a trade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While studying the bat rack Wednesday afternoon, Tino Martinez
spoke to a few reporters. ``So,'' he said, ``what trades are going
to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes stopped quickly as he passed by a reporter Friday,
after seeing his name in a story about the Johnson trade talks.
``What do you think of that?'' he asked, a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of acquiring Johnson is somewhat intriguing to the
players, but most have the same attitude of David Wells, who
suggested that, sure, it would be great to have Johnson. ``But
we've got a good enough team to win it without trading for
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True. But as Cashman mulled his options Friday evening, his
office walls covered by placards bearing the name of every player
in the organization, Cashman knew he could get one of the game's
greatest pitchers, for a team currently considered the best in
baseball. Just one phone call, one word.

DODGERS BEAT METS 4-3 AT SHEA STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One out was all John Franco needed, and the weekend
would surely have been a memorable one. Sometime soon, possibly
Saturday, Franco is expected to sign a two-year contract extension
that will keep him with the Mets through the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco could not record that final out. Trying to protect a
3-1 lead, Franco allowed three ninth-inning runs, and the Los
Angeles Dodgers rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Mets Friday
night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, it looked as if Franco would have no problem
recording his 22nd save. After allowing a lead-off single to Matt
Luke, Franco came back to strike out the next two batters. But he
fell behind pinch-hitter Roger Cedeno, 3-1, with the game on the
line. Then Butch Huskey could not catch Cedeno's drive to deep
right field to record the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball glanced off Huskey's glove at the warning
track and dropped for a run-scoring triple. Franco's very next
pitch, to pinch-hitter Tom Prince, skipped between catcher Mike
Piazza's legs. Cedeno scored from third. And Franco had just blown
his fifth save this season.
</P>
<P>
   Six pitches later, the 37-year-old closer would be facing his
sixth defeat against no victories. That was after Eric Young, just
off the disabled list, crushed a full-count double to score Prince
with what proved to be the winning run. That was it for Franco, who
was booed off the field by the crowd of 49,407.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mets (56-50) to four games behind the
Chicago Cubs in the National League wild card race and the Dodgers
(57-52) now trail New York by one and a half games in the
post-season chase.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured Piazza's first game against the team he
came up with, not to mention a post-game fireworks show. But the
most dizzying displays belonged to the opposing general managers,
Steve Phillips and Tommy Lasorda, who put together a blur of trades
before the midnight deadline expired.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Phillips dealt left fielder Bernard Gilkey to
Arizona for pitcher Willie Blair and catcher Jorge Fabregas. During
the game, the Mets acquired the utilityman Tony Phillips _ whom
they had passed on late this winter _ from Toronto for a minor
league pitcher to take Gilkey's place. And after the game, Phillips
was tirelessly working on another trade. The Dodgers, meanwhile,
acquired Carlos Perez and Mark Grudzielanek from the Expos for
Wilton Guerrero and a bevy of prospects just before game-time.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, however, Steve Phillips left Brian McRae be.
Friday night, McRae's two-run fifth-inning triple off Darren
Dreifort erased a 1-0 deficit and helped propel the Mets to a 3-1
lead before Franco's appearance. Lately, McRae has been doing it
all for the Mets, who lost for the fourth time in their last 12
games. Masato Yoshii (4-6) was denied his first victory since May
27.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii allowed six hits and one run in seven sterling innings,
walking one while striking out eight. But the Japanese right-hander
was trailing by 1-0 when McRae stepped to the plate against
Driefort (6-10) with two out and two on in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   McRae ripped a line drive past center fielder Trenidad Hubbard
and through the gap in right center field. Four pitches later,
Lenny Harris chopped an infield single over the mound to score
McRae to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   For the night, McRae was 2 for 4. In his last 10 starts, he is
20 for 48 (.417), with 11 runs scored, 2 homers, 2 triples, 7
doubles and 9 runs batted in. Once the object of heavy criticism
for his struggles at the plate, McRae's average is now a healthy
.265.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being the odd man out in the Mets' outfield, McRae is
now the anchor. His 48 extra-base hits easily lead the Mets. And
with Tony Phillips on his way to help take over the lead-off
duties, the Mets just might have a consistently dangerous lineup
for the post-season stretch.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Politics, it used to be said, makes strange bedfellows. But that
process is nothing like the current wave of mergers, which are
creating convoluted arrangements that are chosen not to make the
business run better, but to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   No deal has produced a more bizarre arrangement than the
takeover of Rolls-Royce, the luxury-car maker. Volkswagen outbid
BMW to buy Rolls, then grew worried that BMW would refuse to sell
engines needed for Rolls models. The result was a truly Solomonic
decision. In five years Volkswagen will turn over the making of
Rolls-Royce cars to BMW, while keeping Bentleys for itself. In the
meantime, the siblings Rolls and Bentley will have a parent that
plans to keep only one of its children. Which of the brands do you
think Volkswagen will work harder to promote?
</P>
<P>
   Even when there are no plans to carve up a company,
responsibilities post-merger are often divvied up in ways that make
more sense to investment bankers than to management experts. The
plan to merge Bell Atlantic and GTE creates co-chief executives for
the next several years, with one of them already picked to take
full control in 2002. There has been a wave of such deals lately,
among them the Citicorp-Travelers and American Home
Products-Monsanto arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for most embarrassing management structure was won by
Cendant Corp., which owns such brands as Century 21 and Avis. It
was formed last year when two companies merged under an arrangement
where the boss of one company would run the combined operation for
a few years, then yield to the other.
</P>
<P>
   When it turned out the boss-in-waiting had run a company without
noticing accounting fraud, it cost Cendant $35 million to persuade
him to resign rather than exercise his right to take over the
entire company.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of corporate America, there are only a few companies
that choose to have co-chief executives. Those arrangements are
usually based on a belief the two individuals can work together and
have complementary skills. The new run of co-bosses is being
created to get deals done. If and when they blow up, it will be
shareholders, employees and customers who suffer.

SATU SINNOLAI, 79, BUDDHIST ABBOT AND PASTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (js)

<P>
   Satu Khamphouy Sinnolai, one of the first Buddhist monks from
Laos to take refuge in the United States and the first to arrive as
a pastor to immigrants in the New York metropolitan region, died on
May 28 at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 79 and
lived in that city.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, but he was active until a week
before his death, said Damdee Kingsidaphone, secretary to the
Buddhists in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Satu (a title meaning venerable) Sinnolai was the abbot of the
Thepchantharam Buddhist Temple in Bridgeport and a spiritual leader
to Laotian and Thai Buddhists in the Northeast. Kingsidaphone said
final respects to Satu Sinnolai would be paid on Sept. 5 at the
temple .
</P>
<P>
   Satu Sinnolai was born on Feb. 16, 1919, in Ban Houei Sai, Laos.
He became a novice when he was 12 and a monk when he was 21. In
1968 he became the abbot of the Temple Phonsavanh in Houei Sai, the
capital of the Haut-Mekong Province and the home of hundreds of
Laotians now living in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   He fled Laos in 1978, stayed in a refugee camp in Thailand and
continued to the United States in 1980. He founded the
Thepchantharam Temple that year in Rye, N.Y., with the support of
Laotian families who had petitioned him to come.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

EDITORIAL: KEEPING THE CENSUS FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, for the first time in decades, the Bureau of the Census
produced a count that was less accurate than the one that preceded
it. Under congressional direction, the agency consulted the
National Academy of Sciences and came up with a new, more
statistically sophisticated procedure. But Republican leaders have
declared war on the plan. In effect, they are fighting for a census
in which some Americans count for more than others.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in American life style, in which families double up,
children shuttle among relatives and adults move into and out of
relationships make the population increasingly hard to pin down.
The Census Bureau estimates it missed about 8.4 million people in
1990, most of them residents of rental housing.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.4 million others _ many of them college students and
people who owned two homes _ were counted twice. The results were
disturbingly skewed along racial and ethnic lines. One in 10 black
males were missed by the census, and 1 in 20 Hispanics. About half
the Americans who never got counted were children.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the same thing from happening in the year 2000 census,
officials decided to use statistical sampling techniques to check
the accuracy of the count. Field workers will be dispatched to
750,000 randomly selected houses to perform a second mini-census.
The two results will be compared, and the bureau will try to
reconcile the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling techniques are the state of the art in statistics, but
Republicans contend that they violate the constitutional mandate
for ``actual enumeration'' of the population. The party actually
fears that since poor and minority Americans tend to be Democrats,
correcting the census will help the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are attempting to starve the Census Bureau into
submission. The proposed appropriations bill for the Commerce
Department contains funding for census preparations for only the
next six months. If the bill becomes law, next March, President
Clinton will have a choice of accepting the Republicans' demands
for a less accurate count or allowing preparations for the census
to come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The president may feel obliged to veto a budget bill that
endorses such an unfair procedure. To avoid that, the House should
adopt a Democratic amendment to the Commerce budget that would
finance the census for the entire year, and direct the bureau to be
prepared to use either counting method.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have challenged use of sampling in court, and in
the unlikely event the Supreme Court decides to take up the issue,
the judiciary can decide the matter. Otherwise, Congress must stop
trying to politicize the census.

COMMENTARY: NANNIES WHOSE HEARTS ACHE FOR HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Honduras, Guatemala)  (lb) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day her youngest daughter turned 10, Dora Marta
could not help her blow out the candles on her frosty birthday cake
because she was hundreds of miles away. Her daughter and her other
two children were back home, in a speck of a town tucked away in
the northern mountains of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Marta was in New York, pushing a swing under the hot sun in
an Upper East Side playground, ever mindful of the needs of her
charge: a 2-year-old boy who has trouble pronouncing her name and
instead calls her ``she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her that night,'' Dora Marta said. ``And I wished her
happy birthday. And we both cried a little. But I cry every time I
talk to my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dora Marta, 38, a nanny who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens,
has not seen her children, ages 10, 12 and 13, or her husband in
six years. Once a month, she sends them money. Every two weeks, she
calls them. Every night, before she goes to sleep, she says a
silent prayer for them. She bargains with God: ``Another two or
three years, God, and I'll be ready to come home. Just protect them
while I make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Her story is common among the city's thousands of nannies. Even
as they earn more money than ever before, their lives are not
necessarily easier. A recent national survey found 74 percent of
nannies make from $300 to $500 a week, before taxes, and anecdotal
evidence suggests some make as much as $1,000 a week. Still, many
live with the pain of having to care for other people's children
while their own children are far away, often under the care of
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dora Marta, who is in the country illegally, would not
reveal her salary or her last name, she said she is happy with what
she earns. The money helps to keep her focused on her plan, which
is simple. The more money she makes, the faster she can be with her
children. These days she is contemplating not returning home, but
bringing her children to the United States if she can do so
legally, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are taking greater risks. A Mexican nanny named Elena,
who is in the country illegally, said she was so desperate to see
her daughter after a two-year separation that she paid $1,500 to a
friend of a friend to bring her 5-year-old daughter illegally
across the Rio Grande. She expects the girl in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are nannies like Maria Rebeca, who puts up with the
long hours, the hard jobs, the painful separation from her family
with little complaint because, she says, she is thinking of their
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like dropping everything and running back
home,'' said Maria Rebeca, 39, a nanny from Guatemala, who has not
seen her children, ages 12, 15, 19 and 20, in almost five years.
``I have to constantly repress the urge to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   When she left Guatemala for New York in search of a job, her
boys were 7 and 10 and the girls 14 and 15. She feared leaving them
behind with relatives. She suffered at the thought of separating
them; the girls went to the city with an aunt while the boys stayed
in the country with an uncle.
</P>
<P>
   But she feared more and suffered more at the thought of staying
in her war-torn country and not being able to provide for her
children. With a visitor's visa that allowed her to stay in the
United States for six months, she left her country and joined her
husband in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. He had illegally crossed the
border into the United States two years before.
</P>
<P>
   She became a live-in nanny and, because most of her needs were
provided by her employers, sent home her entire salary. She would
not say how much she made, but said it would take her six months in
Guatemala to earn what she makes in a week here. Maria Rebeca, who
has a sixth-grade education, proudly points to her children's
successes. Her oldest daughter is a nurse, her youngest is a
secretary in the capital, and the boys are in school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, she gets through her days as if she were
wounded. She worries her brother may be too strict with the boys.
She worries about her daughters, two young women alone in Guatemala
City. She prays they do not fall in love with the wrong men.
</P>
<P>
   To ease her pain, she gets deeply involved with the children
under her care, she said. ``I take good care of them because I
think that, if I do that, God will make sure that my children are
treated the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, she said, she can rationalize her choices and enjoy
her work. But most days, she feels a physical need for her
children. She touches the center of her chest. ``Right here,'' she
says, ``I have a big hole.''

BRICKYARD 400 FAST CLOSING THE GAP IN INDIANAPOLIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ A day before May's Indianapolis 500, a ticket
scalper stood alone on a street corner near an entrance to the
speedway. He was holding up a sign that read, ``Buy one, get one
free.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a very different scene on that same corner Friday,
less than 24 hours before NASCAR's Brickyard 400. Mobbed by a dozen
race fans, a scalper stood on the curb, taking bids. The highest
bidder paid nearly four times the face value, the scalper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 was the big race in town until 1996, when a bitter
rift between Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Championship Auto
Racing Teams tarnished its reputation. Drivers split into two
factions, representing either CART or the new Indy Racing League,
pulled by differing philosophies over issues ranging from engines
to the actual courses on which they race.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Indy 500 was no longer considered the unrivaled
championship of open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some would argue that the 500 is not even the track's
most popular race anymore. That title, it seems, now belongs to the
Brickyard 400, the annual stock-car race which will be run here for
a fifth year on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brickyard 400 is definitely a hot ticket right now,'' said
Jeffrey Belskus, the Speedway's vice president. ``It's a wonderful
product, and we're fortunate to have it. But the Indy Racing League
is only 3 years old; we expect that it will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ernie Irvan will start on the pole for the second
straight year. Dale Jarrett, the 1996 champion, will be on the
outside of row one; Jeff Gordon, who won the race in 1994, will
start from the third position.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the winner of the Brickyard 400 could take
home a fatter purse than this year's Indy 500 winner, Eddie
Cheever, who got almost $1.5 million. Thanks to a $1 million bonus,
the winner of the NASCAR race could get $1.5 million to $1.7
million, which would be the biggest single payday in U.S.
auto-racing history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Indy 500 still has more television viewers than the
Brickyard race, the gap is shrinking. This year's Indy 500 reached
5,400,000 viewers, its lowest total in recent memory, while
Brickyard 400's ratings continue to grow, reaching 5,180,000 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great event for us,'' said NASCAR's president, Bill
France. ``Fans like it, drivers like it. But NASCAR is not going to
get into which race is bigger. They are two very different races.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the apparent decline of the Indy 500,
and the sudden surge in the Brickyard 400's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   All of the top NASCAR teams and drivers are here for Saturday's
race. At the Indy 500, the top open-wheel racers, CART drivers like
Alex Zanardi, Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti, were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The grandstands Friday were packed for NASCAR practice, and this
week, merchandise trucks selling T-shirts and hats of the NASCAR
teams have packed the gravel lots that were empty in May for the
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers have noticed the Indy 500's decline and the quick rise
of the Brickyard's popularity. Before the 1996 IRL-CART split, one
scalper recalled, Indy 500 tickets could be sold for as much as
four times to six times face value. Now, he said, scalped Indy 500
tickets are worth about face value.
</P>
<P>
   Expect this trend at Indianapolis to continue, unless the rival
IRL and CART series can reconcile their differences. That will not
be done easily, considering the ever-widening technology
differences between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want to come back here and race in a single-seat
open-wheeled car in the month of May,'' said Al Unser Jr., who was
here to compete in Friday's International Race of Champions, which
was won by Mark Martin. ``But any time you get to race at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a dream come true. I'm glad to be
back, but I wish it was in a different kind of car.''
</P>
<P>
   PIT STOPS
</P>
<P>
   With his second International Race of Champions victory this
season on Friday, MARK MARTIN captured a record fourth IROC title,
his third straight. Passing the 1996 CART champion, JIMMY VASSER,
with four laps to go, Martin won the last stage of the four-race
series, capturing the $225,000 championship prize. ... Two
spectators sustained minor injuries when debris from ARIE
LUYENDYK's car flew into the stands after a violent crash.
Luyendyk, whose car hit the new energy-absorbing wall installed
before this year's Indy 500, sustained a mild concussion.

UNITED IN BIRTH, 12 TWINS IN 30 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bulletin out of Beth Israel Medical Center on
Friday morning was intriguingly incomplete. ``At least'' five sets
of twins, the notice read, had been born there in the last 24
hours. The wording raised two possibilities: either doctors there
had no idea exactly what was going on, or a statistically
improbable occurrence was becoming even more so.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, set No. 6 was on its way by early afternoon, when a
small army of doctors, nurses and public relations people greeted
reporters with the vitals: more twins than had ever been born in so
short a time at the hospital had blinked their wrinkled way into
the world, starting at 7:40 a.m. Thursday. Half were the result of
fertility treatments. Four of the 12 parents were lawyers. One
father was a mailman. (``So both he and his wife deliver _ hah,
hah, hah!'' one of the public relations people said.)
</P>
<P>
   The numbers went on: by noon, two of the women had delivered
naturally, two had delivered by Caesarean section and one had had
what an obstetrician, Dr. Janet Stein, called ``the complete
obstetrical experience'' _ a natural birth and a Caesarean birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the last set,'' Dr. Stein said, ``we hope she'll push them
out any moment now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, everybody was fine, and the babies were
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   There were several reasons behind all the fuss at Beth Israel.
For one, the birth rate for twins in the United States has risen by
more than a third since 1980, in part because of the increasing use
of fertility treatments. So an entire social trend was compressed
into a hectic 29 hours and 42 minutes on the East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the event was a coup for Beth Israel as a competitor in
New York's carnivorous medical world. The hospital's reputation has
improved greatly in recent years, and it did not hurt for the
public to see six mothers who represented the diversity of New York
praising the work of doctors and nurses there. (Yet more
statistics: three of the mothers were white, one was black, one was
Hispanic and one was Chinese.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, hospitals compete wildly for pregnant women because
deliveries are profitable _ which helped to explain the general
solicitousness and the regular updates on the status of the
remaining parents-to-be as the afternoon wore on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father of the sixth twins is suiting up!'' another public
relations person announced. Reporters raced, and cameras caught the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief photo opportunity in the neonatal intensive care
unit _ Sidney Capers, 30, the mailman, held two darling new
daughters _ it was time for the news conference. The parents got
bottles of water (the mothers were supplied with rear cushions) and
cheerily told reporters they were tired but exhilarated.
</P>
<P>
   Would there be reunions of the 12 children?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' said Mimi Brill, a 36-year-old legal aid lawyer
from Manhattan who gave birth to the first twins. ``It would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Were so many twins a surprise?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Marisol Portalatin, 32, of Manhattan, who gave one of
her new daughters the middle name Dazian (thrilling Beth Israel
because that is the name of the hospital building). ``My sister was
supposed to videotape the delivery but she was late,'' Ms.
Portalatin said. ``Now, I've got, one . . . two . . .'' and
indicated the other twins who ended up on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   How are the babies doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sitting behind three sets of twin girls, so they're
happy,'' said Betty Troyetsky, 38, a Manhattan environmental lawyer
who gave birth to two little boys.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone having more children? Heads shook no all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saving up for birth control,'' said Ms. Portalatin, who
already has four children.
</P>
<P>
   Before all the cameras were gone, Twin No. 11 was delivered, and
shortly thereafter at 1:22 p.m. came No. 12, both by Caesarean.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here is the rundown (with parents' and babies'
names, babies' weights and delivery times:
</P>
<P>
   _ David Rountree and Mimi Brill of Manhattan: Isobel, 6.8
pounds, at 7:40 a.m. Thursday and Grace, 7.11 pounds, at 11:07 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marisol Portalatin of Manhattan: Alison Dazian Tiru, 3.11
pounds, at 12:47 p.m. and Alexis Tiru, 3.10 pounds, at 1:04 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mitchel and Betty Troyetsky of Manhattan: to Joshua, 3.10
pounds, at 1:09 p.m. and Daniel, 3.11 pounds, at 1:16 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Natalio Hanna and Anne Katz-Hanna: Joshua, 5.2 pounds, at 3:18
p.m. and Jacob, 4.2 pounds, at 3:19 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sidney and Tanjela Capers of Manhattan: Tireya Arne, 5.1
pounds, at 10:16 p.m. and Lanay Essence, 5.02 pounds, at 10:19 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kuong Kin Lao and Lan Chu Cheung of Brooklyn: Yun Chon at 1:09
p.m Friday and Yun Ioi at 1:22 p.m. (no weights available).
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they could not yet tell which were fraternal twins
and which were identical.
</P>
<P>
   Rountree, also a legal aid lawyer, stood proudly over his two
new daughters, lying identically on their left sides with matching
striped blankets. He looked remarkably rested but a little amazed
by all the attention. Grace grunted, and Rountree rubbed her belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, sweetie,'' he said. ``It's just the media. Get used
to it.''

REGULATORS SHUT DOWN OPTIONS TRADING HOUSE FOR FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ohio, Idaho, Calif.)  (af)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Securities regulators in four states, aided by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, have moved to shut down an options trading
house that they accused of defrauding investors of millions of
dollars this year through the sale of options on foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Texas, Ohio, Idaho and California said Friday
that the Options Trading Group in Cleveland and two affiliated
firms were using aggressive and deceptive sales tactics to induce
investors to buy options on foreign currencies like the mark and
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the huge investments returns promised, investors
were saddled with large losses and high commissions, with little if
any profits, regulators say. In some instances, investors _ some of
whom complained of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars _ were
told their investments had failed and that they would have to put
in more money to cover those losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allege that the company told people about the huge profit
potential of these investments,'' said David Grauer, director of
enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. ``But then they
were told they had huge losses and they were refused their money
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say the company, with branches in Austin, Texas;
Akron, Ohio, and Newport Beach, Calif., was working in concert with
two affiliates, Currency Trading International and Ronald Allan
Ltd., both of Newport Beach. All three companies were accused of
making ``cold calls'' to investors and then making fraudulent
representations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, nine employees of the Options Trading Group,
including Jeffrey A. Moore, 32, the firm's president, were arrested
on racketeering and securities fraud charges by various state law
enforcement officials and FBI agents. Craig A. Cunningham, 41, who
has an ownership interest in all three firms, was also arrested in
California. Cunningham has a long disciplinary record, according to
the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left at the home of Moore was not returned.
Gerald Messerman, a lawyer in Cleveland who represented the Options
Trading Group in earlier litigation, said he did not know where to
reach Moore or Cunningham. Messerman said the nine employees were
being held on bail of between $2 million and $15 million. ``They've
all been arrested,'' he said. ``I can't tell you whether I
represent them or not.''

   The nine employees were indicted last month by a grand jury in
Idaho on charges of defrauding residents of the state. Over the
last few months, several other states have cooperated in
investigating the Options Trading Group, which was incorporated in
California in 1997. Currency Trading International and Ronald Allan
Ltd. were also indicted by a grand jury in Idaho.

   In Orange County, Calif., a task force searched the offices of
Currency Trading and Ronald Allan Ltd. in Newport Beach, and seized
documents. They also froze the assets of the Options Trading Group.

   In Texas, regulators obtained search warrants and a restraining
order preventing the company from doing business there, accusing
the firm of using unregistered agents and dealers to sell
unregistered securities. In Ohio, the FBI is investigating the
company, and state regulators have subpoenaed documents. &QL;

BLACK PARENTS SAY LEARNING SUPERSEDES INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ African-American parents are more interested in
having public schools raise their academic standards than put their
energies into promoting integration, according to a new survey by
Public Agenda, a nonprofit research organization, and Public
Education Network, a national umbrella group of organizations whose
goal is to improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   While 8 in 10 parents, black as well as white, said they
believed that integrated schools could help improve race relations
and were a laudable goal, the consensus of both groups was that
schools should concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent a lot of time on race issues, and we need to
redirect some of those energies to getting our children better
educated,'' said a black parent from Pennsylvania in one of the
follow-up telephone interviews with parents who had taken part in
the survey, which was released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the black parents polled and 72 percent of the white
parents said they thought integrated schools made little difference
in the quality of the education their children received.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, nearly three-quarters of black parents and 77
percent of white parents agreed with the statement that ``too
often, the schools work so hard to achieve integration that they
end up neglecting their most important goal _ teaching kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on a national telephone survey of 800
African-American and 800 white parents conducted this spring. The
margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. In
addition, Public Agenda held eight focus groups across the nation
and interviewed 20 specialists in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The study also called attention to fear among some white parents
about integration. For example, one white parent in a Walnut Creek,
Calif., focus group said: ``They redrew the lines and brought in a
large section of low-income-housing kids into my children's
elementary school. Test scores dropped. These are kids that need
help and they get it. But it dumbs down the curriculum, and it
takes away from the gifted kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of African-American parents said race should not
be a factor when choosing a teacher or superintendent for a
predominantly black school district. ``As long as he's doing his
job, I don't care if he's green,'' said a black parent in a
Cleveland focus group.
</P>
<P>
   Among other areas of agreement between black and white parents
was on the question of whether teachers should teach such values as
honesty, respect and civility: 84 percent of the black parents and
83 percent of the whites agreed it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sharp difference, however, in attitudes toward
diversity. Sixty percent of the black parents favored it, while
only 34 percent of the whites did.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deborah Wadsworth, executive director of Public Agenda, said the
big surprise to her and her colleagues was ``the laserlike focus of
black Americans on the need for achievement, rigor and standards,
which must not be distracted by other considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving Hamer , an African-American member of the Board of
Education of New York City, said the loss of interest in
integration that the report revealed was ``not surprising and
somewhat disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, he shares the view that educational
quality should be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is facing cataclysmic change, what with technological
development and the growth of the global economy, and once again
African-Americans are being left out. If we want to prevent that,
we have to focus, and the focus has to be on improved education.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also studied views on standardized tests. Forty-four
percent of African-American parents said the tests that are used to
determine acceptance to college and eligibility for certain types
of financial aid measure ``real differences in educational
achievement,'' and an additional 18 percent said whites tend to
score higher because black students have less faith in their
ability.
</P>
<P>
   But only 28 percent said they believed that the tests are
culturally biased against African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Public Agenda, which is based in New York
City, and the Public Education Network, which is in Washington,
intend to sponsor community discussions on issues raised by the
survey.

EDITORIAL: THE GRAND CENTRAL BID WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers who understand the key role that business
improvement districts have played in the city's revitalization may
have been unnerved by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to dissolve
the Grand Central Partnership, one of the largest and best-known
BID's. The mayor's action seems drastic, but his position is not,
on the whole, unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's chief complaint is that the partnership's president,
Daniel Biederman, is also the head of two other midtown BIDs, at
Bryant Park and 34th Street, creating a sort of mini-empire.
Biederman's defenders say the district operations are deeply
intertwined, and the smaller ones could not provide the present
level of services if they were forced to stand on their own. That
argument makes Giuliani's case. The money the city collects from
neighborhood property owners for a BID's use is supposed to stay in
that neighborhood _ something that is hard to guarantee when
operations are as blended as Biederman's seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Central Partnership's leaders seem ready to fight the
city in court, a decision that could create a long period of
uncertainty that would threaten all the gains the partnership has
made in improving the area around Grand Central Terminal. They
appear to regard their organization as a private company that can
do what it likes as long as the board of directors is pleased. But
BIDs are actually public-private partnerships. There are now 40
BIDs in New York City _ The New York Times is a member of the Times
Square BID _ and they have done a great deal to improve the
cleanliness, security and atmosphere of our commercial districts.
But if city hall begins to feel that the districts threaten its
prerogatives, the whole concept will be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's position appears to be based on a reasonable
conviction that BIDs should stick to a limited agenda, and remain
both community-based and self-supporting. To end this crisis,
Biederman must sever his ties with two of the BIDs he controls. The
Grand Central Partnership should respond to the administration's
other complaints about bidding procedures and keeping operations
open to government scrutiny. Property owners who finance the
partnership's operations must protect their own investment in their
community by making sure these things happen quickly.
