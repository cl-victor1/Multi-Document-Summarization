RECORD FREEZE IN LOS ANGELES MAKING NEW YORK SHINE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ Whether they're schlepping Christmas gifts or
searching for a hot sidewalk pretzel, winter-weary New Yorkers
frost with envy this time of year over their counterparts in Los
Angeles, all toasty and warm in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's high in Central Park hit 63 degrees. The L.A.-area
suburb of Canoga Park peaked at 60 degrees and shuddered through a
low temperature of 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this time of year, it's uncanny, but you enjoy it,'' said
Jeffrey Bailey, a doorman at New York's Carlyle Hotel, glad to
forgo his muffler and heaviest overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the ice age will continue today, with the
National Weather Service issuing a frost warning and predicting
temperature records.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury is expected to dip to 28 degrees just before
daybreak today in some areas, forecaster Clint Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records have been falling and more will fall,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is a blast of arctic air from Canada. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Residents awoke to ice on their porches, nearly frozen pipes
and a treacherous commute for some, as roads had patches of nearly
invisible ice. The damage to homeowners' landscaping has only
begun.
</P>
<P>
   The Boething Treeland nursery in West Hills, an L.A. suburb,
already lost some delicate ficus trees and fuchsia plants to the
cold Tuesday. Later in the day, workers checked enclosures and
heaters protecting other plants, and watered greenery that the cold
wind had dried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing dying is the workers from the cold,'' joked a
nursery employee, Mike Naiditch, 52, of West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just layer. You can always take off what you have,''
54-year-old John Herkins added. But he faced a dilemma _ his layers
were too bulky for the rain suit he wears while watering the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually if it's windy, the stuff will blow back on you. Then
you're really cold. Your fingers get numb,'' Herkins said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the blazing summer sun that roofers usually dread while
working with hot tar. But Bob Tinsey, general manager of Golden
Eagle Roofing in Van Nuys, said a cold day can be just as
miserable &UR;  &LR; _ and more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got up on a roof this morning and there was ice. I thought
we were in Fresno or something,'' he said of a tile-replacement job
in Toluca Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unseasonably cold. It's unbelievable,'' said Tinsey, who
has been in the business 45 years. ``It's an inconvenience. But the
harder you work, the warmer you get. If you're standing around, you
get cold.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles Zoo, the staff protects the animals from the
chill by heating their night quarters, and protects itself by
donning heavy jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the reptiles are kept warm 24 hours a day,'' and an
arthritic goat named Bob has his own heated stall, said Michael
Dee, general curator. ``But it's surprising the number of birds
from the tropics that we don't have to give any heat.''
</P>
<P>
   They've gotten used to the cold and simply perch under branches
for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become acclimatized to a hot environment or a cold
environment,'' Dee said, comparing it to a Chicagoan or New Yorker
visiting Los Angeles who might consider Tuesday balmy.
</P>
<P>
   Layering clothes is the key to weathering a cold night sleeping
in a car, said 54-year-old John White of Encino, homeless since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was the first night it was pretty cold,'' White
said Tuesday. ``But there's guys who are a lot worse off than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   When he hunkers down for the night in his 1973 Volkswagen Super
Beetle, which he bought new as a Marine in Hawaii, White wraps
himself in three sweat shirts, then lies underneath a woolen
blanket he got from a shelter last year, and another blanket he
received at the Veterans Administration hospital recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncomfortable, but I'd rather have the cold than the El
Nino. I don't like the rain,'' said White, sitting in his car at
Woodley Avenue Park.
</P>
<P>
   He's lucky he is not in New York, where unseasonably warm
weather is expected to be followed today by a cold blast into the
20s.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
After Roger Clemens ruled out playing for the Astros under current
management, owner Drayton McLane Jr. stood behind his front-office
personnel Tuesday night and said he hopes to resolve any
differences with baseball's only five-time Cy Young Award winner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Clemens withdrew his demand for a trade from
the Toronto Blue Jays while saying he has no desire to play for
Astros president Tal Smith or general manager Gerry Hunsicker, who
called a news conference during the winter meetings to blast
Clemens' financial demands.
</P>
<P>
   McLane admitted the Dec. 13 news conference was unfortunate but
said the Astros have no plans for any front-office moves in the
wake of Clemens' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry Roger feels that way,'' McLane said. ``We're
certainly not going to acquire Roger if we can't rectify the
problems. We are certainly not going to consider changing anything
in our leadership. We hope Roger will reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very committed to Gerry and Tal. I think Tal is one of
the most respected baseball executives in baseball. Gerry has been
our general manager for two years, and all we've done is win two
division titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker also was named the National League Executive of the
Year by The Sporting News, as was Smith in 1980 when he was the
club's GM.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McLane said he hasn't given up on the idea of
landing Clemens, whose agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, proposed
to the Astros a one-year contract extension worth $27.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, who has been the chief negotiator in the Astros'
discussions with Clemens' agents, said he is confident the
situation can be resolved over time. He never formally has had
discussions with or met Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but believe this can be resolved. Hopefully, time
solves a lot of problems,'' McLane said. ``At the appropriate time,
I hope to sit and talk this through with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens expressed his anger Tuesday at the Astros' remarks
during the winter meetings that he claims portrayed him as greedy
while damaging the reputations of his agents. McLane said that when
he called the Hendricks brothers to apologize, it was on behalf of
the entire organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak for the team,'' McLane said. ``Them being upset with
Gerry and Tal I feel they are upset with me. We're all part of a
family and team. I consider it my problem as well as theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens notified the Blue Jays on Dec. 2 that he was demanding a
trade closer to home or to a contender under a 1996 agreement with
former club president Paul Beeston. The Astros, Texas Rangers, New
York Yankees and Cleveland Indians had been considered the
front-runners to acquire Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros are to pursue Clemens further, McLane said one
thing won't change: the club's hesitance to part with too many
front-line players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give up major talent that will hurt the team in the
long run,'' McLane said. ``In the long run, that would accomplish
nothing. Our goal is to be a champion. That's why we need Roger
Clemens. It has to work financially.''

 CITY BOWL CAPSULE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisville (7-4) vs. Marshall (11-1) Time: 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Location: Silverdome, Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   TV: ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Marshall won the Mid-American Conference
championship and earned the MAC's bid to this bowl. Louisville is
filling the at-large berth.
</P>
<P>
   Retrospective: Marshall, which has been a I-A school for just
two seasons, is making its second bowl appearance. The Thundering
Herd lost to Mississippi in last year's Motor City Bowl. Louisville
is making its sixth bowl appearance and its first since the 1993
Liberty. The Cardinals are 3-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents: The teams played no common opponents. Opponents'
combined won-loss records _ Marshall, 53-68; Louisville, 55-54.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: This bowl should come with its own air
raid warning. Louisville's Chris Redman ranks 12th in pass
efficiency and passed for 4,042 yards and 29 touchdowns; Marshall's
Chad Pennington is 18th in pass efficiency and passed for 3,419
yards and 24 TDs. The quarterback with the best game will find his
name on next season's list of Heisman Trophy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on: For Louisville _ QB Chris Redman, TE Ibn Green,
RB LeRoy Collins. For Marshall _ QB Chad Pennington, RB Doug
Chapman, DB Daninelle Derricott.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville update: The Cardinals were 1-10 last season, but
first-year coach John L. Smith came from Utah State and produced a
winning season. Louisville ranks 105th in pass defense. It allowed
242 yards per game and gave up 26 scoring passes. Louisville opened
the season by losing to Kentucky and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall update: The Thundering Herd, despite the loss of wide
receiver Randy Moss, has continued to win. Last season with Moss,
Marshall was 10-3. Marshall is 14th nationally in pass defense and
23rd in total defense. The Thundering Herd's only loss came at
Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville wins if: Its pass defense can find a way to slow down
Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall wins if: Its pass defense can find a way to slow down
Redman.

   CAVIAR-FARM (Davis, Calif.) _ For two decades and more, Mats and
Dafne Engstrom have been working on a project that he compares to
making paper by planting a forest. Their goal is to produce caviar
comparable to that from the Caspian Sea _ specifically the variety
known as osetra _ from the eggs of farm-raised California sturgeon.
The process works well; the problem is that it takes the
slow-growing sturgeon a very long time to reach an age at which
they produce roe. This is the future of caviar now that the Caspian
Sea is almost depleted of sturgeon. By R.W. Apple Jr.

ANTHRAX RISK TO KEEP COURTS CLOSED ONE MORE DAY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Superior and Municipal courthouses at Van Nuys
Civic Center will remain closed today while authorities investigate
the region's most recent anthrax threat, which caused the
evacuation of 2,200 people Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouses are expected to reopen for business Thursday,
but all court cases and hearings are postponed until next week,
Presiding Superior Court Judge Robert Parkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County health department officials are trying to
ensure the building is safe before reopening it for court business,
according to a statement by the court's public information office.
</P>
<P>
   While the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI believe that
the threat was a hoax, health officials still haven't determined if
the deadly bacterium was released in the building, LAPD Lt. Anthony
Alba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't comment on the investigation, but it seems like this
is the flavor-of-the-month copycat hoax,'' Alba said. ``What we can
say is if we find the suspect, we will guarantee prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, evacuees were told to take showers when they
got home and to put their clothes in sealed bags. Health officials
also told them to wipe down any objects they were carrying, such as
pocketbooks or briefcases, with a solution of one part bleach and
10 parts water.
</P>
<P>
   Civil and small-claims filings were being accepted at the civil
office, which is across the street from the main courthouse.
Filings also will be accepted today at the Central District
Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles or the district courthouse in
San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's threat was the third in Los Angeles in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms resulting from exposure to anthrax usually develop in
two to six days. They include cough and fever over 100.5 degrees,
muscle aches and chest pain.

TWA IN STANDSTILL WITH UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  (Kansas City, Mo.) _ More than a year of
``preliminary'' talks for Trans World Airlines employees appears to
be over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it's crunch time for TWA management and more than 16,000
workers represented by the Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are awaiting a decision by a federal mediator on the
union's request to allow a 30-day ``cooling off'' period to begin.
</P>
<P>
   During that 30-day period, talks would continue in efforts to
reach a new agreement. If a pact isn't reached during that time,
management would be free to lock out the workers and the union
would be free to strike the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Neither scenario seems likely, aviation analysts say, given that
a TWA shutdown most likely would mean the end of the airline.
However, industry experts watching TWA's talks with the Machinists
say both sides need to make certain concessions to ensure the
carrier's viability in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with the Machinists union affect more than
2,200 workers at TWA's overhaul base in Kansas City. Including its
administrative center, TWA has more than 3,600 employees in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's predicament, analysts say, is that it still is trying to
complete a financial turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWA has a revenue disadvantage with the rest of the
industry,'' said Glenn Engel, aviation analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co. ``They'd like to give their people more pay, but they also want
to close that revenue gap.''
</P>
<P>
   As TWA awaits word from the National Mediation Board, the union
remains firm in its demand for a new contract that brings employee
wages up to the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650 in Kansas City,
said the company's workers had given enough in previous contracts
with TWA. Now the employees want wage increases on par with the
rest of the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to strike and, if necessary, put this company
out of its misery so we can get on with our lives,'' Nelson said in
a recorded message to members on an informational hot line. ``There
will be no more concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The union said no progress was made during the final
``supermediation'' sessions that concluded Dec. 11, but TWA said 30
issues involving mechanics and passenger service workers were
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   James F. Martin, TWA's senior vice president of human resources,
said he expected to see the two sides back at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, it seems, have a long way to go to reach common
ground. According to the union, the company made a proposal asking
for work rule changes that would eliminate more than 2,000 jobs
systemwide, reduce staffing at 22 stations, close a reservations
center and allow maintenance work by outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   TWA said it made an offer that included wage increases that
would bring TWA employees to within 90 percent of the industry
standard.
</P>
<P>
   That was what TWA's pilots accepted earlier this year, but
negotiators for the Machinists are seeking a contract to bring
their members' wages completely up to the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Machinists want assurances in the contract that
TWA will not close any of its maintenance bases, including the
overhaul base in Kansas City. Such a provision was included in the
previous contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't give that'' assurance, said TWA spokesman Mark Abels
in an October interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't manage the business that way,'' Abels said. ``Some
people think buildings create jobs. We tend to think a successful
business strategy creates jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But such big differences on important issues are typical in such
talks until the 30-day countdown begins, one observer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of labor negotiations under the Railway
Labor Act,'' said David W. Levine, contributing editor for
/{PlaneBusiness,/} a financial newsletter on airlines. ``You can't
float an idea out there and take it back easily. It's hard to take
an offer off the table, so both sides start out wanting'' what
would be their ideal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Levine and other analysts agree that some fundamental
problems have to be addressed in any new contract with the
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's employees, after continually giving concessions to help
bail the airline out of financial straits, generally are paid
significantly less than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's top pay for mechanics is $17.93 an hour,
compared with hourly rates of $21.63 at Northwest Airlines and
$23.98 at US Airways. Baggage handlers at most airlines earn more
than TWA's mechanics, according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has made it difficult to attract and keep younger
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of maintenance work in the rest of the
industry, so some people train here and go on to other airlines,''
Nelson said. ``I've even heard of TWA mechanics at JFK
(International Airport) with 30 years at the company leaving
because they can get better pay at another carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower pay, TWA's overall labor costs aren't the
lowest in the industry. In various measures of labor costs and
productivity, TWA's numbers are average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reputation in the industry is that TWA is top quality when
it comes to maintaining their planes,'' Levine said. ``But TWA is
at the absolute back of the pack when it comes to productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said that since TWA reduced its fleet and eliminated
widebody jets such as the Boeing 747 and Lockheed L-1011, its
maintenance operation had become too big for the airline.
Maintenance costs have remained the same while the airline has
gotten smaller and acquired newer jets that require less
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the airline no longer is doing the third-party
maintenance on other airlines that used to be a revenue generator
for the company. TWA said it could no longer make money on such
work. MORE
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, TWA canceled what was thought to be a lucrative defense
contract to work on jets for the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question TWA is long on maintenance capacity,''
Levine said. ``And there's something wrong when you're not able to
make a profit on a Department of Defense contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to union officials, has been TWA's
neglect of its maintenance operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ended up making us totally inefficient by not buying the
tooling that we needed and not buying the spare equipment we needed
to do the work,'' Nelson said. ``We made sacrifices in our
contracts so they could make those investments in our operation,
but the company has reneged on those commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Nelson, TWA is investing most of its resources
in flight operations and appears to be on a course to outsource its
maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Machinists officials are working with Kansas City
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver and the Economic Development Corp. of Kansas
City in hopes of coming up with a package that will persuade TWA to
operate the city-owned overhaul facility beyond May 2000, when the
airline's lease with the city expires.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson questioned TWA's timing of its acquisition of new
aircraft earlier this month. TWA plans to add 125 narrow-body
Boeing and Airbus Industrie aircraft from 2000 to 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fix our immediate problems, which is a contract for
most of the airline's employees,'' he said. ``The new aircraft is a
moot point if they don't settle our contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think a wage compromise will be found while TWA's work
force is reduced over the next few years, either through early
retirement buyouts or attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious relationship the Machinists union has had with
TWA through the years doesn't help the talks, Levine said. During
investor Carl Icahn's ownership of TWA, there was no emphasis on
improving labor relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they bought Icahn out, there was a management team of
the year every year,'' Levine said. ``This group (headed by Gerald
L. Gitner) seems to be bringing some stability at the top. But
there are a lot of bitter, entrenched employee groups within TWA.
They've heard all the talk about change before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, TWA's management and union workers will have to
find a way to work together if the airline plans to be around in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either side has much choice,'' Engel said. ``But
with labor-management relations in the airline industry, you never
know what might happen.''

A BULL RUN FROM PAGES OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Undated) _ Gene Ayres, a reporter for
BEGIN ITAL The Star END ITAL from 1957 to 1963, was mindful of this
paper's long reputation as a place hospitable to good writers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation earlier, Ernest Hemingway had served a cub's
apprenticeship here before going off to war, to Paris, and to fame.
And Gene was much affected by Hemingway's writing, as who among us
in those years was not.
</P>
<P>
   He had devoured the master's books, especially those that were
set in Spain and dealt, either directly or in passing, with the
subject of bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
   He held forth with authority on the sport, or spectacle, or
drama _ or whatever you prefer to call it. And he had mastered all
the technical terms, rendering them with such a perfect accent you
never would have guessed that was the only Spanish he knew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Gene and I traveled several months together in Europe,
two footloose youngsters on leave from the paper. Much of the time
in Spain was spent nursing our wreck of a car along dusty roads
from one BEGIN ITAL feria END ITAL to the next, to watch matadors
confront the bulls in a pageant with mortal stakes.
</P>
<P>
   That was what Hemingway would term ``the dangerous summer,'' in
his book about the competition in the bullring between two
brothers-in-law and fierce rivals, Antonio Ordonez and Luis Miguel
Dominguin.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know that. But when we saw the notices of an upcoming
festival in the town of Badajoz, near the Portuguese border, and
read that Ordonez and Dominguin would be featured, it was clear the
week could be something special.
</P>
<P>
   And it was.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguin was more the showman. Ordonez was reserved, less
demonstrative, but elegant in his passes with the cape. What's
more, he was uncommonly tall for a Spaniard. That gave him a great
advantage in dispatching the bull with the sword _ the drama's
final act, which can be messy and repellent in inept hands.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer and the journey drew toward its end, I took a room
in a fishing town on the coast and settled in to write. Gene went
north to the feria of San Fermin to run with the bulls through the
streets of Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   That's been 40 years ago. But often, when we've been together
since, we've spoken of those adventures of our youth. Two years
ago, when Dominguin died, Gene sent me a clip of the newspaper
item.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday(DEC. 20), in BEGIN ITAL The New York Times, END ITAL
there was a photograph of Ordonez in the bullring, seen over the
rump and humped shoulders of a massive fighting bull, whose
needle-tipped horns are aimed directly at his torso.
</P>
<P>
   His expression, as he looks the creature in the face, is a
mixture of excitement and admiration. There is no fear at all. He
is in his late 20s in the picture, just as we were that summer.
And, like us at that age, he believes he is immortal.
</P>
<P>
   The headline and story under the photo told that Ordonez was
dead at 66, of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Ayres left BEGIN ITAL The Star END ITAL for the West Coast,
and practiced journalism there, stylishly, fearlessly, until he
retired. He died, this past August, also of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he'd have rather had it said he ``beat Ordonez to the
barn'' _ which is how Gary Cooper was reported to have put it to
his pal, Hemingway, when the doctors told him his run was near its
end.

THE BATTLE AGAINST COUNTERFEIT TRADEMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ With Christmas fast
approaching, Kansas Citians are crowding accessories counters and
riffling through racks of clothes to find the perfect gifts with
the perfect brand names.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's nice to find a well-tailored shirt, an elegant handbag or a
pair of UV-blocking sunglasses under the tree. But to many people,
that all comes second to finding the right brand name on each gift.
</P>
<P>
   A recent FBI raid on Replicas, a Lenexa store where agents said
they found counterfeit brand-name merchandise, was part of a
continuing war on black marketeers who make ordinary items more
desirable by slapping on trendy labels.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like a crime with few victims _ customers who pay
90 percent less than they would for the real thing usually know
they're buying fakes, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But trademark counterfeiting is a huge problem for the companies
that make the real things.
</P>
<P>
   One group, the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition,
estimates that trademark counterfeiting will cost U.S. industries
$200 billion this year in lost sales, jobs and taxes, up from $21
billion in 1983. That number covers all counterfeit merchandise,
including software and music, and assumes that people who buy
counterfeit goods would have bought the genuine product if the
knockoff hadn't been available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer about cutting and sewing labels onto
T-shirts in back rooms,'' said George Abbott, managing director of
the anticounterfeiting coalition.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza agrees with the $200 billion estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But some who traffic in knockoffs say many people who buy fakes
would never shell out the money for the genuine article.
</P>
<P>
   One customer, Robin Barker of Olathe, shopped at Replicas for
lookalikes of her family's favorite name-brand goods because she
doesn't think the real things are worth what they cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower your prices and we'll buy from you,'' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark piracy picks up around Christmas and just before the
school year starts, and these days the black market is so busy that
private investigators hired by trademark holders have more cases
than they know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, who investigated the Lenexa case for the Guidry
Group, a Dallas security firm and consulting agency, said he spent
58 hours a week recently, working on 125 cases of trademark piracy.
Two clothing factories he's watching have started working 24-hour
days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few stores in the Kansas City area openly display counterfeit
merchandise. Street vendors and flea market stalls also carry the
counterfeits, but they're not as easy to find on the street as they
are in California and New York, where much of the merchandise
enters the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have more of in the Midwest is an underground network
of people who have house parties,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, guests order fake brand-name clothes at the parties
and the host sends a fax or an e-mail to a supplier on the coast,
who ships in just enough knockoffs to fill the orders.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Thanksgiving last year, FBI agents raided a
Mission Hills house where fake goods allegedly were being sold.
Authorities hauled away what they said were pirated goods, but no
one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the black market agree that few people
ever face charges for trademark piracy. MORE
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Foote, the Lenexa man who owns Replicas, took that into
account when he set up a shop that openly sold fake goods with
brand names such as Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, Dooney &AMP; Bourke and
Mont Blanc. He said he wasn't too surprised when FBI agents seized
most of his stock early Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to anybody sooner or later. You just have to expect
it,'' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   Foote hasn't been charged and is free to sell legitimate goods
from his store. And the raid hasn't had an obvious effect on other
area outlets for counterfeit goods. Last week, a small Johnson
County shop was openly selling purses with Dooney &AMP; Bourke labels
for $39.
</P>
<P>
   The real thing goes for $220 at Jacobson's in Leawood's Town
Center Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Jacobson's who agreed to examine the cheaper purse
said it was obviously a knockoff, and some of them could tell the
fake purse from real Dooney &AMP; Bourkes from more than 10 feet away.
After three or four months of use, anyone would probably be able to
tell the difference between the vinyl counterfeit and the genuine
leather purse, employees said. For now, a quick peek at a tag
inside the purse shows it's a fake.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Made in Korea' is a big signal,'' said accessories sales
manager Honey Tishgart.
</P>
<P>
   The real purse has a tag that says ``Made in the U.S.A.'' with a
serial number on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The small shop probably paid $7 for the counterfeit purse, which
likely came without any labels, said Smith, the investigator. Then
the wholesaler probably put the shop in touch with someone who
provided fake Dooney &AMP; Bourke tags, Smith said. The leather patch
with an image of a duck and the words ``Dooney &AMP; Bourke All-weather
leather,'' complete with the registered trademark symbol, typically
costs a dollar. A metal tag hanging from a leather strap goes for
22 cents.
</P>
<P>
   An investment of $8.22 yielded a $30.78 profit, less shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it; it isn't considered to be a crime of violence,
so you can bet that the charges if you get caught are not anywhere
near as severe as for a drug case. In fact, a lot of prosecutors
won't even touch these cases and the criminals know that,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a crook can realize that kind of profit and then if he's
not caught, doesn't face any serious charges or any serious time,
which would you choose if you're considering a life of crime?''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that relatively few buyers of counterfeit goods
consider themselves victims.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of customers on the black market know what
they're buying, Smith estimates. Foote said he named his store
Replicas because he wanted to make sure there was no doubt. He
figured that his business helped trademark holders because he put
brand names on the backs of customers who wouldn't have bought the
real thing anyway. Investigators say it doesn't help a company to
have its name attached to shoddy fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were selling fake Rolex watches for $20,'' Foote said.
``It's not the same market. It's a toy. It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   And it helps parents who want to satisfy their children's
brand-consciousness without overly taxing the family budget, said
former Replicas customer Barker. With Foote's help, she kept her
12-year-old son outfitted with clothes that looked like major brand
names. The FBI raid cut off her supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 12-year-old is very disappointed,'' Barker said. ``He'll
just be wearing the plain old, no-name clothing that doesn't have
the Nike name on it.''

 By MARK MORRIS, JOE LAMBE AND RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Kansas City, Mo.)A former Hilton Hotels
Corp. executive instrumental in locating the Flamingo Casino in
Kansas City was charged Monday with three state counts of felony
perjury before the Missouri Gaming Commission.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The charges against former Senior Vice President Markland
Rousseau are the culmination of more than two years of state and
federal investigations into a $250,000 grant the company awarded to
K.C. Perspectives. Former Port Authority Chairman Elbert Anderson
and his aide, Michelle Lathan, controlled K.C. Perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority selected Hilton in early 1993 over two other
casino applicants vying for rights to the site at the foot of the
Paseo Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau, now an Atlanta businessman, pleaded not guilty at his
arraignment Monday in Jackson County Circuit Court and was released
on a signature bond. His attorney, Tom Bath, denied all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole government case rests on the word of Elbert
Anderson, which I find curious at best,'' Bath said. ``The federal
government didn't think this was worthy of prosecution. I don't see
why the state did.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Rousseau faces a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a $2,500 fine on each count.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges come as the Gaming Commission considers renewing
Hilton's license, which expired last October and was conditionally
extended pending the outcome of an investigation by Jackson County
Prosecutor Claire McCaskill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions was a satisfactory conclusion ``to the
outcome of the (commission's) investigation into (Hilton's)
relationship with former Kansas City Port Authority Chairman Elbert
Anderson and related matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Monday, the Gaming Commission Executive
Director Mel Fisher said the agency expects to deal with Hilton's
Kansas City license when it meets Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing the evidence gathered in the various
investigations and will proceed accordingly,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said her investigation began this fall at the request
of the Gaming Commission. She also probed a $3 million severance
payment made to another Hilton official, former chief executive
officer and board member Raymond Avansino. He left the company with
Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   That payment raised no legal problems, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have brought all the charges we think that are appropriate
under the evidence,'' McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau assembled Hilton's bid for a Kansas City site in 1992
and was still a company employee when he testified before the
Gaming Commission at an Oct. 2, 1996, hearing that explored the
K.C. Perspectives grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although at the hearing Rousseau described all of his actions as
being proper and above-board, he and two other top-level Hilton
officials quickly resigned afterward. The Gaming Commission then
granted the company its Kansas City riverboat license.
</P>
<P>
   In the charges, Rousseau is accused of lying under oath to the
Gaming Commission three times during that 1996 hearing. Each
question dealt with who raised the idea in 1993 of Hilton
sponsoring a seminar//fashion show tour as part of its development
agreement with the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau told the commission that Anderson did not raise the
issue of sponsoring such a tour, that he was not influenced by
anybody in Kansas City in offering the grant, and that when he
conceived the grant he had no specific recipient in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sworn statement supporting the indictment, Missouri
Highway Patrol Trooper Eric S. Wilhoit said that Anderson raised
the idea in a February 1993 meeting at Winstead's Restaurant near
the Country Club Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agreed on a monetary sum of $1 million,'' Wilhoit wrote.
``As a result of this agreement, Anderson understood that his vote
had been `financially secured' by Hilton Hotels Corp. for future
developments, including attempts to open a temporary or permanent
facility (near the Paseo Bridge).''
</P>
<P>
   Only a $250,000 payment was made to K.C. Perspectives, which
used the money for staff salaries and to stage fashion shows and
seminars in Kansas City and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both Anderson and Lathan have been convicted in federal court on
public corruption charges unrelated to Hilton. MORE
</P>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ unrelated to Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday, Hilton described the new charges
as ``stale allegations'' that are not against ``Hilton Hotels
Corp., any Hilton entity, or any current Hilton employee, officer
or director.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...there are no new facts and no new evidence here...At no
time in any investigation _ and we have cooperated with six of them
in the past five years _ have we seen any evidence that in any way
changes our firm conclusion that there was no wrongdoing by anyone
acting for Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of which makes it particularly difficult for us to
understand the continued pursuit of these stale allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hilton agreed to pay the federal government $500,000
to avoid criminal charges that an executive _ identified Monday as
Rousseau _ had rewarded Anderson for his support of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Steve Hill said he opted for the out-of-court
agreement because the base fine of $500,000 was the maximum Hilton
would have paid in a guilty verdict. Hill also said a conviction
might have amounted to a ``nationwide death penalty'' for Hilton's
14 casinos in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling regulators in Nevada and New Jersey said Monday they
would continue to watch Hilton developments in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt our investigators will be monitoring that,'' said
Nevada Gaming Control Board spokeswoman Joanie Jacka. ``The board
does not usually act until whatever is happening is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Curtis, a gaming stocks analyst with BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, said he doesn't see the Missouri charges having
much impact on the Hilton Hotels Corp., with billions in annual
revenue, or its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to lose their license in Nevada or any other
jurisdiction because of the allegations brought against one
individual,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hilton's regulators also have been watching a
federal investigation unfold in Florida, where a $240,000 payment
was made in 1994 to the speaker of the Florida House by Bally's
Entertainment Inc., a casino company since acquired by Hilton
Hotels Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Missouri case, Hilton executives have said nothing
improper occurred.

ISLANDERS AND BLUES TIE, 3-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Three months after the season's start, there
was an opening-night feel at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Islanders' franchise player, Zigmund Palffy, was on
the ice Tuesday night, electrifying the fans, a rare capacity
crowd, gathered to witness Palffy's season debut as well as the
unveiling of a new scoreboard to replace the one that was the
center of so much controversy last summer.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the $3 million scoreboard showed Islanders
3, Blues 3. The $27.5 million player's scoring line showed two
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, whose feet were up to speed but whose hands looked a bit
rusty, helped get the Islanders on the new board in the first
period, and he helped them gain a 3-2 late in the game. After that,
it was impossible not to wonder where the Islanders would be had
Palffy, a holdout until last week, been playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a lot of practice,'' said the 26-year-old Palffy, who
signed a five-year contract last Thursday that pays him an average
of $5.5 million a season. ``I had good jump. This first game was
very important. I will get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lapointe scored at 10 minutes 32 seconds of the final
period to give the injury-riddled Islanders a short-lived 3-2
advantage, knocking in a pass from Robert Reichel, who got the puck
after a shot by Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, just as the Islanders were closing in and the clock
was running out, Todd Gill spoiled the home team's special night
with a lob shot from the side boards that eluded the Islanders'
goalie Wade Flaherty, tying the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left our legs in Arizona,'' said Coach Mike Milbury, whose
Islanders were coming off of a 2-1-1 West Coast swing that ended
with a 4-2 loss on Sunday in Phoenix. ``There's not much positive
to say about tonight's game except for we gained a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty, who played for the injured Tommy Salo, made 25 saves
for the Islanders. Grant Fuhr made 14 for the Blues. Palffy merely
saved the season.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the excitement of his return, for the fans at least,
was the scoreboard, which the Islanders purchased last summer but
refused to hang because of the allegedly unsafe hoist system. It
was introduced by a laser show on Tuesday night, complete with 3-D
glasses for all in attendance. On the video screen during the
player introductions, the Islanders welcomed back Palffy with a
lengthy tribute that showed dozens of his highlight-reel scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell he's not 100 percent,'' Milbury said of Palffy.
``But it sure helped to have him out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're markedly better'' with him, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game was the Islanders' second sellout this
season. Among the organization's reasons for not giving into
Palffy's demands earlier was the perception that he did not sell
tickets. But the 16,297 fans who chanted, ``Ziggy, Ziggy,'' when
Palffy hopped over the dashers for the first time proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Palffy was showing off those flashy
skills, the slick stick-handling and speedy skating, that make him
one of the league's most entertaining players. With Palffy laying
on a line with Reichel and Mariusz Czerkawski, the Islanders
fashioned a 2-0 lead with a couple of first-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' lead, however, did not last for long as St.Louis
struck twice, tying the score, 2-2, on goals by Scott Pellerin and
Marty Reasoner late in the first period.

DUKE SENDS WILDCATS A MESSAGE FOR MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ How this game was to be played was
decided early, barely eight minutes after tip-off. The decision was
dictated from the Duke sideline when Kentucky's Saul Smith, all 6
feet 2 inches of the coach's son, hurtled himself into the 6-8
Shane Battier to block what look like a certain dunk. It was a foul
_ a hard foul.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Blue Devils Coach Mike Krzyzewski vaulted from
his seat and stalked down the hardwood right past the officials. He
did not have a beef with them. ``Don't let them do that to you,
don't let them do that,'' he said to Battier, Trajan Langdon and
whatever other Blue Devil answered his glare.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment, the No. 2-ranked Blue Devils turned bullies.
They took what was a lackadaisical 4-point lead and wrung it in
their hands and banged it against their elbows for a 71-60 victory.
It was a hard-nosed but not hard-hearted effort before a sellout
crowd of 20,092 at Continental Arena in an all-out war at the Jimmy
V. Classic.
</P>
<P>
   By kicking up dirt underneath what was often an aerial ballet,
Duke (11-1) grounded the nation's No. 3 team in bruising, punishing
fashion. The Blue Devils blocked eight shots. They outmuscled the
Wildcats (10-2) on the backboard, squeezing 45 rebounds to
Kentucky's 36. They committed 22 fouls, their promising freshman
Corey Maggette picking up his fifth and final one minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the No. 3-ranked Wildcats threatened to fight back,
Duke invited them back into the mosh pit to scrum some more. The
last time came with 3 minutes 51 seconds left in the game with the
Wildcats within 9 points. Langdon shot and missed. Elton Brand
missed a follow. But there was Chris Carrawell on the floor
underneath the basket. He picked the ball up and stretched the lead
to 11.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Devils forced a 35-second violation the next time
down the floor, the Wildcats looked as if they wanted to throw in
the towel. They did, finally, when Brand bulled into the lane,
banged home a twisting finger roll and drew the foul. ``We wanted
to wear them down _ it was body to body all night,'' said the 6-8,
265-pounder who scored 22 points on 9 of 12 shooting and pulled
down 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue hammered South Carolina, 80-64, in the first game of the
doubleheader, whose purpose was to raise money for cancer research
in the name of Jimmy Valvano, the former Iona and North Carolina
State coach, who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   There was no holiday spirit evident on this hardwood even though
the Krzyzewski and Tubby Smith, the coaches for the two most
dominant college basketball programs of the 1990's tried to soft
sell it beforehand as nothing more than an early-season checkup. A
chance to test reflexes, to plunge a thermometer into their
players' wills and see if they had begun to burn.
</P>
<P>
   But Krzyzewski acknowledged this was something more, that he
indeed intended to send a message to his young Blue Devils when
Smith hammered Battier. ``It wasn't about being pretty tonight,''
he said. ``If you scored, you had to earn it. Everybody talks about
this being a December game. Well, it's an important December game.
I have five sophomores and a freshman. They need to get better.
They need to learn during the games. I wanted them to walk away
from here with something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils and the Wildcats have been in epic struggles
before _ though this was the first time they have met in the
regular season since 1988. Both teams have won two titles in the
1990's. Both have more weapons than the Pentagon among its deep,
athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   Battier and company answered Krzyzewski's early challenge by
going on a 21-14 run over the next 10 minutes as their backcourt,
William Avery and Langdon, suffocated the Wildcats into committing
10 turnovers that turned into 19 Blue Devil points.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who came into the game holding opponents to just
37 percent shooting, had their defensive intensity turned back on
them. They shot just 34.9 percent and the two Kentucky stars,
Heshimu Evans and Scott Padgett, scored only 13 points each on a
combined 8-for-24 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments of acrobatics that promise more highlights as
both teams drive toward the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Brand, a sophomore from Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
engaged in a game of ``top this'' with the Bronx's Evans. He
drop-stepped beneath the Wildcats' Michael Bradley for a reverse
layup that was sweetly touched off the glass. Evans sliced the
middle, feigned once and arched a left-handed rainbow to answer
right back for the Wildcats. They could have been two guys playing
horse on a netless rim in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Kentucky, which had already beaten four of the
nation's top 11 teams, got outbullied by its top rival. Smith
conceded his team got ``timid.'' ``When you get bumped and get hit
inside,'' he said, ``you still have to come out with something. We
didn't.''

MAN FOR ALL SEASONS: JEWISH SANTA BRINGS JOY TO CHILDREN FOR 15
YEARS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Surrounded by dozens of excited children tugging
at his white beard and cuffs, Arnie Cohen delivered Christmas joy
and bits of wisdom Tuesday at the Sylvan Park Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his own bright red suit, it was Cohen's latest
appearance as one of Santa's helpers during a 15-year stint with
the Los Angeles Fire Department's Toys for Needy Children campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is a practicing Jew who just finished celebrating
Hanukkah, but playing Santa is no conflict for the L.A. man, who
first took on the role in 1951 during a tour of duty in the Air
Force during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Santa is not a religious figure,'' Cohen, 66, said.
``He's a person that the kids see as someone special, and to look
into their eyes and see how happy they are brings me emotions I
can't describe.''
</P>
<P>
   And happiness is precisely what was on the menu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids' faces, they just lit up,'' said Susan Han,
psychological coordinator for the center, which caters to
underprivileged children. ``Some of the kids were afraid, but they
all know the holidays are coming when they get a visit from
Santa.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's military buddies in Guam were the first to cast him as
St. Nick, they wanted Santa to deliver food and gifts to native
children of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked around and I was the only Jewish guy and they
said: Hey, Arnie, you're not doing anything for Christmas, so
you're the man,'' Cohen said. ``And that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the military he continued playing Santa at a
market he owned in Echo Park, an L.A.-area suburb, where the order
of the holidays was handing out candy and small gifts to
neighborhood children.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Fire Department role came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to fly a delivery in on a helicopter, and the Fire
Department had it, so I started working with them 15 years ago,''
he said. ``It's been so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hofbauer, a Fire Department paramedic who organized
Tuesday's visit, said Cohen has been a valuable asset to the Toys
for Needy Children campaign, which has been running for more than
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he gets sent out three or four times a day,''
Hofbauer said. ``But he helps us interact with the children at an
impressionable age _ we tell them not to play with matches and to
stop, drop and roll _ and give some of them the only Christmas they
will really have.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing these days will stop Cohen from putting on that
suit. He played Santa one year with a broken foot. Last year he had
undergone surgery for prostate cancer and had to be helped into a
truck. Some time ago he did it right after a hernia operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should probably be in the Guinness Book of World Records for
the amount of times I've been Santa,'' Cohen said after spending
the morning at the Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some kids can't even get to a mall to see Santa,
and I might be the only Santa they've seen. That keeps me going,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep doing it as long as I'm able.''

<P>
   Arizona State didn't so much beat Marist Tuesday night at Wells
Fargo Arena as the Sun Devils survived the Red Foxes, 85-77, to
extend their winning streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of factors working against the Sun Devils, not
the least of which is that Marist came in with an 8-0 record and
has a senior backcourt tandem that can play with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils had more than that to overcome.
</P>

   First, guard Eddie House, the team's leading scorer, who has had
three 30-point-plus scoring performances, was so ill Monday night
that he was given liquids intravenously Tuesday morning.

after being reinstated late last week, suffered an ankle sprain in
the game's opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sun Devils, after building a 16-point lead early in the
first half, watched the Red Foxes go on a 13-0 tear to close within
three with 15:40 to play in the game. ASU built the lead back to 13
and then surrendered a 12-2 Marist burst.
</P>
<P>
   But they survived it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a little adversity to this point this year, but I'm
proud of them,'' ASU Coach Rob Evans said. ``Mike came back in and
played through some adversity and some pain, enough to get us by.
These guys are learning how hard they've got to play, how long
they've got to play and what they've got to overcome to be a good
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's really under the weather. He wasn't able to come to
shootaround or pregame meal. He was pretty ill. I was very pleased
with him. He didn't have his usual game, but he fought through it
and helped us win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   House gave the Sun Devils 27 minutes and scored 10 points while
handing out six assists. Batiste put in 34 minutes, finishing with
19 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let a little ankle injury keep me out of my
first home game of the season,'' Batiste said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he needed some help, and he got it.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bobby Lazor led the Sun Devils in scoring with 22 points
and added six rebounds and five assists. And he produced a couple
of big baskets that helped the Sun Devils weather Marist's second
rally.
</P>
<P>
   And reserve point guard Ron DuBois came off the bench to settle
the Sun Devils down offensively in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get us into something,'' DuBois said. ``I
was just trying to get us to slow down and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a problem in the first half, when the Sun Devils _
the Pac-10's worst shooting team at 39.6-percent for the season _
fired at a 64.5-percent rate to build a 49-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he has told his team that if they could shoot 50
percent then, with their typical defensive effort, they might blow
teams out by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils, who have won with their defense and grit
this season, forgot their identity for a stretch in the second half
and turned the ball over five times and missed four straight shots.
That's when Evans called on DuBois.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we needed somebody to get the basketball to the
right people and steady the ship,'' Evans said. ``Ron got in there
and got us moving a little bit, which we needed to have happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Evans adjusted, in part because of House's illness, and
switched from man-to-man defense to zone for some stretches. House
was too fatigued to stay with his man defensively, and also was in
foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils got it done, but it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Red Fox guard Bobby Joe Hatton hit from beyond the arc for three
of his team-high 21 points to start Marist's final surge, and guard
Bo Larragan finished it with another three that cut ASU's lead to
72-69 with 3:58 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor hit a fadeaway jump shot and followed that by diving to
the basket and taking a nice pass from Batiste for a layup and
seven-point lead. The Red Foxes got no closer than five after that
as the Sun Devils were good enough from the free-throw line to
finish the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost to a good team, and I think that they're going to
surprise some of the teams in their league now that they're at full
strength,'' Marist Coach Dave Magarity said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It might not rank up there with the role reversals
undergone by Christine Jorgensen or Renee Richards, but the Phoenix
Coyotes found themselves the major focus of a huge one themselves
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, always the hunter, were the hunted. Believe it or
not, the Detroit Red Wings, winners of consecutive Stanley Cups and
a team that has eliminated Phoenix from two of its past three
Stanley Cup playoff appearances, were using the Coyotes as a
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure, eh?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings didn't come close to getting the answer they
wanted, as the Coyotes whipped them for the second time this
season, 6-2, at Joe Louis Arena, setting a season high for goal
production and raising their record to 19-5-4 to climb within two
points of Pacific Division-leading Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how they felt coming in, then we complemented each
other, because that's how we felt, too,'' said Keith Tkachuk, who
had a goal and an assist. ``They still have a great team over
there, one that has won two straight Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we limited our turnovers in the neutral zone and got
another great effort from Niki (Khabibulin) in goal. But, hey,
don't ever give up on them. This is the regular season. They'll
still be there at the end. Count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (17-13-1) is atop the Central Division standings, which
would be enough to satisfy most teams and their fans, but not those
in Hockeytown, where perfection is expected.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Wings are also a team that is 0-7 against division
leaders and is 4-10 against teams better than .500, which has fans
in a bitter mood. Tuesday night they booed ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer`` and cheered ``Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   To show Detroit's resolve entering the game, witness center Igor
Larinov's comment between the first and second periods, after his
power-play goal at 11:54 of the first period gave the Red Wings an
early 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big test for us,'' he said. ``Phoenix is playing
great this season, and we have to beat a team like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larionov's thoughts were echoed by several teammates before the
game, including center Kris Draper, who said a victory over Phoenix
would make a statement for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Say, do the Coyotes have a Stanley Cup stashed away somewhere?
No, but if they continue to play as they did Tuesday night, who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   To beat Detroit, a team has to dominate the neutral zone, an
area that Phoenix controlled most of the night while capitalizing
on 19 giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   When they did err, Khabibulin was providing another stellar
effort. He stopped 36 of 38 shots, and none bigger, perhaps, than a
series of three in the last minute of the second period while
protecting to 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I had a lot of tough shots because the guys
played so well in front of me and cleared the rebounds,'' said
Nikolai Khabibulin, who improved to 13-4-2. ``This was a good test
for us to start winning again against one of the best teams in the
league. It was the perfect team for us to have a great game
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised they stopped skating hard in the
third period, though.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone typified Phoenix's effort, it was Dallas Drake, who
showed up at the arena in a walking cast to protect an injured
middle toe. Drake gave Phoenix a 2-1 second-period lead with a
second-effort, diving goal off a turnover by Larionov. Drake later
dived to knock the puck away as Dareen McCarty was firing a
point-blank slap shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical Dallas Drake play, a second, third-effort
goal,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``He not only got that,
but also a big block. He gives you maximum effort on every shift of
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game winner came from center Juha Ylonen at 13:15 of the
second period. &QL;

MAN CHARGED IN MEDAL OF HONOR FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling up a rarely used law founded in
patriotism, federal officials said Tuesday that they have charged a
man with wearing a congressional Medal of Honor he never earned.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald L. Hayes could go to prison for up to a year and be fined
as much as $100,000 if convicted of donning a fake medal for a
Veterans Day celebration at a Wal-Mart in Lompoc, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Dec. 14 in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, Hayes pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor, said U.S.
Attorney's Office spokesman Thom Mrozek. The 53-year-old Hayes
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual but it's not unheard of,'' Mrozek said Tuesday,
pointing out that the office has in the past decade charged at
least one other man with the unauthorized wearing of a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Honor is the highest distinction that can be
awarded to members of the military in battle. The bronze
five-pointed star was first awarded by Abraham Lincoln in the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been convicted of both illegally wearing fake medals
and selling real ones on the black market, where they can fetch up
to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the charge is rare _ the Department of Justice doesn't
keep records of how many medal-related crimes are committed _ the
government takes the offense seriously. In 1994, Congress voted to
increase the penalty for wearing a fake Medal of Honor, which used
to carry a maximum $250 fine and six-month jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was questioned by police Nov. 6, when he was scheduled as
a featured speaker at the Wal-Mart event in Lompoc, an agricultural
town in northern Santa Barbara County.
</P>
<P>
   Mrozek said the event was advertised, which drew attention to
Hayes. FBI and local police investigated after a tipster checked an
Internet record of Medal of Honor winners and did not find Hayes'
name.
</P>
<P>
   A magistrate judge set a Feb. 22 trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Kalfayan, who acted as an interpreter for Gen. George Patton
in World War II, is one of 24 veterans who helps run the Legion of
Valor in Fresno, Calif. _ the largest museum dedicated to Medal of
Honor and Navy Cross winners in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kalfayan, 87, pointed out that ``living Medal of Honor winners
are very few,'' because 70 percent to 80 percent of the recipients
perform heroics that end with their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretending you were awarded a medal when you didn't is a
disgrace to the people who died for them,'' Kalfayan said. ``I
can't think of a bigger embarrassment.'' &QL;

TYSON PLAYS NICE, GETS HOLIDAY BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids waited in a long line on the streets and sidewalks that
circled Phoenix's Madison Square Garden gym. Toys filled the ring.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mike Tyson's turn to play Santa in his continuing effort
to rehabilitate his image.
</P>
<P>
   But, first, he had several other roles to fill.
</P>
<P>
   After sparring Tuesday, the fighter talked about history and
Napoleon, Russia and Haiti, Archie Moore and forgotten eras, new
ways and bad habits. Tyson even got around to Clinton and
impeachment, even though he can't vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a felon, but they'll take my tax money,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bada-boom, bada-bing.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson worked his audience as though it were a speed bag. Nobody
knows if Tyson can still throw a punch. But there was no doubt that
he could deliver a punch line along with philosophical bits and
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   For one afternoon, at least, this was no Iron Mike.
</P>
<P>
   More like Mercurial Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard that the more important you are, the more
humble you should be,'' said Tyson, who has been training at the
central Phoenix gym since mid-October for his comeback bout against
Frans Botha on Jan. 16 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. ``I've always been
a hell-raiser. But I'm trying to practice humility. I'm working at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man with earnings and losses of untold millions, the
battle never ceases. He fought it Tuesday before a scheduled
workout for his first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears
in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in my room and a man brought me my lunch,'' he
said. ``He called me Mister Tyson. I said, `No, no, no. Call me
Mike.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But, no, he kept calling me Mister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I looked at him and said, `Look, I have millions of
dollars and no friends.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since his move to the Valley, Tyson has worked hard to find
those elusive friends. He has signed autographs, passed out
Thanksgiving turkeys and, on Tuesday, delivered about 500 toys to
underprivileged kids. Today, he'll visit Maricopa County Sheriff
Joe Arpaio's Tent City jail in an attempt to counsel juveniles
imprisoned at the compound for adult convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Arpaio said the youths might listen to Tyson
because of his own prison experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson did not talk about jail or the possibility of a return. He
faces sentencing in Maryland on Feb. 5 for a no-contest plea on
misdemeanor assault charges. The sentence could affect his parole,
which he has been serving since his 1995 release from prison on a
rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson did talk about what he hoped to accomplish. He
mentioned writer Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defined an era,'' Tyson said. ``When I die, I'd like people
to say, `Mike, he defined an era.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Tyson, that attempt will come in the ring. Throughout his
turbulent career, he either has been ill-defined, or a fighter
whose definition is incomplete. More always has been expected of
the youngest man to ever win the heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   But, over the years, he exceeded expectations only outside the
ropes with his own personal excesses and a crazy menagerie that
served as his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Don King, John Horne and Rory Holloway are gone. Adviser
Shelly Finkel and trainer Tommy Brooks, a former Evander Holyfield
cornerman, are there instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Shelly are around me so I won't give all my money
away,'' said Tyson, who has a reported $10 million loan from
promoter Dan Goosen of America Presents and a $13 million debt with
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooks, Tyson appears to have a low-key, no-nonsense trainer
who was in Holyfield's corner on the night of the infamous Bite
Fight. Brooks understands what happened then. Tyson's fearful
image, his intimidating presence, was stripped away like a thin
veil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bully syndrome won't work anymore,'' Brooks said. ``Now,
he's got to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But, on this day, the fight would have to wait. Mercurial Mike
still had to play Santa. &QL;

EX-CARDINALS FINDING LIFE NOT GREENER ON OTHER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   When middle linebacker Eric Hill left the Cardinals in free
agency last winter, he said he wanted to go to a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has helped the St. Louis Rams to four victories, half of
the total of the Cardinals, who are only one win away from
clinching their first non-strike playoff berth in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Brent Alexander, who signed a free-agent deal with
Carolina in the off-season, knows how Hill feels. The Panthers have
only three victories this season, the same number as former
Cardinals defensive end Michael Bankston has won in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants were 3-7 when ex-Cardinal Kent Graham
replaced Danny Kanell as the starter five games ago. Graham has
gone 4-1 as a starter, but the Giants can't get into the playoffs
unless the Cardinals and Tampa Bay lose their regular-season
finales Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Jeff Feagles, who left for Seattle in free agency,
started the season 3-0. But the Seahawks have struggled since, are
8-7 and will miss the playoffs for the 10th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the free agents who departed, only Kevin Williams, the
wide receiver-return specialist who signed with Buffalo last
February, will be in the playoffs. But each has made big enough
contributions to his team that the Cardinals should get several
compensatory picks in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Compensatory picks are awarded to teams after Rounds 3-7 and are
based on salary and performance.
</P>
<P>
   The number of picks a team receives equals the net loss of
compensatory free agents up to a maximum of four.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost six unrestricted free agents (the sixth is
Giants running back LeShon Johnson, who has been out all season
recovering from a cancerous tumor in his chest) and signed only
one, running back Mario Bates, formerly of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Lester Holmes, middle linebacker Mark Maddox and
backup quarterback Dave Brown signed as free agents but don't count
in the formula because they were released by their teams before
signing with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what we lost, we should get at least an extra
third-rounder,'' a Cardinals official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already own San Diego's No. 1 choice in the 1999
draft. If the season were to end today, the Chargers (5-10) would
pick seventh or eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Williams has been the most successful of the free
agents who left the Cardinals after last season. He is eighth in
the AFC in punt returns with a 10.1-yard average and has 27 catches
for 373 yards and one score.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who signed a two-year, $5.25 million deal, struggled early
when he suffered a broken hand in the season opener. But he stayed
in the lineup and has started 14 games. He is fifth on the Rams in
tackles with 86 and has one sack, one interception and one forced
fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who signed a three-year, $3.025 million deal, has
started 15 games for Carolina and has 99 tackles, third most on the
team. But, just as he did with the Cardinals, he has made few big
plays and has no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Bankston has been one of the Bengals' most consistent players on
the league's worst defense. He has 67 tackles and 3.5 sacks in 15
starts. He has led the defensive line in tackles eight consecutive
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has completed 90 of 179 passes for 1,086 yards and five
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Feagles is seventh in the AFC in punting with a 44.2-yard
average. &QL;

MERCURY SADDENED BY RIVAL'S COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the WNBA's only competition in North American
professional women's basketball folded up business Tuesday, the
Phoenix Mercury didn't see it as a reason for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, it's a sad day for women's basketball,'' said
Seth Sulka, the vice president of operations for the Mercury. ``I
know there has been a lot of talk about the rivalry between the two
leagues, but in many ways the ABL was a positive because it gave
year-round exposure to the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that people in the WNBA never have had anything
negative to say about the ABL, and appreciated what that league did
for women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think there's a rivalry between the players. A
lot of them are friends because they played together in Europe
before the two leagues formed. That's where the best collegiate
players went to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mercury will be watching closely to see how the WNBA
handles the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an influx of talent from the American Basketball
League into the WNBA, and it must be determined how that will be
done. Before the announcement, there already had been talk of a
possible merger of the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Will the WNBA take over operation of existing teams? Will there
be a supplemental draft of ABL players? Will the players simply be
there for the signing as free agents?
</P>
<P>
   And how will the two expansion teams, Orlando and Minnesota, fit
into the reallocation of talent? If the players are all free
agents, theoretically Orlando and Minnesota could put together what
amounts to ABL All-Star teams that could threaten the best of the
WNBA's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what will work,'' Sulka said. ``We're at the
beginning of our own negotiations with our players' union that
formed about six weeks ago. Obviously, both leagues have some of
the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just up in Portland, and I saw an ABL game between the
Portland Power and the Seattle Reign. The ball was great. They had
a nice little crowd, and talent-wise, the players definitely have a
place in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland has a player, Natalie Williams, who's unbelievable.
She would look great in a starting lineup alongside Jennifer
Gillom.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans, the collapse of the ABL ultimately is likely to result
in a better WNBA product.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury was regarded as one of the WNBA's deepest teams,
having upgraded its bench considerably between its first and second
seasons. But most WNBA teams were not more than six or seven
players deep.
</P>
<P>
   Now there will be some star-quality players coming in, along
with other experienced, talented players without big-name
recognition. It will also mean that some current WNBA players will
have a battle on their hands to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would argue that their players aren't
comparable in talent to ours,'' Sulka said. &QL;

TVERDOVSKY NOT STEAMED OVER LACK OF HOT WATER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DETROIT _ Coyotes defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky overheard a media
member complaining on the team bus on the way to Tuesday morning's
skate and again in the hotel elevator after the skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you guys still talking about that?'' he quizzed. ``You're
nothing but a bunch of whiners.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have included several of his teammates on that list,
including Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' abode here is the plush Atheneum Suites in Greek
Town. But with temperatures outside dropping to 7 degrees, several
rooms were without heat and all the rooms were devoid of hot water
Tuesday morning, robbing everyone of a shower unless he wanted to
brave tap water that was not far away from being slush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys should have been with me when I was kid in Russia,''
Tverdovsky said. ``Me and a friend of mine were sent to the Sports
Academy, and when we checked into the room where we stayed, there
were two windows but no glass in them. There was snow inside the
room and on one of the beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we didn't have hot water to shower with for the whole year
. . . no kidding, for the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe North Americans are somewhat spoiled. &QL;  &QL; 
Watchful eye &QL;  &QL; 
Coach Jim Schoenfeld plans to keep a watchful eye on his two
veteran second-line forwards Greg Adams, 35, and Rick Tocchet, 34,
to ensure they get enough rest as the season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Adams in particular seemed to show the effects of playing three
games in four nights during the recent four-game trip that ended in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at things right now for Gus (Adams) and Tocchet
where their practice time will be limited at times,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``For instance, if we have a 40- to 50-minute practice, they
might go off after 20 minutes at times. Have them do just enough to
take some shots at the goaltender and to get a good warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally gave him a couple days rest after St. Louis, and
Gus had great legs against the Islanders. You have to recognize
what you have and don't go to the well too many times. Just like
you can't rush young guys along too fast, your older guys aren't
going to get younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams supplied two assists and Tocchet added another in the
lopsided victory over the Red Wings Tuesday night. &QL;  &QL;

PLUMMER WINS WEEKLY LEAGUE, CLUB MVP HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer's week keeps getting better.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked as the NFL Player of the Week on Tuesday, one day
after he signed a four-year, $29.7 million contract extension to
become the NFL's second-highest-paid player.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who threw for 394 yards in Sunday's 19-17 victory over
New Orleans, becomes only the third Cardinals player to get the NFL
Player of the Week honor, joining previous winners Chris Chandler
(1992) and Boomer Esiason (1996).
</P>
<P>
   He also was selected Tuesday as the team's Most Valuable Player
for the 1998 season in voting done by the Phoenix chapter of the
Professional Football Writers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has guided the team to back-to-back, come-from-behind
victories the past two weeks, two of eight winning rallies he has
directed the past two seasons. He has completed 60 percent of his
passes for 3,463 yards this season, fourth-most in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored by the Pro Football Writers group was middle
linebacker Ronald McKinnon, who was selected as the team's Most
Courageous Player, an award named for the late Republic
sportswriter Lloyd Herberg, who covered the Cardinals when they
moved to the Valley in 1988 until his death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not being drafted, McKinnon has been a starter the past
two seasons and has a team-high five interceptions this season,
including three in an October victory over the Chicago Bears. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jealousy not allowed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said he is not worried that players
whose contracts are up at the end of the season might resent
Plummer's getting a new deal with another year left on his rookie
pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it will affect them,'' Tobin said. ``They
should be happy Jake is going to be here for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that we want to keep the players here. We
plan to keep the football team intact.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Christmas spirit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, there were long lines at the
ticket windows for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers at
Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Tuesday afternoon, the team had sold 50,748 tickets,
including 10,000 the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   Those standing in line at the team's Tempe training facility
were given unspiked egg nog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium reverberates noise,'' Tobin said. ``I'd love to
see 70,000 there to make it hard for San Diego.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Giving back &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plummer plans to give about $1 million to charity.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a scholarship fund at his high school in Boise,
Idaho, to rebuild the physical plant for athletics.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to endow a full scholarship at Arizona State,
where he played four seasons. He and his agent, Leigh Steinberg,
are starting the Plummer Foundation, with money to be given to
abused and ill children and for research to combat Alzheimer's
disease. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I'm so happy for the guy and proud of him,'' ASU Coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``The lesson I see is that he is consumed and driven
by winning. I don't think he set out to make money or be famous.
It's a byproduct of his focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Frank Sanders, who leads the NFC in receptions
with 81, is trying to become the first Cardinals player to
accomplish that feat since J.T. Smith in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Tommy Bennett was limping noticeably Tuesday
because of a sprained ankle, but Tobin expects him to start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin won't know the availability of backup cornerback Tommy
Knight (broken hand) until later in the week. ``We'll have to see
what the cast is and how limiting it is,'' Tobin said. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE DEFENSE DOMINATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It will take time for most of Los Angeles to
forget what happened to Cal State Northridge against UCLA during
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of time. Which means absolutely nothing to the Matadors
now.
</P>
<P>
   More imperative was how quickly CSUN forgot about what happened
at Pauley Pavilion and got on with its season, which continued with
a defensive gem against James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps their best defensive effort of the season, the
Matadors rolled to a 77-64 home win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good way to come back from the UCLA game, and
that's what our coaches were looking at,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``They wanted to see how we would respond. They came
out and really defended, which is what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN didn't do it by creating turnovers off its pressure
defense, but rather by shutting down any option the Dukes had
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison (6-4) entered the game shooting 49 percent from
the field. But a tenacious CSUN defense, something missing in the
17-point loss to UCLA, held the Dukes to a woeful 31 percent. They
made 4 of 25 shots from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two practices all we did was stress our defense,
getting back,'' CSUN guard Jason Crowe. ``We tried to stress to get
back in transition. The only points they were getting were on
drives, so we knew if we could contain their drives with a little
zone we could shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CSUN's offense was efficient for most the night, and
it was again led by sophomore center Brian Heinle. He was 4 of 5 on
3-pointers and scored a game-high 19 points while Derrick Higgins
added 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence right now. I know the ball is going in,''
Heinle said. ``With Rico (Harris) out, we have to pick up the
scoring a little bit and I feel I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was added significance to the win.
</P>
<P>
   It ended CSUN's two-game losing streak and also ensured the
Matadors (7-4) of entering the Big Sky Conference with a winning
record.
</P>
<P>
   With NAIA Lewis-Clark State as the remaining tune-up to the
Jan.2 league opener at Northern Arizona, the Matadors should enter
the new year with eight wins for the first time since 1988 turned
into 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two games in a row and didn't want that to become a
big issue, which is why it was important for us to win this game,''
Braswell said. ``This was a system win for us. It means our guys
stuck to our system, believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fallout from the UCLA loss, Braswell didn't resort to a
screaming, tirade-infested practice following the Bruins loss.
Instead, he made the Matadors endure a more grueling endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   They watched the game film in which the Bruins shot 65 percent
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Painful, but effective.
</P>
<P>
   Less than seven minutes in against James Madison, the Matadors
had a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle then hit a 3-pointer at the 9:32 mark to trigger a 9-0
run, which featured easy lay-ins in transition and on backdoor
cuts, to put CSUN ahead 29-17. The Dukes never got closer than
eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you they have a lot of pride,'' Braswell said.
``That's part of building a program, having guys that have attitude
where losing is not acceptable.''

FLOOD OF GIFTS OFFERED FOR HOUSTON OCTUPLETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the eight babies born to a Houston woman on Sunday
struggled to survive as the first known living octuplets, donors
from around Texas and across the country on Tuesday pledged money
and goods to help the new family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there hasn't been any dramatic change in
the conditions,'' said Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at
Texas Children's Hospital, where the six girls and two boys remain
under sedation. ``We don't look for significant change. We are
happy with small progressions.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest infant was being fed formula through a nasal tube,
while the other seven received an intravenous mixture. Doctors
examined all eight on Tuesday afternoon and found that all were
responding to sound and light, but the smallest of the babies was
found to have a treatable heart condition common to premature
babies.
</P>
<P>
   The babies remained in critical but stable condition, while the
octuplets' mother, Nkem Chukwu, 27, had shown marked improvement
throughout the day after surgery to correct internal bleeding and
was listed in good condition at the adjacent St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which has insisted on its privacy, allowing no
interviews or photographs of the infants, released a statement on
Tuesday evening. ``We are very appreciative of the worldwide
support of the past few days, particularly the prayers and
spiritual connection at this time of the year,'' the statement
said. ``It has been incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials say they have received a steady stream of
calls and packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten a lot of interest, though I think some people
around the country are waiting to see how the babies do,'' said
Katy Gill, director of development at Texas Children's Hospital.
``In this case, because the babies are so critical, a lot of people
may be waiting to see if they survive.''
</P>
<P>
   A food chain based in Houston, Randall's Food Markets, has
donated a year's worth of groceries for the Chukwus. A national
company, Drypers, has donated a lifetime supply of baby wipes and
disposable training pants. Another company, which asked to remain
anonymous, donated a lifetime supply of diapers. Mead Johnson
Nutritionals donated a year's worth of infant formula.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual call, said Marianne Dwyer, assistant director
of hospital philanthropy at St. Luke's, came from Excalibur Tire
and Wheel, a local chain of auto supply stores, offering the
Chukwus a lifetime supply of tires and oil changes. ``It's so
sweet,'' Ms. Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, who had been trying to have children for several
years and had miscarried triplets earlier this year, learned 12
weeks into her pregnancy that she was carrying multiple embryos,
but declined for religious reasons to allow doctors to reduce the
number of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The sensational nature of the case _ marking the fifth known
time in the world that more than seven children were delivered and
the only known time that all have survived _ has revived the debate
among doctors over the ethical use of fertility drugs, because
so-called high-order multiple births, triplets or more, most often
end in death for at least some of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said today that many of the calls came from
individuals who wanted to give money to the new family. Ms. Dwyer
said that St. Luke's Hospital would accept checks made payable to
the Chukwu Family Fund until a more permanent fund for the family
could be set up in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chido Nwangwu, the publisher of two national
magazines and two Internet sites intended for Africans and black
Americans, said he was trying to rally support among blacks for the
octuplet's parents, both American citizens born in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought is to stimulate the spirit of community service
and volunteerism for all people, regardless of race or culture,''
said Nwangwu, whose business is based in Houston. ``And we want
particularly to make certain that these children get the same kind
of support, regardless of their culture, that have been given to
other multiple-birth babies in the past.''

JOHNSON HAS THE RIGHT GENES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When Josiah Johnson walked into the gym last summer
at Montclair Prep, Bob Webb couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before him wasn't the 5-foot-8 water boy Webb often saw
at UCLA games with his father, former Bruins and NBA player Marques
Johnson. Instead, he was staring at a 6-foot-6, 220-pound
16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day he walked into the gym for the first time I was like
`Wow,''' Webb said. ``This wasn't the same kid I remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just fine with Webb, who played with Marques
Johnson at UCLA and became the boys' basketball coach at Montclair
Prep this summer. At the time, Josiah Johnson was considering
leaving Crenshaw, where he spent his freshman and sophomore years,
for Montclair Prep, where brother Kris played two years before
transferring to Crenshaw in the early 1990s. Johnson wasn't happy
with the playing time he was slated to get at Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   One look at Josiah was all the convincing Webb needed that
Johnson would be a good fit with the Mounties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking `Yeah, he can definitely play for us,' ''
Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   The walk is reminiscent of his dad, the height and size more
like his brother. The question now is whether Josiah Johnson can
elevate his game to become the type of players Marques Johnson and
Kris Johnson became.
</P>
<P>
   Marques was an All-American at UCLA from 1974-77 before going on
to an NBA career. Kris Johnson was the City Player of the Year at
Crenshaw before moving on to UCLA, where he was a key player from
1994-98.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Josiah. It's not the easiest thing, trying to follow
in the footsteps of a talented father and brother. There's pressure
to measure up to their accomplishments, and people automatically
assume you'll be able to dominate like your relatives.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the comparisons bothered Josiah. He
wondered when people would judge him on his own terms, rather than
the father and brother that came before him.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he decided to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just finally got to the point where I decided I am my own
person and my own player,'' Johnson said. ``I mean, my dad was one
kind of player, my brother had his game and I've got mine. It was
difficult at first, following them, but I'm OK with it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is playing center for the Mounties, but he enjoys
extending out to the perimeter, where he's able to do the thing he
loves most: Shoot jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why. Johnson can shoot the ball (much
better than Kris could at a similar age). Where Kris was an inside
force, Josiah _ averaging 19 points and 10 rebounds through seven
games _ has the ability to catch and shoot from most anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got that really nice soft shooting touch,'' Webb said.
``You notice that right away about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's shooting ability was honed during pickup games with
his father and brother. They rarely took it easy on him, which
meant Josiah had to develop a quick shot just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to shoot it fast when you play against Kris or he'll
send it back,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him now, it's obvious Josiah learned well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll rarely bring the ball below his head, which is something
young players do all the time,'' Webb said. ``That's something he
learned from his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   As good a shooter as he is, Josiah understands he needs to
advance other parts of his game if he wants to have an impact at
the next level. At his size, he needs to be a better, more physical
inside player. And he'll need to develop a better move to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things I have to work on,'' Johnson said.
``That's what I want to do these next two years, just become a
better all-around player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also needs to watch his diet. Like his brother Kris at the
same age, Josiah has some baby fat to shed. Kris lost 40 pounds
between his freshman and sophomore years at Montclair Prep. When he
got to UCLA, he dropped another 30 after his first year.
</P>
<P>
   Josiah isn't nearly as heavy as Kris was, but there's still work
to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of him eating right and taking care of his
body better,'' said Webb, who believes Josiah can succeed on the
college level.
</P>
<P>
   `The tools are there, and he's shown that he's willing to work
to get better,'' he said. ``He has a bright future.''

ABL'S GRASS-ROOTS BRAND OF BALL DIES ON VINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before delving into the inevitable dollars and cents
issues like operating costs, TV rights and marketing _ all key
issues that the pioneer American Basketball League could not
successfully address _ it seems appropriate to offer a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle lost a friend Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle lost a good-faith, feel-good, hearts-in-the-right-place
enterprise called women's professional basketball _ grass-roots
style.
</P>
<P>
   That's a heavy blow, especially in these days of locked out,
overpaid, ego-driven, Age of Entitlement professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and its players are fighting over $2 billion in annual
profits. They won't take the court.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL, with its perhaps too idealistic model for success, is
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The Reign closed its doors with the rest of the league. Two and
a third seasons are on the books. And the books are closed.
</P>
<P>
   So much was accomplished in the promotion of the women's game.
So much was left to do, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Reign was off to its best start ever _ on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the ABL is out of money, which is why the league plans to
file for bankruptcy. The league is out of time, too, although I
suspect the will to go on was strong, from the commissioner's
office on down to the players.
</P>
<P>
   A women's basketball enterprise founded and promoted as ``A
League of Their Own'' has a power beyond the bottom line, even if
the bottom line is ultimately unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of Jennifer Azzi's 3-pointers in San Jose, there
are empty gyms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Teresa Edwards' full-court mastery in Philadelphia,
there are unused tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Jennifer Rizzoti's floor-burning dedication in New
England, there is one women's hoops hotbed fresh out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   And here in Seattle, instead of Shalonda Enis' inside muscle or
the freestylin' offense of Kate Starbird, there is disbanded
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked is how Enis, Starbird and Reign general manager Karen
Bryant described their reaction to Tuesday's abrupt announcement by
league commissioner Gary Calvelli.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked, too, will be the fans in Seattle, San Jose, Portland
and New England, where ABL teams were holding their own in
attendance and revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on our last road trip East, some of the crowds we saw,
some of the hotels we stayed at, we could see things might be
coming to an end,'' Starbird said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nashville, Columbus, Colorado, Chicago and Denver were
having a tough time putting fans in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was a day that most ABL observers could see coming,
although this sudden midseason shut-down seemed out of character
with the player-friendly, fan-conscious spirit of the league.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, just before the Reign opener, Calvelli indicated
that there was enough sponsor money to make it though 1998-99, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   But the warning signs were all too apparent.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, as the WNBA reeled in most of college basketball's
All-Americans, the ABL knew it was losing the public relations war.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing, though, compared to the serious, substantive
problems that could not be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   When league officials could not find a suitor at CBS or Fox
willing to give the ABL a national TV package, there was little
hope the ABL could survive on the sheer benevolence of some
good-intentioned sponsors, like Reebok nationally and US West here
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA lockout was going to present the ABL with any
additional opportunities for a TV deal, league officials must have
been shocked when nothing materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fox's regional stations refused to bite at broadcasting ABL
games.
</P>
<P>
   In that most important way _ TV coverage _ the ABL could not
approach the muscle of the WNBA, the other women's pro league that
comes courtesy of NBA marketing, money and leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The central debate over the fate of women's pro hoops has
conveniently broken down along ABL vs. WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL had the superior talent and the longer, winter schedule.
It was a players' league, with a salary scale that benefited all
players, not just the superstars, as in the WNBA, where there is
great disparity between the top and bottom players.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, meanwhile, was assisted by the NBA's marketing skills,
its TV deals with NBC, ABC and ESPN and the fan-friendly NBA
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's summertime schedule was seen as a way to expose the
game during a ``down time,'' while the ABL clung to the ideal of
holding its season during the real season _ winter.
</P>
<P>
   But now the ABL model has imploded. Certainly, the easy
assumption will be that the ABL lost and the WNBA is winning.
</P>
<P>
   That is not entirely the correct interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA always thought it was positive for there to be two
leagues as a way to expose women's basketball,'' Mark Pray, WNBA
director of media relations, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a synergy to the arrangement,'' Pray said about
having two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But that synergy was lost Tuesday. And for everyone who rooted
wildly for the ABL to win its grass-roots battle to raise a women's
league up from the ground, there is no shame in hoping now that the
WNBA continues to grow, shoddy politics or not.
</P>
<P>
   For Seattle, as well as other cities where the ABL has shown the
women's game has fans, it is the next step, the best hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long, long-term goals have been to have a WNBA team in
every NBA city,'' said Pray, who noted Minnesota and Orlando will
be the WNBA's two expansion franchises this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the nine ABL teams are in NBA cities.
</P>
<P>
   However, the promise of a new league does not diminish the sad
news right here, right now.
</P>
<P>
   Saying goodbye is tough, for sure. Ending this way is terribly
bitter. But the Reign proved women's pro basketball can work in
this market. The Jan. 2 game at KeyArena date, now canceled, was
going to bring out more than 12,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   There is a baseline of support and enthusiasm from regional
sponsors. Something says that the Reign's legacy won't be anything
less than a stupendous effort toward an as yet unfulfilled goal.
</P>
<P>
   Along with somber condolences must come the sincere kudos.

IN WORLD AWASH OF BOWLS, HAWAII TWIN BILL HAS VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ On the long list of things the world needs, another
college bowl game fits in somewhere between a $13 million baseball
pitcher and House impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking big-time college sports here, which is never
about needs and always about wants.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever someplace with a yearning for the spotlight wants to
stage a bowl game, the NCAA wants to comply. And hearing no
objections, the city and the NCAA boom out ``voila!'' and 19 bowl
games appear out of no particular need.
</P>
<P>
   Only one counts for much. The Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl between
Tennessee and Florida State is the schedule's only item of
substance. The rest are strictly raindrops on roses and whiskers on
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, these are the holidays, when irrelevant cuteness is
not only allowed, it is virtually mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   So in a culture where too much of a good thing is never enough,
why not a bowl doubleheader?
</P>
<P>
   And why not in the best location?
</P>
<P>
   Or as Husky center Brad Hutt put it Tuesday: ``It's 80 degrees
and sunny here. And 20 degrees and snowing in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The sublime logic is overpowering, and a prime reason why his
Husky teammates will play Air Force on Friday in the new Oahu Bowl,
the second game of a twin bill featuring Oregon and Colorado in the
lid-lifting Aloha Bowl. For the $45 tickets, fans also get a
between-games Hawaiian dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks and Huskies were awarded this sandy gig by virtue of
finishing fourth and fifth in the Pac-10 race, respectively. For
the Huskies, who were in the Aloha Bowl last year, Hawaii is
becoming their home for the holidays away from home. And given that
prospects for a higher finish in the next couple of years aren't
high, they might want to consider buying instead of renting.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is not to get too good, because the league's
third-place finisher goes to the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, which
is to Hawaii what the Wicked Witch of the West is to Cindy
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the fact that the Hawaii bowls' payouts are the
NCAA-required minimum of $750,000 per team, which often doesn't
cover expenses, and thereby draws the least distinguished eligible
teams, the set-up is grand _ beachfront hotels, multiple tourist
draws, perfect weather and Christmas Day sports exclusivity on
national TV, made even better this year by the absence of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is too good to stay long in the warm backwater. So
guess what is up the sleeves of the bowl folks here (were they to
own clothing with sleeves).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to host for the Final Four of college football,''
Lenny Klompus, the bowls' chairman and CEO, said Tuesday. But not
exactly like college basketball's Final Four. The Hawaii dreamers
want to bring here the nation's four best college teams for a
doubleheader much like Friday's, only with meaning. But that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that any championship game has to be in a big
metropolitan area, like the Rose Bowl or Stanford Stadium,''
Klompus said. ``But we think the two semifinal games would work
well in one day on one site.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's twin bill is the initial step toward that goal. The
NCAA was intrigued enough with the doubleheader idea to have
granted the Oahu Bowl a sudden, quick certification last April,
partly to see how the logistics work.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest problems for Hawaii hosting a big-time event are
the expensive, long flight from the U.S. mainland, and Aloha
Stadium, a baseball/football hybrid that seats only 50,000 and is
mostly minor-league.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of playoffs. College football doesn't
have any. While this year's Bowl Championship Series was purported
to be the closest thing to playoffs, it still isn't right, and
never can be. The BCS debates will only help the slow momentum
toward a playoff. Klompus thinks it's inevitable, and wants to be
ready.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after Washington and Miami divided the mythical
national championship, Klompus made an informal pitch to the NCAA
for the Hawaii semifinals idea _ bring the four best teams, which
would get free air fare and hotel rooms. The NCAA could keep all TV
revenues as long as it split the gate receipts with the bowl
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch was premature. It's now six years later, and the NCAA
football poohbahs still don't get it. But they will eventually,
because there's too much money to be made _ the siren song of the
NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The inadequate stadium problem remains. But if Klompus and
others get a some sort of serious nod from the NCAA, it would give
a jump start toward a better facility.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature in January for the first time provided
public funds for underwriting the bowl games. Hawaii's strong ties
with Asia also mean that a bigger stadium wouldn't have to rely
exclusively on hosting North American events.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a long shot. But when one's toes are dug into white
sand, one's ears are filled with the tinkle of ice cubes, and one's
alabaster skin is pinked by the sun, dreams come easily and often.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Friday will provide the first answer to the question
of how much pigskin and poi can be consumed locally, and
nationally, in one holiday gorge.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dollar bill an endangered species
 &HT;    For release Dec. 27, 1998.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd better become accustomed to that new funny-money-looking
$20 bill because it won't be long before you're going to have to
begin grappling with a new $1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you rarely see or use the Susan B. Anthony dollar
coin, her replacement has been decided _ and, likely, there is an
ulterior motive in issuing a new $1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   It may foretell the demise of the dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 2000 or 2001, it is estimated that the SBA coins,
which have not been minted since 1981, will be out of circulation
and the new coin established to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the size, shape and content of the coin have been
selected in addition to the person it will honor: a Native-American
woman, Sacagawea, who accompanied Lewis and Clark on their
expedition to the Pacific in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   The really bad news about this coin is that it is going to be
the same size as the SBA. That's all got to do with not having to
retool America's vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   To help avoid the continuing confusion between the quarter and
the alike-sized SBA _ a major reason the SBA was in disfavor _ the
Feds have decided to make the new coin gold-colored, although color
will not be a differentiating factor when jiggling for a coin in
your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, the government has been looking at the dollar
bill with the intention of retiring it. It has a life of only about
18 months, is easily counterfeited and is becoming more expensive
to produce. Although there is no existing legislation to do away
with the dollar bill, it is the long-range intention to do exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, will not be happy about this. A recent trip to
England, where the smallest paper currency is the five-pound note
(about $8.25) easily illustrated the discomfort of carrying around
a mess of coins in your pocket, or purse. The British have eight
denominations of coins, from the 2-pound coin down to 1-pence, with
the humongous 2-pence coin being most outrageous in size for its
worth. The 1-pound coin is thick and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   All told, a pocketful of change is weighty.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. we have six denominations of coins, although one of
them _ the 50 cents piece _ is rarely seen or used. Simply
replacing the SBA with the almost-unpronounceable Sacagawea dollar
coin is one thing; you could shun them as you did the SBA. But to
eliminate the dollar bill and make the Sacagawea the only form of
the dollar starts adding bulk beau coup to our pockets and purses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about U.S. currency is its stability in
look and size, whereas currency elsewhere is a befuddlement of
sizes and colors. Americans do not go much for change, or
international conformity. Recall, please, the effort to switch us
from feet to meters, and of how that failed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it appears we will be asked to give up one of our most
trusted forms of exchange, the dollar, the good old buck. Instead,
we will have a coin that feels like a quarter but isn't because
it's colored gold.
</P>
<P>
   I have a hunch the American public will see and use it as it did
the SBA, only when absolutely necessary _ unless the dollar bill is
done away with.
</P>
<P>
   And I also would expect that it is only a matter of time before
Native American organizations begin to agitate about the selection
of Sacagawea for the face of the coin. After all, her place in
history is that she, as Lewis and Clark's intepreter, played a
major role in bringing the white man into the Native American's
western lands, and all that happened as a result.

 &HT;    Bush: The potential presidential candidate with all the right
moves
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While official Washington slogs through the
impeachment process, uncandidate George W. Bush, officially and
unofficially, is doing the kinds of things a fellow might do if he
had a hankering to be president.
</P>
<P>
   None of the moves _ a mix of public actions that make political
advisers happy and private actions that make moms proud _ can be
offered as proof positive that Bush has decided he wants his dad's
old job. But collectively, and combined with his high name
identification and league-leading potential for raising money, they
offer plenty of fuel for political observers prone to pole vaulting
to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The official moves that could have White House overtones _ or
not _ include Monday's naming of Michael Williams, an African
American, to the Texas Railroad Commission, Bush's recent
appointment of a trusted family friend as chairman of the State
Board of Education, the naming of a Hispanic aide to the Texas
Supreme Court and what could be the first step in a
campaign-related staff shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   On the unofficial, more private side, a proud father in
Davenport, Iowa, is convinced he found evidence of a Bush
presidential campaign on his answering machine this month. For some
reason, the governor of Texas decided it was important for him to
congratulate Steve Grubbs on the birth of his fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance baby-kissing, or just a guy who remembers a
mother's lessons about thoughtfulness?
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Grubbs said, ``it was a courtesy call to the
chairman of the Iowa GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby talk over, the governor and Grubbs _ who said he'd love
to work for a Bush presidential campaign when his term as party
chairman ends this month _ talked some business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You running for president?'' Grubbs said he asked Bush, who
fields the question enough in his waking hours to hear it in his
sleep. ``He said, 'I'm seriously thinking about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs, who has seen presidential candidates come and go in
Iowa, said Bush sounds like a comer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't really know what they are getting into
when they start exploring it,'' Grubbs said. ``He knows what it
means to run for president, and he knows what it means to serve as
president. Here is a man who is not going into this thought process
blind. He knows what it is all about, and he hasn't ruled it out.
That says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Texas, insiders _ who sometimes see what they want
to see _ see a governor getting things aligned for a presidential
race. Bush, who insists no decision has been made, discounts all
the speculation as nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about it,'' Bush said of the present state of his
potential presidential candidacy. ``I'm thinking about it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also thinks he has nothing to gain by taking sides in the
current Washington fratricide, an ongoing mudfest that has many
Americans _ yet again _ looking to places like big-state capitals
for the next president.
</P>
<P>
   While one probable GOP White House contender, Steve Forbes,
jumped headfirst into the impeachment fray last week with
pro-impeachment radio ads, Bush declined to talk about what was on
the lips of everyone else in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see what happens,'' he said in his Capitol office last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid it though he might, presidential politics frequently comes
looking for Bush. If it's not reporters, it's tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope to vote for you in a couple of years,'' the Kesslers of
Olympia, Wash., recently wrote in the visitors book in the
Governor's Reception Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, run for president,'' the Enzlers of Woodbridge, Va.,
wrote in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush,'' wrote the Rowells of Baton Rouge, La., ``you
are very much needed as president of these United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, while presumably still thinking about whether he
wants to be president, Bush announced his selection of Williams to
replace Carole Keeton Rylander on the three-member Texas Railroad
Commission. Rylander was elected state comptroller last month.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he will run for the seat when it is on the ballot
in 2000, a decision that _ assuming he wins the nomination _
guarantees that Texas Republicans will have a black candidate on
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It's a significant move for a GOP governor who made
unprecedented efforts to capture African American votes this year.
Exit polls showed Bush pulled almost one-fourth of the black vote,
unprecedented for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said it ``would be inappropriate to suggest that race
played no role'' in his appointment. But so did his ties to the
Bush family. In 1980, Williams and Bush served as co-chairs of
Midland's United Way campaign. In 1990, President George Bush made
Williams assistant secretary of education for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush named family friend Chase Untermeyer as
chairman of the State Board of Education, a panel the governor
believes does not always put the best face on Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The board, including high-profile members of the Christian
Coalition, occasionally sees one-worldism and other forms of
intrusive government lurking in the public schools. Some board
members are leery of school-to-work plans, a program called Goals
2000 and other federally driven programs that critics see as
impinging on local control of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer is a card-carrying conservative, but of the
Bush-like, more pragmatic stripe. He first got mixed up in politics
as a state House member from 1977-81.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Bush, he was director of presidential personnel.
In the Reagan administration, he was assistant secretary of the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Now director of government affairs for Compaq Computer Corp. in
Houston, Untermeyer insists he and the governor have not chatted
about the overlap of the State Board of Education and a race for
president.
</P>
<P>
   He discounts insider talk that his job is to push hard on the
rudder to steer the board toward the middle and away from
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any marching orders like that,'' he said. ``And
I'm not sure how any one person could throw a blanket of silence on
14 very able, energetic people, all of whom have won election in
districts with over a million people in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff, travel and rumors
</P>
<P>
   Other personnel moves that could be interpreted as good state
government or White House-related include the shuffling of State
Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer to a new senior adviser post in
the governor's office and the appointment of former Bush aide and
former Secretary of State Al Gonzales to the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists who see a presidential race lurking behind
every Bush move see Bomer winding up as the governor's chief of
staff when, and if, Chief of Staff Joe Allbaugh heads over to get a
White House race on track.
</P>
<P>
   Even faraway job moves have been spun into White House-related
rumors. Earlier this month, Bush insisted he had nothing to do with
Condoleeza Rice's resignation as provost at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who was a national security adviser to President Bush, has
talked with the younger Bush about those kinds of issues. But
``there was nothing formal,'' she said. There are no immediate
plans for her to join a Bush campaign, Rice said, but she did not
rule out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip last month to Israel also pumped up the presidential
talk and was billed by some as a governor in search of instant
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, Bush entertained a guest last week whose name
also carries potential presidential race connections. Brad Freeman,
a Los Angeles investment banker and longtime Bush friend, spent the
night of Dec. 16 at the Governor's Mansion. Though not the subject
of a news release, Freeman's visit was not exactly maintained as a
state secret. He was there the night of Bush's annual holiday party
for the press.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Freeman was host of a Los Angeles lunch that raised
more than $500,000 for Bush, showing off a talent that could come
in handy for a guy running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Freeman's visit had any kind of political
overtones, Bush replied, ``that's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of signal
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists all the speculation, tea-leaf reading and
old-fashioned rumormongering amount to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision-making process is under way, but the governor says
he has reached no conclusion. Now working toward next month's
inaugural and state of the state speeches that will draw national
attention, Bush says he knows he will have to give some kind of
signal soon, perhaps as early as February, as to whether he wants
to follow his dad in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The most common signal is the exploratory committee, set up,
ostensibly, to explore. History is short on folks who formed an
exploratory committee, explored and then reported finding little
interest in candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is running,'' CBS's Dan Rather said matter-of-factly in a
recent column. ``He may get knocked out along the way, or he may
yet decide to pull out. But his campaign is already formed,
well-financed and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, there is no such thing as the George W. Bush for
President Committee. His gubernatorial re-election campaign has
morphed into an inaugural committee, raising money and making plans
for the Jan. 19 event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush discounts comments like Rather's as uninformed patter from
folks who can't imagine there is a big-state governor who might not
want to be a big-nation president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand about me: If I choose not to run for
president, I won't think anything less of myself,'' he said last
month. ``I'm comfortable with who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, there is at least one politically connected dad willing
to do anything to help make Bush comfortable with the concept of
life in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have named him Jared Bush Grubbs,'' Grubbs said
of his son, Jared Reagan Grubbs.

 &HT;    Internet pigs: Your kind of web site has arrived
 &HT;    By Howie Paul Hartnett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's got a pig picture gallery. It's got
Paul Thompson's views on the benefits of playing music for pigs.
It's even got a little section on pig humor.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to www.pigfarmer.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-month-old site was set up by Thompson's daughter and
son-in-law in response to the Stuart, Fla. pig farmer's continuing
problems with his golf community neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that everybody involved thought we should
do,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Club officials have complained to the county and Martin
County's sheriff's office several times that the music and stench
emanating from the Thompson homestead is disrupting business.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Club and a resident filed suit against Thompson
and fellow swine farmer Thomas Rossano, claiming the country music
the two play for their pigs was too loud under the county's new
noise ordinance. County commissioners muffled loud activities in
October, but the ordinance exempts farms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rossano has been ordered by Judge Larry Schack to turn
down his music, and Florida Club attorneys expect to bring Thompson
to trial in June.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Thompson is using his website to solicit
information about playing music for animals and garner support. So
far, he's received overwhelming amounts of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a person in this country that we've talked to in
the past year that didn't have the same comment, `But you were
there first,' '' Thompson said. ``(The Florida Club) has just done
all the underhanded stuff they can to get me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The site isn't just getting raves from supporters. It's also
gotten some official kudos. America Online spotlighted the site in
November and ranked it No. 2 among the five websites reviewed each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's lawyer doesn't see anything wrong with the site. In
fact, Stuart attorney Lance Richard wants to see some improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him about posting some of the information about
the litigation,'' Richard said. ``He's interested in gathering
information from other people in similar situations.''
</P>
<P>
   A few have been close, but not exactly the same, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy who said, `My brother has a horse farm and he
plays music for his horses,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no other musically inclined swine have stepped forward yet.
It's not because Thompson hasn't been asking.
</P>
<P>
   Since being sued, Thompson has talked to newspaper and
television reporters in 47 states. He also has been on radio
programs in England and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   His message is simple: When you give up your rights, you give up
your freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are using our civil court system and out
taxpayers' money to sue me,'' he said.

 &HT;    One of Ireland's 'Banished babies' on search of his life
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Between 1949 and 1973, at least 2,200
babies born to unwed mothers are known to have been spirited out of
Ireland and adopted to families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many birth records were altered and many intentionally
misplaced. Church and state acknowledge they conspired to keep the
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that to have a child out of wedlock in
Catholic Ireland back in the '50s was the most heinous thing you
could do,'' says Bill Neylon. ``It was considered shameful and
despicable. It was a mortal sin in the eyes of the government as
well as the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Neylon, a 44-year-old West Palm Beach physical trainer, was one
of the 2,200 who would become known as the ``banished babies'' of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up with an Irish-American family in Chicago. He was told
his birth parents had died, and he had been adopted out of an
orphanage in Roscrea, Tipperary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can try to stuff anything they want under the carpet, but
an adopted child grows up with questions,'' Neylon says. ``We don't
want to tear open anybody's family. We just want to know. I had a
chapter of my life missing, and I had a burning desire to learn
about my heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 20, that desire led Neylon to southern Ireland and
the convent at Sean Ross Abbey where he had been told his life
began. A nun met him at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is the birthing room,'' she told him. ``Here is the
chapel. This is where your mother had you baptized when you were
five days old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean,'' he asked, ``my mother was alive?''
</P>
<P>
   The nun bristled and quickly recanted. She said Neylon's mother
had probably died after his baptism, or perhaps moved to Australia.
Even if she were alive, there was no way she could ever be found,
he was assured.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years, Neylon grudgingly accepted that part of himself
might forever remain a mystery. Then last year he was training two
clients from Dublin at the gym where he works on Palm Beach Lakes
Boulevard. They encouraged him to search again, and within two
months he had Kevin Cooney on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney, 30, with 18 other volunteers, works for the Adopted
Peoples' Association of Ireland, a Dublin group that seeks to
reunite birth mothers with their lost children. The movement for a
national reconciliation was energized by Mike Milotte, a reporter
with the Irish TV network, who two years ago wrote Banished Babies:
The Secret History of Ireland's Baby Export Business.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney, a secretary to an Irish Parliament member, has assisted
in some 50 reunions between adopted Americans and their natural
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assume everything you've been told about your adoption to be a
lie,'' Cooney told Neylon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to find my mother to tell her I love her,'' Neylon told
him. ``I want to tell her I turned out all right. I want to tell
her that I know it was very difficult for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Neylon was instructed to request from the Irish government a
copy of his birth certificate, a document he had been told did not
exist. He mailed off $15 and a month later, a paper written in
English and Irish was delivered to his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what it said. `Mother: Nora Fitzpatrick.'
Until then, she had been a figment _ an abstraction. Suddenly she
had a name. Nora.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooney researched records this spring and found eight Nora
Fitzpatricks who might have been Neylon's mother. The most likely
was in Cahirciveen, Kerry, a town of 1,200 on the southwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Neylon carried on research himself in West Palm Beach. He
learned that a musical duo from Cahirciveen was playing at O'Shea's
Pub on Clematis Street. After a set, Neylon approached one of the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I about knocked him off his trolley when I asked him about
Cahirciveen,'' he said. ``It's such a little place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you've got a Kerry man's face,'' the musician told him.
``To find your family, you need to look up Mike the Yank.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike the Yank is Michael Murphy, the county's genealogist who
lived 20 years in the United States before retiring to Ireland.
Cooney contacted Murphy, who immediately identified ``Paddy Fitz''
as the head of the Fitzpatrick family in Cahirciveen. Patrick
Fitzpatrick was a 67-year-old master carpenter who had lived a
dozen years in the Bronx. He was Nora's oldest brother.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Neylon flew to Ireland, and with Cooney and Mike the
Yank, knocked on Paddy Fitz's door.
</P>
<P>
   What was the name on the birth certificate, Fitzpatrick wanted
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Joseph Mary Fitzpatrick,'' Neylon told him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a critical point of detail. In 1954, all Irish babies
born in convents were given ``Mary'' as a middle name in honor of
the blessed virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some time during the night,'' said Cooney, ``the penny
dropped. We won them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick agreed to call Nora but worried about how she would
take the news. She was living in England and consumed in sorrow,
mourning her husband who died six weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Paddy handed me the phone, I could hardly talk,'' Neylon
said. ``I said, `Hello, Nora.' She said, `Hello, son.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzpatricks then took Neylon to his grandparents' graves
and to the small farmhouse where his mother grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed this was the highest compliment they could pay me,''
Neylon said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Neylon flew to England and met Nora at the airport
gate. He took her a single red rose, and she, a slight woman,
barely 5-foot-3, held a handwritten sign with his name.
</P>
<P>
   She was 18 when she last saw him, 16 when he was born. Nora and
Neylon's father, who died many years ago, went separate ways long
before adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were screaming when the nun came to take you out of my
arms,'' she told him. ``They brought me into a room with two
priests and a solicitor. I signed my name three times and that was
it. You were gone. You had such beautiful curls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora had believed her son had been killed in the Vietnam War, as
``so many American boys were.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters will be exchanged regularly until their next visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is all about God's impeccable timing,'' Neylon
said. ``He brought me into Nora's life after she'd lost her
husband. All the Masses she had said for him _ this was God's
answer.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ When she went to the drug store last spring for

   ``The people all knew me at the drug store, so I had a fit right
there at the counter,'' Gamsu recalled Tuesday. ``'What the heck is
going on here?!' This was a generic drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The indignation of Gamsu and countless other lorazepam customers
will surface in court through lawsuits filed by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission and 10 state attorneys general, including Ohio's.
Ohio is seeking to recoup $7 million in Medicaid expenses and
unspecified millions more on behalf of individual consumers and
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The separate suits allege price-fixing by lorazepam's
manufacturer, Mylan Laboratories of Pittsburgh, its supplier and
two distributors. They are based on a nine-month FTC investigation
that charges Mylan forced competitors out of the market by reaching
agreements with the other companies that gave Mylan the only
reliable sources of the active ingredients for lorazepam and
clorazepate, another anti-anxiety drug.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan officials have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve of that company,'' said Gamsu, a Medicare
beneficiary in Clayton who's on disability with Crohn's disease, an
intestinal disorder. She said she spends $4,000 a year
out-of-pocket on prescription drugs, and although it hurts her
pocketbook, ``I'm lucky. There are so many people that obviously
had to go off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While state and federal government sources said the price
increases were more than 2,000 percent, a local pharmacist and
health plan administrator put the actual cost to consumers in the
500-600 percent range. Even so, the increase caused an aberrational
hike of 0.2 percent last May in the Producer Price Index, a federal
tool for measuring inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a pharmacist have to become a commodities broker,
buying large supplies before the price goes higher,'' said Rich
Gunza, the Dayton executive director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Lorazepam probably was underpriced before the increase,
Kettering pharmacist Terrell Mundhenk said, ``but going up 500
percent instantly? That's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the generic now costs more than 80 percent as much as
the brand name, Ativan, which accounts for nearly 17 million U.S.
prescriptions a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And generic manufacturers aren't incurring research costs or
clinical trials or anything else that the brand name incurs,''
Gunza said. ``The purpose of a generic drug is to provide high
quality without the expenses that go into marketing a new drug. If
generic houses are getting into the mind-set that they can charge
almost as much as brand names, that's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-anxiety drugs are available as generics, but Mundhenk
said doctors often prefer lorazepam because it leaves the
bloodstream after 4-6 hours, as opposed to 12-24 hours for Valium
and others. Gamsu said she can take it only as needed without any
feelings of withdrawal on other days.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers of the drugs won't be able to contact the state about
restitution until after the lawsuit is decided or settled, said
spokesman Chris Davey for attorney general Betty Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort is to get the money back,'' Davey said, ``and in
doing so, attempt to prevent these and other companies from doing
these things in the future.

 &HT;    Logging on to future can be stressful
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For small businesses, the Internet is a lot like
stepping up to the blackjack table in Vegas. You place your bet,
cross your fingers and take your chances.
</P>
<P>
   Many entrepreneurs figure they need to be on the Internet
because everyone is telling them so. But going online isn't cheap,
and the payoffs often are unclear at best.
</P>
<P>
   So why even bother?
</P>
<P>
   With global electronic commerce expected to top $220 billion and
as the percentage of people who will buy and sell goods online
grows to about 40 percent by 2001, the Internet has become the
ultimate shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet's like a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week retail
store,'' said Larry Bohn, chief executive of net.Genesis, a
Cambridge, Mass., firm that helps companies evaluate their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But to cash in, you've got to log on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake any small business can make is to think
this thing will go away and ignore it,'' says Jeffrey Kagan, an
Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst. ``The old way of doing
business won't go away. But this new channel _ the Internet and
electronic commerce _ is going to be as important for delivering
products to the marketplace as the invention of the automobile was
100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, small-business owners have embraced the
Internet in a big way. The U.S. Small Business Administration
estimates that millions of small-business owners _ ranging from
one-person shops to home-based businesses _ are online.
</P>
<P>
   But most aren't taking full advantage of the Internet, largely
because they're confused about how it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's fear and misunderstanding and not knowing how to
go about it,'' says Diane Gannon, Washington-based manager of the
SBA's Internet Services division.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Chamber of Commerce/IBM study of 1,000 companies found
that firms using the Internet have been on it less than two years.
Most were using it for e-mail or research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they're taking small steps onto the Net,'' says
Brian Meincke, director of small- and medium-business development
for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the study's biggest surprises, Meincke said, was that
most small-business owners relied on family or friends for
information on technology. He also noted that many small businesses
haven't made provisions for technology in their business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's study for Enterprise Magazine, a publication
for small-business owners, had similar findings: Younger companies
were more likely to use the Internet, and companies less than a
year old were more likely to have Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost 1999, and I'm seriously amazed that there are
businesses who aren't on the Internet,'' said Entrepreneur
editorial director Rieva Lesonsky. Lesonsky says she repeatedly
encounters small-business owners who say they see no value in being
on the Internet. She recently chastised the holdouts in a column in
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are serious about growing the business, you cannot do
it unless you have a Net presence, whether that's for e-commerce or
just using it for sales and advertising and marketing,'' Lesonsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Danger for holdouts
</P>
<P>
   For many Internet holdouts like Frank Momodu, it's simply a
question of time. ``I haven't been able to find the time to find
out how it would exactly benefit my business yet,'' said Momodu,
owner of Lennox Limousine in Atlanta. But Momodu and others may not
be able to avoid it much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is fast becoming as indispensable as the telephone, and
small businesses working without a Net run the risk of losing
clients or market share to Web-savvy competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you want to do business with the federal
government in the future, for instance, you're likely going to have
to plead your case and place your bids for contracts online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to put RFPs (request for proposal) online.
Those are actual bids,'' said Gannon at SBA, which gets about 3
million weekly hits on its Web site. The SBA also has an online
procurement network called PRO-NET.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ranging from BellSouth to IBM to American Express and
Online Office Supplies Co. are going after small firms with
offerings aimed at making their introduction to the Internet smooth
and trauma-free.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth alone estimates 260,000 of its small-business
customers will go online before the close of this year. It offers
software and Web sites to help customers build their own Web sites.
A whole subculture of Internet consultants has sprung up, offering
workshops promising to make the online venture a profitable one.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, small-business owners can use the Internet to
``research a competitor, do statistical analysis, find out how
(customers) are using your services and whether you have the
products or services customers need,'' Gannon said. ``And it's
instant feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the Internet gold rush for everyone? And how realistic
are small-business owners?
</P>
<P>
   For entrepreneurs like Cathy Cunningham Hays and John Landstrom,
the Net is a natural, according to experts. The two metro Atlanta
business owners offer hard-to-find items. Cunningham Hays has a
gourmet snack food company. Landstrom sells BMW motorcycles. Both
have gotten online inquiries from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a big company. You just have to have
something that specialized and of value,'' Bohn of net.Genesis
said. ``The Internet gives you a way to get to a much, much wider
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempering expectations
</P>
<P>
   But Internet and small-business experts caution those who
venture online shouldn't expect sales to skyrocket overnight, nor
should they look at the Internet as the cure-all for existing
business problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their thought about getting business on the Internet is a lot
like Alice in Wonderland,'' said Jerry Chautin, who counsels small
business online as a volunteer with the Atlanta chapter of Service
Corps of Retired Executives. ``They think they can put a Web page
up there and business will come. It doesn't work like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chautin cited the popular Amazon.com to make his case.
``Amazon.com is a glaring example of getting a lot of traffic and
not making a profit,'' he said. ``They're spending all of their
revenues to get traffic to their Web site. I think a Web site is
important to give them (small businesses) credibility in today's
world. But if they don't have more traditional ways of generating
business, they're not going to make it. If they're in retail, they
need to open a store. If they're a service business, they have to
go out and bang on the door to get sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Large corporate counterparts can write off Internet losses and
move on. When companies such as Macy's or Barnes and Noble go
online, their sheer size enables them to take risks most small
businesses can't afford. Losing $10,000 on an Internet venture
won't break Federated Department Stores, but it could bankrupt many
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses can still use the Web to establish credibility
and showcase their goods and services. The Web can give a lot, but
you can also lose a lot. The Internet itself probably won't make
you rich, but it might be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big fallacy if you think you're going to make all this
money overnight by having a Web site. It doesn't work that way,''
says Debra Dixon-Stringer, a Decatur-based computer and Internet
consultant who has worked with hundreds of small businesses in the
last four years helping them design Web pages and market their
business on the Internet.

 &HT;    Barnes `dedicated' to Y2K preparations
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov.-elect Roy Barnes has already tackled what may be
his administration's biggest problem, Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who will be inaugurated Jan. 11, discussed the
Millennium Bug recently at his transition office in the state
capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appropriated $152 million last year,'' Barnes said, noting
there's ``a request for a little over $200 million additional
money'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dedicated to making sure that there are sufficient
resources allocated for this problem,'' Barnes added. Y2K ``will be
the highest single figure in the supplemental budget'' that Barnes
will send to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here,'' Barnes said, ``the first person I met with
was'' Michael Hale, Georgia's chief information officer and project
manager for Y2K. ``I spent about half a day with him. He's done a
grading system and a time line for every department, so I can keep
up with where we are. And I've reviewed every department.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said someone from his transition office talks to Hale
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said, in a November interview, the state's mission-critical
systems should be compliant March 31.
</P>
<P>
   But it's evident that much needs to be done. The state's
Department of Administrative Services, for instance, maintains 191
different computer software programs, 89 of which are mission
critical. Just 30 were compliant in early November.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Barnes said he asks department heads is, ```Are you
going to make your Y2K deadline?' They tell me, `Yes.' I tell them,
`Listen, there will be repercussions in your job if you don't make
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Barnes followed up with a memo to state department
heads, reiterating the state's ``Y2K efforts have entered a
critical phase requiring our immediate and constant attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The state doesn't as yet have a contingency plan for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're talking about now and trying to get
full information about what other states are doing and what
coordination exists between the federal and state governments. We
generally have a contingency plan for every emergency. Y2K and what
it might affect are what we're reviewing now,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a problem. I can't tell you if it's overblown. I
can tell you this: We're going to plan and do whatever is necessary
_ considering worst-case scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that worries Barnes is lack of public awareness and
the potential for the public to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to raise consciousness about this problem,''
he said. ``It's like (Donald) Ratajczak (of the Georgia State
Economic Forecasting Unit) says, 'If you understand the importance
of the problem, you'll probably make whatever efforts are necessary
to address it. But if you're not cognizant of the problem, that may
be the biggest problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   To check the state's the progress, go to Georgia's Y2K Web site
(http://www.year2000.state.ga.us).

 &HT;    Employee leasing gains popularity
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ McNairs Appliance Co.'s 35 workers wear uniforms
emblazoned with the McNairs name and drive McNairs trucks as they
deliver new washers and refrigerators to homes throughout Central
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But technically, they get their benefits _ and paychecks _ from
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   That's because 59-year-old McNairs is part of one of the latest
trends in small-business management _ employee leasing.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the way large corporations are choosing to rid
themselves of non-core parts of their business, small businesses
such as McNairs are increasingly turning to outside companies for
human resources services that can also help them compete for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years, McNairs employees have been co-employed
by the Austin appliance company and by Administaff Inc., a
so-called Professional Employer Organization, based near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McNair, president of McNairs, also is technically a leased
employee. He said employee leasing has unburdened him of keeping up
with federal and state regulations, eliminated the yearly chore of
rebidding his company's medical and workers' compensation insurance
and allowed McNairs to offer better benefits than he could
previously. Through McNairs relationship with Administaff, the
appliance company also can tap into a plethora of human resources
services _ ranging from criminal background checks to employee
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even large corporations are farming out parts of their
businesses that didn't make sense for them to do. This is basically
the same thing,'' McNair said. ``Basically, I'm farming out a human
resources department and payroll department.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Administaff, which has an agreement with Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, McNairs offers its employees a full range of medical
plans, as well as vision and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't cost me less, but it's much better insurance
than we had before, much more comprehensive,'' McNair said.
Depending on what they need, however, some small-business owners
may not find it advantageous to pay the extra fee or may dislike
how it changes parts of the employee relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At McNairs, for example, Administaff's fee runs roughly 3
percent of payroll, or $1,800 on its $60,000 biweekly payroll. That
doesn't include what the appliance company also pays for health
insurance, workers compensation insurance and payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman DeBusk, owner of DeBusk Electric Co. in Austin, said he
looked into employee leasing a year ago and decided it wasn't for
him. He said he was concerned about his potential liability as a
licensed commercial electrical contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up quite a bit of control,'' he said. ``I didn't like
it. They didn't offer enough benefits to change. I like owning and
controlling my own company entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee leasing companies can also require clients to adhere
strictly to employment laws. At McNairs, for example, Administaff
requires the appliance company to use its employment application
forms and makes employees provide proof of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 189 companies that are licensed to offer staff
leasing. Along with Adminstaff, several companies _ including some
based in other states _ do business in Austin. Texas began
licensing the companies in September 1993, becoming the second
state to do so, because of complaints about the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ketchum, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Licensing
and Regulation, said the agency handled about 50 complaints on
about staff leasing companies last year. He said most related to
unlicensed companies and insurance complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has the potential for serious growth.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates there are more
than 6 million small companies with fewer than 500 employees. Of
that group, only 180,000 companies _ less than 3 percent _ lease
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically at the stage where it has reached a critical
mass, and it's really starting to proliferate,'' said Paul Sarvadi,
chief executive of Administaff.

 &HT;    All I want for Christmas is . . .
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I had a great time in the supermarket
the other day. Waiting for my husband to pick up an item, I parked
our basket in front of a display of dolls. Each of the little
creatures _ identical except for colors of clothes and skin _
represented a 3-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   To check out the cuddle factor, I poked one through the
cellophane of the box. To my delight, she spoke. Actually, she
commanded: ``Touch my foot.'' When I obeyed, she directed me to
touch other appendages. I probably would still be poking her body
parts had my husband not returned and dragged me into the checkout
line.
</P>
<P>
   How different today's dolls are from the one I knew as a child.
I speak literally, for, from my earliest memory, I had one doll. I
played house with her, but ours was a love-hate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must picture this doll, whom I secretly called ``Miz
Pellum.'' She was indeed a ``baby'' doll, for, with a
synthetic-paste body molded in a rigid seated position, she was
designed to represent an infant. Her hair was a mass of brown curls
_ painted on in circular swirls. Her face was also painted on. She
had no movable eyes (like the doll of the girl next door), no open
lips, no pearly teeth peeking forth to form a smile.
</P>
<P>
   No. Miz Pellum's facial expression was as placid and
expressionless as a figure of Buddha. Indeed, had I known such a
personage existed, I might have named my doll after him. But I
didn't. I did, however, know a Miz Pellum.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever my grandmother needed more eggs than our chickens
produced, she went to visit Miz Pellum. The plump, petite white
woman raised ducks and chickens on the bank next to a drainage
stream. She always sat just inside her screen door. Though blind,
she could identify people by their steps. Without rising, she would
greet my grandmother by name and invite us into her house.
</P>
<P>
   After Grandma Annie explained what we had come for, Miz Pellum
would count out the eggs from a bowl in the middle of the kitchen
table and accept the money. Transaction completed, she would return
to her seat. All the while, her facial expression remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   So, my expressionless doll, fused in a seated position, became
Miz Pellum. Studies have been done on the effects of black kids
playing with white dolls, but I don't think I suffered any
permanent damage. I simply longed for a soft doll that would yield
to my touch or one that cried when patted on the back or one whose
eyes moved or that had a rubber body I could bathe.
</P>
<P>
   So, each year, I wished for a new doll, pointing out my choices
in the Sears Christmas catalog every November. And every December,
I fought reality with denial as I heard the treadle of the sewing
machine pumping away after I had gone to bed. Mama would be sewing
little garments: a new dress, underwear and a bonnet for Miz
Pellum. Sometime before Christmas Eve, the old clothes would be
washed and ironed and put into a shoebox. As if delivered by Santa,
Miz Pellum would be dressed in the new outfit and placed under the
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   There would be other gifts: skates one year, a bicycle another,
puzzles and books. But always and forever pink, Miz Pellum reigned
over the lot, impassively staring ahead. The only permanent trauma
to my psyche I can attribute to her presence is a fascination with
dolls. I bought them for my daughter long after she became an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Watching antiques experts assess the value of old toys on PBS,
I've wondered how much Miz Pellum would be worth today had I kept
her. I will never know. One summer day, when I was 10 or 11, my
younger cousin came to visit. I let her play outside with Miz
Pellum. When a sudden shower came up, my cousin ran inside and left
my doll outside in the rain. I found her hours later, her fat,
little plastic body puckered and blistered, her stolid face
unrecognizable. I said I didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I went to bed and cried.

 &HT;    Kenneth Starr should've investigated further
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If Clinton had lied about eating Mexican food,
would it be perjury?
</P>
<P>
   That's the philosophical tortilla my Bubbaland pea brain has
been chewing on ever since I saw a funny new T-shirt that's selling
like fajitas here.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheek shirt, available at Chuy's restaurants in
Austin and around the state, shows a cartoon of the president
wagging his finger. In the bubble, the president is saying, ``I did
not have Tex-Mex with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuy's, with restaurants in Austin, Dallas, Arlington, Houston
and San Antonio, has sold right at 1,000 of these T-shirts in about
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's just suppose for argument's sake that the statement on
the T-shirt is bull tweedle, and that the president did indeed
have, you know, just Tex-Mexual relations with that woman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current thinking in the House of Representatives,
would the president lying under oath about having Tex-Mex with that
woman amount to perjury? Would it be grounds for impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Sure it would, since Mexican food is as important as sex. And I
know that's true, from looking at some of the lard behinds on
y'all.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can bust Clinton for lying about sex, surely you could
bust him for lying about Tex- Mex, right?
</P>
<P>
   I can hear you Republicans whining now. You're saying, ``Kelso,
you're a bowl of queso short of a Number One Dinner. That Tex -Mex
question is stupid. Kenneth Starr wouldn't ask the president if he
had Tex-Mex with that woman, or anybody else, because it doesn't
make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   You're telling me Tex-Mex isn't as important as sex? What part
of Nuevo Yorko did you just move here from?
</P>
<P>
   So if Kenneth Starr can badger the president about his sex life,
why shouldn't he bother him about lunch?
</P>
<P>
   You tell me. Which is more critical to the future of this
Republic? Hanky panky or a good plate of migas?
</P>
<P>
   I say it's a two-way tie for first place. A dead heat. Although
you could make the case that Tex-Mex is easier to deal with than
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our enchiladas never get a headache,'' said Mike Young, one of
Chuy's owners. And after you're finished with a tamale, it doesn't
get half of everything, either.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton detractors are constantly pointing out that it doesn't
matter what the president was lying about. What matters, they
argue, is that he lied under oath _ period. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. My point exactly. So I can imagine Starr going after
Clinton for lying about Tex-Mex, since sex and Tex-Mex share many
similarities:
</P>
<P>
   You never hear anybody complaining about getting too much of
either.
</P>
<P>
   After you get started, they both take about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Both can earn an X rating based on amount of heat.
</P>
<P>
   It's best if neither is served overly greasy.
</P>
<P>
   Either goes well with a margarita. But if you have more than
three, it'll screw up your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Having too much of either can make you feel guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you just have to go back for seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, you figure you ought to branch out and try
another place. But you'll get better service if you stick to the
same establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, sitting there waiting for it to show up at your table
is better than when it actually gets there.

 &HT;    Life sweet after lungtransplant: `I like ordinary'
 &HT;    By Shannon Colavecchio
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wake up. Take a long, deep breath. Go to
work. Come home. Spend time with wife and dogs. Fall asleep with
quiet, easy breaths. Repeat every day for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Dull? Monotonous? Not if you're a 28-year-old still getting used
to two new lungs. Not if you're breathing easily for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you're Leland Herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't like the ordinary patterns of life,''
said Herring as he briskly walked the grounds of Wellington
Christian School, where, at 5-feet-4 and 112 pounds (``Enough not
to blow away in strong winds!''), he has gone from being ``The
World's Smallest Gym Teacher'' to ``The World's Smallest Chapel
Coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like ordinary, because I've never had it this way before. It
was always one chaotic moment to the next chaotic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I wake up, I go to work, I come home. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice because before the doctors at Duke University Medical
Center gave him the lungs of a 13-year-old shooting victim on April
26, Herring's days centered around hourlong ``therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice a day, every day without fail, ever since he could
remember, Leland Herring would lie down with his feet elevated
while someone vibrated his chest until he could cough up the mucous
and phlegm that kept him from breathing normally _ trademarks of
the cystic fibrosis he inherited from his parents, both symptomless
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our life before,'' says 23-year-old Melissa Herring,
who has been pounding and vibrating Leland's chest every morning
and evening since they started dating five years ago. ``It was wake
up, do therapy. Come home, do therapy. We tried not to let life
revolve around it, but it did. (The transplant) was, like,
liberating!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leland Herring doesn't have to schedule dinner around
therapy. He doesn't get winded after walking up a flight of stairs.
The oxygen tank is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been cured. My life is very easy compared to
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He can take out the trash, mow the lawn and go for long walks
with Melissa. And he can breathe without even trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets to do the masculine `husband' things now,'' says
Melissa, married to Leland for three years a week ago today. ``A
year ago, he never would have been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   His lung capacity was about 15 percent before the transplant,
``and they stopped testing me because they couldn't even finish the
test, I was so weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was at 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal is 80 to 100 percent,'' he proudly explains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are things to remind Leland Herring of the CF that
remains in his body: It is hard to digest some foods. Every
morning, he has to weigh himself and take his blood pressure and
temperature. He writes it all down and gives the reports to the
doctors at Duke and St. Mary's Cystic Fibrosis Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   He takes 30 pills a day, including Cyclosporin, Prednisone and
Imuran to keep his body from rejecting the foreign lungs. Then
there are the pills to combat the side effects _ irritability,
nervousness and sensitivity, warts, high blood pressure, vitamin
depletion _ of the antirejection drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a connoisseur of fine pills,'' he smiles, massaging his
goatee and holding up one bottle like it's a vintage wine. A shelf
in his garage holds dozens of bottles and packets of pills, big and
small, square and round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't go down smooth, I don't like 'em. But it sure
beats the heck out of the therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Leland and Melissa are back at Duke for a two-hour
checkup, the third since the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   He will be there ``every three months for the rest of my life,''
getting his blood gases tested, taking X-rays and breathing for the
doctors. Doctors gave him a 40 to 50 percent chance of living four
to five years, admitting they are unsure whether the CF will infect
his new lungs.
</P>
<P>
   He and Melissa are staying with friend and fellow CF patient
Bret Weinstein, 19, of Palm Beach, who is awaiting his own set of
new lungs. Weinstein got married in May. He took his oxygen tank
with him down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, Leland's lungs finally got so bad he and
Melissa moved from their Royal Palm Beach home to a Durham, N.C.,
efficiency apartment. There, they waited near the Duke transplant
team for new lungs _ more specifically, small lungs with Leland's
Type A blood.
</P>
<P>
   After two false starts, and just when doctors said he couldn't
wait much longer, he got The Call. And just after 9:30 p.m. on
April 26, Leland began life with good lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Is he worried about his lungs giving out in five years?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because it's a heck of a lot better than a month!'' he
says, slapping his desk in Wellington Christian's P.E. storage room
for emphasis. ``I said, `I'll take five years.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks he'll get more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of transplant recipients have rejection or
infection within the first 45 days. Doctors at Duke thought Leland
Herring would fall into that group because he had a ``bug,''
Burholderia cepacia, that was resistant to antibiotics. The doctors
were so worried, they almost didn't perform the operation.
</P>
<P>
   But an antibiotic cocktail from Toronto Medical Center fought
the bug, which doctors can't find anywhere in Leland's compact
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's surprising everybody,'' remarks Wellington Christian
headmaster Doug McLaughlin, who hired the 1992 Palm Beach Atlantic
College graduate three years ago. ``His health is even stronger
than it was when he first started working here.''
</P>
<P>
   He works all day around children, but he hasn't been sick once
since school started in August.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Herring, now the school's chapel coordinator and ``Mr.
Miscellaneous, the Spiritual Guru _ I go wherever they need me,''
spends his days planning chapel programs and counseling the kids
who need special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just seemed to work out well, putting him in front of the
children and letting him serve as an inspiration,'' McLaughlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Leland Herring, talking about the future, about maybe
adopting a child, about taking long trips far from hospitals, about
getting recertified so he can teach in a classroom again. But he
hasn't forgotten where he was eight months ago and how close he
came to dying.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a pastor at Wellington Church _ looking almost
guilty as he said it _ told Leland he had his eulogy written.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `I wrote it when you left for Duke.' So I told him,
`That's OK, I'm going to make a video for the funeral soon.' What's
gotten me this far is Jesus, and I want that to be what's gotten
across at my funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is, I've outlived people I thought were
healthier than me. But they were angry at God, and I'm not angry at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to die. The question is, are you ready to meet
your maker? I was, and I am. I was ready to die, but I'm ready to
breathe, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32nd annual ``65 Roses Gala,'' to benefit the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation, will be Jan. 9 at 7 p.m. at The Breakers in
Palm Beach.

 &HT;    Life in Washington couldn't get weirder
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Send in Bruce Willis! Could this be anything but
the political apocalypse, the Beltway Armageddon?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the omens:
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt as Deep Throat. It was Hustler magazine, not The
Washington Post, that hounded House Speaker-designate Bob
Livingston from his post.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde as the Enforcer of Conscience. This is the same man
who, during the Iran-Contra scandal, bashed those who sermonized
about how terrible lying is and complained that ``it just seems to
me too simplistic'' to condemn all lying.
</P>
<P>
   The President, already in trouble for his, er, poor impulse
control, bombs Iraq on the eve of his impeachment vote. The news
toggles back and forth between Iraq and impeachment. Meanwhile, the
President's job-approval ratings soar to a record 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Do you wonder if you died and are spending the afterlife in a
Fellini movie? Could it get any weirder? I spent Saturday curiously
detached, not turning on the TV. Yet when our friend The Bearer of
Bad Tidings arrived with the expected news _ two counts _ I erupted
in anger: ``They stole our vote! They acted from Clinton's first
day in office as if it were an outrage against humanity that a
Democrat was elected and they were going to do whatever it took to
get him out of office! They stole our vote!'' Muttering something
about the evils of ``partisan politics,'' my friend beat a hasty
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In a calmer mood, I hosted a small dinner party that night. My
friend the Bringer of Wine provided the first post-impeachment
laugh by taping a new label to the bottle of merlot: ``Bob
Livingston Whine: If I quit, he should too. Potomac River Valley.
1998.''
</P>
<P>
   He was angry too. We talked about the hypocrisy of a Congress
that shows by its own posturing that Clinton's behavior doesn't
meet the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors: ``Just act a
little more remorseful, Mr. President, tell us you did it, but
you're really, really sorry, and we won't impeach you.'' If the
President is guilty of an impeachable offense, it shouldn't matter
if he wears a hair shirt and sings Gregorian chants for a month.
</P>
<P>
   We sipped our Bob Livingston Whine and vented and laughed. And
vowed to keep hopeful. It has been, as the Queen might say, an
``annus horribilis'' year in Washington. The President acted
disgracefully and lied about it for seven months. The halls of
Congress reek of sexual McCarthyism and poisonous partisanship. Our
representatives refer to each other as ``gentleman'' while hissing
like cobras.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we still can hope that American democracy will rise from the
ashes of this debacle, stronger than ever. That we will become more
engaged and alert citizens, and our Congress more civil, more
productive, less partisan.
</P>
<P>
   My friend the Student of History, in fact, is downright cheerful
about last week's events. They only prove that those guys who wrote
the Constitution are ``the minds of the Millennium.'' Andrew
Johnson's impeachment was also ferociously partisan, he points out
_ even worse, because Johnson hadn't done anything wrong. The
democracy survived, the scandal all but forgotten. Now our
president has been impeached in the middle of an airstrike, the
probable Speaker of the House goes down in flames, and people
aren't rioting in the streets. They're not firing howitzers into
the Kremlin. Folks are singing Christmas carols and happily doing
their shopping. All is well; the system is stronger than we
realized; the Constitution works.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quite work myself up to ``cheerful,'' or much past
bitter and disillusioned, but the Student of History has a point.
Send back Bruce Willis. The events of the past week are not, after
all, political Armageddon. They are a reminder of what we have, and
how we should all be better stewards of it.

 &HT;    Wholesale displeasure: Columnist rings up many complaints by
retail workers
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``It's obvious you have never worked in retail,''
wrote Mrs. Gail Micek of Bellevue, Neb., who said she was writing
for ``all sales associates everywhere'' who took offense at my
column.
</P>
<P>
   The column that upset Mrs. Micek began: ``It's amazing how many
people work in retail sales but don't know anything about the
products they sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The column went on to describe unhappy encounters with ``sales
associates'' who had little or no knowledge of the products they
sold and who often didn't even know what products their employer
stocked.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the column referred to a ``Superior Service''
policy used by Safeway Stores, Inc. that is generally popular with
Safeway customers but not that popular with Safeway employees who
oppose forced friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Micek started to work in retail sales 28 years ago,
she said, buyers and sales representatives held classes on new
merchandise so the store's sales staff would know the new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, now as retail stores keep expanding, communication
isn't what it used to be _ even in this computer age.''
</P>
<P>
   She dared me to work a day in a big department store and see how
much product information I learned as I was running the cash
register, answering the telephones and getting yelled at by
customers for being understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what you may want to believe,'' wrote another
sales person, many people have to live off the wages paid for sales
jobs. Since that is nearly impossible, those who could left sales
jobs to take jobs that paid a living wage, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Those who couldn't get better jobs ``have been evicted so many
times for being unable to pay the rent that we are sleeping on our
parents' couches.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers will continue to get poor service ``as long as service
with a smile means slavery,'' wrote ``the guy on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sales people are underpaid, undertrained, overworked and
stores are understaffed,'' wrote Chris, a former retail employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to know that clueless newspaper writers are still
confounding readers,'' began another e-mail letter from an upset
reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when being a store clerk was a professional
job with good enough pay and commission incentives to raise a
family and take pride in learning all about the products your
company sells,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it (retail sales) is an extremely unglam- orous job
that not many want and generally leads nowhere. Or, if you are
lucky, you can be promoted to an assistant store manager that pays
a salary and where you get to do lots of mandatory overtime for
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when if you asked about Model 500 widgets,
the store and its management had held a weekly or daily sales
meeting and explained all the new products with the benefits and
uses, and set up a compensation plan that rewarded people who
actively worked with customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast-buck artists, the writer said, sold the retail
businesses down the drain, laid off experienced workers and cut
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The real culprits, he said, are buyout artists who wring the
retail chains dry and customers who want only the cheapest prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the chains give them what they want, and now you're whining
that there is no service. Please spare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Risley of Dayton, Ohio, made a similar point by suggesting
that I find out more about the training, pay, duties and
aspirations of today's retail sales workers.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I don't feel comforted now that I know why service from
retail sales clerks has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we are just getting what we deserve.

 &HT;    Children's videos get thumbs-up from kids, grownups
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ We invited kids, parents and teachers to review a
batch of current children's videos.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some we all liked and can recommend. Prices vary, but
most cost between $10 and $20, depending on length:
</P>
<P>
   Preschool and toddlers
</P>
<P>
   _ The group of 3- and 4 year-olds who watched The Bear were
mesmerized. The charming adventures of a little girl and a huge
polar bear celebrate friendship and love. It's based on the book by
Raymond Briggs and produced by the creators of The Snowman, another
Briggs winner. ``I liked it because everybody got home safe,'' said
one 4-year-old video critic (Buena Vista Home Video).
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of the kids ages 2 to 4 watching Sing &AMP; Dance With Barney
couldn't sit still, and that's the way it should be. They were busy
clapping, moving and singing. The soon-to-be released video
celebrates Barney's 10 years and features reunion appearances by
Kathy, Michael, Tosha, Min and Jason. Teachers say kids begin to
find the purple dinosaur ``babyish'' after the age of 5, but little
ones still like him a lot. This video won't be out until
mid-January, but there are other Barney tapes _ such as the Barney
Safety Video _ if you need one in time for Christmas (Lyrick
Studio).
</P>
<P>
   _ Mention Blue's Clues and toddlers light up. The Nickelodeon
hit leads kids from paw print to paw print as host Steve and his
dog Blue help kids learn to reason. These two videos encourage
interaction and are definite hits with toddlers and preschoolers:
Blue's Clues Story Time and Blue's Clues Arts &AMP; Crafts (Paramount).
</P>
<P>
   _ Little ones adore seeing their favorite costumed characters,
and that's one of the reasons Disney's Sing Along Songs videos are
so popular. In The Twelve Days of Christmas, Mickey, Minnie,
Donald, Goofy and their friends enjoy a sleigh ride through the
wintry woods and a country yuletide hoe-down. Words are flashed on
the screen so kids can sing along.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary school
</P>
<P>
   _ Many kids are interested in flight and space. Follow up their
interest with videos on the subject. Two of the best are The Big
Space Shuttle and The Big Plane Trip, which allow kids to learn
about the space program and blast off with the astronauts, learn
how airplanes work and fly with the pilots in the cockpit (Little
Mammoth Media). Another interesting airplane video is Fred Levine's
Cleared for Takeoff, which follows a family from beginning to end
of a trip and takes viewers behind the scenes at an airport (Fred
Levine Productions).
</P>
<P>
   _ Videos can be used to help ignite a child's interest in
reading or _ for kids who already love books _ bring favorite
characters to life.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Madeline , the Ludwig Bemelman classic series
about a Parisian girl and her schoolmates. There's the new
live-action film with Frances McDormand as Miss Clavel (Columbia
Tri-Star) and a series of animated videos from Golden aimed at kids
between 4 and 8. Check out Madeline &AMP; The New House, Madeline at
Cooking School and others.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is Winnie the Pooh. If you're looking for a
holiday video, consider Winnie the Pooh and Christmas, Too. The
originals are still great: A Blustery Day and The Honey Tree
(Disney).
</P>
<P>
   _ For kids who love science, the ``Eyewitness'' videos are based
on the fascinating book series and include titles ranging from
Monster and Flight to Bear and Volcano (DK Vision). Other
possibilities: Disney's ``Amazing Animal'' series with titles such
as An Animal Year and Bill Nye the Science Guy Videos for kids 8
and older (Disney).
</P>
<P>
   _ Young folks with an artistic bent will be fascinated by the
``Notes Alive'' videos from the Minnesota Orchestra. The most
recent, The Nutcracker , interweaves footage of the orchestra, a
ballet performance and animation of Maurice Sendak illustrations.
First in the excellent series was On the Day You Were Born, a
similar format with an animated version of the Debra Frasier
picturebook.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents and grandparents looking for a bit of holiday
nostalgia will like sharing the series of ``Golden Oldies'' with
their kids. Danny and Marlo Thomas star in Cricket on the Hearth ,
plus restored versions of the original Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer and The Little Drummer Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Family films
</P>
<P>
   _ You won't be surprised to hear that the older kids who watched
the full-length feature films gave top ratings to movies such as
The Parent Trap, Air Bud: Golden Retriever, Dr. Dolittle and
Simba's Pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dr. Dolittle had a lot of action and was really
funny,'' said Jacob Levitt, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Horwitz said The Parent Trap was ``probably the best movie
I've seen in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   His mom preferred Disney's Summer of the Monkeys , a
coming-of-age adventure about a 12-year-old farm boy who makes
friends with four runaway circus monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   I objected to the language in Dr. Dolittle and found Simba's
Pride unnecessarily violent and scary for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Kids and adults of every age _ except little ones _ are likely
to love The Parent Trap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where do Christmas trees come from? The Christmas Tree Story
is a fascinating look at them _ from seedling to recycling
(Earthwalker Entertainment).
</P>
<P>
   _ I Love Christmas and Toy Trains &AMP; Christmas 2 (TM Books &AMP;
Videos) are entertaining for families who love watching electric
trains go round and round. Tom McComas combines Christmas music and
stories with smoke-puffing Lionel train layouts. These are great
videos for dads who always wanted a toy train of their own and
never got one, and for collectors. Younger train addicts will like
videos featuring Thomas the Tank Engine &AMP; Friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't neglect the classics, the full-length features that you
can all watch again and again. We're talking Mary Poppins, Mary
Martin's Peter Pan, Babe, Mrs. Doubtfire and Lady &AMP; the Tramp . One
of my favorites is Fly Away Home , the true story of a flock of
geese that lose their mother and are helped by 13-year-old Amy and
her dad (Columbia Tri-Star).
</P>
<P>
   _ Looking for a perfect video for Christmas Eve or Christmas
Day?
</P>
<P>
   A Hollywood Christmas brings together well-known scenes from
more than 40 years of Christmas films. Hosted by Jane Seymour, the
journey begins with the first Santa Claus film in 1898 and includes
clips from Home Alone, A Christmas Story , Miracle on 34th Street,
A Christmas Carol and others (Real Entertainment). A similar video,
TV Guide Looks at Christmas , includes holiday clips from popular
television shows.

 &HT;    When broken families remarry, new parents work to stay ... One
step ahead
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Instant love.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one big myth common to stepfamilies, it's that
children and their stepmothers or stepfathers should instantly love
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love me, love my children. You don't need to love them to be
successful,'' says Dr. Elaine Rotenberg, a West Palm Beach family
psychologist. ``It's OK to realize that stepparents and
stepchildren may never really like each other, and they don't have
to love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But she adds: ``They can get along with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Love takes time. And stepmothers in particular have a hard time
as heads of new families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize that stepmothers are sometimes a safer
person to be mad at than the biological parent,'' says Margorie
Engel, president of the Stepfamily Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   That can reinforce the tired image of the ``wicked'' stepmother.
And it forces many stepparents into avoiding confrontations,
Rotenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice to stepmothers struggling with the label of
`wicked stepmother,''' she adds, ``is not to take on the burden of
erasing someone else's label for you. Instead, you will be better
off creating your own unique relationship with your stepchildren
and your entire family.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, step-parenting is never about the kids alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's about couples working on their own relationships while
coping with children and ex-spouses who feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie Stepmom, which opens Friday, tackles those rocky
issues. It's about two women who don't particularly like each
other, two kids and a man in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first movie endorsed by the Stepfamily Association of
America because the movie showed that life can go on, happily, when
families break up and form new bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Here we give some local stepmothers a chance to tell their side
of the story, in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Robin Bernstein
</P>
<P>
   Age: 45
</P>
<P>
   Married to: Richard, 14 years
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom to: Arthur, 20
</P>
<P>
   Mom to: Ariel, 11; twins Alexandra and Julia, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Lives in: Palm Beach
</P>
<P>
   ``I first met Richard when I was 29 and Arthur was 5. I knew I
was never there to replace someone, but to be there in addition to
his mother. It was a joint custody arrangement. We had him
sometimes during the week and sometimes during the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was fun. I didn't have to give birth. I inherited
him past the diapers. He was fun, creative, ornery.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Step-parenting) wasn't really an obstacle early on in the
relationship, and I do love my stepson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the difficulty begins is when the parents have their own
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel was born when Arthur was 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the stepchild always feels that he's not part of the
family, or that he's part of the family, but in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There also were different parenting styles, which did cause
conflict between the two homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was more structured than the other due to increased
parental responsibilities in our home when Ariel was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a very difficult period. What we ended up
doing was sending Arthur to a boarding school because the dual
environments, the different parenting styles, were not good for
Arthur. This was done after many meetings, and consultations with
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave him a stable environment. He became much more mature,
and independent and really considerate of the different parents'
homes, and his relationships with his siblings improved greatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to Israel for his bar mitzvah, we all went
together as one big family: his mother, grandmother, all of us. So,
I think at critical stages in his life, whether graduation, or
whatever, there always was a time when everybody could be there for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Name: Gay Koehler
</P>
<P>
   Age: 49
</P>
<P>
   Married to: Dennis, 14 years on New Year's Eve
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom to: Joshua, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Mom to: Brittany Koehler, 13; Ken Hutcheson, 30; Rob
Satterthwaite, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Lives in: West Palm Beach
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh was 6 when I first met Dennis. I have two older children
so I did have some experience being a mom. I already had experience
being involved, going to the games and events children go through,
so it worked well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a challenge from time to time with Josh, but
no more so than with the other children. After Brittany was born, I
was a stay-at-home mom. At the end of the day, Josh would be picked
up by his nanny and go to his mom's house, and he would call me and
I would really enjoy that. I felt that I was appreciated, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Brittany was born, since she was a daughter, I think
maybe it made it easier for Josh to take. His dad didn't have
another son. I remember Josh being pleased she was a girl. I don't
know if he thought, `Is my status going to be threatened?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But having stepparents can give a child an extra set of
parents to count on. I remember when Josh auditioned for Super
Sloppy Double Dare (a TV show), and they asked about his parents
and he said three were attorneys, and one was a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Josh now sees relationships as being lifetime
commitments. When I met Dennis, I don't think he had that concept
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels close to me; I certainly feel close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've just been one of the lucky ones. I've talked to
people who have had horrible experiences. Maybe they just don't
hang in there long enough to work everything out. Maybe when two
people do love each other, maybe the kids do pick up on that and
everyone feels the love.''
</P>
<P>
   Name: Olivia Tartakow
</P>
<P>
   Age: 51
</P>
<P>
   Married to: Sheldon Bufferd, eight years
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom to: Marci, 31; Gary, 28
</P>
<P>
   Lives in: Palm Beach Gardens
</P>
<P>
   ``When we married, they were both out of the house. There was no
custody problem because both were adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of excited about being a stepmom because I didn't
have my own children and it was like having an instant family with
none of the burdens, except financial. They were good kids and they
were very accepting of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I tried to increase the relationship he had with
the kids. His having been in a divorce and (shuttling) the children
back and forth, their relationship with him was not as solid as it
could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship with Marci has always been very good. She
calls me WSM _ wicked step mommy. It's a joke. She just said it one
day, but it was said affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Marci, I see her about twice a year. Gary became
estranged from the family. We're not quite sure what the situation
is, but it's nothing to do with my stepmothering, nothing to do
with our marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my also being a stepchild made me more sensitive to
just letting the relationships develop as they would. I know what
kind of pain and hurt I went through when I was younger. My parents
were divorced when I was 13 and I had chosen to live with my
father. My mother remarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintained an excellent relationship with her, and my
stepdad is the one we go on vacations with when we have our family
vacations. He was just always basically there.''
</P>
<P>
   Name: Kathy McCarron
</P>
<P>
   Age: 37
</P>
<P>
   Married to: Brian, 16 years
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom to: Adrea, 20
</P>
<P>
   Mom to: Ariana, 11 months, Samantha, 4 1/2, and Kelsey, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Lives in: Boca Raton
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very young when we married. (She was 19, he was 28) My
stepdaughter was 5. She never remembers a time when I wasn't
around. I have always been there with her dad. Being a stepmom was
easy for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first married, she visited in the summer for about two
months. She was living in Indiana and had to fly on the plane by
herself. In the third grade, when she was 9, she came to live with
us full-time. I was pregnant and she wanted to be part of our
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good dad and wanted to make a family for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he wanted her to move in with us. It took a long time
to work it out without a big custody battle that would have been
bad for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only trouble I remember is she didn't like to eat very
much and we made her sit at the table until she finished, but I had
that with my kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some things with her mom, but we tried not to say bad
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her biological mom really wanted to do what was right for
Adrea, but I have always been like her parent. Her mom had like a
totally different parenting style; she wanted to be her friend
instead of her parent. Adrea was 18 when her mom died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much like her mom. I can really relate to her, she's
such a levelheaded kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought twice about marrying him because he had a
child. I was so in love with Brian and his daughter was so cute.
Most people think stepkids are nasty, but she was sweet, an
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Name: Terra Lynn Cay
</P>
<P>
   Age: 30
</P>
<P>
   Married to: Danny, 7 years
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom to: An 18-year-old stepdaughter (who doesn't want to be
named)
</P>
<P>
   Lives in: Boynton Beach
</P>
<P>
   ``When we met, she was 9 and I was 21. She and I were actually
friends before Danny and I. I volunteered at a church youth group,
so my focus was youth. Danny and I met through another church
group, and I found out he was a single dad with a young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because his daughter didn't have a mom, I asked him if I could
take his daughter horseback riding. So, she and I began spending
time together. Danny and I were acquaintances. I would go to the
house and pick her up. It still wasn't a dating relationship for
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we got married, I didn't think (being a stepmom) was a
lot to deal with. I didn't want to have kids of my own; I wanted to
adopt or foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in God, and I believed before we got
married that when we did get married, that I would feel a bond with
her as if she was my own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny and his daughter talked about the marriage, but once it
actually happened, it opened up a lot of anger in her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been seven years that she hadn't been in contact with
her mom. After we got married, her mom called. From that point on,
she was in and out of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was dealing with it fine. But things got harder.
She internalized things, and she started stealing and lying. She
was 13. That's when I started feeling like she wasn't appreciating
my love. What does she want from me? That's when it became
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started having marriage problems, and going to counseling.
The really neat thing was it strengthened our communication skills
and the counselor was very supportive of us and how we were
handling things with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of stepmother was a lot tougher than I thought it
would be. I felt like a failure. Her problems kept getting worse
and it got to a point where she left home. There's been some
reconciliation now that she's 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that I had known somebody who I could have talked to
before I got married. I don't know whether it would have changed my
decision to marry. I'm happy I did get married. But if you have
foster or adopted kids, they come with their own issues.''

 &HT;    J.J. deals with his personal loss the best way he knows
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The mother said her son made the call
every week.
</P>
<P>
   The mother knew well enough, though, that her telephone would
ring later rather than sooner back in Port Arthur, Texas, during
football season if that son's team had lost a game.
</P>
<P>
   Allene Johnson, 77, who died Sunday, understood and loved that
about her boy, Jimmy, who went about his business _ remember that
word _ Monday night in Pro Player Stadium as head coach of the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful for all of the concern and support I have
received, especially from the people who knew my mother,'' Johnson
said in a statement issued before Miami's stunning 31-21 victory
over Denver that qualified the Dolphins for the playoffs. ``This is
a matter that is private and personal, and I appreciate being given
the latitude to handle it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was.
</P>
<P>
   Even during pre-game drills with coaches and players scattered
around the Dolphins' half of the field, Johnson wandered mostly
alone. There was nothing particularly unusual about that, because
Johnson is often a solitary figure at such a time.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be even fewer conversations _ however brief
_ than usual ... a handshake ... a wave ... a pat on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more than quick tidings of comfort without joy in this
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a businessman,'' said Dolphins wide receiver Lamar
Thomas, who caught three touchdown passes. ``He always tells us
there are certain things that go along with life, and you have to
separate them when you go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami defensive end Jason Taylor, who was one of the few players
who approached Johnson during warm-ups, said there was no official
announcement to the team that the coach's mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word just got around,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Business.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Johnson initiated a meeting with anyone prior to
kickoff was when he noticed team owner H. Wayne Huizenga strolling
a sideline. They spoke for a moment, and Johnson posed for pictures
at Huizenga's request.
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, Johnson was alone with his head bowed as staff
and team afforded him space during the invocation before the game.
</P>
<P>
   These are perhaps nothing more than observations made from afar
shaded exaggeratedly by a voyeur's knowledge of circumstances. And
perhaps, too, Johnson would object to any sympathetic portrayal of
him in sorrowful pose.
</P>
<P>
   Do not presume.
</P>
<P>
   Do not intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Do not presume to intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Those are Johnson's shields.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nice _ and maybe even important _ to remember Allene
and her husband, C.W., watching their son's Dolphins win a game
earlier this year in Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And it's nicer still to remember Johnson's first season in Miami
when the Dolphins went to Houston just down the road from Port
Arthur, and his mother and father watched a Miami victory over the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   That was back when Allene was spending four hours a day three
days a week hooked to a dialysis machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not including the 30 minutes it takes to stop the bleeding
from the needles,'' she told me once.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Allene and C.W. satisfied themselves most of the time
by watching the Dolphins on a big-screen television in their quiet
house on a quiet street in the same town to which they moved from
Arkansas in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs were lives far removed from their son, who found glitter
and national-championship glory in Miami (during his college
coaching days with the Hurricanes) and Dallas (winning two Super
Bowls coaching the Cowboys) and is now more at home in South
Florida with the Dolphins than he ever was in an oil town-gone-bust
on the Gulf Coast of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But calls back to Port Arthur always remained a touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson coached a football game Monday night in the wake of his
mother's death, and he did it in his standard out-loud style. He
ranted and raved over slights real or imagined. He stomped and
pointed.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be held Wednesday morning in Groves,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The son's call to his mother would have come sooner rather than
later this week.

 &HT;    This American dish has been enjoyed for nearly a century
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Oysters Rockefeller is an American classic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the name, based on the richness of a Rockefeller, but
it is a special occasion dish, one that is perfect for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure of classic dish is that it endures, this one
meets the test. Flip the calendar to 1999 and it will be 100 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Created in New Orleans, the specialty became popular in upscale
restaurants everywhere and managed to survive the era of
continental cuisine, when Beef Wellington and Cherries Jubilee
flourished. Over the decades the thumbprints of hundreds of chefs
have left their mark on the dish.
</P>
<P>
   As the late James Beard, the dean of American cuisine, once
said, ``It's such a misquoted classic that there are as many
recipes as there are cookbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the recipes include a topping made with spinach,
and that's completely wrong, say the owners of Antoine's
Restaurant, where the recipe was created in 1899 during a shortage
in the supply of French snails. The first owner of the French
Quarter restaurant responded by cooking native oysters under a pale
green puree.
</P>
<P>
   While the recipe for the original topping is still a secret, the
descendents insist that the puree includes more than one green
vegetable _ and that spinach is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most recipes from imitators today are based on spinach.
Some innovators, guessing at the original, rely on watercress.
Parsley and green onions are frequent additions, and some anise
flavoring is essential, either from Pernod or bulb fennel.
</P>
<P>
   And the recipes always include butter, lots of butter.
</P>
<P>
   If Oysters Rockefeller comes in many guises, some are better
than others. On the menu at Kettering, Ohio's l'Auberge restaurant,
the Oysters Rockefeller bear the stamp of chef/owner Dieter Krug.
He dispenses with shell oysters, buying fat ones from Virginia that
are always a uniform size and easier for the home cook to deal with
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach is the correct green ingredient, he insists, and he
cooks it briefly in butter. He flavors it with Pernod, just enough
to add the faint anise taste, but not so much that any sweetness
can be detected. And in this presentation, the oysters, briefly
poached in a little white wine, are laid on top of the bright green
buttered spinach, instead of being baked and buried under some
mysterious green puree.
</P>
<P>
   The chef's whim at l'Auberge is a ladle of hollandaise sauce on
top and a stardust sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   These are, to be honest, nothing like the ones I tasted at
Antoine's years ago. These are much better. Call them a different
take on a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Krug willingly shares his recipe, which he says is prepared
quickly _ a la minute .
</P>
<P>
   That's true if you have someone to clean the spinach and mince
the garlic and shallots and onions and make the hollandaise, to
have them all ready when you go to the stove.
</P>
<P>
   But take a clue from the chef and do all those preparations
ahead and you, too, can make Oysters Rockefeller part of your
holiday entertaining. It truly does just take minutes to finish
this classic.
</P>
<P>
   While restaurants usually serve six-oyster servings, that's a
lot to precede a big holiday dinner. I suggest four per person, but
you can adjust that and bump up the amount of spinach filling if
you like.
</P>
<P>
   OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoons minced shallot or green onion
</P>
<P>
   cup finely minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh spinach, rinsed and dried, all stems removed
</P>
<P>
   salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons Pernod
</P>
<P>
   16 select oysters
</P>
<P>
   cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
</P>
<P>
   hollandaise sauce (recipe on Page 3C)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter in a large skillet. Add the garlic, shallot and
onion and cook several minutes until the onions are softened. Add
the spinach to the pan, season with salt and pepper and cook,
shaking the pan occasionally, until the spinach wilts, about 2
minutes. Drizzle the Pernod over the top, cover and let the spinach
steam for a minute or two. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the cheese
over the spinach and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the oysters in a skillet and add the wine and sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat 1 to 2 minutes, then
turn. Cook another minute or two and remove from the heat. The
oysters should be warm and firm but not overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spoon cup spinach on a warm plate. Arrange the drained
oysters over the top and ladle cup hollandaise over the top.
Sprinkle lightly with remaining Parmesan and run under the broiler
for a minute or two to brown the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 529 calories, 43 g
fat, 289 mg cholesterol, 785 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Blender hollandaise is the easiest choice for the home cook. It
can be made a good half-hour ahead and kept warm in a heated
thermos. Remember that this sauce contains eggs that are not fully
cooked, which is a health issue for some. Blender Hollandaise Makes
1 cups 3 egg yolks 2 tablespoons boiling water cup warm melted
butter 1 tablespoon lemon juice salt dash cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Put the egg yolks in an electric blender. Turn to low speed and
slowly add the boiling water and then the butter, very slowly in a
thin stream. Add the lemon juice, cayenne and salt to taste.
(Recipe from the Fannie Farmer Cookbook by Marion Cunningham).
</P>
<P>
   James Beard's recipe, which he published in American Cookery
contains no spinach, but a mixture of green onions, celery,
chervil, fennel, parsley and watercress run through a blender until
pureed.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ We've all heard all the helpful hints people
suggest to dry up the tears while cutting up onions. Well, this
month Cook's Illustrated tested 20 of the household hints to see if
any really work. Two that do are wearing contacts, or, if you
don't, wearing goggles, which admittedly looks silly in the
kitchen. So did a number of other suggested solutions. Best of the
others was to have a lighted candle nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Change baking soda two times a year
</P>
<P>
   We all know to check the use-by date on the baking powder can.
But did you know to change your baking soda every six months?
</P>
<P>
   So says Dorie Greenspan, the ``baking evangelist'' for the Land
O'Lakes Holiday Bakeline who worked on the Baking With Julia
cookbook that accompanied Julia Child's PBS series.
</P>
<P>
   But don't just pitch the old baking soda; put it in the
refrigerator to trap odors.
</P>
<P>
   One good source
</P>
<P>
   U nless your idea of a good time is sitting around skinning
nuts, recipes for toasted hazelnuts can move you to turn the
cookbook page. While the nuts can be hard to find, raw skinned
hazelnuts (also called filberts) can be found at nut specialty
stores.

 &HT;    It's simple: Wild rice offering fills the holiday bill
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Like most of you, I'm working today. I'll be
lucky to sneak away at midday, with just enough time to get a head
start on Christmas Eve dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Friends from out of town will arrive about 6 p.m. for our ritual
celebration, which this year will be a seafood feast. There's not
much time to think about even the small dinner planned for
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   But because the holiday is a pull-out-the-stops day for
ingredients, wild rice is always on the dinner menu. My favorite
recipe is this one for Wild Wild Rice, which adds the intense
flavors of dried mushrooms and pecans to the rice.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old recipe from my ``It's Simple'' column, which has
been on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   WILD WILD RICE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 cup wild rice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped toasted pecans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Soak the mushrooms in 1 cup warm water for 30 minutes. Strain
the mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and rinse the mushrooms under
cold water to remove any grit. Chop the mushrooms, discarding any
hard stems, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear (some
packages carry an advisory that the rice has been prewashed).
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Add enough water to the reserved mushroom liquid to make 3 cups
and bring to a boil; add the rice and salt. Cover, bring back to a
boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes
until the water is evaporated and the rice is tender. Do not
overcook to the mushy stage.
</P>
<P>
   When the rice is done, remove from heat, cover with a paper
towel, replace lid and let stand off the heat for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the rice stands, heat the butter in a small skillet and
cook the mushrooms and pecans. Just before serving, stir the pecans
and mushrooms into the wild rice and add a few gratings of nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 238 calories, 8.5
g fat, 12 mg cholesterol, 537 mg sodium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The view from a snow-covered observation platform above
Potsdamer Platz offers three telling sites.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the spare glass and terra cotta geometry of new and
burgeoning office towers rising from the hubbub and confusion of
construction. This is Sony Corp.'s $5 billion European
headquarters, which is rising alongside Daimler-Benz' new $2.2
billion mega-development with its offices, stores, restaurants,
apartments, Germany's largest casino, a 10-screen cinema, musical
theater and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 men and women in blue work clothes and white
helmets hustle day an night in the largest construction site in
Western Europe -- perhaps anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Next, nearly unseen in the construction, a remnant the Berlin
Wall snakes through the equipment and scaffolding on the plaza,
which until World War II was the pulsing heart of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the old Reichstag -- the old parliament building --
which was torched by the Nazis in 1933 and bombed by the allies in
1945, rises above scores of construction cranes. A new translucent
cupola pops up from the gutted and renovated building, an
architectural marriage of very old Berlin to the future -- a future
that promises big things.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, the bundestadt -- the federal assembly -- will
convene in the Reichstag to elect the nation's next president, the
first official act in the building since Hitler was chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   And next November, most of federal government will finish the
move from Bonn to Berlin, completing a long symbolic journey home.
</P>
<P>
   For Berliners, who have lived through a remarkable decade, it
sometimes seems unreal. ``Berlin is a fantasy,'' said Dirk Kroegel,
a spokesman for the city government. ``It is a dream that seems to
be coming true.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the rising capital of the wealthiest and perhaps most
influential country in Europe. Its importance is expected to grow
with the monetary union, which begins with the introduction of the
euro as the continent's primary electronic currency on Jan. 1.
Bills and coins will begin circulation three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Germany pushed hard for monetary union in hopes of creating a
more stable economic environment for its financial and industrial
prowess to flourish. While the European Commission will remain in
Brussels, the powerful European Central Bank will operate from
Frankfurt. The most powerful national government will be in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, more than 30,000 federal workers and
their families will pack up and move from Bonn to Berlin. An
estimated 70,000 lobbyists, lawyers and other institutions that
travel with government will also move in. Embassies are also
returning to the old capital, including a proposed $140 million
U.S. compound planned for its pre-war site near the Brandenberg
gate in what had been East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The move is costing the German government about $12 billion in
new construction, renovations and moving costs, said Gerda Renatus,
a spokeswoman for the government's office that is coordinating the
move.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to refitting old buildings including Hitler's old
Aviation Ministry new government buildings are rising along central
parts of the Tiergarten and Mitte districts, near where the River
Spree river curves sharply west of the Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   Private construction projects unrelated to the government's move
are worth an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion. The amount of
construction is so vast -- about triple the construction in
pre-Olympic Atlanta and Barcelona combined -- it is hard to soak
in.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the planned $11.5 billion reconstruction of the
Lehrter Bahnhof rail station is underway to provide a 21st-Century
juncture for two great European rail routes: from Paris to Moscow,
and from Stockholm to Vienna. The station will have a 1,400-foot
glass concourse, 58 escalators and 37 elevators. A new airport is
scheduled to open in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boomtown feel of Berlin, the city is in an economic
slump. Office occupancy is less than 50 percent, according to the
city government. The unemployment rates is about 18 percent, and
industrial production has fallen 6 percent in 1998. Things are so
slow that plans for a major new complex of skyscrapers planned for
Alexander Platz in the old eastern sector have been placed on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Things are expected to improve, but not for another five or six
years, officials say. Many business leaders expect the city's
prospects will rise as the economic situation in Russia gets sorted
out. ``Russia will come back, and when it does it will mean a lot
for Germany and Berlin,'' said Joachim Volz, an economist with the
German Institute for Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, truth is no one seems to know what to expect
with the return of the government and the advent of a monetary
union, both of which could have dramatic uncertain impact.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Berliners seem most interested in figuring out the
identify of their city -- a complex matter given its mixed history
and puzzling future. There seems to be a desire to reach back
before Hitler's times to the Berlin of Sally Bowles, the character
played by Liza Minelli in ``Caberet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is like a ghost,'' Koegel said. ``People remember the
way it was before the Third Reich, and they want it the way it was
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is more haunted than Potsdam Platz. In the 1920s, it had
legendary cafes such as Josty and Vaterland, and the hotel
Esplanade was one of Europe's most coveted addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The square was reduced to rubble in the last months of World War
II, and left desolate and overgrown on the dividing line between
East and West Berlin. That all changed in 1989 when the Berlin Wall
came down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years ago, Berliners destroyed the Wall with hammers,''
Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen Schrempp(CQ) said a few weeks ago at
the opening of his firm's development. ``Today we are marking a new
Berlin, a country on the move and a continent that has rediscovered
its equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   With Berlin again at the center.

<P>
   LONDON _ While much of world takes a break at the end of the
year, the dense honeycombs of money-making in central London will
be abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long weekend from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4, The City --
London's financial district -- will swarm with 30,000 bankers,
stockbrokers and computer wizards assembled to make ready for the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   While the new bills and coins won't be around for three years,
the euro will become the electronic currency of choice at the first
of the year. The briefcase-wielding army will face a monumental
mission: Converting millions of electronic financial transactions
to the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on New Year's Eve, European finance ministers in
Brussels will fix the conversion rates between their currencies and
the euro. The Bank of England will then post the rates on computer
screens around The City, setting off a 55-hour race to be ready for
business when the Far East markets open at midnight on Jan 3.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being taken so seriously that some banking
institutions have asked London hotels, where many of the troops
will be housed, to remove the booze from the minibars.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Levene of Portsoken, the chairman of Bankers Trust and the
Lord Mayor of London, said the job is made complicated because
these institutions will be fiddling with something uniquely
sensitive: Other peoples money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my bank, we have two huge task forces, one on the euro and
the other on YK2000, the euro requirement is more difficult,''
Levene, also chairman of Bankers Trust, said at a recent luncheon
at the grand Mansion, what amounts to London City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   A Citibank guide to the euro circulated among corporate
treasurers put it this way, ``It is like the U.S. deciding to
switch to driving on the left by 1999. Moving the steering wheels
on the cars is the easy bit. What to do about the roads, interstate
highways, traffic signs, traffic management, driver education and
so on is far more complex.'' European banks will spend $10 billion
to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Because the euro will be phased in over the next 3 1/2 years on
a largely voluntary basis, American businesses -- like their
European counterparts -- will have to work with both euros and the
old currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the hassle, there are three key advantages for
American businesses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price transparency: It will be easier to compare prices across
Euroland, making it easier for companies to shop around and,
consequently, forcing more price competition. This also will make
it easier for companies to give their products consistent prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A strengthened European stock market: That would provide
American companies a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Economic stability: Unified interest rates and a broad attack
on inflation will make it easier to manage the business cycle, to
moderate the highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, companies may experience a savings of 25 percent
to 40 percent in bank foreign exchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   For many businesses, the monetary union will create a vast and
exciting marketplace that may look a lot like the United States.
``The country boundaries, the currency boundaries, will be replaced
by boundaries of groups of people who are distinguished only by
their buying preferences,'' said Jim Reed, the director of European
programs for Dell Computer Corp., the Austin, Texas-based computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   A vast restructuring is likely as businesses reassess their
approach to Europe, most likely centralizing and consolidating
operations, said Reed, whose company manufactures its computers in
Ireland and sells them across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is to be able to make sure that we can price,
trade and settle in euros from the first of January within any
country in the euro zone,'' Reed said. ``As customers are ready to
transition to euros, we want to be ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses will switch completely to the euro, billing
customers and paying suppliers electronically in the new
currencies. They will be free to pay employees in euros, which will
be converted into national currencies by their banks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its advantages, no one thinks the change to the euro
will be easy. The most often cited concerns are the long delay
before bills and coins appear, the lack of a single European
government to take responsibility in a banking crisis and varying
pressures on the new -- and ostensibly independent -- European
Central Bank. There also are concerns about ancient national
rivalries that can't be ended by sharing money.
</P>
<P>
   Another big unanswered question is the euro's effect on the U.S.
dollar and economy. Many economists believe that over time, the
euro may challenge the dollar as the world's currency, a status
that brings many rewards and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is in the future, the immediate task is to be
ready for dawn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Things, after all, can go dreadfully wrong. A power outage is
one popular nightmare scenario. ``What we all fear is the
unknown,'' said Mitchell Shivers, the euro conversion coordinator
at Merrill Lynch in London. ``There is an unprecedented third party
risk, so we have tons of contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that point, Lord Levene sounds Churchillian: ``We are not
just determined to be ready,'' he said. ``We will be ready.''

   WELCOME TO EUROLAND
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 15 countries in the European Union have agreed to
join their financial and
</P>
<P>
   monetary systems within the Economic Monetary Union (EMU). This
step will bring the people and governments of the continent closer
together than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   TIMELINE
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, 1999, 11 European countries will take the
first step toward using a new, unified currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, new currency will be used in many business and
investment transactions as well as in credit cards and other
electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 1998 -- Exchange rate for euro and 11 national currencies
is set.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 1999 -- Euro is launched for bank transactions, stock
exchanges, credit card and other electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 2002 -- Euro coins and bills are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   July 2002 -- National currencies are withdrawn from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER ECONOMIC POWER?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Euro 11 stacked up against the United States in
1997:
</P>
<P>
   ....................................................................
..............Euro 11...............United States
</P>
<P>
   Population (in 
millions)..................................................290......
....................268
</P>
<P>
   Gross Domestic Product (in
billions).........................$5,942.....................$8,080

   NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France _ Sipping a vintage pomerol in the
sitting room of his small apartment in this pretty Paris suburb,
Franck Berchier laments he may never be able to forget his francs
and centimes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, when he buys something at the market downstairs he will be
forced to go through the same mental calculations of value he
endures when he travels abroad. ``I will see something with the
price of 20 euros, and I will have to think about what that is in
francs so I will know if it is expensive or not,'' Berchier says in
a tone of mild annoyance. ``With the euros, I will be like an alien
in my own country.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for the franc -- and deutsche mark,
lira and peseta for that matter -- will come Jan. 1, when 11
European countries begin switching to the new, unified currency.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the euro will exist only as virtual money in bank and
credit card statements, investment portfolios and on other bills
and pricetags placed by merchants as a reference point and learning
tool.
</P>
<P>
   In January 2002, euro bills and coins will begin circulating.
Six months later the old money will be history.
</P>
<P>
   For Berchier and millions of other Europeans, the demise of a
national currency represents more than just switching money. It
also means the loss of a unique, portable and familiar expression
of who you are. When a French man or woman unfolds a 100-franc
note, he or she sees the familiar and affirming face of the great
French impressionist painter Paul Cezanne. It is a subtle reminder
of what it is to be French, just as the image of Independence Hall
on the back of a US$100 bill is a reminder of what is special about
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the day comes when his wallet holds euros instead of
francs, Berchier wonders if he might feel that much less French and
more something else, something not so clearly understood even after
eons of definition: A European.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the way of the future, isn't it?'' Berchier asks with a
shrug as he takes another sip of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the euro is generally regarded as the next step
in the evolution of Europe from a continent of often quarreling --
occasionally warring -- countries into something bigger. Someday
the union may challenge the United States for the economic
heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Already a unified market, the 11 euro countries -- often called
Euroland -- will become a single economy, a concept not far removed
from the idea of 50 semi-autonomous states operating for business
purposes as the United States of America. Interest rates will be
set by a Central European Bank, which also will deal with a broad
range of economic issues. In theory, this will create economic
conditions in Bonn that match those in Dublin or Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The initial euro club will include Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted not to participate in the
single unified currency, and Greece failed to meet the required
economic criteria.
</P>
<P>
   While the Euroland countries will surrender individual control
over interest rates, inflation management and other economic
policymaking, they will retain authority -- for now -- over
taxation, wages and labor law. Yet, it is widely accepted that over
time, even these politically charged matters will become
standardized.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding theory behind economic union is that the
individual countries will all gain in efficiencies and stability:
the whole will add up to more than a sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders spare few superlatives in describing the advent
of the euro, which is seen as the economic equivalent of the
tearing down of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most significant economic event in Europe's
history,'' said Jim Reed, an executive with Dell Computer Corp.,
the Austin, Texas-based computer maker that builds its products in
Ireland and sells them across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on inflation will be a major benefit in
countries such as Italy and Spain, which have been ravaged by
recurring rounds of price instability over the years. At the very
least, ending the need to change currencies will create an
immediate savings of $40 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro countries can get their act together -- not a small
``if,'' mind you -- then many European economists believe the
continent may in time challenge the United States. On paper
Euroland stacks up nicely against America. The 11 countries have a
combined population of 290 million, 22 million more than the United
States. Each controls slightly less than a quarter of the world's
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are profound differences. Europe is far more divided
by culture, history and language -- even distinct regional
dialects. This problem is easing by the rise of English: When a
German speaks to an Italian, the conversation is in English. A
recent study showed that 63 percent of the people in France can
speak English, while the number is 94 percent in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Euroland believe that their union already has paid
off by easing the impact of a worldwide economic slowdown,
particularly in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already, we have seen the euro work,'' said Joachim Volz, an
economist with the German Institute for Economic Research. ``Our
markets did not suffer from the global crisis nearly as they would
have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Toiling in her tiny office in Neuruppin, 100 miles north of
Berlin, it is sometimes hard for Christine Gerhardt to remember the
grand ideas that possessed Europe's leaders to change to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerhardt, the whole thing is a stomach churning mess.
Gerhardt battles in the euro trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Her job is to prepare the government in this town of 33,000 to
handle the new currency. When the euro fully replaces the deutsche
mark, then parking meters, land taxes, swimming pool fees --
everything -- will have to be billed and collected in euros.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the rubber will meet the road In the summer of 2002,
when moms leading packs of kids show up at the city pool to learn
that price of swimming has jumped because of the euro. The calls
won't go to Brussels or Berlin, they'll go to Neuruppin City Hall.
``People may not understand what happened, and they may be angry,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this former East Germany military center, people for the most
part are ambivalent about the euro, said Otto Theel, the
burgermeister. The city still has its hands full just making the
change from socialism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   For residents, the euro is just another twist in an already
unfamiliar road, Theel said. ``People worry that unemployment,
which is already not good, will go up because people from other
countries will come to Germany because it is a rich country. They
worry how it will effect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, the support for the euro has been declining
for some time. In Germany, the most powerful country in the union,
popular support for the euro has fallen to 43 percent -- exactly
the same as the level of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The word most often used to describe the attitude of the public
is ``resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is doing it because we want to be European,'' said
Emma Davis, an English woman who is married to Franck Berchier.
``We're only doing it because we're scared stiff about America or
Japan knocking the hell out of us if we don't. It's totally
mercenary.''
</P>
<P>
   Profound fears remain that economic unity will lead to the
surrender of political autonomy to some multinational collective of
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Such anxieties seems most acute in Britain, where the press
seems particularly hostile toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were once an island-based empire fighting off these
European invasions for hundreds of years while Americans we're
running around in the woods trying to find a country,'' said
Herbert Smart, a small grocer in Manchester. ``You will excuse us
if we don't embrace the idea of being in this new empire dominated
by the Germans and French.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, a professor of European politics at the London
School of Economics, believes these concerns are exaggerated.
Taylor believes Europe is evolving into a kind of confederation of
independent states with economic decision-making centralized but
conventional government powers retained by the individual
countries. ``I don't see any indication that any of the member
states want to dissolve themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor believes the British should find some comfort in their
own history: Great Britain is itself a collection of different
peoples. ``The Scots and the Welsh and the Irish have survived with
a quite distinct identities in what is a United Kingdom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he acknowledges that many Britons resist even admitting
that they are Europeans. ``But this is different from talking about
views about the relationship with Europe,'' he said. ``The British
public as a whole is resigned to the fact that we're in Europe, and
there's a certain impatience for those who are not prepared to make
the best of this.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the potential benefits of the forging a greater Europe,
there also are worries that cultural diversity may be a casualty of
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One speaks quite a lot about Europe these days, and one speaks
of it as an industrial trust,'' said Jorg-Ingo Weber, an official
in Berlin's municipal department of science, research and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity in culture, language, the things that make
Germany and Europe special, if not protected, will go away. It is
what I call the 'vanilla-ization' of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many view becoming part of a greater Europe not so
much as a cause for celebration as an unalterable reality with
which they must come to terms, particularly in the way they define
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is my home, Germany is my fatherland, and Europe,''
Weber says, ``Europe is my future.''

   ATHENS, Greece _ Pity poor Greece. Three thousand years is a
long slide from grand empire to European also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   The land of Hercules and Mount Olympus is the poorest country in
the 15-member European Union and the only one which wanted to enter
the single European currency, the euro, but couldn't meet the
economic standards. (Britain, Sweden and Denmark chose not to
join).
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Greece was known as the EU's ``black sheep,''
hamstrung by double-digit inflation, labor strife and a colossal
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greece is the only country that wanted to be part of the euro
and could not make the grade. There is a sentiment of exclusion, of
somehow being second-class and less than European,'' said Ilias
Nicolacopoulos(CQ), a pollster and political scientist at the
University of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which joined the EU in 1981, has launched an epic
struggle for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Its failure to become a founding member of the euro club -- the
11 countries which will adopt the single currency on Jan. 1 -- has
resulted in uncommon unity among Greece's notoriously divided
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They resolved to reduce Greece's deficit and improve its economy
by the end of 1999 for possible inclusion in the euro zone by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Athens pushed hard and won the rights to host
the 2004 Olympics. New airports, roads and rail links are under
construction in preparation for the games.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new image taking shape across the Greek isles
and in the minds of Greeks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of being ``European'' is immensely popular. Polls
indicate that the idea of a shared European currency is supported
by two of every three in this country of 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two Greeces: One is in the past. It is heroic and
unique. It celebrated great victories and suffered greatly, too.
The new Greece is simply normal. It has managers and technocrats.
It thinks not in terms of territory and nationalism, but of
economics and pragmatism,'' said Theodore Couloumbis(CQ) of the
Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, a think tank
in the capital, Athens.
</P>
<P>
   To join the core club of EU players like France and Germany
would lend an image of stability to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   That is important in a country worried that violence in the
turbulent Balkans -- notably the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo --
could erupt into a regional war, or that Greece's perennial
disputes with longtime adversary Turkey could unexpectedly explode
into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Prime Minister Costas Simitis and his moderate Socialist
government, Greece's main political factions and industrial leaders
have set out to transform the country into a business and
transportation hub for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from the rest of the EU by the Balkans, Greece is now
looking to make its location an advantage -- as a link between
Western Europe and emerging markets in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 billion tourism industry remains vital to the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But reflecting a new sophistication to broaden its economy,
Greece -- with the help of the EU -- set up a publicly-financed
company to sell foreign investors on Greece's attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not just the three S's -- sand, sun and sex -- an image
many in America and Europe have of Greece. It's a place to do
business,'' said Efthimios Mouratidis, project manager for the
Hellenic Center for Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Substance, not image alone, has hampered Greece. Inflation stood
at 22 percent in 1991. Trade union strikes continue to periodically
paralyze the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist government of former Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou, which ruled through most of the 1980's, stoked
organized labor and generally neglected the business community.
Major industries were nationalized. Liberal wage accords caused
industrial productivity to drop, and fed inflation. Papandreou was
driven from office in 1989, returned to power in 1993, but died in
1996 and was succeeded by Simitis.
</P>
<P>
   He initiated a renewed drive to join the single currency. In
all, the EU has contributed about $35 billion to Greece's efforts
to improve its economy and meet the economic criteria to join the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Greece's lingering inflation that could continue to
bar its euro membership. Running as high as 5.3 per cent this year,
Greece must cut it in half by the end of 1999 to meet the target
for euro membership by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the government has remained committed to a program
of slashing state subsidies, eliminating some services, raising
taxes and privatizing state enterprises, where workers once enjoyed
virtual jobs-for-life security.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have left many unhappy. Nearly every labor union has
held some sort of protest against the austerity initiative in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something rotten in the state of Hellas,'' headlined
the daily newspaper Kathimerini in recent special section dedicated
to Greek woes.
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion and political will seem firmly behind the
effort to join the euro. Many Greek businesses, including the
nation's largest supermarket chains, have agreed to freeze most
prices in an effort to hold down inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of replacing the national currency, the drachma, for
the euro is widely accepted, said Nicolacopoulos, because of the
drachma's mercurial history as a shaky currency. An estimated 35
percent of the national economy remains underground, carried out in
dollars, German deutsche marks and other hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   An Athens taxi driver, Costas Samos, says Greeks will always be
Greek. ``We have our own language that is difficult for outsiders,
our own history and culture. I'm not worried about being less
Greek. I am worried that we will be left behind if we don't follow
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But do Greeks really believe the euro will change their lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro offers validation, but not very high expectations,''
said Nicolacopoulos. ``The stabilization of the currency is the
prime objective for Greece. That, and perhaps a little more respect
for our nation.''

<P>
   WARSAW _ Poland, like much of the rest of Central and Eastern
Europe, has a clear image of itself in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Anti-Soviet Pact, former satellites of the Soviet
Union eager to shed their association with Moscow and become
clearly linked with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``being European'' is simultaneously appealing
and ambiguous to the nine Central and East European countries
lining up for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
   They know they want to join the club. They simply are not
certain what the fine print will mean, particularly as 11 members
of the union are set to launch a single currency on Jan. 1 and
enter unchartered territory in the realm of economic unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not be completely happy with the EU and what
membership will do for them, but all that is negligible compared to
the prime motivation: They clearly want to draw a line that defines
them with the West and protects them from Russia,'' said a Western
diplomat in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to become the
newest members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next
spring, expanding the Cold War security organization beyond what
had been the iron curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The three nations and others are on a separate path to EU
membership. The crash of Russia's economy last August sent shock
waves through Eastern and Central Europe and reinforced the need
for stronger economic alliances with the European Union and
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the alternative? There is no alternative. We have
nothing to take from Russia. Our path is to the West,'' said Robert
Soltyk, deputy foreign editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's
largest circulation daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has opened membership talks with the front-runners who
hope to join early in the next decade: Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and the Mediterranean island nation of
Cyprus. Another five countries -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania and Slovakia -- will be the second wave to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But expanding the European family is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion will cost around $50 billion through 2006, according
to the European Commission, but nobody wants to pick up the bill.
The European Union's 15 current members are divided over how to
proceed and at what speed.
</P>
<P>
   The applicant countries must adopt some 80,000 pages of
intricate legislation and regulations to conform to EU standards.
It is a daunting task considering that many of the countries, which
concentrated earlier on their economic overhaul, are only now
beginning to tackle significant social reforms and junk old
Soviet-era laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``While speed is desirable, quality is essential. Thus, each
candidate will join only when it is ready,'' said Hans van den
Broek, the EU commissioner in charge of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   With a vigorous entrepreneurial class and billions of dollars in
long-term foreign investment, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic have become the dominant emerging economies of the region.
The signs in Warsaw, Budapest and Prague are unmistakable as
multinationals like Sony, IBM and McDonald's have entered the
markets and illuminated the once-bleak skylines.
</P>
<P>
   Following the collapse of communism a decade ago, Poland enacted
swift and painful economic reforms that worked. Today, only 8
percent of Poland's exports go to Russia, and 64 percent go to the
European Union, a complete turnabout compared to Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Poland also represents the region's largest consumer economy,
with 39 million people. In the last 10 years, more than 2 million
new businesses have been formed, mostly by Poles, spawning millions
of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's economy has slowed as a result of the Russian and Asian
economic shocks, but expanded 5.8 percent in 1998 and is projected
to grow at a hearty 5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such success on its own has led some in Poland to wonder why the
country should rush to join the European Union and take on dictates
from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   More than two out of three Poles support EU membership, though
more than half of them think it will position Poland as a
second-class member in a weak position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mixed feelings. People are wondering whether Poland
should be a second-class country in the big leagues, or a
first-class country in its own league,'' said Lena
Kolarska-Bobinska, director of the Foundation of Public Affairs, a
Warsaw-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Poland also must address massive problems.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, it will cost nearly $30 billion merely to clean
up the environment and bring factories up to EU operating standards
in terms of safety and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity levels still lag well behind Western Europe,
America and Asia. A local joke in Poland goes: ``How many people
work at this factory?'' Answer: ``Half of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge task facing Poland will be the overhaul of its system of
2 million mostly small farms, which employs 27 percent of Poland's
workforce -- 3.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   To become competitive Poland must restructure the system and
consolidate farming into larger operations to make them more
competitive. This, at a time when the EU is trying to reduce its
costly farm-subsidy programs, which consume half of the union's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Poland, we want EU membership to happen as quickly as
possible and we want it to be as good as possible. These can be
contradictory objectives unless we do it right. The worst thing
would be to join and somehow be considered a second-class member,''
said Artur Zawisza, cabinet secretary for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Even the euro-skeptics in Poland consider EU membership
inevitable. The prime objective is recognition as something other
than a country in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's success is self-evident. In a dreary stone building
that was once headquarters of Poland's Communist hierarchy during
Soviet times, the Warsaw Stock Exchange now thrives.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't a vivid enough symbol of Central Europe's
transformation in the past decade, consider this: the stock market
moved to bigger quarters. The building might have been spacious
enough to house the party bosses for decades, but capitalism is
busting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main task is to make our nation wealthier,'' said Zawisza.
``That's what all the political discussion is about. It is what our
national psychology is about.''

<P>
   BERLIN _ The view from a snow-covered observation platform above
Potsdamer Platz offers three telling sites.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the spare glass and terra cotta geometry of new and
burgeoning office towers rising from the hubbub and confusion of
construction. This is Sony Corp.'s $5 billion European
headquarters, which is rising alongside Daimler-Benz' new $2.2
billion mega-development with its offices, stores, restaurants,
apartments, Germany's largest casino, a 10-screen cinema, musical
theater and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 men and women in blue work clothes and white
helmets hustle day an night in the largest construction site in
Western Europe -- perhaps anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Next, nearly unseen in the construction, a remnant the Berlin
Wall snakes through the equipment and scaffolding on the plaza,
which until World War II was the pulsing heart of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the old Reichstag -- the old parliament building --
which was torched by the Nazis in 1933 and bombed by the allies in
1945, rises above scores of construction cranes. A new translucent
cupola pops up from the gutted and renovated building, an
architectural marriage of very old Berlin to the future -- a future
that promises big things.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, the bundestadt -- the federal assembly -- will
convene in the Reichstag to elect the nation's next president, the
first official act in the building since Hitler was chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   And next November, most of federal government will finish the
move from Bonn to Berlin, completing a long symbolic journey home.
</P>
<P>
   For Berliners, who have lived through a remarkable decade, it
sometimes seems unreal. ``Berlin is a fantasy,'' said Dirk Kroegel,
a spokesman for the city government. ``It is a dream that seems to
be coming true.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the rising capital of the wealthiest and perhaps most
influential country in Europe. Its importance is expected to grow
with the monetary union, which begins with the introduction of the
euro as the continent's primary electronic currency on Jan. 1.
Bills and coins will begin circulation three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Germany pushed hard for monetary union in hopes of creating a
more stable economic environment for its financial and industrial
prowess to flourish. While the European Commission will remain in
Brussels, the powerful European Central Bank will operate from
Frankfurt. The most powerful national government will be in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, more than 30,000 federal workers and
their families will pack up and move from Bonn to Berlin. An
estimated 70,000 lobbyists, lawyers and other institutions that
travel with government will also move in. Embassies are also
returning to the old capital, including a proposed $140 million
U.S. compound planned for its pre-war site near the Brandenberg
gate in what had been East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The move is costing the German government about $12 billion in
new construction, renovations and moving costs, said Gerda Renatus,
a spokeswoman for the government's office that is coordinating the
move.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to refitting old buildings including Hitler's old
Aviation Ministry new government buildings are rising along central
parts of the Tiergarten and Mitte districts, near where the River
Spree river curves sharply west of the Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   Private construction projects unrelated to the government's move
are worth an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion. The amount of
construction is so vast -- about triple the construction in
pre-Olympic Atlanta and Barcelona combined -- it is hard to soak
in.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the planned $11.5 billion reconstruction of the
Lehrter Bahnhof rail station is underway to provide a 21st-Century
juncture for two great European rail routes: from Paris to Moscow,
and from Stockholm to Vienna. The station will have a 1,400-foot
glass concourse, 58 escalators and 37 elevators. A new airport is
scheduled to open in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boomtown feel of Berlin, the city is in an economic
slump. Office occupancy is less than 50 percent, according to the
city government. The unemployment rates is about 18 percent, and
industrial production has fallen 6 percent in 1998. Things are so
slow that plans for a major new complex of skyscrapers planned for
Alexander Platz in the old eastern sector have been placed on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Things are expected to improve, but not for another five or six
years, officials say. Many business leaders expect the city's
prospects will rise as the economic situation in Russia gets sorted
out. ``Russia will come back, and when it does it will mean a lot
for Germany and Berlin,'' said Joachim Volz, an economist with the
German Institute for Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, truth is no one seems to know what to expect
with the return of the government and the advent of a monetary
union, both of which could have dramatic uncertain impact.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Berliners seem most interested in figuring out the
identify of their city -- a complex matter given its mixed history
and puzzling future. There seems to be a desire to reach back
before Hitler's times to the Berlin of Sally Bowles, the character
played by Liza Minelli in ``Caberet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is like a ghost,'' Koegel said. ``People remember the
way it was before the Third Reich, and they want it the way it was
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is more haunted than Potsdam Platz. In the 1920s, it had
legendary cafes such as Josty and Vaterland, and the hotel
Esplanade was one of Europe's most coveted addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The square was reduced to rubble in the last months of World War
II, and left desolate and overgrown on the dividing line between
East and West Berlin. That all changed in 1989 when the Berlin Wall
came down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years ago, Berliners destroyed the Wall with hammers,''
Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen Schrempp(CQ) said a few weeks ago at
the opening of his firm's development. ``Today we are marking a new
Berlin, a country on the move and a continent that has rediscovered
its equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   With Berlin again at the center.

<P>
   LONDON _ While much of world takes a break at the end of the
year, the dense honeycombs of money-making in central London will
be abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long weekend from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4, The City --
London's financial district -- will swarm with 30,000 bankers,
stockbrokers and computer wizards assembled to make ready for the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   While the new bills and coins won't be around for three years,
the euro will become the electronic currency of choice at the first
of the year. The briefcase-wielding army will face a monumental
mission: Converting millions of electronic financial transactions
to the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on New Year's Eve, European finance ministers in
Brussels will fix the conversion rates between their currencies and
the euro. The Bank of England will then post the rates on computer
screens around The City, setting off a 55-hour race to be ready for
business when the Far East markets open at midnight on Jan 3.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being taken so seriously that some banking
institutions have asked London hotels, where many of the troops
will be housed, to remove the booze from the minibars.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Levene of Portsoken, the chairman of Bankers Trust and the
Lord Mayor of London, said the job is made complicated because
these institutions will be fiddling with something uniquely
sensitive: Other peoples money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my bank, we have two huge task forces, one on the euro and
the other on YK2000, the euro requirement is more difficult,''
Levene, also chairman of Bankers Trust, said at a recent luncheon
at the grand Mansion, what amounts to London City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   A Citibank guide to the euro circulated among corporate
treasurers put it this way, ``It is like the U.S. deciding to
switch to driving on the left by 1999. Moving the steering wheels
on the cars is the easy bit. What to do about the roads, interstate
highways, traffic signs, traffic management, driver education and
so on is far more complex.'' European banks will spend $10 billion
to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Because the euro will be phased in over the next 3 1/2 years on
a largely voluntary basis, American businesses -- like their
European counterparts -- will have to work with both euros and the
old currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the hassle, there are three key advantages for
American businesses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Price transparency: It will be easier to compare prices across
Euroland, making it easier for companies to shop around and,
consequently, forcing more price competition. This also will make
it easier for companies to give their products consistent prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A strengthened European stock market: That would provide
American companies a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Economic stability: Unified interest rates and a broad attack
on inflation will make it easier to manage the business cycle, to
moderate the highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, companies may experience a savings of 25 percent
to 40 percent in bank foreign exchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   For many businesses, the monetary union will create a vast and
exciting marketplace that may look a lot like the United States.
``The country boundaries, the currency boundaries, will be replaced
by boundaries of groups of people who are distinguished only by
their buying preferences,'' said Jim Reed, the director of European
programs for Dell Computer Corp., the Austin, Texas-based computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   A vast restructuring is likely as businesses reassess their
approach to Europe, most likely centralizing and consolidating
operations, said Reed, whose company manufactures its computers in
Ireland and sells them across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is to be able to make sure that we can price,
trade and settle in euros from the first of January within any
country in the euro zone,'' Reed said. ``As customers are ready to
transition to euros, we want to be ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses will switch completely to the euro, billing
customers and paying suppliers electronically in the new
currencies. They will be free to pay employees in euros, which will
be converted into national currencies by their banks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its advantages, no one thinks the change to the euro
will be easy. The most often cited concerns are the long delay
before bills and coins appear, the lack of a single European
government to take responsibility in a banking crisis and varying
pressures on the new -- and ostensibly independent -- European
Central Bank. There also are concerns about ancient national
rivalries that can't be ended by sharing money.
</P>
<P>
   Another big unanswered question is the euro's effect on the U.S.
dollar and economy. Many economists believe that over time, the
euro may challenge the dollar as the world's currency, a status
that brings many rewards and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is in the future, the immediate task is to be
ready for dawn 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Things, after all, can go dreadfully wrong. A power outage is
one popular nightmare scenario. ``What we all fear is the
unknown,'' said Mitchell Shivers, the euro conversion coordinator
at Merrill Lynch in London. ``There is an unprecedented third party
risk, so we have tons of contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that point, Lord Levene sounds Churchillian: ``We are not
just determined to be ready,'' he said. ``We will be ready.''

   ATHENS, Greece _ Pity poor Greece. Three thousand years is a
long slide from grand empire to European also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   The land of Hercules and Mount Olympus is the poorest country in
the 15-member European Union and the only one which wanted to enter
the single European currency, the euro, but couldn't meet the
economic standards. (Britain, Sweden and Denmark chose not to
join).
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Greece was known as the EU's ``black sheep,''
hamstrung by double-digit inflation, labor strife and a colossal
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greece is the only country that wanted to be part of the euro
and could not make the grade. There is a sentiment of exclusion, of
somehow being second-class and less than European,'' said Ilias
Nicolacopoulos(CQ), a pollster and political scientist at the
University of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which joined the EU in 1981, has launched an epic
struggle for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Its failure to become a founding member of the euro club -- the
11 countries which will adopt the single currency on Jan. 1 -- has
resulted in uncommon unity among Greece's notoriously divided
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They resolved to reduce Greece's deficit and improve its economy
by the end of 1999 for possible inclusion in the euro zone by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Athens pushed hard and won the rights to host
the 2004 Olympics. New airports, roads and rail links are under
construction in preparation for the games.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new image taking shape across the Greek isles
and in the minds of Greeks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of being ``European'' is immensely popular. Polls
indicate that the idea of a shared European currency is supported
by two of every three in this country of 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two Greeces: One is in the past. It is heroic and
unique. It celebrated great victories and suffered greatly, too.
The new Greece is simply normal. It has managers and technocrats.
It thinks not in terms of territory and nationalism, but of
economics and pragmatism,'' said Theodore Couloumbis(CQ) of the
Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, a think tank
in the capital, Athens.
</P>
<P>
   To join the core club of EU players like France and Germany
would lend an image of stability to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   That is important in a country worried that violence in the
turbulent Balkans -- notably the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo --
could erupt into a regional war, or that Greece's perennial
disputes with longtime adversary Turkey could unexpectedly explode
into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Prime Minister Costas Simitis and his moderate Socialist
government, Greece's main political factions and industrial leaders
have set out to transform the country into a business and
transportation hub for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from the rest of the EU by the Balkans, Greece is now
looking to make its location an advantage -- as a link between
Western Europe and emerging markets in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 billion tourism industry remains vital to the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But reflecting a new sophistication to broaden its economy,
Greece -- with the help of the EU -- set up a publicly-financed
company to sell foreign investors on Greece's attributes.

   ``Its not just the three S's -- sand, sun and sex -- an image
many in America and Europe have of Greece. It's a place to do
business,'' said Efthimios Mouratidis, project manager for the
Hellenic Center for Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Substance, not image alone, has hampered Greece. Inflation stood
at 22 percent in 1991. Trade union strikes continue to periodically
paralyze the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist government of former Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou, which ruled through most of the 1980's, stoked
organized labor and generally neglected the business community.
Major industries were nationalized. Liberal wage accords caused
industrial productivity to drop, and fed inflation. Papandreou was
driven from office in 1989, returned to power in 1993, but died in
1996 and was succeeded by Simitis.
</P>
<P>
   He initiated a renewed drive to join the single currency. In
all, the EU has contributed about $35 billion to Greece's efforts
to improve its economy and meet the economic criteria to join the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Greece's lingering inflation that could continue to
bar its euro membership. Running as high as 5.3 per cent this year,
Greece must cut it in half by the end of 1999 to meet the target
for euro membership by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the government has remained committed to a program
of slashing state subsidies, eliminating some services, raising
taxes and privatizing state enterprises, where workers once enjoyed
virtual jobs-for-life security.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have left many unhappy. Nearly every labor union has
held some sort of protest against the austerity initiative in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something rotten in the state of Hellas,'' headlined
the daily newspaper Kathimerini in recent special section dedicated
to Greek woes.
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion and political will seem firmly behind the
effort to join the euro. Many Greek businesses, including the
nation's largest supermarket chains, have agreed to freeze most
prices in an effort to hold down inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of replacing the national currency, the drachma, for
the euro is widely accepted, said Nicolacopoulos, because of the
drachma's mercurial history as a shaky currency. An estimated 35
percent of the national economy remains underground, carried out in
dollars, German deutsche marks and other hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   An Athens taxi driver, Costas Samos, says Greeks will always be
Greek. ``We have our own language that is difficult for outsiders,
our own history and culture. I'm not worried about being less
Greek. I am worried that we will be left behind if we don't follow
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But do Greeks really believe the euro will change their lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro offers validation, but not very high expectations,''
said Nicolacopoulos. ``The stabilization of the currency is the
prime objective for Greece. That, and perhaps a little more respect
for our nation.''

   NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France _ Sipping a vintage pomerol in the
sitting room of his small apartment in this pretty Paris suburb,
Franck Berchier laments he may never be able to forget his francs
and centimes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, when he buys something at the market downstairs he will be
forced to go through the same mental calculations of value he
endures when he travels abroad. ``I will see something with the
price of 20 euros, and I will have to think about what that is in
francs so I will know if it is expensive or not,'' Berchier says in
a tone of mild annoyance. ``With the euros, I will be like an alien
in my own country.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for the franc -- and deutsche mark,
lira and peseta for that matter -- will come Jan. 1, when 11
European countries begin switching to the new, unified currency.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the euro will exist only as virtual money in bank and
credit card statements, investment portfolios and on other bills
and pricetags placed by merchants as a reference point and learning
tool.
</P>
<P>
   In January 2002, euro bills and coins will begin circulating.
Six months later the old money will be history.
</P>
<P>
   For Berchier and millions of other Europeans, the demise of a
national currency represents more than just switching money. It
also means the loss of a unique, portable and familiar expression
of who you are. When a French man or woman unfolds a 100-franc
note, he or she sees the familiar and affirming face of the great
French impressionist painter Paul Cezanne. It is a subtle reminder
of what it is to be French, just as the image of Independence Hall
on the back of a US$100 bill is a reminder of what is special about
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the day comes when his wallet holds euros instead of
francs, Berchier wonders if he might feel that much less French and
more something else, something not so clearly understood even after
eons of definition: A European.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the way of the future, isn't it?'' Berchier asks with a
shrug as he takes another sip of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the euro is generally regarded as the next step
in the evolution of Europe from a continent of often quarreling --
occasionally warring -- countries into something bigger. Someday
the union may challenge the United States for the economic
heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Already a unified market, the 11 euro countries -- often called
Euroland -- will become a single economy, a concept not far removed
from the idea of 50 semi-autonomous states operating for business
purposes as the United States of America. Interest rates will be
set by a Central European Bank, which also will deal with a broad
range of economic issues. In theory, this will create economic
conditions in Bonn that match those in Dublin or Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The initial euro club will include Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted not to participate in the
single unified currency, and Greece failed to meet the required
economic criteria.
</P>
<P>
   While the Euroland countries will surrender individual control
over interest rates, inflation management and other economic
policymaking, they will retain authority -- for now -- over
taxation, wages and labor law. Yet, it is widely accepted that over
time, even these politically charged matters will become
standardized.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding theory behind economic union is that the
individual countries will all gain in efficiencies and stability:
the whole will add up to more than a sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders spare few superlatives in describing the advent
of the euro, which is seen as the economic equivalent of the
tearing down of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most significant economic event in Europe's
history,'' said Jim Reed, an executive with Dell Computer Corp.,
the Austin, Texas-based computer maker that builds its products in
Ireland and sells them across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on inflation will be a major benefit in
countries such as Italy and Spain, which have been ravaged by
recurring rounds of price instability over the years. At the very
least, ending the need to change currencies will create an
immediate savings of $40 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro countries can get their act together -- not a small
``if,'' mind you -- then many European economists believe the
continent may in time challenge the United States. On paper
Euroland stacks up nicely against America. The 11 countries have a
combined population of 290 million, 22 million more than the United
States. Each controls slightly less than a quarter of the world's
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are profound differences. Europe is far more divided
by culture, history and language -- even distinct regional
dialects. This problem is easing by the rise of English: When a
German speaks to an Italian, the conversation is in English. A
recent study showed that 63 percent of the people in France can
speak English, while the number is 94 percent in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Euroland believe that their union already has paid
off by easing the impact of a worldwide economic slowdown,
particularly in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already, we have seen the euro work,'' said Joachim Volz, an
economist with the German Institute for Economic Research. ``Our
markets did not suffer from the global crisis nearly as they would
have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Toiling in her tiny office in Neuruppin, 100 miles north of
Berlin, it is sometimes hard for Christine Gerhardt to remember the
grand ideas that possessed Europe's leaders to change to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerhardt, the whole thing is a stomach churning mess.
Gerhardt battles in the euro trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Her job is to prepare the government in this town of 33,000 to
handle the new currency. When the euro fully replaces the deutsche
mark, then parking meters, land taxes, swimming pool fees --
everything -- will have to be billed and collected in euros.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the rubber will meet the road In the summer of 2002,
when moms leading packs of kids show up at the city pool to learn
that price of swimming has jumped because of the euro. The calls
won't go to Brussels or Berlin, they'll go to Neuruppin City Hall.
``People may not understand what happened, and they may be angry,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this former East Germany military center, people for the most
part are ambivalent about the euro, said Otto Theel, the
burgermeister. The city still has its hands full just making the
change from socialism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   For residents, the euro is just another twist in an already
unfamiliar road, Theel said. ``People worry that unemployment,
which is already not good, will go up because people from other
countries will come to Germany because it is a rich country. They
worry how it will effect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, the support for the euro has been declining
for some time. In Germany, the most powerful country in the union,
popular support for the euro has fallen to 43 percent -- exactly
the same as the level of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The word most often used to describe the attitude of the public
is ``resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is doing it because we want to be European,'' said
Emma Davis, an English woman who is married to Franck Berchier.
``We're only doing it because we're scared stiff about America or
Japan knocking the hell out of us if we don't. It's totally
mercenary.''
</P>
<P>
   Profound fears remain that economic unity will lead to the
surrender of political autonomy to some multinational collective of
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Such anxieties seems most acute in Britain, where the press
seems particularly hostile toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were once an island-based empire fighting off these
European invasions for hundreds of years while Americans we're
running around in the woods trying to find a country,'' said
Herbert Smart, a small grocer in Manchester. ``You will excuse us
if we don't embrace the idea of being in this new empire dominated
by the Germans and French.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, a professor of European politics at the London
School of Economics, believes these concerns are exaggerated.
Taylor believes Europe is evolving into a kind of confederation of
independent states with economic decision-making centralized but
conventional government powers retained by the individual
countries. ``I don't see any indication that any of the member
states want to dissolve themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor believes the British should find some comfort in their
own history: Great Britain is itself a collection of different
peoples. ``The Scots and the Welsh and the Irish have survived with
a quite distinct identities in what is a United Kingdom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he acknowledges that many Britons resist even admitting
that they are Europeans. ``But this is different from talking about
views about the relationship with Europe,'' he said. ``The British
public as a whole is resigned to the fact that we're in Europe, and
there's a certain impatience for those who are not prepared to make
the best of this.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the potential benefits of the forging a greater Europe,
there also are worries that cultural diversity may be a casualty of
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One speaks quite a lot about Europe these days, and one speaks
of it as an industrial trust,'' said Jorg-Ingo Weber, an official
in Berlin's municipal department of science, research and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity in culture, language, the things that make
Germany and Europe special, if not protected, will go away. It is
what I call the 'vanilla-ization' of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many view becoming part of a greater Europe not so
much as a cause for celebration as an unalterable reality with
which they must come to terms, particularly in the way they define
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is my home, Germany is my fatherland, and Europe,''
Weber says, ``Europe is my future.''

<P>
   WARSAW _ Poland, like much of the rest of Central and Eastern
Europe, has a clear image of itself in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Anti-Soviet Pact, former satellites of the Soviet
Union eager to shed their association with Moscow and become
clearly linked with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``being European'' is simultaneously appealing
and ambiguous to the nine Central and East European countries
lining up for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
   They know they want to join the club. They simply are not
certain what the fine print will mean, particularly as 11 members
of the union are set to launch a single currency on Jan. 1 and
enter unchartered territory in the realm of economic unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not be completely happy with the EU and what
membership will do for them, but all that is negligible compared to
the prime motivation: They clearly want to draw a line that defines
them with the West and protects them from Russia,'' said a Western
diplomat in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to become the
newest members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next
spring, expanding the Cold War security organization beyond what
had been the iron curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The three nations and others are on a separate path to EU
membership. The crash of Russia's economy last August sent shock
waves through Eastern and Central Europe and reinforced the need
for stronger economic alliances with the European Union and
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the alternative? There is no alternative. We have
nothing to take from Russia. Our path is to the West,'' said Robert
Soltyk, deputy foreign editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's
largest circulation daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has opened membership talks with the front-runners who
hope to join early in the next decade: Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and the Mediterranean island nation of
Cyprus. Another five countries -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania and Slovakia -- will be the second wave to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But expanding the European family is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion will cost around $50 billion through 2006, according
to the European Commission, but nobody wants to pick up the bill.
The European Union's 15 current members are divided over how to
proceed and at what speed.
</P>
<P>
   The applicant countries must adopt some 80,000 pages of
intricate legislation and regulations to conform to EU standards.
It is a daunting task considering that many of the countries, which
concentrated earlier on their economic overhaul, are only now
beginning to tackle significant social reforms and junk old
Soviet-era laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``While speed is desirable, quality is essential. Thus, each
candidate will join only when it is ready,'' said Hans van den
Broek, the EU commissioner in charge of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   With a vigorous entrepreneurial class and billions of dollars in
long-term foreign investment, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic have become the dominant emerging economies of the region.
The signs in Warsaw, Budapest and Prague are unmistakable as
multinationals like Sony, IBM and McDonald's have entered the
markets and illuminated the once-bleak skylines.
</P>
<P>
   Following the collapse of communism a decade ago, Poland enacted
swift and painful economic reforms that worked. Today, only 8
percent of Poland's exports go to Russia, and 64 percent go to the
European Union, a complete turnabout compared to Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Poland also represents the region's largest consumer economy,
with 39 million people. In the last 10 years, more than 2 million
new businesses have been formed, mostly by Poles, spawning millions
of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's economy has slowed as a result of the Russian and Asian
economic shocks, but expanded 5.8 percent in 1998 and is projected
to grow at a hearty 5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such success on its own has led some in Poland to wonder why the
country should rush to join the European Union and take on dictates
from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   More than two out of three Poles support EU membership, though
more than half of them think it will position Poland as a
second-class member in a weak position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mixed feelings. People are wondering whether Poland
should be a second-class country in the big leagues, or a
first-class country in its own league,'' said Lena
Kolarska-Bobinska, director of the Foundation of Public Affairs, a
Warsaw-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Poland also must address massive problems.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, it will cost nearly $30 billion merely to clean
up the environment and bring factories up to EU operating standards
in terms of safety and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity levels still lag well behind Western Europe,
America and Asia. A local joke in Poland goes: ``How many people
work at this factory?'' Answer: ``Half of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge task facing Poland will be the overhaul of its system of
2 million mostly small farms, which employs 27 percent of Poland's
workforce -- 3.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   To become competitive Poland must restructure the system and
consolidate farming into larger operations to make them more
competitive. This, at a time when the EU is trying to reduce its
costly farm-subsidy programs, which consume half of the union's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Poland, we want EU membership to happen as quickly as
possible and we want it to be as good as possible. These can be
contradictory objectives unless we do it right. The worst thing
would be to join and somehow be considered a second-class member,''
said Artur Zawisza, cabinet secretary for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Even the euro-skeptics in Poland consider EU membership
inevitable. The prime objective is recognition as something other
than a country in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's success is self-evident. In a dreary stone building
that was once headquarters of Poland's Communist hierarchy during
Soviet times, the Warsaw Stock Exchange now thrives.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't a vivid enough symbol of Central Europe's
transformation in the past decade, consider this: the stock market
moved to bigger quarters. The building might have been spacious
enough to house the party bosses for decades, but capitalism is
busting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main task is to make our nation wealthier,'' said Zawisza.
``That's what all the political discussion is about. It is what our
national psychology is about.''

 &HT;    IN POOR KAMCHATKA, A GOLD MINE AWAITS -- BUT AT WHAT PRICE?
 &HT;    With photos to be placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.

<P>
   PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia _ Desperately low on fuel to
run its power plants and short of food to feed its people, this
region suffers grim hardships facing much of Russia amid an
economic crisis and a cruel winter season.
</P>
<P>
   What's a poor Russian region far away from Moscow to do?
</P>
<P>
   There's gold in them there hills.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in the pristine, snow-capped mountains of the Kamchatka
peninsula in Russia's Far East is a fortune in gold, platinum,
silver and other minerals.
</P>
<P>
   The riches have remained undisturbed for millennia in a remote
wilderness region that boasts more salmon, bears and eagles than
people.
</P>
<P>
   The volcanic mountains are far from civilization in a vast
peninsula that was cloistered for much of this century by Soviet
secrecy. The region's only city, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, is home
to a nuclear submarine base and an air force base and thus closed
to foreigners and most Russians before the Soviet Union collapsed
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the 400,000 Russians living in Kamchatka have survived
on the bountiful waters that have made this one of the world's
richest fishing regions.
</P>
<P>
   But the seduction of gold is growing as the sea and rivers are
being overfished and the region's other main employer, the
military, suffers cutbacks by the near-bankrupt federal government
5,000 miles away in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be very important for our area, where unemployment
is very high. It would diversify our economy and bring tremendous
wealth,'' said Alexander Gorbunov, director of industry, energy and
mineral resources for the regional government.
</P>
<P>
   Kamchatka alone could provide 10 percent of Russia's gold
production, as much as $10 billion worth to be mined over the next
few decades.
</P>
<P>
   But a vigilant community of environmentalists and anglers has
fought to ensure that any mining will not spoil the idyllic
landscape of volcanoes, rolling hills, rivers and lakes and one of
the world's largest salmon spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold is nice only in a museum. Gold mining is a dirty
business,'' said Robert Moisseev, director of the Kamchatka
Institute of Ecology and Nature Management. ``This business
destroys nature.''
</P>
<P>
   This being Russia, where nothing is easy, getting to the gold is
difficult. Despite the interest of American, Canadian and
Australian mining companies, Russia's tangled bureaucracy and
economic morass have made it difficult to do business.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Western and Russian companies have applied for
permission to mine gold in Kamchatka, but no projects have begun.
The costs are daunting. Roads are poor and helicopters are
necessary to reach the remote region.
</P>
<P>
   The largest proposed project involves a company called Kamgold,
a Russian-U.S.-Canadian joint venture that proposes building an
industrial mining plant in the mountains at Aginskoe. Such plants
produce a potentially dangerous by-product, large volumes of water
tainted with heavy metals and toxins which must be stored in
retention ponds.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four years, the project has been delayed by
environmentalists who have appealed to the Russian government and
the United Nations. The conservationists allege that the mine and
gold-refining plant would pollute the region and the holding ponds
would be susceptible to rupture in the earthquake-prone zone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 10 million acres of the peninsula were placed on the
list of protected World Heritage Sites by UNESCO, the U.N. agency
which oversees the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how heavy the Russian crisis might be, we don't have
the right to spoil the lives of our next generation,'' Moisseev
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the project's investors are armed with reams of impact
studies which conclude that their plant, which will create about
300 jobs, will not spoil the environment. If there is any
substantial hazard, it is to the Westerners attempting to do
business in Russia's rickety economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take any part of the world, and when mining there is a
technical risk and there is a political risk. In Russia, the
technical risk is zero. The political risk clearly is quite high,''
Robert Buchan, chairman and chief executive of Kinross Corp. said
in a telephone interview from Toronto. Kinross holds a 25 percent
interest and is the managing partner in the Kamchatka
joint-venture.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism in 1991, there was a rush of
interest in mining. But the prospects were more attractive when
gold was at $341 an ounce at its high in April 1997. Now the world
price has dipped below $300, and Russia is in the midst of an
economic and banking crisis which has discouraged many Western
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But it has spawned interest among others. By some local
estimates, freelance prospectors panning and digging without
permits are yielding $50,000 to $60,000 worth of gold in the summer
months, before the rivers freeze and snow covers the hills.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how bad the local economy may be,
environmentalists argue that the risks are not worth it for mines
that would be exhausted within 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sequestered for decades by Soviet secrecy and dictated to by
leaders in Moscow, Kamchatka now faces a classic dilemma of
democracy -- economy-vs.-environment -- and must decide its fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mining interests say, 'Look how much we could gain for the
economy.' The fishers and environmentalists say, 'But if you dump
your chemicals in the river we will lose it all.' I think the truth
lies in between,'' said Vladimir Yefimov, a local journalist.

   LOW EXPECTATIONS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Russians have been battered by their feeble economy since the
Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991. Currency devaluation, bank
failures and inflation have reduced their standard of living and
left them with low expectations for life.
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow-based polling firm surveyed 1,600 Russians in late
November about their aspirations. They were asked whether they
expected merely to survive, to live no worse than others or to live
better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they responded:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect simply to survive at the most basic level
................................ 28%
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Want to live no worse than most families in your city/region

<P>
   &QR;  Want to live better than most families in your city/region

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hope to live as well as the middle class in U.S. or Europe

<P>
   MOSCOW _ There is nothing happy about the New Year for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Its erratic post-Soviet economy went into a coma last August and
has shown little signs of life since.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, sick with pneumonia in the fall and
clearly frail throughout the year, remains largely out of sight
from his people and has left a power vacuum at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Russians have lost their jobs, while
millions simply have not been paid for months. The national
currency, the ruble, has lost two-thirds of its value since the
economic crisis struck on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   How bad could 1999 be for Russia?
</P>
<P>
   At least as unpleasant, but likely worse, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation could degenerate as in the former Yugoslavia.
There is a real danger of the population turning to extreme
nationalistic solutions,'' said Judith Shapiro, co-author of a
status report published this month on Russia for the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's drive toward democracy is tentative seven years after
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its deep economic problems have
left the Clinton administration and other Western governments
watching carefully and hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists simply predict more of the same in 1999. The
government under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov continues to
solicit the International Monetary Fund and others in the West for
aid and meanwhile prints more rubles to pay salaries and keep the
economy limping along.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Yeltsin, 67, has turned over virtually all his
responsibilities to Primakov, a consensus candidate for the job
after the August crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet-era spymaster and most recently Russia's foreign
minister, Primakov has plodded forward, concentrating mainly on how
to get Russia through its long winter, but not what to do about its
problems in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a political truce with the Communist-dominated
parliament, he appointed key Soviet-era economists to his
government. The result was political calm, but few economic
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to expect any sharp turn around,'' said Jan
Lundin of the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has announced it will be able to pay only
$9.5 billion out of $17.5 billion in foreign debts in 1999. This
after Russia defaulted on $40 billion in short-term debt --
one-third owed to foreign investors. That move last summer
unsettled the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, the government wrote a federal budget for
1999 based on an assumption that it will receive $7 billion in
foreign loans -- money that may not materialize from the IMF and
other wary donors who lack confidence that Russia can fix its
structural economic mess.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, ordinary Russians are ignoring their
government's deep political and economic predicament. The nation of
147 million is busy trying to survive the harshest winter in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is having difficulty keeping some of its remote areas in
the Arctic and Siberia supplied with food and heating fuel. Some of
the country's more successful regions are hoarding supplies and
cutting ties to the federal government. Poorer regions have
reported that some residents have resorted to eating dogs to stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Russian expectations are low. A recent poll showed most
Russians, 76 percent, simply want to live no worse than their
neighbors. Only 12 percent expressed any hope that they could raise
their living standards to match or exceed America's.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of those polled by the Russian Center for Public
Opinion and Market Research said they expect the economy to worsen
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Political conditions are not much better.
</P>
<P>
   National elections for parliament are scheduled for late 1999,
but presidential elections -- not set to take place until mid-2000
-- could be necessary in 1999 should Yeltsin's health deteriorate
further or another economic shock occur. Potential successors like
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and former presidential candidate, and
now Krasnoyarsk Gov. Alexander Lebed are already marshalling
campaign teams.
</P>
<P>
   Without some outside aid in the form of direct loans, Russia
will be forced to print billions more rubles, which inevitability
will weaken the currency and threaten to spark inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF approved a $22.6 billion bailout for Russia last July --
a deal closely overseen by the U.S. Treasury Department -- but put
it on hold after the August crisis. IMF officials want Russia to
carry out promised market reforms and not lurch back toward
hyperinflation and Soviet-style economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the financial support of the IMF it will be hard for
us to repay the debts. Russia risks becoming isolated financially
and I don't think anyone wants that,'' said Deputy Finance Minister
Mikhail Kasyanov.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is all-out bankruptcy and hyperinflation
-- inflation in the triple or quadruple digits that could make the
forecasted 70 percent figure for 1998 look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflationary problem is like the one with the genie --
once you let it out it is very difficult to put it back in. So you
would have to live with high inflation problems for many, many
years,'' said Lundin.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Russia has asked the IMF to provide a $4.2 billion
loan installment in 1999. IMF officials are planning to return to
Moscow in early January to consider the request. Without it,
Russia's Finance Ministry forecasts that the economy could contract
by 5 percent to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, analysts are talking about years, not
months, for Russia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a status report on Russia in December, World Bank vice
president Johannes Linn said the economy could decline another 10
percent to 15 percent in 1999 but ``could regain momentum over the
next 5 or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the downside, if hyperinflation is not avoided, if
total default on all debts were to be part of an extreme response,
a much more severe decline could be imagined,'' added Linn, who is
responsible for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

NO MALE BASHING, PLEASE 
 FOR USE FRI., DEC. 25, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: People tell me that I'm independent, attractive,
funny, successful and sexy, but I haven't had a date in eight
months. My gay friends say I'm too strong for today's men and
threaten the pants off all of them.
</P>
<P>
   I'd just like a co-equal relationship in which we're both free
to pursue career goals and then come together to enjoy each other's
company, minds, bodies and incomes. I am ready to be a companion
and partner rather than some little girl wanting a daddy. What's
wrong with men today anyway? _ Valley Stream, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Hey _ no male-bashing allowed: Men aren't the problem,
but they aren't the solution either.
</P>
<P>
   We are a society in transition. Many men feel that the gains
women have made in the workplace have been at the expense of the
male ego. They are unsure not only of what women want from them but
don't know if women want them at all. Most men long for the good
old days when everybody had a place.
</P>
<P>
   Since a powerful man can have his choice of females, he most
often will choose one who makes him feel good about himself and
doesn't threaten his masculinity. Powerful women, laboring under
the old-fashioned male standard, naively assume that they too are
entitled to their choice of men in society. They opt for a powerful
man with whom they can be coequal, but that powerful man is opting
for a lesser woman who is willing to defer to his needs. Instant
problem.
</P>
<P>
   As powerful women become more common, as power is redefined, as
relationships and male and female roles are redefined, powerful men
and women may or may not be together, but most likely powerful
women are going to have to decide to deal with a non-traditional
male or choose to revert to a ``traditional'' female role or go it
alone.

   QUESTION: I retired to Costa Rica in 1991 after a career in the
U.S. Immigration Service. At 67, I have a 21-year-old son in
college who has made me very happy, but I am still living with the
regrets of losing my children from my first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Before my twin sons were a year old, I was divorced and ruined
financially. I saw them only twice in the next three years as I
struggled to afford a lawyer to fight for my right to see them. The
judge threatened their mother with jail if she didn't allow me to
see them, but when I arrived to pick them up, the house was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Private investigators finally found them for me when they were
18, but they wanted nothing to do with me and considered me a
stranger. They are now 42 years old and are both dentists in
California. I send letters and cards each birthday and Christmas,
but they do not respond. I am tired of waiting for them to
acknowledge me, but how can I ease decades of pain? _ San Jose,
Costa Rica
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: What a sad situation! The only bond you have with your
twin sons is genetic. From their point of view, you really are a
stranger. We can't undo the past, but we can create family today.
Find some younger adults close by with whom you can become involved
on a daily give-and-take basis. They can serve the function of your
lost children.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Joy, I'm in my final year of a social work degree and
required to take two psychology courses: introductory and child
development. I hate psych and am barely passing. Is there any way I
can make learning about this stuff more interesting? I've tried to
apply it to everyday life situations but that isn't always easy. _
Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I'm a great fan of psychology as well as a
practitioner. Psychology is about understanding why people do what
do they. Before you give up on applying it to everyday life
situations, apply some of that psychological jargon in a little
self-analysis. How are you going to be a social worker if you don't
care about why people act as they do?
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Do I have to tell people my age? I'm single and I
don't know what to say when guys ask me how old I am. I don't want
to lie, but I don't want to turn them off right away. _ Des Moines,
Iowa
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It doesn't have anything to do with being single or
with telling a man your age. I just smile sweetly and say one of
two things: I'm timeless and ageless, or Everyone in my family is
29. I'm 29; my mother's 29, my daughter's 29. Or I'm honest about
it and say I always lie about my age.

THE OSCAR GUESSING GAME GETS UNDERWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slide and black and white photo of Roberto Benigni in ``Life
is Beautiful'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's soon going to be Oscar time again in Hollywood, but no one
seems all that impressed with this year's list of potential
candidates.
 &HT;    ``It's a very thin year,'' laments producer-director Irwin
Winkler of ``Rocky'' (1976) and ``Goodfellas'' (1990) fame.
 &HT;    ``I haven't seen much that's really knocked me out,'' agrees
Steve Tisch, producer of ``Forrest Gump'' (1994) and ``American
History X'' (1998).
 &HT;    Nonetheless both Hollywood veterans are talking _ as everybody
in Hollywood does this time of year _ about the Oscar race in
March.
 &HT;    Who's in, who's out? Whose chances are climbing and whose
momentum has slipped? It's a year the much praised _ some would say
overpraised _ ``Saving Private Ryan'' from Steven Spielberg would
seem to have a lock on a Best Picture nomination. But don't count
on it.
 &HT;    Way back in 1969, the winner of the Best Picture and the Best
Foreign film were one and the same _ Costa Gavras' political
thriller ``Z.'' Could 1999 be the year it happens again with
Italian actor/director/producer Roberto Benigni's hymn to the
positive _ ``Life is Beautiful''?
 &HT;    While ``Saving Private Ryan'' was much admired for its brutal
battle scenes, pundits say it didn't inspire the kind of devotion
that brings Oscars. The Italian contender, on the contrary, sent
audiences into the streets to call their friends, and that's the
kind of momentum that often makes a difference. I wouldn't be
surprised to see a best picture, best actor and director for
Benigni.
 &HT;    This was the year some pricey movies fell by the wayside. Oprah
Winfrey's ``Beloved'' was an expensive bomb. Brad Pitt's ``Meet Joe
Black'' was a disaster as was Robin Williams' ``What Dreams May
Come.'' ``Primary Colors'' was a clever sophisticated adaptation of
a clever sophisticated book _ too clever, some say. So don't expect
much in the way of nominations except the brilliant Kathy Bates a
Best supporting actress candidate for ``Primary Colors.''
 &HT;    This year's surprise hit a la ``The Full Monty'' (1997) could be
``Waking Ned Devine,'' which has charm, Irish blarney, the always
popular lust for life and the kind of independent stamp that these
days often produces winners.
 &HT;    A rival to ``Saving Private Ryan'' could be another World War II
film, ``The Thin Red Line.'' But it didn't open until late
December, and only then in limited release.
 &HT;    In fact many of the big studio contenders this year didn't open
until Christmas. Among them ``Stepmom'' with Susan Sarandon and
Julia Roberts, ``A Civil Action'' with John Travolta, and
Dreamworks animated contender ``Prince of Egypt.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, the later in the year a movie is released the
more likely it is to get a nomination. Early releases sometimes get
forgotten. ``Zorro'' was charming and Anthony Hopkins gave a
performance of style and grace as the elder Zorro. ``The Truman
Show'' with Jim Carrey, on the other hand, is likely to remembered
on Oscar night.
 &HT;    So who's hot and who's not? Don't be misled by critics from the
major cities. The Los Angeles film critics awarded best screenplay
to Warren Beatty for ``Bulworth'' _ a film that moviegoers rightly
ignored.
 &HT;    So here are some likely contenders.
 &HT;    The illness stakes: Emily Watson as cellist Jacqueline du Pre
battling multiple sclerosis in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' versus fellow
British actress Helena Bonham Carter playing a wheelchair bound
victim of Lou Gehrig's disease in ``The Theory of Flight.''
 &HT;    The history prize: ``Elizabeth'' with Cate Blanchett as the
queen versus ``Shakespeare in Love'' with Gwyneth Paltrow _ plus a
great best supporting role by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth.
 &HT;    WW II stakes: In one corner there's Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' and in the other ``The Thin Red Line.'' In the middle is
``Life is Beautiful.''
 &HT;    Smiling through the tears award: ``One True Thing'' with Meryl
Streep, versus ``Stepmom'' with Susan Sarandon. (Streep could tie
herself with her other likely best actress contender ``Dancing at
Lughnasa.'' )
 &HT;    The great book becomes great film stakes: ``Primary Colors''
versus ``A Civil Action'' versus ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    And here are my picks in main categories:
 &HT;    Best Actor: Tom Hanks ``Saving Private Ryan.'' (Unlikely because
he won twice before.) Sir Ian McKellan, ``Gods and Monsters,''
Roberto Benigni, ``Life is Beautiful'' (because he's so talented
and reminds everyone of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.) Jim
Carrey who kept his mugging under control in ``The Truman Show,''
and Edward Norton as the racist skinhead in ``American History X.''
 &HT;    Best actress: Cate Blanchett for ``Elizabeth.'' (Her acting was
Glenda Jackson style and the Academy loves that). Meryl Streep,
``One True Thing,'' Gywneth Paltrow, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Emily
Watson, ``Hilary and Jackie'' (if enough voters see it) and Helena
Bonham Carter for ``The Theory of Flight.'' (because she lost for
the 1997 film ``The Wings of The Dove'')
 &HT;    Best Director: Spielberg for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Peter Weir
for ``The Truman Show,'' Shekhar Kapur for ``Elizabeth,'' Roberto
Benigni for ``Life is Beautiful,'' and John Madden for
``Shakespeare in Love,'' or Terence Malick for ``The Thin Red
Line'' (Hollywood loves a redemption story and Malick is certainly
that.)
 &HT;    Best picture: ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``The
Truman Show,'' ``Life is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love.''

FUR FLIES OVER FURBY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest-selling toy this Christmas is the Furby, a fat,
squat, Gremlin-like thingy that costs $30, assuming you can find
one, which you can't.
</P>
<P>
   As they did with Tickle-Me-Elmo and Cabbage Patch dolls in years
gone by, many parents have convinced themselves that they must have
a Furby. Fights have broken out in toy-store aisles as dazed,
glassy-eyed moms and dads, wired from 300 miles of high-speed
driving, sacrifice their last shred of dignity for a
battery-operated assemblage of microprocessors and cheap, plastic
gears that will most likely cease working long before the tree
comes down.
</P>
<P>
   Listen up, parents: It does not have to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you need to do is stop looking at this Furby
thing as some sort of personal challenge. It is one thing to pursue
a heart or liver transplant obsessively for your sick child; it is
another thing entirely to kick and gouge one another over a fuzzy
doll.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking the Furby habit is a lot like kicking the cigarette
habit: You've got to convince yourself that your life will be
better without a Furby than with it.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you light one up and smoke it, you will probably not get
cancer or heart disease from a Furby. Still, the little suckers
have lots of unappealing qualities over and above the fact that you
can't find one.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Furbys look like a cross among a penguin, an owl and a kitten.
Genetic engineering is a troubling-enough subject, what with
who-knows-how-many identical sheep roaming the planet, without
exposing our children to this kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Furbys talk. Parents should not invite a talking anything into
their homes, let alone the grotesque aftermath of some sick,
twisted cloning experiment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Furbys are of undetermined sex. Kids get all they need of that
kind of stuff from Marilyn Manson music videos. Why encourage it?
</P>
<P>
   _ You can buy a Furby off the Internet for $300. Anytime you
hear the words ``Internet'' and ``buy'' used in the same sentence,
you should grab your wallet with one hand and lock the door with
the other. Add the word ``Furby'' and you are talking serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Furby was invented by a 47-year-old guy named ``Dave.''
Forty-seven-year-old guys named ``Dave'' should be writing
semi-amusing columns for a mid-size, chain-owned newspaper situated
somewhere in the love-bug-infested swamps of Southwest Florida, not
soldering sexually ambivalent pieces of penguins, owls and kittens
together into something that can be bought on the Internet for
$300.
</P>
<P>
   _ Furbys can speak to one another in a language called
``Furbish.'' It is not good to have toys that talk. It is
especially not good to have toys that talk to one another in a
language we cannot understand. While I am not saying that the 2
million Furbys sold so far are plotting world conquest, I think it
is safe to say that if such a thing were to happen, most of us
would sell on the Internet for considerably less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   _ When they're not plotting the overthrow of the human race,
Furbys pout, burp, get bored, make raspberry sounds, sing, dance
and pass gas. Your kids can get all of this stuff for free by
watching ``South Park'' or ``Ren and Stimpy'' cartoons. And no
batteries are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although they respond to the spoken word, Furbys cannot really
carry on a conversation. Do we really need another teen-ager in the
house?
</P>
<P>
   There you go, parents! Feel free to use any or all of these
reasons as you attempt to explain to your grief-stricken child on
Christmas morning why every other kid on the planet got a Furby
except her!
</P>
<P>
   Good luck!
</P>

deadlines.
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: One America elected Clinton, another America
impeached him
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America that impeached President Bill Clinton is strikingly
different from the America that re-elected him just two years ago _
far whiter, far more male, far less female.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are a disturbing feature of the House's action.
In effect, the decision to remove the president from office was
made by the America that voted not to re-elect him in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Run the numbers in three key categories: Clinton's re-election
voters were 58 percent female, 17 percent African American and 31
percent white male. Of the 228 House members who voted to impeach
the president, all but 17 were white and male _ 92.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the impeachment electorate was female and, of
course, the single black vote for impeachment was an infinitesimal
.004 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The skewered demography was there from the get-go, in the
Judiciary Committee as it took up impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 committee Republicans are white. Only one is a woman.
None is black. Nearly half come from the South. Of the 16 Democrats
in the committee, five are African American, three are women. The
Democratic muster leaned to the northeast states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those disparities were sustained when the issue moved to
the full House. Only the regional tilt was righted. (Twenty-five
percent of Clinton's re-election vote came from the 11 former
Confederate states; ditto impeachment.)
</P>
<P>
   This impeachment, when you get right down to it, was the work of
a bunch of 55-year-old white guys sitting around talking to
themselves, and talking themselves into it.
</P>
<P>
   No one could expect that the impeachment vote would be a perfect
match with the electorate or an exquisite microcosm of the
population at large. But disparities this great, especially when
combined with the overwhelming partisanship of the vote, go a way
toward explaining why the radical decision to unhorse the president
strikes so many Americans as inauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   A representative democracy like ours can take a lot of
roughhousing. As mean and defamatory politics has been in recent
years, it still hasn't hit the low set by the richly slanderous
election of 1800 that sent Thomas Jefferson to the White House,
with Sally Hemmings as the Monica Lewinski of her time. No
journalist these days would write the billingsgate the opposition
press routinely heaved at Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drift of the Republican Party into hard-shell
ideology, computer-driven reapportionments that are making more
purely Democratic and purely Republican districts and the now
common resort to personally and mutually destructive political
campaigns are driving large numbers of voters out of the system and
leaving it disproportionately to eager disputants.
</P>
<P>
   To those strains add, now, a divisive impeachment carried out by
a cadre that is not even close to being representative of the
American citizenry. We are, all in all, giving our political system
as severe a testing as it has faced since its breakdown into civil
war. It is a testing prudent managers would have never let happen.

(rl) 
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A caviar connoisseur is someone who relishes the various. Bursting
between the tongue and the roof of the mouth, caviar never tastes
the same. Its flavor varies from fish to fish, region to region,
season to season. That is part of its allure.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the variety is less alluring than it is baffling.
The world of caviar _ from the harvesting to the selling to the
buying and tasting _ has degenerated into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The market is glutted with stale, substandard caviar shipped
before more stringent import regulations took effect in April,
although fresh, pristine caviar imported since then is also
available. For the first time, a significant amount of caviar is
being imported from China. Add the growing amount of farm-raised
caviar from California, Russia and France, and you get an array of
choices that can be thrilling _ and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the confusion is mostly a symptom of transition.
The new regulations from the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, or Cites (the acronym is pronounced
SIGHT-ease), seek to protect the threatened sturgeon by regulating
its harvesting and the taking of its caviar. By April 1999, people
in the industry say, the substandard caviar predating the
regulations will be gone. Labeling will be clearer, quality will be
more consistent and prices will reflect the grade of the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, buying caviar this season is complicated, and a
mistake can be costly: Beluga is going for as much as $150 an
ounce. ``What's so great about this?'' is a perceptive response to
the taste of most caviar being sold in New York right now.
</P>
<P>
   And if all that weren't enough, last week three distributors
were indicted on federal charges of smuggling illegal caviar into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   News like this compounds the confusion that has surrounded
caviar since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the source of most
caviar. Before, a central authority controlled the caviar industry
and protected the sturgeon stock and, ultimately, the consumer.
Today the Caspian Sea waters that were regulated are worked by
fishermen from two independent republics (Kazakhstan and
Azerbaijan) and two Russian regions (Astrakhan and Degestan),
producing caviar whose taste and quality are completely
unpredictable. Overfishing and poaching are rife, as are unskilled
handling and processing of the precious roe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the American trade embargo against Iran, no Iranian
caviar can be legally imported into the country, but some caviar
dealers are nevertheless using the Iranian grading system as a
marketing tool. Triple-zero beluga was the best, double-zero second
best, single-zero runner-up; A-rated osetra was top-grade, B
something less. Sevruga was graded 1 (best) and 2 (second best).
But those grades are not reliable indicators of quality. Even the
Russian term malossol, which means ``little salt,'' is a marketing
tool; the saltiness varies from tin to tin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to anarchy on the banks of the Caspian, there are
the newcomers. China has developed a caviar industry that is
shipping tons of caviar to the United States this year. Fishermen
along the Mississippi River are landing hackleback sturgeon, and
the roe from those fish is being sold as caviar, along with that of
paddlefish from the Great Lakes. Stolt Sea Farms in Sacramento,
Calif., has developed some excellent caviar from farm-raised
sturgeon, as have five tiny sturgeon farms in France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are trying to wedge these new varieties into the
three traditional classes of caviar _ beluga, osetra and sevruga _
thus diminishing the meaning of those terms. Other retailers are
coining names like Royal Black for the new caviars, which may be
poetic but say little about the taste, quality or provenance of the
roe.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to clarify the meaning of the traditional terms,
and to assess the most serious contenders among the new types of
caviar, I recently convened a panel of six tasters to compare 16
types.
</P>
<P>
   To compose the panel, I surveyed a dozen of Manhattan's top
chefs for the caviar tasters and purveyors they most trusted, and
combined their suggestions with my own experience buying caviar
over 15 years in Manhattan. The panelists were Eric Ripert, chef of
Le Bernardin; Eve Vega, president of American operations for
Petrossian, which has offices in Paris and New York; Hossein
Aimani, owner of Paramount Caviar in Manhattan; Rod Mitchell, an
owner of the Browne Trading Company in Portland, Maine; Florence
Fabricant, who writes about food for The New York Times, and
myself. We sampled wholesale specimens, which are often repackaged
under a retailer's own name.
</P>
<P>
   We found that 1998 is not a good year for sevruga, the scarcest
caviar right now, but is fairly good for osetra and beluga, the top
types, from Kazakhstan. The quality of Astrakhan caviar is
inconsistent. And we were stunned to find the Sterling caviar,
which comes from farm-raised sturgeon in California, comparable to
the best osetra.
</P>
<P>
   But the main object of the tasting was not to rank the samples _
indeed, we tasted only the best caviar that is available. Our
effort was to identify the characteristics of the main types of
caviar being sold in New York City today, and to compile a sort of
Baedeker of caviar _ a guide to buying, selecting and enjoying the
season's ultimate indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Techniques
</P>
<P>
   Would you buy a diamond without seeing it? Don't buy caviar
without sampling it first, and don't be intimidated _ it is
customary to ask for a taste. And if you don't like what you taste,
don't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh caviar should glisten; upon close inspection, the eggs
should be luminous, pert-looking and consistent in size and color.
If they look noticeably different, different grades of caviar may
have been mixed together and the offering inaccurately labeled and
overpriced. Smashed or misshapen eggs are likely to have been
mishandled or frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar should not smell fishy. The grains should be firm, but
not rubbery or tough. Hard grains usually mean that the caviar has
been pasteurized, which destroys its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   For higher-priced caviars, the purveyor should be able to show
you a copy of his Cites permit, which includes a detailed account
of where the fish was harvested and processed. (The fish will be
identified by its Latin name _ Huso huso instead of beluga, for
instance). If you are spending top dollar, you are paying for
freshness; you want evidence that it was harvested last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting Techniques
</P>
<P>
   Use small spoons made of bone or mother-of-pearl, which do not
affect the flavor of caviar. (Most metal spoons impart unpleasant
metallic notes; even plastic is preferable.)
</P>
<P>
   Before tasting, inhale the aroma; there should be very little.
Then slip the caviar into your mouth. As it sits on your tongue,
pull a little air into your mouth, close your eyes and, without
hesitation or any attempt at delicacy, crush the eggs by forcing
them against the roof of your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate taste should be oceanic. The middle sensations
should evoke earthier things: fruit, nuts, even truffles. The final
sensation should be a slight brininess, tinged with the sort of
coppery nuance of a Belon oyster. The overall impression is the
balance of the disparate sensations in the mouth. This final
equation lingers; don't rush to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Varieties
</P>
<P>
   BELUGA (Huso huso, $50 to $150 an ounce). The king of the 27
varieties of sturgeon that produce edible roe, beluga has a snub
nose and the appearance of a pit bull. It can grow 20 feet long and
weigh a ton. It takes 15 to 20 years to reach maturity, lives about
150 years and can contain up to 15 percent of its body weight in
roe.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in the Caspian Sea, where temperatures can become
tropical in the day and freezing at night, seem to produce the most
succulent beluga.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, beluga caviar is pale to steel gray; the eggs are
the largest, and perhaps the most tender. The texture is buttery,
and the flavor is the most delicate of all caviar; it should taste
less salty than oceanic. Beluga can have hints of nuts or fruit and
can finish with a subtle copper taste or a delicate herbaceous
flavor, depending on its origin.
</P>
<P>
   This year's beluga from Kazakhstan, a seat of the caviar
industry from the days of the czars, has a nice bead that tends to
be quite large. The flavor is very buttery; the texture creamy; the
overall impression sultry and deep.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from Astrakhan can be the most pronounced in flavor, yet
most subtle of all. But production difficulties have made the
supply inconsistent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian beluga is almost always from the old Guryev fishery and
is milder and mushier this year than beluga from Kazakhstan or
Astrakhan. While the fruitiness is pronounced, it tastes more
acidic than delicate.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from the Sea of Azov is very mixed in quality this year.
It tends to have a small egg, closer to black than gray. While it
can have a mild, creamy taste, the muddy flavors of the egg tend to
overpower all other nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from the Amur River, which forms a part of the
Russian-Chinese border, is not impressive. The eggs vary and tend
to be smallish and very separate, with a greenish hue. They have a
sharp, herbaceous taste that is not unpleasant, but not buttery,
either. If the taster were not expecting the rich creaminess of a
Caspian beluga, Amur River caviar might represent a whole new
tasty, affordable world.
</P>
<P>
   OSETRA (Acipenser gueldenstaedti, $14.50 to $75 an ounce). The
fish has an elongated jawbone like a swordfish and can grow to 7
feet long and about 400 pounds. It reaches maturity in 12 years,
lives about 40 years and can contain nearly 3 pounds of roe. Chefs
tend to prefer osetra to beluga: the egg is firmer, and the color
varies from gold to dark brown. Osetra is rich and nutty tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan has produced a large quantity of osetra this year. It
has a large, light-colored bead, often tortoise-shell in tone, with
a rich hazelnut flavor and a clean, smooth, oceanic taste.
</P>
<P>
   Russian osetra from Guryev comes in two distinct types this
year. One has a smaller bead, with a pronounced briny flavor and
tart finish. It tastes peppy and young, but doesn't have its usual
voluptuousness. The other has a big, voluptuous bead, a tawny color
and a rich, almondy taste.
</P>
<P>
   Osetra from the Amur River is very mixed in quality but has been
steadily improving as China's processing improves. Caviar labeled
Amur River most likely comes from China, and like the beluga, the
osetra grade is typically fresh and sprightly. It's a nice,
easy-eating caviar _ good but very different from its Caspian Sea
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   FARMED AMERICAN STURGEON (Acipenser transmontanus, $35 an
ounce). Domestic caviar has come into its own this year. Virtually
all of it comes from Stolt Sea Farms in Sacramento, whose top grade
is called Sterling caviar and is comparable to Kazakhstan osetra in
both quality and price. The bead is small and firm, with a lively
pop, a subtle hint of the sea and a deep, pronounced hazelnut
flavor. The color ranges from violet to a nearly cream-colored
gold, touching all the steely and tawny points between.
</P>
<P>
   SHIP (Acipenser nudiventris, $12 to $23 an ounce). The ship, a
Caspian Sea sturgeon, is being most closely monitored because its
numbers are dwindling. It is traditionally mixed with osetra or
sevruga. This year, with mixing illegal, some ship caviar is being
sold on its own. It falls between osetra and sevruga in appearance,
but has a flavor like that of sevruga _ intense, but with an odd
and indefinable musty, dusty aftertaste. The bead tends to be quite
dark and small.
</P>
<P>
   SEVRUGA (Acipenser stellatus, $7 to $25 an ounce). This is the
smallest of the three sturgeon that produce luxury caviars, at a
little over 5 feet and 70 pounds. It matures in seven years but
produces precious little caviar, an average of a little over 11
pounds per fish. Because it matures young, sevruga sustained the
most damage from overfishing after the breakup of the Soviet Union
and is therefore the most likely to be mixed with ship caviar, or
roe from American hackleback or paddlefish.
</P>
<P>
   The best comes from Russia this year: tiny, glittering, nearly
black eggs with a characteristically intense flavor, deep on the
briny side, with a dark, dangerous sexiness as opposed to the
languid sensuality of both beluga and osetra. Very, very little
good sevruga is available.
</P>
<P>
   KALUGA (Huso dauricus, $15 to $25 an ounce). This sturgeon is
harvested from the Amur River; if it is landed on the eastern
banks, it is Chinese; on the western banks, Russian. The eggs are
firm, large and beautiful; they seem to glow a deep olive green and
tortoise. Their taste is less breathtaking: lighter, fresher and
younger than Caspian beluga. Kaluga shares part of its Latin name
with beluga and is often mislabeled either beluga or osetra,
depending on the size of its egg.
</P>
<P>
   PRESSED CAVIAR (About $15 an ounce). A jammy confection made of
broken beluga, osetra and sevruga, this can be very good indeed. If
you plan to cook with it _ in an omelet, as a topping for potatoes,
as a filling for crepes or even blini _ pressed caviar is an
economical option. Unfortunately, very little good-quality pressed
caviar is available this year.

Apple giving it the old college try 
By Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Apple's heyday, universities and colleges were a
bedrock of support. The company sold Macs to top universities at a
steep discount, and students became Apple Computer enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Many in academia remain Apple Computer fans, but support for the
company has seriously eroded over the past several years. Macs no
longer dominate college campuses. Some colleges, such as Yale, are
even trying to steer students away from Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Apple Computer is making a renewed push into higher
education. It has restored its advisory council of college
officials and announced a new program designed to encourage
students to develop software for Macs.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has created focus groups of students, deans and
professors. One of the things these focus groups have been looking
at is a new, low-cost portable computer Apple Computer hopes to
release sometime next year. This portable will be marketed
especially to the college market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to wade back into higher education,'' Interim
Chief Executive Steve Jobs told a technology conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Apple Computer reigned supreme on college campuses,
and Jobs was responsible for that. During his first tenure at Apple
Computer during the 1980s, he targeted both universities and their
students as an important market for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs created a unique partnership with higher education called
the Apple University Consortium. It consisted of representatives
from 24 elite campuses.
</P>
<P>
   These colleges agreed to buy thousands of Macs at prices up to
50 percent off retail. It was a winning combination that helped
establish the Mac in its early years.
</P>
<P>
   But then Apple Computer began to take colleges for granted, and
it lost much of its share in this market. Some are skeptical Apple
Computer can regain much of the lost ground. But the company is
determined to give it the old college try.

GOLF SCORES NO LONGER A HANDICAP FOR SOFTWARE INVENTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALAN D. ABBEY   
 c.1998 Albany Times Union   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ John Pritchard, a bank association
executive and avid golfer, had a problem. He wanted to play exotic
golf games with complicated scoring methods such as Nassau,
Scramble, Vegas and others even more obscure for those who like to
bet a few dollars on the side.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't keep up with the scoring _ and didn't like
relying on a partner who kept scratching out numbers on a small
piece of paper with a nub of a pencil. So he did something about
it. He invented a computer program that fits on certain types of
hand-held computers, allowing individuals and golf foursomes to
keep score of one or even multiple golf games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a golfer, I knew what I needed,'' he said. Now, three
years after first coming up with the idea, the businessman and
councilman in the upstate New York town of Clifton Park wants to
license the program to a computer manufacturer and sell it over the
Internet to other golf-obsessed individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Score Pro, allows entry of golf course information,
player handicaps, game choices and wagers prior to a golf round.
The program automatically calculates scores and winnings. Unlike
some other golf scoring programs, he said, it permits recalculation
is someone enters an incorrect score.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more or less a hobby for me,'' said Pritchard, who is
now entering into negotiations with Philips Electronics,
manufacturer of a hand-held computer with enough computing power to
operate the software. But the project has occupied him for evenings
and weekends as he ran, tested and debugged the software through a
contract with the General Electric Co. He is now at the stage that
the product is being marketed for $39.95 on its own website
(http://www.scorepro.com).
</P>
<P>
   He also plans ads in the catalogs that come with certain
hand-held computers. The program runs on hand-held machines with
16-bit processors, a hefty amount for a small machine, as well as
certain Psion devices. At the moment the machine does not run on
the popular Palm Pilot series of pocket organizers, which do not
have enough computing power.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard would not say how much he has invested in Score Pro,
only saying that the figure is substantial. Nor will he say how
much he expects to earn from the project. But he said he is turning
down initial offers of investment capital because he does not want
to give up any equity in the company he has created to own the
software, Sandtrap Software Llc.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not give up his job as executive director of
the Independent Bankers Association of New York State Inc. in
Albany, he said.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my little girls wants a microscope for Christmas. She's
liable to end up with two, thanks to my stupid approach to on-line
shopping. Look upon my folly, and beware.
</P>
<P>
   Locating an Internet shopping site that sells microscopes isn't
a problem. Plenty of on-line retailers carry them. I quickly found
one at eToys (http://www.etoys.com), a clean, well-designed site
with lots of Christmas booty. But after filling up an electronic
shopping cart with the microscope and several other items, I held
off on buying, in order to do a bit more research.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I'd decided to close the deal, eToys was fresh out
of microscopes. Frustrating, yes, but also convenient. The eToys
site is linked directly to its inventory system, so when it runs
out of something, shoppers find out immediately, and can start
looking elsewhere. Many other on-line stores keep on selling
product long after they've run out. It may be a day or two before
you're told the goodies are not on their way.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, for instance, ordered some educational software from
the ebWorld site (http://www.ebworld.com), which is run by the
well-known Electronics Boutique retail chain. A day later, it
e-mailed him to say that the software was sold out, and would he
mind waiting for them to backorder it? At another time, perhaps,
but not 10 days before Christmas. The boss is now waiting to see
how long it takes ebWorld to cancel his order.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I placed my truncated order with eToys, then began a
search for the missing microscope. Any of the major Internet search
engines will serve; indeed, most of them have separate listings of
on-line retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping area of the Yahoo search service listed a retailer
in Ohio who sold an appealing microscope for children. I'd never
heard of the retailer before--just some small Midwestern company
that had hustled itself onto the Internet. But what of it? When
you're rushing to make newspaper deadlines and play Santa, there's
a temptation to buy from the first shopkeeper you see.
</P>
<P>
   I placed the order, but my Microsoft Web browser crashed right
at the end of the transaction--go ahead, laugh. This small disaster
left behind a residue of uncertainty. Did the deal go down, or not?
A call was made to the merchant's toll-free number and was shunted
to a voice mail system, which announced that it was accepting no
messages, because the mailbox was full. A day later, it's still
full. So we have a merchant who can't be bothered to answer its
phones. Or its e-mail, for that matter--I tried that too, with no
results.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go back to Yahoo and demand satisfaction from one of
their listed merchants? Because Yahoo explicitly warns customers
that they take no responsibility for the stores they list. Other
Web sites, such as Excite, offer a listing of certified retailers.
Buy from them, and Excite pledges you'll be satisfied. But Yahoo
leaves its customers twisting in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo makes no secret of its retail policies, and it was my
fault for ignoring them. And the retailer may be an honest outfit
swamped by Christmas orders. My order could be on the way right
now. Trouble is, I have no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd done my homework before ordering, I'd have noticed that
the merchant doesn't seem to belong to any of the various
consumer-protection groups now watchdogging the on-line shopping
business. There's the Better Business Bureau's BBBOnline
certification, for instance, or the consumer privacy seal of
approval offered by TrustE. These are signs of a trustworthy
outfit. Or I could have shopped on a Web site or on-line service
that guarantees satisfaction. The America Online shopping network
offers ironclad guarantees; if one of its merchants don't come
through, AOL promises to back you up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I got careless, and with Christmas eight days away, my
blunders won't come cheap. I must hunt up another microscope,
either on line or in person at some crowded mall. There's a chance
that my little darling will wind up with two microscopes. Maybe she
and her sister will open a pathology lab, to help pay for college.
That'd be some comfort to their old man, an Internet veteran who
misplaced all his hard-won savvy just in time for Christmas.

SINGING THE RIO BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weighing just 4.4 ounces with its stereo earphones and AA
battery, the Rio PMP300 is nevertheless a force to be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough to fit comfortably in your hand, the Rio looks like
a Walkman. But instead of using cassette tape, the Rio has a
computer chip. It plays digital music that you can record yourself
or download over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio is the first piece of consumer electronics equipment to
play music compressed with the MP3 system. Over the last six months
MP3 has become a recording industry phenomenon. There are literally
thousands of computers on the Internet that are filled with pirate
copies of MP3-encoded songs --- most of them in college dorm rooms.
Yet at the same time there are a growing number of legitimate Web
sites that are selling licensed MP3 songs --- goodnoise.com sells
singles for 99 cents a track --- with royalties going to the
artists. Meanwhile, a growing number of bands have realized that
giving music way on the Internet is a good way to promote their
live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 players terrify the recording industry. That's because once
you download an MP3 file, there's nothing that prevents you from
e-mailing the song to a friend. Unlike cassette tapes, computers
make perfect digital copies of MP3 files. And each MP3 file is
untraceable: there is no way to tell who was responsible for the
original copyright violation (if there was one in the first place).
</P>
<P>
   What the Rio lets you do is to take these MP3 songs, put them in
your pocket, and listen to them wherever you go. The Rio connects
to your computer through the parallel port and comes with a cable,
earphones, and even a AA battery, which reportedly lasts 14 hours.
The unit comes with 32 megabytes of memory, enough to hold 6 or 12
songs, depending on whether the MP3s are compressed to allegedly CD
quality or near-CD quality. There's also a slot on the bottom of
the device that let's you expand the Rio's memory using standard
compact flash cards, the kind that are getting popular on digital
cameras. Diamond sells a 16 megabyte 3.3 Volt memory card for
$49.95; you can find 48 megabyte cards on the Internet for about
$200, and they should work with the device. Given trends, these
prices will only go down.
</P>
<P>
   What I find the most disappointing about the Rio is not what it
does, but what it doesn't do. It would have been really neat if the
unit displayed the name of the song being played, rather than just
the track number and the number of seconds into the song. I wish
the fast-forward and rewind features let you hear the music as it
drifted by. I wish it had a built-in stop-watch, so that the Rio
could be used as a sports Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   As far as portable music machines go, in fact, the Rio has is
pretty average. Since it's solid-state, it can't skip. The Rio has
buttons that let you skip forward or backwards in the playlist or
play the songs in random order. It has a special intro mode that
plays the first 10 seconds of each song. It has volume buttons and
four equalizer settings: Jazz, Rock, Classical, and Normal. The
only way to record is by using your desktop or laptop computer and
then downloading the music into the device.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this doesn't compare favorably with my new my Sony
MiniDisc Walkman. It weighs 7 ounces, it doesn't skip either, and
holds 74 minutes of music. Perhaps more important, I can record
with it. While the MiniDisc it costs about $100 more than the Rio,
you can buy MiniDiscs for $5 a piece --- much cheaper than a memory
card. And you can still download MP3s from the Internet, you just
have to take the extra step of recording them yourself onto disc.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with two programs that that run on Windows 95
(sorry Macintosh fans). The first is the Rio control program, which
lets you download MP3 files into the system. The second is Music
Match, a program that lets you take tracks off your own CDs and
turn them into MP3 files --- a process that's called ripping. The
etymology of this word isn't from ripping off, but from the Raster
Image Processors that are used in the computer graphics industry. A
RIP is a program that converts images in one form, usually in
PostScript, to another form that can be printed on a high-quality
printer. MusicMatch is a completely legitimate program that lets
American citizens exercise their rights under the 1992 Audio Home
Recording Act to make home recordings of their own music.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way that the Recording Industry Association
of America sees it. The RIAA, a trade group that represents record
labels, sees Rio and MusicMatch as one of the biggest threats to
profits since, well, the cassette tape. Back in October the
association filed suit and was granted a restraining order in
federal court to halt the sale and distribution of the Rio PMP300.
That injunction was quickly overturned. The court ruled that since
the Rio was incapable of recording, and since there was no way to
get the music out of the device, it didn't violate the recording
act. MusicMatch, meanwhile, doesn't fall under the recording act's
purview because the law specifically exempts computers and computer
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawsuit against the Rio is continuing, the case may
be moot. On Tuesday, Diamond Multimedia announced that it would be
joining an RIAA coalition that will develop a standard for bringing
security to digitally recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   What the industry fundamentally wants is the best of both
worlds, to be able to keep itself as a middleman between the bands
and the fans. Doing this means having a system that lets fans
download music over the Internet but prevents them from sharing the
music with their friends, or even make a second copy for
themselves. Systems like this already exist in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   What the recording industry is sure to discover, however, is
that copy protection is ultimately a lost cause. At the very least,
people will always be able to hook up their MiniDisc recorders to
their computers and record the music that comes out of the
speakers. That's why the recording industry would do better stop
dreaming up ways to kill devices like Rio, and start trying to
figure out ways to embrace this new technology. Time is running
out.

 How to Fix A PC After An Outage  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I was using my computer when the lights went out in
San Francisco last week. The power went out, came back on after a
second, then went out again. When power was finally restored, I got
back on the computer and found there were some problems that I'm
not sure I can fix.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the keys on the keyboard are sporadically not
responding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four of the icons on the Windows desktop have changed to small
numbered Windows icons that don't show exactly what they do.
</P>
<P>
   _ When typing in Word, I see flashes of the red and green
underlines throughout the page.
</P>
<P>
   _ The scanning light in my scanner is on all the time. So I had
to unplug it.
</P>
<P>
   Do I need to get a repairman, or is this something I can fix
myself? I have a service agreement with Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  OK, here's what you do. Open the computer case, scoop
out the innards and use it as a planter box. Just kidding. Since
you have the service agreement, I'd get on the phone to Gateway.
But if you want to have a go at it yourself, here are a few things
you can try.
</P>
<P>
   First, run the ScanDisk program, which you'll find in the System
Tools folder inside the Accessories folder in the Windows Programs
menu. ScanDisk will check your hard drive for errors, and fix
anything minor (assuming ScanDisk itself hasn't been damaged).
</P>
<P>
   After running ScanDisk, restart the PC. If you still have
problems (and you probably will), reinstall Windows, Word and any
other damaged applications. Also reinstall the driver for your
scanner. If, after doing all this, you've still got trouble, it
probably means the power surge frazzled something in the computer's
circuit system. And for that, you'll need a technician.
</P>
<P>
   Too Good to Be True
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me if the Internet service provider AtBigger.net
has gone under? They offered lifetime service for $60, and I signed
up. But now all access numbers are busy constantly and their
customer service numbers have been disconnected. Also, is there
another ISP that offers lifetime service for even a little more
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: AtBigger.net is a classic example of the adage, if something
seems too good to be true, it probably is. The San Jose company
couldn't survive with its pricing scheme, even though it amassed
some 40,0000 customers. It was acquired in October by Brigadoon, a
Seattle-based ISP which also is having financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brigadoon reported on its Web site
(www.brigadoon.com) that all access to AtBigger.net had been shut
down. It said it is working to restore service, but didn't say how
long that might take. You can try phoning them at (206) 652-9365
(they're in Seattle), or by sending e-mail to admin(AT
SIGN)brigadoon.com.
</P>
<P>
   As for other ISPs, I don't know of any in Northern California
that offer lifetime service. It certainly doesn't appear to be a
profitable way to run a business. However, many ISPs will give you
service for as little as $8 a month if you sign up for a year in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Printing Problem
</P>
<P>
   Q: In printing a document in Microsoft Word, is there a way to
make the ``current page'' the default rather than ``All?''
Sometimes I want to print on both sides of the paper. But Word
won't let me pause while printing so I can reverse the paper and
thus do it in one operation.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't change the default, but there is a way to work
around it. In the Print window, type in just the odd numbered pages
_ 1,3,5 etc. When the printing job is finished, turn the printed
pages around and print on the back using the even numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Tower or Desktop
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advantages does a tower PC have over a desktop model?
And which would you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A: Full-sized towers generally have more room inside than
desktops for adding things like video and sound cards and extra
hard drives. But the trend is toward minitowers, which don't offer
any advantages. If you plan to add components, look for a big tower
such as the Hewlett-Packard Pavilion series, which is designed for
easy expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, there's no difference between a tower and a
desktop. It comes down to whether you want the computer on the desk
or on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your computer crashes, or you get a new one, you're going to
have to re-enter information that's necessary to log onto your ISP
and any other online accounts that you have, including banking and
customized Web pages. So do yourself a favor and write down all
your user IDs, passwords, log-on phone numbers and DNS numbers and
keep them somewhere safe.

FOUND IN OHIO: THAT `YOU'VE GOT MAIL!' GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a deep and resonant voice, pleasant enough but ever so
slightly affected. It's not exactly James Earl Jones, but more
along the lines of Ted Baxter in the old ``Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
And it's vaguely familiar, the kind of distinctive sound that makes
you think, ``Have I met this guy before?''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you haven't met Elwood Edwards, whose Dickensian
name is as memorable as his voice. Unless, perhaps, you've wandered
through the booming metropolis of Orrville, Ohio, where he lives
with his wife, Karen. But you may be one of the 14 million
subscribers who hear his voice all the time on America Online. He's
the ``Welcome. You've got mail!'' man, the guy behind the
relentlessly perky greeting the on-line service has used since
1989. He's also the voice of ``File's done'' and the inevitable
log-off, ``Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are icons and there are icons. Elvis and Einstein are
big icons; Elwood Edwards is a ``Jeopardy'' question icon, a nice
man who unwittingly became the voice of the biggest on-line service
provider in the business. He never applied for the job of the
mailman; he never asked to extend the welcome mat. It just worked
out that way. Back in September 1986, he was a broadcast announcer
in the Washington area; out of curiosity, he bought his first
computer, a Commodore 64, which is now a museum relic. The computer
came with software called Q-Link, which was the on-line service of
Quantum Computer Services (which later became AOL). He decided to
check it out and ended up in a chat room for Christians. ``I
received an on-line message from KarenJ2, and it simply said,
`We're almost neighbors.' '' He lived in Gaithersburg, Md.; she
lived in Fairfax, Va. ``It was just friendly conversation, and we
chatted on line every once in a while over the next few months,''
says Edwards, 49.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberbuddies eventually met for dinner. ``It was July 6th of
1987,'' the man with the voice recalls. They got married the next
year. At the time, Karen was working in Quantum's customer services
department, and one day, she overheard AOL founder Steve Case and a
few programmers discussing adding a voice to the service. ``She
said, `Why don't you try El? He's a broadcaster.' '' Try him they
did. Edwards recorded the four phrases on a cassette recorder, and
they've been using those simple recordings ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm the mailman, always bringing good news,''
he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He's not employed by AOL, never has been. He allows that he has
received compensation for his voice, which the company says is
heard 27 million times a day. ``I'll go so far as to say that my
relationship with AOL is very satisfactory,'' he admits, ``but I
don't elaborate any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most AOL members tend to think the voice is computer-generated,
but that's likely to change soon. The ``Welcome'' man is heard
repeatedly in the upcoming film, ``You've Got Mail,'' a sort of
cyber love story starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Edwards hopes to
generate interest for the voice-over business he runs out of his
home after the film is released. (You can see his photograph and
hear ``the voice'' at his Web site, members.aol.com/voicepro.)
</P>
<P>
   A silver-haired, bespectacled man who stands at 6-foot-6,
Edwards has been in the broadcast business since he was a teenager
in North Carolina. ``I made a pest of myself at the local radio
station,'' he recalls. ``I had fallen in love with the idea of
being a DJ, and the people at the radio station figured, `If we
don't do something with this kid, he'll never stop hounding us.' I
became a DJ back then.''
</P>
<P>
   He's worked steadily in both television and radio announcing,
selling products, that sort of thing. He's not exactly recognized
every day for his quirky contribution to on-line lore: ``I don't
walk around saying, `You've got mail,' '' he notes. His wife,
however, will tell anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will be talking about the mailman in the chat
rooms on AOL, and women will say they've had a crush on `that
little man' for years,'' says Karen, whose own voice comes out an
octave higher than her husband's, with a distinct drawl. ``I pop up
and say, `That little man is 6-foot-6.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Edwardses are certainly one of the first _ if not the first
_ married couples to have met in an on-line chat room, which is a
small claim to fame. Were they a tad nervous about meeting in
person? ``I was a lot nervous,'' Karen says. ``I almost didn't show
up. My friends thought I was crazy and said he could have been an
ax murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just the mailman, though, even though he hasn't written a
postal letter in quite a few years. ``I like to think I have a
friendly voice and it doesn't grow old,'' he says, before
delivering that oh, so familiar sign-off. You know how it goes,
deep with a slightly lower tone on the second syllable:
``Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  At 20, Sage Weil is another aspiring DJ, but not on the
radio; he just likes spinning at parties and raves in his spare
time. Like Edwards, he's a bit of an icon in the on-line world, a
community where a simple idea can reach millions. Weil invented the
Webring, an alternative to search engines or hubs that enables
users to navigate the Web through rings of themed sites hooked
together in a virtual circle.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, Weil was a high school junior in Ashland, Ore. A
computer user since the fourth grade, he started his own Web site _
``mostly ranting and raving'' _ and linked it manually to sites
launched by his friends. In August of that summer, he was visiting
his father in Northern California; ``I was bored, so I wrote a CGI
(common gateway interface) script'' that enables webmasters to hook
their sites together in a ring. By clicking on hypertext links at
the bottom of the page, users can jump to the next site in the ring
or choose a random site or obtain a list of the next five sites.
Weil then started a site called Webring.org and offered to share
the technology with anyone who asked. Soon after, a ring of
English-as-a-second-language sites was launched.
</P>
<P>
   This young man's idea, born of boredom, has enjoyed meteoric
growth.  &UR; Today &LR; , there are 70,000 rings linking 981,000 Web sites;
the rings specialize in everything from mermaids to museums, from
Winnie the Pooh to Scooby Doo. Last year, Webring was sold to
Starseed, Inc., and last week, Starseed merged with Geocities, the
burgeoning on-line community. Weil, now a junior majoring in
computer science at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., made
a sizable chunk of change on the deal. But he doesn't like to dwell
on that: ``It's not something I really like to attach to myself,''
he says. ``The Geocities merger was a big distraction, and now
we're focusing on developing the system to give the user what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil remains committed to his original notion of sharing the
Webring software and allowing everyone to start their own rings on
their own terms, free of censorship and advertisements. The pop-up
windows that are a constant annoyance on Geo- &QC; cities will not
automatically appear on rings listed on Webring. ``That's an
annoying issue because everyone keeps asking about that,'' Weil
says. ``We let the ringmasters have complete control. They can let
in whoever they want.'' Webring doesn't censor its sites and
enables anyone to participate for free. It also has a search engine
of its own that provides links to thousands of rings organized by
myriad topics.
</P>
<P>
   Weil didn't have to go to college to land a job, but he seems
utterly unimpressed with the glittery trappings that come with
unexpected success. ``It depends on what you're after,'' he says.
``If all you want is a salary, that's fine. But I'm actually
interested in learning something.'' What's next for the lord of the
rings? ``I have no idea. Right now I'm bogged down in finals, but
after that I'll do whatever inspires me, I guess.''

WEARING YOUR COMPUTER

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wearable computers are considerably less geeky than they used to
be. But the day when average Americans wear one as nonchalantly as
they wear a Walkman CD player is still several years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When that day does come, though, Xybernaut Corp. contends it
will be poised to reap the rewards from a patent portfolio it has
been building since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This month Xybernaut received its ninth and, the company says,
most substantial American patent. The latest patent covers, for
example, a headset operated by a remote computer through radio,
satellite or cellular transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you don't have to wear the processor,'' said James
Ralabate, who was Xerox Corp.'s general patent counsel during the
1970s and who is now with Xybernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have several headsets functioning off a remote host
computer, for example,'' he said. ``And it covers three types of
activation: voice, eye and brain activation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Xybernaut has such a product on the market just yet.
Last week it announced its latest model: a mostly speech-activated
computer powered by a 22-ounce processor that straps onto a
person's belt and contains 128 megabytes of RAM and a 4.3-gigabyte
hard drive. This version has a head-mounted display system, which
gives the same viewing ability as a 15-inch monitor viewed at two
feet, the company says. ``What you're wearing on your belt is
essentially your laptop,'' said Michael Jenkins, chief technology
officer at Xybernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Among those testing Xybernaut's technology, the company says,
are the U.S. Customs Service, Mercedes-Benz, Lockheed-Martin and
the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Xybernaut's president, Edward Newman, called the latest patent
the linchpin in the company's patent portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this you can have multiple headsets operated by a remote
computer, like nodes on a network,'' he said. ``It totally frees up
the paradigm of wearables. This is the patent we've been waiting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual technology will require more waiting, however. The
company said it could not say exactly when such computers would be
on the market. Xybernaut received patent 5,844,824.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

E-MAIL VIRUS PREYS ON MICROSOFT WORD 97 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer security experts are warning clients about a new
software virus that is spread by e-mail, infects Microsoft Word
files and has already caused several networks to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, officially named the ``MS Word Macro 97 Class
Virus,'' creates a pop-up box in Microsoft Word 97 files that
addresses the recipient of the e-mail message by name and informs
the user that he or she ``is a big stupid jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale infections of the virus, which are activated on the
14th of each month, have been reported worldwide, security experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The virus itself contains no programming that would cripple a
network server, but experts said that a big infection of document
files can start a chain reaction on a computer network that in turn
can cause a general system failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the No. 1 virus in the world right now,'' said Vincent
Gullotto, manager of the antivirus emergency response team for
Network Associates, a company that develops and publishes antivirus
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Gullotto said, he has received thousands
of complaints about the virus. In one recent case, he said, the
network server of a major U.S. corporation, which he declined to
identify, was crippled after 7,000 documents were infected. The
company's server was set up to sound alerts upon the discovery of
viruses, and the constant alerts brought down the server.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically went into alert overload,'' Gullotto said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Don Goff, an adjunct professor of information
technology at the University of Maryland, wrote in an e-mail
message: ``In the last 48 hours, a `class virus' has been
propagating from MS Word attachments to e-mail documents. It
manifests itself as a pop-up with the phrase `(recipient by name)
is a big jerk.' It is going around Washington, D.C., like lightning
_ like a cold through my preschoolers class.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``it has to be cleaned from each file,'' he
described the macro virus as ``a pernicious cuss'' and ``a mean
little spud.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus infects only machines that are running Microsoft's
Word 97 word processing program. Since it was first reported to
Symantec, an antivirus software company, in late July, the virus
has sprouted 43 different strains, said Eric Chien, a software
engineer for Symantec's antivirus research center.
</P>
<P>
   Because the original virus was not protected by encryption, it
has been easy to alter. Some variants contain references to
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and with those variants,
pop-up boxes about the relationship appear when users open Word
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have Word, it's not an issue,'' Chien said. If a
user has Word 97, however, and opens the e-mail attachment, he
added, ``the virus will infect any other Word document'' on the
user's hard drive or network drive.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word documents are frequent targets of virus writers
because Word enables users to write simple programs known as macros
that can, for example, automatically end every letter that a user
composes with the word ``Sincerely.'' That functionality, intended
to spread instructions through all Word documents on a machine,
also helps viruses infect documents, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Word macro viruses, known as the Concept Virus,
is thought to be the most widely dispersed computer virus in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials point out that people who use Word can
instruct the program not to run macros, an option that is part of
Word's built-in protection against viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be careful not to open a document whose source you
don't know,'' said Andrew Dixon, a group project manager for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the Word Macro 97 virus can create for networked
computer systems is that it changes the software registration
information. System errors can occur when the registration
information on an individual machine does not match information on
the network. The virus changes the company name to ``Dr. Diet
Mountain Dew,'' and it changes the user name to
``VicodinES/CB/TNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Chien said ``Vicodin'' is the pseudonym of the virus writer,
while ``CB'' stands for ``Code Breakers,'' a virus-writing group,
and ``TNN'' stands for the writer's own group, known as ``The
Narcotic Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicodin has been quite active lately, writing and distributing
viruses through the Internet, experts said. He even issues press
releases, which he attributes to the fictitious ``Disassociated
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Vicodin is, he has a sense of humor,''
Gullotto said.
</P>
<P>
   But victims are not laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As the virus mutates and spreads, antivirus companies, not
surprisingly, are recommending that corporations be more
conscientious about updating their antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   Goff wrote in his e-mail message that the latest versions of
antivirus software defended computers and networks from the virus
but that earlier versions did not.
</P>
<P>
   Gullotto said, ``I can only preach so much to customers that
they need to update.''

Holidays a good time to reflect on computers' magic 
By Bill Husted  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christmas has always been a confusing time for me. I
hate the months of department store carols that lead up to it, am
deeply traumatized by shopping of any kind, and have to fight a
neurotic desire to sing the only song to which I know all the
words: ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   But I can't deny the magic and wouldn't if I could. I have the
same love-hate relationship with the gadgets that surround me.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when I get pleading e-mails asking what
to give a geek for the holidays. Parents, overwhelmed by the
computer wizardry of their kids, feel helpless at a time like this.
And maybe because I have a beard and am getting past the middle of
middle age, some mistake me for Santa's high-tech adviser.
</P>
<P>
   I make a puzzling elf, they soon discover. I just finished
answering a long e-mail from a reader who explained that her child
already had a 400-megahertz computer, a paid-up membership to an
Internet service provider and access to the family's home theater.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I answered:
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad you asked. I know a way to multiply the value of all
your gadgets and make the computer's power much more amazing. I
know you expect to spend money to do this, and that's good because
my suggestions will cost $23 and change.
</P>
<P>
   The real wonder of technology is understanding how magical it
is, and this is the right time of the year for magic. With that in
mind, I've prepared a Christmas gift list for you.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's work on increasing the power of that computer. For
$13 you can buy a book by Joel N. Shurkin for your child called
``Engines of the Mind: The Evolution of the Computer From
Mainframes to Microprocessors.'' This isn't a geeky book, and even
I know most of the words in it. The publisher is W.W. Norton and
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child reads that book, he'll understand he owns a
computer more powerful than the ones that ran big businesses and
government agencies a decade ago. When he pops in his favorite
video game, he'll appreciate the magical nature of a machine that
creates entire worlds using the words, letters and symbols that
make up a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   It's better he hear it straight from a book that the
400-megahertz computer chip is mostly made of silicon, an element
common as sand. And if you told him the circuits on that chip, all
those tiny transistors, are merely photographic etchings, he might
not believe you.
</P>
<P>
   So for $10 or so, you've turned what was a good computer into a
magical machine. You can't match that for $1,000 down at the
computer store.
</P>
<P>
   If you still have $10 more to spare, we can change the Internet
into something magical, too. We can take those chat groups and Web
pages and wrap them in some paper. The paper I'm talking about
comes from another book called ``Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The
Origins of the Internet.'' It's by Katie Hafner and is published by
Touchstone Books.
</P>
<P>
   Your child will discover that many of the pioneers of the Net
weren't much older than he is. They couldn't point and click in
those days, because the mouse wasn't an option 25 years ago.
Instead, they wrote programs that let them link computers together
and _ like a bunch of harnessed mules _ learn to work together and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time your child logs onto a chat group and says
nothing much is happening, he may remember there are still enormous
things to be done with a computer that have nothing at all to do
with telling the hangers-on at some chat channel that he's bored
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stuff requires a battery and _ even when you factor
in the cost of wrapping paper _ you'll spend less than what a game
from the discount bin costs.
</P>
<P>
   Have a wonderful holiday.

 SCHWAB GETS NET SHY

<P>
   Consumers dreaming of an e-Christmas free of the hassles of
crowds have been rushing online to shop in record numbers. While
Internet merchants are delivering plenty of convenience, they are
offering up plenty of e-reality as well. In the past weeks, some of
the best-known sites have experienced slowdowns and even service
outages.
</P>
<P>
   Among sites with traffic troubles was BarnesandNoble.com, the
Internet outpost of the retail book giant Barnes &AMP; Noble. The site
was processing orders at a snail's pace on Tuesday, and the company
blamed surging holiday traffic. Another site that has faltered
under holiday demand was IBM's much advertised Startrekstore.com,
which went out of service for several days almost as soon as it
went online just before Thanksgiving. And Macys.com has repeatedly
had troubles processing customer orders since its relaunch on Nov.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sanger, vice president of corporate affairs for Federated
Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, said the Macy's delays
had been caused by an ``incredible'' interest in the site. ``We've
been receiving 10 million hits a day,'' she said. ``So for us, this
is kind of a good news-bad news story.''
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, an Internet commerce analyst with Current
Analysis, which gathers industry intelligence for private clients,
says companies that advertised heavily should have anticipated such
problems: ``It is amazing that all these companies hyping
electronic commerce have run face-first into capacity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of holiday shoppers was not to blame for all
the more notable failures. E-Bay, the popular Internet auction
service, experienced three system outages over the last two weeks,
one because of a hardware failure and two because of software
problems that Mike Wilson, the company's vice president for product
development and site operations, said were ``completely unrelated
to demand.''

   ASTRONAUTS GET MAIL; MICROSOFT GETS A FOOTHOLD
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail revolution has breached another frontier _ space.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour finished a 12-day mission last
Tuesday that was the first on which crew members could routinely
send and receive e-mail, using notebook computers and ``smart
modems'' developed by NASA engineers to overcome problems in data
communications from space.
</P>
<P>
   The five astronauts and one cosmonaut could send e-mail to
colleagues and family much as they would on Earth. The 620 messages
they sent were mostly personal, dealing with Christmas preparations
and the like, says John Grunsfeld, chief of NASA's astronaut
computer branch.
</P>
<P>
   Many messages were sent up as well. In one, a crew member, James
Newman, received snapshots of his wife and two young children from
Grunsfeld, who had scanned them and sent them as e-mail
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was restricted to family, other astronauts and NASA
mission personnel. ``The last thing I'd want in space is to have to
wade through all my terrestrial e-mail,'' Grunsfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the astronauts have been pushing NASA hard to have
``our workplace in space mirror our workplace on earth in terms of
access to information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The software technology they use is largely supplied by
Microsoft Corp. and includes the Windows operating system with its
Outlook Express e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Is NASA concerned about extending what another branch of the
government terms the ``Microsoft monopoly'' into space? ``Despite
the Justice Department's case, we don't really worry about that
here on Earth,'' Grunsfeld said. ``Now if I were running a software
company on Mars, I might be concerned.''

   SCHWAB BACKS AWAY FROM SOME INTERNET TRADES
</P>
<P>
   In the volatile and warp-speed world of online trading, Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. has blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it wants to protect overzealous investors from market
volatility _ and from themselves _ Schwab, a discount broker based
in San Francisco, is no longer accepting trades over the Internet
for stocks of some companies on the first day they are available
for public trading.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, it would not accept online trades on
Tuesday for Infospace.com, an Internet content aggregator that went
public that day. Schwab customers were still able to purchase the
shares over the phone on their first days of trading, and online
trading resumed for the stock on the day after its initial
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials said the policy was implemented at the end of
November to protect clients and the company's own bottom line. Tom
Taggart, a Schwab spokesman, said that in the case of some
offerings, investors place online orders to buy the stock at the
market price, but by the time the trades are actually executed, the
stock costs significantly more than the investors had expected to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart said that even when investors specified a price, market
volatility resulted in ``an inordinate amount of changing and
canceling of orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Taggart said the company would restrict trading on only a
handful of stocks it identified as likely candidates for volatility
_ among them Marketwatch.com and Pacific Internet, which are
expected to go public shortly.

   AN OLD HAND AT START-UPS MOVES ON FROM I-VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When photographers took pictures of the three
founders of I-Village, the New York Internet service for women,
they often tried to place Robert Levitan in the center. This proved
to be a repeated annoyance to Candice Carpenter, the company's
chief executive, and Nancy Evans, its editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, 33, was decidedly the junior partner, but he provided
some visual variety in a company of, by and for women.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Earlier this month, just as I-Village was preparing for
an initial public stock offering, Levitan quietly departed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, after selling his first start-up, Levitan was
recruited by Ms. Carpenter to help with a consulting assignment for
America Online. Later she invited him to join in starting
I-Village.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan brought in the revenue, selling advertising sponsorships
to big consumer products companies _ $20 million worth by his own
count. But last May, Ms. Carpenter hired John Glascott, a former
top sales executive with Hearst, to take over sponsorship sales,
and Levitan moved over to run the company's health information
site. When his stock holdings vested last fall, he began making
plans to leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   He said last week that he was eager to move on to another
start-up, which he described as involving electronic gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for another challenge,'' he said. ``I will go on
to do things that are as big or bigger than I-Village.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
All things considered, I'd rather use a mouse 
By Jack Warner  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Under the heading of ``What Will They Think of Next,''
we have for our examination and amusement today the Cruise Cat from
Cirque, a touchpad device aimed at the Internet addict.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is a modified touchpad-pointing device, a thin
little pad that connects to a serial port and does not cancel out
or confuse your mouse. It simply competes with it for your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In case you have no experience with a touchpad device _ they
have become rather common as built-in pointing devices on laptops _
it is simply a little panel on which you lightly move your finger
to control the mouse, tap gently for a single click and double-tap
for a double-click.
</P>
<P>
   They work as well as a mouse. Whether you would prefer one to a
mouse is another matter. Personally, I have seen no alternative
device that suits me as well as a mouse. This is due in large part,
certainly, to the fact I learned to use a mouse years ago and it is
second nature.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to see the reaction of many of the newsroom
staff when the personal computer, in the form of Macintoshes, made
its appearance. Those who had never used a mouse had no end of
trouble for a while. Some never got used to them and wound up with
trackballs by preference. I find trackballs to be a minor torture
device.
</P>
<P>
   For me, touchpads are a decent alternative to a mouse, better
than trackballs and a lot better than those stupid stubby sticks
they put in the middle of laptop keyboards. However, if a mouse is
available, I'll use that in preference to anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat has some interesting embellishments _ chief among
them the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this is cute. If, for instance, you want to look
at your bookmarks, you draw a little B and voila! here come your
bookmarks. If you want to close the active program, you describe an
X with your finger on the pad.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a fatal flaw here. You can't just suddenly
scribble an X on the pad and do anything but move the mouse around.
First, you must place a finger in a depression to one side of the
screen and wait for a little image of the Cruise Cat to appear.
Then you make your symbol on that image. Now, if you compare the
act of pressing the finger into a depression to produce a little
box on which you then draw an X to the simple act of seizing the
mouse, moving the cursor to the Close box with a simple little
wrist movement and clicking a button, you can see we are not
talking convenience here. We're talking gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise Cat is doubtless the spawn of some wunderkind at
Cirque Corp. who conceived of yet another way to market the Glide
Point pad. In fact, the Cruise Cat has no particular attachment to
the Internet. You can create your own gestures, and they will work
anywhere, in any program I tried. None, however, turns out to be as
easy as using the mouse for the same task.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cruise Cat sounds really catchy, does it not? We can
carry this idea almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why not give it a few built-in gestures to accomplish basic
tasks in Word 7 such as inserting the date or saving the file, fix
it all up and market it as Word Wompus? Tie in a few calculations
and presto! Excel Eel.
</P>
<P>
   Two or more can play this game.

Computer games don't have to cost anything 
By Bill Husted  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If holiday shopping has cut into your budget for
computer games, you needn't fear withdrawal. Many games are
available free for the downloading on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these games fall into the shareware category: You
download them free and then are expected to pay if you like and
continue to use the game. Many of the shareware games are
full-blown versions, while others have only a few episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Other games available for free downloading are demonstration
versions of commercial games. In that case, the games are usually
crippled to one degree or another. Either you get only a few
episodes of an elaborate game, or some of the features of the game
have been disabled. Think of these commercial demos as, at worst, a
good way to preview a game before making the sometimes-expensive
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Our first Web site has a mixture of both types _ shareware and
commercial demos. The site is called the Ultimate Game Download
site and you'll find it at http://www.skyex.com/rkonline/dwnld.htm.
Like many programs available for download on the Net, these games
come in a file that is compressed into something called a ZIP file.
That means you'll need software to decompress the ZIP file.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer users already have such a program, but if you
don't have one, just use the term ``ZIP'' as a search word and pick
from the list of unzipping programs at a site like those at
http://www.shareware.com and
</P>
<P>
   http://www.download.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of downloading from the Ultimate Game Download site
varies considerably from game to game. One reason for that is most
of the game downloads are not actually stored at the computer that
holds the Web site. Instead, the games are stored on sites
maintained by their publishers or owners. Some of these sites are
extremely busy and _ in extreme cases _ may refuse to make the
connection. In that case, you'll be forced to try again.
</P>
<P>
   To the good, the site has literally dozens of games, including
commercial demos of some of the most popular games.
</P>
<P>
   You'll surely want to bookmark the next site _ Game Downer.
Download games and sites at
http://starcreations.com/gamedowner/ga-dwn01.htm. You can search
for games alphabetically here, making it easier to find a specific
game. Again, most games are not stored on the site, so download
times and availability may vary.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a sampling of the game sites you can find online.
To find a list of literally hundreds of sites that offer downloads,
try using your favorite search engine with the search terms ``game
download'' and, if you try them all, you'll be so busy downloading
you won't have time to play.

Anyone can exterminate pesky bugs 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   IN PRINT
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled that the box is sealed in shiny plastic wrap.
Many pieces of software, even from the biggest companies, are far
from finished when shipped to stores. Most include at least some
bug, which is computerese for a glitch or feature that doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, most common bugs are fixable. The January issue of PC
World features a story called ``Bug Busters: Top cures &AMP; fixes for
software snarls.'' You'll find a list of the 10 worst bugs, tricks
for working around glitches and Web sites where you can download
something called a patch, which is a mini-program that fixes buggy
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, you'll also find a review of the
top 10 high-resolution digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest generation of digital cameras, the article says
image quality is advancing rapidly _ and so is the list of
features. Among the cameras examined, PC World recommends Toshiba's
PDR-M1 as the best deal. The magazine says this camera offers the
most at the best price ($499).
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Girls are increasingly becoming the target of CD-ROM makers. It
seems every month brings news of yet another title to be marketed
to girls. The latest is Activision's ``Teen Digital Diva.''
Designed for the teen market, this computer CD lets girls create
their own magazine. Players do virtual makeovers, try out clothes,
generate personal horoscopes and take personality quizzes. The CD
is based on Teen magazine and comes with tons of animations, music
clips and color schemes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're serious about your flight simulators, check out the
latest from Electronic Arts called ``WWII Fighters.'' It's a game
based on designs from Jane's, the world-famous military magazine of
the same name. This game lets you fly seven famous WWII fighters.
It also includes lots of information about each of the planes and
its role in history.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   No, the Geminids meteor shower, among the largest in recorded
history, did not knock out satellites or disrupt communications
back on Earth, as feared.
</P>
<P>
   It was still darn interesting, and now you can learn all about
it online. There's an entire Web site devoted to the phenomenon.
You'll find it at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.geminids.com/.

Rise of news sites on Web traced to Clinton scandal 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was the year the Internet joined CNN as one of
the prime places we turn for breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, his Gap-garbed intern and Kenneth Starr's
tell-all of their sloppy affair get most of the credit. The January
issue of Yahoo! Internet Life tells us why. The magazine's Top of
the Net for 1998 names Sept. 11, the day the Starr report was
released on the Internet, the year's top Net traffic day. The
report sent Internet traffic to an all-time high and, since it was
released in the morning, it likely dropped office productivity to
new lows. ``It was sleazy. It was sad. It was a political
earthquake,'' according to the article's read-in.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of list named the evolution of electronic commerce, Web
communities and portalmania the top Net trends. Portals are the new
name for search engines, which are trying to recast themselves as
more than just Internet on-ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio and Pamela Anderson Lee were the names most
often typed into search engine windows. Leo edged Clinton in a
close race between male cyber-stalkees.
</P>
<P>
   There's less Intel Inside
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the company that makes the chips that power our PCs, is
losing market share.
</P>
<P>
   Intel processors, with their ubiquitous Intel Inside icon, went
from being in about 70 percent of all desktop PCs sold to somewhere
around 40 percent. Advanced Micro Devices has picked up the slack
and now leads the retail PC market for processor chips. Cyrix is
still a distance third.
</P>
<P>
   The chart, and a short explanation, are in the January 1999
issue of PC Computing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers a seven-step cure to reduce the amount of
junk e-mail in your life. Death to Spam offers tips such as hiding
or ``spoofing'' your e-mail address should you post to a newsgroup.
Such postings usually list your e-mail address and leave you open
to software programs that search the Web for addresses. To
``spoof'' your address, just add an easily recognizable phrase to
your address, something that will fool a computer but not a person.
If your address is ed(at)aol.com, ``spoofing'' it would change it
to something like ed.ignorethispart(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   The article recommends simpler tricks. Like just ignoring it.
Like an annoying neighbor, responding to a junk e-mail usually
encourages more spam. Sending a return e-mail to the spam source
often just confirms yours is a valid address.
</P>
<P>
   Blabbing e-secrets
</P>
<P>
   They say telling a secret unburdens you. Depending on who is
involved, it also can louse up a friendship. An Internet site may
have split the difference, a chance to lay bare your conscience
anonymously, a scream in the a cyber-forest.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if the http://www
</P>
<P>
   .secretxchange.com postings are true? At the very least, they're
funny. This week's load-offs include ``Three Day Ordeal: I Glued
Myself to My Easy-Chair'' and ``I Threw Up on a Twenty Topping
Pizza and None of My Fraternity Brothers Even Noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret exchange idea started as a newsletter in 1994, which
led to a book, ``I Forgot to Wear Underwear on a Glass-Bottom
Boat,'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Business cards, updated
</P>
<P>
   They don't really fit into Rolodexes and are a hassle to
transcribe. But with CardScan, a software program from Corex
Technologies, you can scan your business cards and keep them on
your desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The scanned cards create an interactive card file. If a business
card lists a Web address, CardScan lets you link directly to the
Internet site. Other features include direct modem access to any
fax numbers on the cards, the ability to merge the names with your
word processing program and the chance to add notes to the card
once its in your digital card file.
</P>
<P>
   CardScan's version 4 sells for $79. The software with a
dedicated card scanner sells for $299. The program is available in
office supply and computer stores and online at
http://www.cardscan.com.

 Network Associates Says Killer Virus Hit MCI WorldCom  
 By Benny Evangelista   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new, highly sophisticated computer virus that installs itself
in network servers surfaced last week in MCI WorldCom Inc.'s
corporate system.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates Inc., the world's leading maker of anti-virus
software, publicized the existence of the new Remote Explorer virus
yesterday, calling it the ``most destructive virus ever seen.''
However, the Santa Clara company added that so far, the damage was
limited and a cure already is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does represent an entirely new kind of virus, but at this
point, there's no reason to panic,'' said Peter Watkins, general
manager for Network Associates' security division.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said Remote Explorer was programmed to install itself
primarily into Microsoft Windows NT network computer servers and
workstations though it also can reside on, but not infect, Unix
systems. The virus systematically encrypts documents and other
files with a code that has to be unlocked before the files can be
accessed again.
</P>
<P>
   He said the virus appears to be the work of a technologically
savvy programmer and ``is the first one that is really targeted at
attacking a network environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far more sophisticated than other viruses like the new MS
Word Macro 97 Class Virus, which also recently appeared, that
normally are activated by a computer user opening a file or
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not (the work of) a weekend hacker; this is a pro,''
Watkins said. ``It's scary. This is a completely new strain that is
self-propagating.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates would only say Remote Explorer was discovered
last Thursday in one of its Fortune 100 clients, but it declined to
name the company. However, MCI WorldCom spokesman Jim Monroe
confirmed that MCI is so far the only known victim of the Remote
Explorer virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We detected it very quickly, and it had no impact on our
customers,'' Monroe said. The company is investigating how the
virus entered the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said the virus was only programmed to encrypt files and
that it also was programmed to move more rapidly between 3 p.m. and
6 a.m. weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday, when program
administrators normally are not at work.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, however, could have been programmed for greater
destruction, such as deleting files, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates has a Remote Explorer detection program
available to its customers and is working on a program to clean up
files infected by the virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bradshaw, spokesman for Network Associates' chief rival,
Symantec Corp., said his company has not encountered another
instance of the virus and was awaiting a sample from Network
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of VIRUS22 (84030 ) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Peter Rogers of Volpe Brown Whelan said it was too soon
to tell whether Remote Explorer will erupt into an epidemic, but he
said technology has always found a cure for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of sophistication and complexity of viruses has
increased pretty dramatically,'' Rogers said. ``Each level has been
overcome by technology, and I suspect that will be the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates stock rose 12 percent to close at $60.38, up
$6.38. Rogers said news of the virus had an effect but that Network
Associates also benefited from a strong market for technology
stocks.

Check the movie sites before you head out 
By Frances Katz  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not clear when going to the movies became part of
the Christmas ritual, right up there with eggnog, mistletoe and
caroling.
</P>
<P>
   If movie reviews just don't do it for you or the malls are too
crowded, take a peek at this season's hottest offerings on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Major motion pictures seem to be the one group left that doesn't
understand packing as many applets, plug-ins and other bells and
whistles into one place does not necessarily a good Web site make.
While special effects may be a thrill in the theaters, they can be
a turnoff to movie lovers checking out movies on their home PCs.
Most of the new movie sites are inventive and informative, but be
prepared to download special tools or reboot your browser. And if
all else fails, you can always just see the movie in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's ever had even a brief encounter with America Online
will be intrigued by the title of the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film
``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The title is a direct lift from the quasi-cheery message that
greets AOL users when they log on. The site at
http://www.youvegotmail.com offers pretty standard movie site fare
but includes some of the e-mail exchanges between the lead
characters, who go by the online screen names of Shopgirl and
NY152.
</P>
<P>
   The site also invites people who have met online to send in
their stories of real-life Net romance, which gives the movie's
plot a little more credibility as well as interesting reading. The
one trouble with the site is that it is an odd combination of a
marketing site and a creative site. It's a strange user experience,
but you'll learn something about the movie and about love online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' (http://www.prince-of-egypt.com), the
big, elaborate animated feature from DreamWorks, has an equally
big, elaborate animated Web site that really is something to see.
There's very little pointing and clicking; users can just sit and
watch the story unfold, almost like an actual movie trailer. The
site is available in several languages and offers a study guide,
special visual downloads (including a desktop music player), the
trailer for the film and a collection of images from the movie. The
brief synopsis of the film will also help parents and kids learn
more about the biblical characters before or after seeing the film.
This is a lovely site for a visually beautiful film.
</P>
<P>
   Trekkers, as they like to be called now, have probably already
bookmarked the site for the newest Star Trek feature, ``Star Trek
Insurrection.'' The builders of the Star Trek site clearly know
their audience, and the site is meant to replicate, if you will,
the computer images on the bridge of the Enterprise. This site
really is a trekker's paradise with creative tidbits such as the
``Briefing From the Federation Regarding the Prime Directive,''
desktop pictures, cast biographies (as if fans didn't already know
everything there is to know about Patrick Stewart and company),
audio interviews and more. This is a fans' site, clearly designed
for devotees of the ``Star Trek'' series and the inside references
to the series. The variety of interviews and pictures make this an
excellent promotional vehicle for the film as well as a nice
stand-alone site.
</P>
<P>
   For families that can't get enough and other grown-ups who
wonder what all the fuss is about, there is the Web site for the
Rugrats movie at http://www.rugratsmovie.com. It's easy to spend
hours on the Rugrats site, playing games, meeting the characters
(from baby Tommy's point of view), downloading screen savers and
just cooing over the characters. Since Rugrats is part of
Nickelodeon, the cable kids channel, the site is very careful to
avoid pitching products or trying to sell things to kids surfing
the site. Advertisements are clearly marked, and clicking on an ad
brings up a warning that users are about to view an ad. It's easy
to spend hours here bonding with the characters without a lot of
complicated Web gizmos.

Keying in to `high-tech hate' on the Internet 
By Mary McLachlin  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A couple of months ago, Internet hate
groups pulled a high-tech, in-your-face trick on the mainstream
press that normally tries to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   It got them immediate attention, but not the kind they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, certain U.S. and foreign newspapers suddenly
began getting puzzled and angry reports from people searching for
their World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding the Chicago Sun-Times, St. Louis
Post-Dispatch or Atlanta Constitution, people were landing on the
swastika-emblazoned site of Stormfront Inc., a Nazi-patterned white
power organization based in West Palm Beach. Stormfront is run by
Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klansman who was the first to set up a
white supremacist site on the Internet, according to groups that
monitor bigotry on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Someone _ Black says he didn't do it _ had registered variations
of 14 newspapers' names on the Internet, then programmed them to
divert searchers to the Stormfront site. For example, a searcher
looking for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Web site who typed
atlantaconstitution.com would wind up instead at stormfront.org.
The Constitution's real Web address is ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver was a new twist on cyber-squatting, in which
opportunists register names similar to famous trademarks and try to
make businesses pay them to give up the names.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first known time that Web searchers had been hijacked
to a hate site, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. The ADL, which monitors hate groups worldwide, estimates
several hundred now operate on the Internet. The Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, also a monitor, lists more than 800 sites
that it classifies as hate-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was we're now in the generation of high-tech
hate,'' said William Rothchild, ADL regional director in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers got another message from the Stormfront incident.
Cyber-squatting has opened a chaotic new realm of legal conflict
over trademark protection, and the hate-group twist added a free
speech element that made it even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is moving ahead faster than the law, and the law
needs to catch up,'' said Jon Vegosen, attorney for the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Fortunately, there were (trademark) laws here to
protect people in this case, and we were able to take advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago and St. Louis papers sued the groups in federal
court for trademark infringement in October and got restraining
orders. Within a month, the groups had given up the soundalike Web
domains to the newspapers, which registered them to their own
companies. The remaining sites either have been or are being
re-registered to the trademark owners, or have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania attorney general also has sued Stormfront and
two white supremacy groups with cyber links to it. That suit, filed
in October in Pennsylvania state court, accuses ALPHA HQ and White
Pride World Wide of using their Web sites to make ``terroristic
threats'' against two state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Stormfront holds the distinction of being the first Internet
bigotry site, according to the ADL and other hate-watch
organizations. It showed up in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 45, is a former Grand Wizard of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.
In the 1980s, he was sentenced to three years in prison for leading
an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government on the
Caribbean island of Dominica.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Chloe _ formerly married to Louisiana
politician and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke _ have lived
in West Palm Beach since 1987 and have a 9-year-old son. Black
manages a network of Web sites and computer servers from his home,
according to court records in the newspaper suits.
</P>
<P>
   Groups maintaining such sites range from old-line ones such as
Aryan Nations and Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to the newer
Skinheads of the Racial Holy War and record companies peddling
white-power albums with violent lyrics. Graphics are heavy on
swastikas, Celtic crosses, Gothic type and dark backgrounds with
flames, flags and thunderbolts. Articles quote ``scientific''
evidence that whites are genetically and culturally superior to
other races and allege persecution of white, Gentile,
English-speaking patriots by blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, the
media and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Black said in an interview that he knew nothing about the plan
to divert newspaper searchers to Stormfront. He said it was
strictly the work of Adrian Edward Marlow of Suisun City, Calif.,
from whom Black rented space on a computer and knew only through
online communication.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers sent lawyers after Black and Stormfront, as well
as Marlow and others. Court documents from the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch case disclosed a national network of connected Web
sites, post office addresses and computer-support functions. For
example, according to the documents, Black provides Internet access
and Web site links to:
</P>
<P>
   _Frank Weltner of St. Louis, who calls himself Von Goldstein
Mohammed and calls his Web site Jew Watch.
</P>
<P>
   _Adrian Marlow, who created and maintains a site called White
Pride World Wide and who provided computer space for part of
Black's Stormfront operations, as well as for Weltner's
jewwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim DeLaire of St. Charles, Mo., listed as the contact for
Bluelantern Inc., the name used to register the White Pride World
Wide site.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact Weltner, Marlow and DeLaire were
unsuccessful. Marlow did not respond to telephone messages
requesting comment, and the number listed for DeLaire on his
Bluelantern site registration produces a recording saying the call
can't be completed.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge found that Weltner had reproduced a copyrighted
Post-Dispatch story and photograph about Jewish religious services
on his Web site without the paper's permission. He signed a consent
order forbidding further use of copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts in Missouri and Illinois also issued injunctions
against Black, Weltner and the others, ordering them to stop using
any variations of the newspapers' trademarked names. They, too,
signed consent orders agreeing to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents showed that Marlow had used the initials, MKM,
and post office box of his mother, Monika K. Marlow _ without her
knowledge _ to register the names. She was dismissed as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the newspapers, two variations of pharmaceutical
giant Abbott Laboratories' Web address also were registered to MKM.
A spokeswoman for Abbott said the company is ``working to
invalidate the current registrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Stabbe, an attorney for The Atlanta Constitution said
Marlow told him in a telephone conversation that he wanted money
for the atlantaconstitution.com address. Stabbe said Marlow told
him he had linked the address to Stormfront to create publicity,
attract more traffic and thus make the site appear to be worth
more.
</P>
<P>
   But Marlow gave up the name, under a cease-and-desist letter and
threat of a suit, without ever saying how much money he wanted,
Stabbe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got that far,'' Stabbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Tweaking the noses of the establishment press, and being hauled
into court for it, wasn't as impressive to Black as it was to the
newspapers and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a ripple, but it wasn't that big a story,'' Black
said. ``The attorneys certainly put forth a great deal of effort.
Getting a court injunction is a big deal, considering it's such a
trivial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania lawsuit is another matter. As in the St. Louis
and Chicago newspaper cases, the suit is directed at a cross-linked
network of organizations, Web sites and individuals _ including
Black and Stormfront; DeLaire and Bluelantern; and a Philadelphia
white supremacist group called ALPHA HQ and its founder, Ryan
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the ALPHA HQ Web site posted pictures of two women
employed as fair housing and human relations workers by the state
and made ``terrorist threats'' against them. It called one a ``race
traitor'' and said traitors ``will be hung from the neck from the
nearest tree or lamp post.'' It also carried a photograph doctored
to look like the employee's office building was exploding.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants the court to ban publication of the photos and
images on the ALPHA HQ site and prohibit Black and the other
defendants from providing computer support for the site. Further,
it wants the court to force Network Solutions Inc., the worldwide
registry for Internet names, to banish ALPHA HQ from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Black says the suit is an attack on the groups' First Amendment
rights and the attorney general would be wise not to push it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act,'' Black said. ``He
could be countersued based on that act.'' The Civil Rights Act of
1871, known as the KKK Act, was an attempt to curb Klan violence by
forbidding one person or group from usurping another's
constitutional rights, including by force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions Inc., which has 3 million Internet ``domain''
names registered, says monitoring trademarks and content on Web
sites is not its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is it's up to trademark owners to police their
own trademarks,'' said spokeswoman Sheryl Regan. ``We register Web
addresses . . . on a first-come, first-served basis, but we don't
concern ourselves with the content on sites using those
addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 4,000 disputes since NSI began registering names
in 1993, Regan said. NSI has been targeted in court actions 44
times, including the Pennsylvania case, and has never been found at
fault, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Internet sites promoting hostility and even
violence against racial, religious, ethnic and other populations
keeps changing as groups adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Black and his inspiration, David Duke, are enthusiastic leaders
of the Internet movement. They say it gives them access and
exposure to millions of potential recruits and followers they can't
reach through other media that shun them. A headline on Duke's Web
site sums up their expectations: The Coming White Revolution _ Born
on the Internet.

 Bidder Beware, Say eBay Critics  
 By Jamie Beckett and Jon Swartz   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In just three years, online auctioneer eBay has gone from a
seller of Pez dispensers to one of the hottest spots on the
Internet. Its stock has soared, giving the company a market value
yesterday of nearly $12 billion and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a growing number of critics _ who derisively call the
company ``eBad'' and ``ePay'' _ say what's keeping eBay aloft is
hot air and charge that fraud is rampant on the popular online
auction site. They accuse the San Jose company of turning a blind
eye to those who put in false bids, sell fake items or fail to
deliver paid-for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, critics claim that eBay auctions sometimes offer
illegal items. During the past week, sellers were offering Cuban
cigars, which cannot legally be imported in the United States, and
an AK-47 assault rifle, which is illegal to sell in California and
several other states. One particularly brazen seller advertised a
``Banned Covert Auto-knife'' _ a type of switchblade _ bragging
that ``the Feds have decided that it's in your best interest not to
let anymore of these knives into our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to eBay often go unheeded, critics say, and violators
are able to easily slip back in using a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them suspend someone and let them back on the same
night,'' said Sandra List, a Washington, D.C.-area user. ``They
don't have a central file of suspensions, so the thieves are on an
honor system.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at eBay emphasize that problems have arisen in only a
small percentage of the 36 million auctions it has hosted. When an
eBay user complains about an impropriety, the company is quick to
investigate and act, said Brad Handler, director of public policy.
In addition, the auction site offers a number of protections that
include 24-hour customer support, a feedback forum where bidders
and sellers are rated by users, and access to an escrow service to
secure transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay is a community that is working hard to create an
environment of open, honest trade,'' said Handler. ``It's
incredibly difficult in the online and offline world to catch the
dedicated criminal, but it doesn't mean we aren't trying.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Handler also said that eBay cannot proactively monitor
the site for illegal activity and that it relies on users to bring
problems to its attention.
</P>
<P>
   But many users say the system isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, eBay executives got to see for themselves.
As a publicity stunt, eBay asked ``Today Show'' host Katie Couric
and her co-workers to autograph a show jacket to auction off for
chartity. Bids zoomed to $200,000. But, a chagrined eBay learned,
most of the bids were pranks. After checking on bidders, eBay found
the real high bid to be a paltry $11,400.
</P>
<P>
   In a more serious case, an Oklahoma City man pocketed at least
$30,000 and up to $100,000 for baseball cards he didn't deliver,
according to postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Dean Stemple, 27, allegedly bilked eBay customers by
enticing them into sending money orders for auction items he
claimed he had but never delivered. There is no warrant or
indictment yet for Stemple, who is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the transactions were made over the Internet, they
are being investigated as mail fraud, said postal inspector Linda
Kirksey of Fort Worth, Texas. ``The people who bid on the products
sent their money through the postal mail,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay have refused to reimburse buyers who were
duped by Stemple. Handler said the company policy is to urge those
who believe they've been bilked to report problems to eBay and to
local law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask law enforcement authorities to contact us, so we can
make sure we give them all the information we have about this bad
actor,'' Handler said.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents illustrate the pitfalls of performing anonymous
transactions on the wild and wooly Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lines are blurred,'' said List, the Washington-area user.
``You never know who you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment over the ``Today Show'' jacket and the alleged
fraud by Stemple came at the same time eBay was experiencing a
series of outages that angered users. Yet in many ways, eBay is a
lot like President Clinton. The worse things get, the higher its
stock rises.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, eBay's shares rocketed to another new high, climbing
$44.13 to $296.38. Its nearly $12 billion market value is more than
that of consumer-products giant Clorox and nearly triple that of
Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that, whatever its problems, eBay remains the
hottest auction site, with traffic that far outpaces competitors.
So despite their complaints, users keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 2 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One practice that riles List and others is ``shill bidding'' _
when sellers use a different identity to bid on their own items, or
have friends bid on the item. The purpose: to drive up the price or
to reach the 30-bid level, which puts the auction into eBay's
``hot'' category and earns it a special promotion on the site.
</P>
<P>
   She and others say eBay is slow to take action on complaints
because the higher the price an item fetches, the more commission
the company collects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't do checks on people who register, so the same
person can sign up under different names and bid an item up. It
hurts everyone,'' said one heavy eBay seller who said he grossed
tens of thousands of dollars on eBay last year. The seller, who
lives in Canada, pointed out several auctions in which bidders
appeared to be the same person registered under different names. In
another case, he pointed out a seller who appeared to have faked
his own feedback to ensure a high rating.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay say they suspend anyone they catch who
registers multiple times under different user IDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian seller and many other eBay users say earnings from
eBay auctions have become a significant portion of their incomes.
That's why they say they are so passionate about the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People care about this. It's their livelihood,'' said List.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us just want to sell $10 items and not make trouble,''
said one Bay Area user. ``We are troubled by the amount of
fraudulent goods sold on the service. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Don Brister of the San Jose Police Department's High
Technology Crimes Detail said it has received a handful of
complaints about eBay but that the company ``has done everything it
can to protect the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are problems,'' he said. ``But the consumer has to
take some personal responsibility to ensure their own money is
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Schwartz, president and general manager of eBay
competitor Auction Universe, said protecting users from fraud is
actually quite simple. Auction Universe, for example, offers a
service known as Bid Safe, which for $19.95 a year provides $3,000
in insurance for buyers and sellers against fraud, shipping damage
or other losses. More important, Bid Safe includes an escrow
service in which Auction Universe handles credit-card payments for
buyers and sellers and holds payments until it is assured the item
is delivered in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 3 of EBAY22 (32382 ) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want this thing to grow, we have to make people feel
safe,'' Schwartz said. ``Right now it's getting the perception that
it can't be trusted.''

CHRISTMAS BRIGHTENS UP WEB, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ho, ho, ho! Merry computing, everyone!
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus just sent me an e-mail, and it says I should write
about stuff to help get people into the holiday spirit! If I don't,
Mr. Claus says he's going to replace my operating system with coal.
</P>
<P>
   So I best get cracking!
</P>
<P>
   - Want to treat the kids to something a bit different this
Christmas? Check out www.eaze.net/citius//santa.htm. It offers a
program for PCs called Tracking Santa. The shareware ($6.99 to
register) offers a world map that ``tracks'' Santa on Christmas
Eve, holiday songs, a version of the Christmas Story and features
you can customize for your family. It runs on Windows 3.1, 95, 98
or NT. My advice: If this interests you, download it now and test
it. You don't want to disappoint the kids on Christmas Eve!
</P>
<P>
   - There's still a few days left before Christmas. And, if you're
like most people, you'll have to work right up until Christmas Eve.
Not to worry. My advice: Goof off at work! The easiest way is to
download and play with ``Twinkle Bulbs.'' It's the shareware you
probably saw a co-worker using last year. It allows users to
decorate their desktops with Christmas lights. Find them at
softseek.mdonline.net/DesktopEnhancements/FunStuff/Review42 &QL; 
16index.html.
</P>
<P>
   - Want a laugh? You'll think this version of '`'Twas the Night
Before Christmas'' is funny if you know anything about computer
programmers. Find it at www.citilink.com/
jgarrick/vbasic/humor/nightbeforechristmas.html.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Away in a manger, ya da da da dum, dee dum . . .'' I can
never remember the words to all those holiday songs. Can you? If
not, check out www.primenet.com/kringle/. You'll find the words and
some decent .wav files that will have you singing in no time!
</P>
<P>
   - Well, the geese and maids-a-milking still cost the same as
last year. But just about everything else in the traditional song,
``The Twelve Days of Christmas,'' cost more in 1998. Check out an
official accounting at www.pncbank.com/12days/.
</P>
<P>
   - Oh yes. I know you want to hear them. Yes, yes. You deny it.
Go ahead. But you'll sneak back to your desk to listen to them
again later, won't you? I'm talking, of course, about ``Jingle
Cats'' and ``Jingle Dogs'' and, yes, this year's special, ``Jingle
Pigs.'' And they're not just singing, they're in QuickTime movies!
Find them at www.forthnet.gr/astronet/business/jingles/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking for images of Santa or Rudolph? Check out a new image
search site called Arriba Vista at www.arribavista.com. It works
pretty well, offering up a quick list of images available on the
Internet. The folks behind the site were billing it as
``pornography free.' But I managed to pull up some off-color images
with a single search. (No, I won't tell you how!) The Arriba Vista
folks said they'll stop claiming the site is porn-free, but
maintain that they've taken many steps, including blocking specific
Web sites and search terms, to keep pornographic images from
showing up during searches. They deserve some credit for their
effort. So, give it a try, but be forewarned that Arriba Vista
isn't perfect. (I'm not sure any site is!)
</P>
<P>
   - If you have the urge to cook this holiday season, and you'd
like to try something besides that pork stuffing dish your mother
always made, check out Christmas Recipe.com at
www.christmasrecipe.com. The site offers a wide variety of recipes
and cooking tips. There's also a glossary so you can look up
confusing ingredients. Additionally, the site allows users to
search its recipe database for just the right dish. You can search
using any keyword or ingredient. Yum!
</P>
<P>
   - The final days before Christmas can be hectic. Gifts to buy.
Rooms to clean. Relatives arriving. And, of course, the kids are
out of school! Want to keep them busy? Check out the Crafts for
Christmas page at www.imagitek.com/xmas/crafts. The site offers
basic instructions for many holiday crafts, including snowflakes
you can hang on the tree, paper angels, tin can toys and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   - When Uncle Harry starts boring everybody with his know-it-all
attitude, ask him if he knows how cold it is at the North Pole.
Then, stand up and say, ```You know, Harry, we can find out real
quick if you're right!'' Then, check out The Weather Channel's
North Pole page at www.weather.com/northpole/. If Harry is wrong,
maybe he'll stay quiet for a couple days. Then again, he might be
right!
</P>
<P>
   - Want to send Santa some e-mail? It's getting late, but you can
still give it a shot. One site to check is Santa's Official Web
Site at northpole4kids.netnation.com/1998/america/west/server.htm.
You can send e-mail not only to Santa, but to Rudolph, the elves
and others. While you're there, you can check out the Christmas
tunes, stories, contests and lots more! While you're at it, try
www.santaclausonline.com/, which offers many of the same features.
</P>
<P>
   - Every year, the U.S. Postal Service receives thousands of
letters from kids across America to Santa Claus. The USPS has
created a special Web site that honors this tradition, and allows
visitors to read some of the very best letters to Santa. Find it at
www.usps.gov/letters/volume2/santa-main.html. (You best keep a dry
hanky handy.)
</P>
<P>
   - Uh-oh. You just opened the mailbox and found a Christmas card
from somebody who wasn't on your list! Don't panic! If they have an
e-mail address, you can send them an electronic holiday greeting
card free. There are many Web sites that offer this service. One
you can try is www.123greetings.com/christmas/. Have fun!
</P>
<P>
   - Ever heard of the term ```Webring?'' It's a way Web sites of
similar topics can group themselves together. It's kind of like an
advertising co-op. Similar sites link to each other. Tap into the
right Webring, and you might find hundreds of sites offering what
you need. You can tap into Santa's Christmas Webring at &QL; 
members.aol.com/Lisa1929/santa.html. Links toward the bottom of the
page allow visitors to visit random sites in the Webring or view an
entire list of all the sites that belong. Sure, it's not that much
different from using a Web directory, such as Yahoo! But give it a
shot!
</P>
<P>
   - OK, so the guy across the street put up enough Christmas
lights to attract attention from astronauts in the space shuttle.
Well, be glad you don't live across the street from Nat George. He
spends weeks each year putting up his Centralia, Wash., display.
And if that ain't enough, he has a Web site to show it all to those
who can't drive by! Check it out at
www2.localaccess.com/NGeorge/lights/.
</P>
<P>
   - Hey, guess what. They celebrate Christmas all over the world!
Yep. I figured you'd like to know that. Anyways, there's a great
Web site at christmas.com/worldview/ that will show you h ow the
celebrations are conducted. The site features a clickable world map
and information ranging from music to recipes.
</P>

   - OK, here's one last site: If the kids keep asking, ``Mom, how
much longer is it until Santa comes?'' Don't scream. Sit them down
in front of the computer and call up Nick's Countdown 'Til
Christmas!! page. It's at
home.weborbiter.com/users/user2/countdwn.htm. The page displays the
exact number of days, hours, minutes and seconds left until the Big
Day.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. Hope it makes you happy, and keeps Santa off my
case! &QL;

 &HT;    CUBA CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS, BUT SANTA CLAUS ISN'T INVITED

<P>
   MIAMI _ This week, Cuba officially celebrates Christmas for the
first time in three decades. As such, the government is discounting
roast pork and other traditional fare, while youngsters are acting
out Jesus Christ's birth at a pageant in Old Havana's National
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a limit to the yuletide spirit of hard-line
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   They are demanding that Santa Claus, for example, not come to
town.
</P>
<P>
   Official newspapers warn that the jolly old man in red is an
unwelcome agent of U.S. cultural imperialism that threatens the
ideological integrity of this socialist nation.
</P>
<P>
   The daily La Tribuna de La Habana said that Christmas imagery
such as fake trees and Santa Claus foment ``ideological confusion''
within Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' weekly Trabajadores -- which means ``workers'' --
called Santa Claus a threatening symbol of U.S. ``consumerism,''
``cultural hegemony,'' and ``mental colonization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no true Cuban way to celebrate Christmas?'' the
newspaper pointedly asked.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers -- all of which are state-owned -- also blasted
Santa Claus as the leading representative of the ``hagiography of
U.S. mercantilism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's been no shortage of cardboard cutouts of Santa
Claus in stores and hotels -- imported, of course -- in Cuba this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, most Cuban children know little about the
beloved chubby elf so popular in the United States -- just 90 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of decorations in hotels and in stores, but
kids here don't know who Santa Claus is,'' Eli Lopez, a mother of
three, said by telephone from Havana. ``Santa Claus is something
they're just not used to, so he's just another decoration to most
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said most average Cubans can't afford to decorate their
homes with Santa Claus or any other imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas trees, for example, cost up to $50, or more than twice
the monthly salary of a Cuban doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing strains between Cuba's churches and a government
that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained an
official holiday in Cuba until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Cuban government declared that Christmas was no
longer a public holiday, asserting at the time that it interfered
with the sugar harvest.
</P>
<P>
   But last month(Nov.), the Communist Party said mechanization had
reduced the need for manpower in the harvest so that Christmas can
again, become a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Cuba observers say the re-establishment of
Christmas is yet another concession to the Catholic Church
following Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba last January.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba also has released about 100 political prisoners and has
allowed more foreign priests to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   This year, decorated Christmas trees adorn hotel lobbies and
store windows display scenes with artificial snow throughout
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But even church leaders in Cuba lament the fact that holiday
expressions on the Caribbean island are, mostly, secular.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans are glad to have the day off, but few understand
that Christmas observes the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega said Tuesday that the
church must strive to restore the religious traditions of
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a job that I think will take many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Cubans planned to attend Midnight Mass on Christmas
Eve for the first time in years. Others had purchased cheap plastic
Nativity scenes for their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Santa Claus is in good company. Mickey Mouse, too,
has been criticized by hard-line Communists as a tool of U.S.
cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mexico withdrew its ambassador from Cuba
after Cuban President Fidel Castro suggested that Mexican children
knew more about Mickey Mouse than their own national heroes.

GIFT IDEAS FOR THE SPORTS ENTHUSIAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas is looking you in the face and you're still four gifts
short, rushing through the holiday crowd to find something,
anything, that's doesn't smell funny and isn't broken.
</P>
<P>
   But before you give up and buy some piece of cheese that'll be
thrown in the trash as soon as it's opened, take a glance at these
books for the sports fan on your list:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Moments: The Official Book of the 1998 World Series.''
Edited by David Burgin. Woodford Press, San Francisco. $19.95. 144
pages.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain train of thought that says the event justifies
the means. You see this a lot at rock concerts, where people shell
out $25 for so-what T-shirts just to say they've been there. The
same holds true in sports, from the Final Four to the NFL playoffs
to the World Series _ you buy something because it says the event
was important to you.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``Great Moments: The Official Book of the 1998 World
Series,'' published by the Woodford Press. Once you say the writing
in ``Great Moments'' is good and the photography is ordinary,
you've said it all. After that, the only question is whether you
want to spend $19.95 for a large paperback about the '98 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Moments'' offers plenty of good writing, including Ray
Ratto, the sports columnist for the San Francisco Examiner, talking
about the Yanks' Chuck Knoblauch and Andy Pettite and the way the
Padres took defeat to heart. Here's Ratto on Paul O'Neill's catch
of Wally Joyner's long fly ball with two men on and two out in Game
Two: ``Ask any old baseball man the question and he will give you
the answer: `There is always one point in a game when you have a
chance to win.' For the Padres in Game Two, the chance came in the
very first inning. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Koppett makes the argument for the '98 Yankees being the
best team of all time, Orange County Register columnist Mark
Whicker speaks up for the Padres, and Boston Globe columnist Martin
Nolan looks back at the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the words, there are the pictures _ and the pictures
are no better and no worse than every other World Series paperback
of the past 20 years. Pitchers are pitching. Batters are batting.
Runners are running. Fans are fanning. Winners are celebrating.
There are a handful of Hollywood faces and the same grainy look to
night games you find in all sports books.
</P>
<P>
   Except for some curiosities, like the Star Trek outfit Padre
catcher Carlos Hernandez insisted on wearing behind the plate,
there is nothing that separates these pictures from the '97 Series
or the '96 Series or the '95 Series or, for that matter, any Series
since the pajama-clad October Classics of the '70s. It is hard to
believe anyone but a tried-and-true Yankee fan would need to have
this on his shelf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrating 70: Mark McGwire's Historic Season.'' Edited by
Ron Smith. Sporting News Publishing, St. Louis. $29.95. 184 pages.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a picture book you want, this is the one. ``Celebrating
70'' has a breakdown of each McGwire homer _ the count, how many on
base, how many outs, McGwire's batting average, RBIs, and the homer
counts of Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The book also offers the best quotes and most memorable pictures
of the homer race, topped off with the good writing of Ron Smith,
Bernie Miklasz, Mike Eisenbath and Dave Kindred.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just an endless series of shots of McGwire swinging
the bat _ the photos are crisp and colorful and to the point.
There's a section on ``The men who came before,'' black-and-white
studies of Roger Maris and Babe Ruth, a section on Sosa's hottest
weekend, a section on McGwire's batting practices, and a set of
little-known statistics, such as the fact that McGwire finished the
year with nine more homers than singles, that his homer total was
three better than Earl Webb's 1931 record for doubles in a season,
and that 70 homers was three more than the Cardinals hit in 1982,
the year they won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The book is well laid-out and the quotes are given good play,
from Giants' pitcher Rich Rodriguez _ who gave up No. 22 _ saying,
``At least I made SportsCenter,'' to the Astros' Craig Biggio
saying, after a two-homer day from McGwire, ``You've got to get
that family of four out of the left field seats before he kills
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The book smacks too much of hero worship, but this is the
Sporting News' hometown team and what McGwire did, after all, was
historic. As McGwire said at the end, ``I can't believe I did it.
Can you? It blows me away.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Values of the Game.'' Bill Bradley. Artisan, New York. $30.
160 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, former NBA player and senator who is at times
mentioned as a presidential candidate, has written an intelligent,
readable memoir of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He writes about his teammates in the National Basketball
Association, about the solitary joy of standing behind your house,
sinking one free throw after another, of the days when his mother
would challenge him in a one-on-one game, and how easy it was to
decide between the Boy Scouts and basketball when he was told he'd
be cut from the team if he missed another practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who grew up in Missouri, wore shoe weights to improve
his vertical leap, learned to dribble the ball without ever looking
down and got into every pickup game he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced three to four hours a day Monday through Friday
and five hours a day on Saturday and Sunday,'' he writes. ``In the
fall, before basketball season began, I ran along streets in town,
through fields, over railroad tracks, down to the banks of the
Mississippi and back.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment makes all the difference, argues Bradley (``For high
school and college players, there is no excuse for not being `up
for the game'''), and that commitment can lead to excellence in the
sport he loves the most. It's an expanding sport, open to both men
and women, writes Bradley, who pays homage to the women's game _
``I used to love to watch Kate Starbird spark her Stanford team
with her tenacity, intensity and 3-point shooting skill, but the
epitome, for me, is Chamique Holdsclaw of Tennessee, the female
Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Football's Best Short Stories.'' Edited By Paul D. Staudohar.
Chicago Review Press. $22. 328 pages.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book for preteeners, with Chip Hitchcock breaking
tackles all the way down the field for Winsocki U. This is a sports
book for adults. Or, more correctly, a sports book for adults who
feel nostalgic for the way football was played when they were
growing up, when they were playing themselves, when it had a real
hold on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The theme is set from the opening story, ``56-0,'' a saga of a
losing team that's meant to be belly-laugh funny but isn't. The
stumbling sadness of ``56-0'' sets a tone for lost times and
broken-heart football that runs throughout the book. Irwin Shaw's
``The Eighty-Yard Run,'' maybe his best short story ever, repeats
that theme. So does Don DeLillo's ``Game Plan'' and John Updike's
``In Football Season,'' with its opening, ``Do you remember a
fragrance girls acquire in autumn? As you walk beside them after
school ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Football's Best Short Stories'' is exactly what it's cracked
up to be _ the best stories ever written about the game. But don't
expect it to be an easy read.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Power, Money &AMP; Sex.'' Deion Sanders. World Publishing,
Nashville. $21.99. 194 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have a born-again Christian on your list or can't get
enough of that talk-show cliche about the eternal curse of riches,
give this book a pass.
</P>
<P>
   There are some interesting passages, especially when Sanders
offers his reasons for dumping a bucket of water on announcer Tim
McCarver and taking a chartered jet between a Falcons and Braves
game to play two sports on one day. But the ex-Braves, ex-Reds,
ex-Falcons, ex-49ers standout spends precious little time talking
about his sports career.
</P>
<P>
   Basically the book is a sermon, with Sanders continually
repeating the theme that, ``Some people spend their whole lives
thinking that if they could just get more power, money and sex,
they would be happy. But as somebody who has had more than my share
of all three, I can tell you this: In themselves, those things will
not make you happy.''

 &HT;    `Young Frankenstein' lurches onto DVD
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What better companion piece for a (James) Whale of an evening on
home video than the special edition of Mel Brooks' inspired 1974
spoof, ``Young Frankenstein,'' starring Gene Wilder, Teri Garr and
Peter Boyle as the Monster (who joins his creator in a rendition of
``Puttin' on the Ritz''). The DVD format beautifully conveys the
film's luminous black-and-white cinematography. Bonuses include a
36-minute documentary featuring Brooks' comments and the
ever-popular original theatrical trailers (``See `Young
Frankenstein,' in black and white and echo!''). There's also a
selection of bloopers, but they're mostly disappointing stuff _
like Wilder and Garr cracking up during their love scenes.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of movies released on video
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cousin Bette'' (R) _ Balzac's 1846 novel may have been
whittled down, but there's still much to like about this
deliciously tart comedy of ill manners and worse morals that slowly
ripens into a revenger's tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the
overlooked and underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate
revenge scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful
supporting cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Grade: A-
ER
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' (R) _ Is he or isn't he?
That's the very thin question stretched to feature length in this
comedy about a gay man (Sean P. Hayes, bottom left, with Brad Rowe
) who wonders if a supposedly straight waiter secretly isn't. The
movie is colorful and breezy, but like its dimpled object of
desire, it's cute but shallow. Grade: B- SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Midaq Alley'' (unrated) _ Salma Hayek is among the large
cast of this drama, a bittersweet series of interrelated tales
about misplaced love and heartbreak among neighbors in Mexico City.
Based on stories by Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz. In Spanish,
with subtitles. Grade: A- SM

 &HT;    Vampire flick adds cartoon gore to the Christmas season
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blade'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, vampires popping like fat
tics... New Line Cinema gives us a bloody little Xmas with this
frantic film version of the comic book hero, starring Wesley Snipes
as Blade, a half-human, half-bloodsucker vampire slayer in modern
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has its amusing moments, recasting the undead as
leather-wearing hipsters who frequent nightclubs that become
literal bloodbaths. Stephen Dorff plays the upstart vampire who
wants to climb the bloody ladder, which gives the actor a chance to
smolder and walk around with beard stubble. Meanwhile, Snipes takes
his role very, very seriously, which makes him pretty boring.
</P>
<P>
   What few cartoonish pleasures the movie offers are killed by an
overblown finale, featuring computer-generated special effects that
seem to transform the bad guys into giant, bloody hemorrhoids.
Scary. Grade: C +

 &HT;    The giant talent of James Whale
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fate has a serious sense of humor. More than 40 years after
dying in near-obscurity, director James Whale has suddenly become a
hot ticket again, thanks to the new movie ``Gods and Monsters'' and
Ian McKellen's prize-winning performance in it. But some of us have
been wild about Whale since, well, since Forrest J. Ackerman
published the first copy of ``Famous Monsters of Filmland.'' But if
``Gods and Monsters'' has piqued your interest, here are a few
Whale rentals to consider. And, yes, we do emphasize the
monster-mash side of his oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   `Frankenstein' (1931)
</P>
<P>
   The one we all know, with Boris Karloff as the Monster and Colin
Clive screaming, ``It's alive!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casting coup: Having just scored with ``Dracula,'' Bela Lugosi
was seriously considered. But Whale thought that having the same
actor play two classic monsters was absurd (plus, he thought Lugosi
wrong for the part). Enter struggling actor and former truck driver
William Henry Pratt _ stage name, Boris Karloff. Whale interviewed
him and told him he wanted to test him ``for a damned awful
monster.'' He got the part.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for: Mae Clarke. She plays Clive's fiancee, but is better
known for being on the wrong end of Jimmy Cagney's grapefruit in
``Public Enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about it: In one of the most famous scenes, the Monster
is taught by a little girl to toss petals into a lake. A few
minutes later, he tosses her, thinking that she too will float like
the petals. Years later, the young actress, 7-year-old Marilyn
Harris, recalled that after a few takes she complained because
hitting the water hurt. Whale promised her anything she wanted if
she'd do it again. After the wrap, she blurted out that she wanted
two dozen eggs, which Whale _ probably relieved that it wasn't a
pony or a diamond _ delivered.
</P>
<P>
   `The Old Dark House' (1932)
</P>
<P>
   On the proverbial dark and stormy night, an assortment of
travelers are stranded at a very strange domicile.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casting coup: Brought over for another film that was delayed
by co-star Tallulah Bankhead's illness, Charles Laughton actually
made his American debut working for Whale. He's relatively
restrained in a cast of scenery-chewing loonies who range from
Karloff to Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorius in ``The Bride of
Frankenstein'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for: Gloria Stuart. Yep, the lovely old lady whose
memories launch James Cameron's ``Titanic'' is the ingenue here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about it: A house full of crazies. A stormy night. Some
stranded innocents. Do the words ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show''
come to mind?
</P>
<P>
   `The Invisible Man' (1933)
</P>
<P>
   H.G. Wells' classic about a scientist who invents a formula for
becoming invisible but is driven mad by its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casting coup: Universal, naturally, earmarked this for its
monster-in-residence, Karloff. Whale had other ideas. He went with
Claude Rains, who'd never made a movie before. Whale knew Rains'
stage work and felt that his soothing voice was a perfect contrast
to the violence he commits. Rains went on to make movies such as
``Casablanca'' and ``Notorious.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for: Gloria Stuart. Again.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about it: It took nine writers, six treatments and 10
different screenplays to get ``The Invisible Man'' onscreen. Among
those who passed through the writers' mill were a couple of guys
named Preston Sturges and John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   `The Bride of Frankenstein' (1935)
</P>
<P>
   The Monster wants a bride. Whether she wants him is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casting coup: Karloff returns as the Monster, even though he'd
clearly been blown to bits in the original. Ah, the magic of
sequels.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for: Elsa Lanchester, not once but twice. Most movie fans
know that she plays the Bride with the electro-shock hair. But she
also plays Frankenstein's true creator, Mary Shelley, in the film's
prologue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about it: ``The Bride of Frankenstein'' is one of the 25
movies added this year to the Library of Congress's National Film
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   `Showboat' (1936)
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The celebrated musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar
Hammerstein II.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casting coup: This is the version with Paul Robeson singing
``Ol' Man River.'' 'Nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for: Hattie McDaniel as Queenie. She replaced the
originally cast Tess Gardella. What was wrong with Gardella? She
was a white actress who had performed the role on stage in
blackface. It being the late 1930s, the problem, alas, wasn't
blackface, but the protests that could arise from a white actress
playing a black actor's (Robeson's) wife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about it: This was Whale's public declaration that he
was out of the monster-movie business. Five years later, his career
was over. He completed his last feature in 1941.

ISAAC NEWTON AND THE SPIRIT OF SELF-SACRIFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On Christmas Day, in addition to everything
else, we celebrate the birth of the greatest intellect in human
history.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 25, 1642, in the tiny village of Woolsthorpe, England, a
Christmas baby was born. The mother was a grieving widow whose
husband had died less than 10 weeks earlier. She christened the
baby Isaac, after his father. Born prematurely, he was not expected
to live.
</P>
<P>
   This baby grew up to be Isaac Newton, the most important
physicist and mathematician of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how Newton, while still in his early 20s, came up
with the law of universal gravitation after watching the apples
fall in his mother's garden is well-known, and probably false.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known _ but most definitely true _ is that Newton
accomplished most of his great work during a two-year explosion of
creativity in which he also invented calculus, determined the
particle nature of light, pinned down the binomial theorem and
demonstrated that white light is not white at all but instead is
made up of all the colors of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   During this same two years _ from the summer of 1665 to early
spring, 1667 _ he also formulated the observations he was to later
write up in ``Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,'' the
single most influential scientific treatise ever written, and the
key to all known physics till the dawn of this century.
</P>
<P>
   What came forth from Newton's mind during these two fevered
years of concentration, curiosity and imagination was a true
revolution _ a revolution not only in how to observe and calculate
but also in how to explain the universe and everything in it.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a mark of Newton's enduring flame that Newtonian
physics _ now well over 300 years old _ remains the tool modern
science employs both to describe most of what takes place in our
world and to create nearly all of our latest technologies. Even
relativity and quantum theory, which have replaced the Newtonian
view at the subatomic and galactic edges of the universe, are
themselves deeply rooted in Newton's two years of inspiration and
insight.
</P>
<P>
   How did these two years come about? Although not, in all
likelihood, gaping at falling apples, Newton was indeed in his
mother's garden in Woolsthorpe for much of his two-year miracle _
and when not in her garden, then upstairs in his bedroom or
otherwise on her property. Newton was staying so close to home
because home was safe, and the rest of England was not; the Great
Plague was ravaging London, and it looked like the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The plague hit London with unparalleled violence. By April 1665,
it was an epidemic; by September, it was killing 8,000 people a
week. Newton, who received his bachelor's degree from Cambridge in
May 1665, went to Woolsthorpe soon afterward, just as the
university was closed as a safety measure. Only when the epidemic
ended did Newton's self-exile end.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak and unusual circumstances in which this Christmas baby
accomplished his greatest work offers a special lesson this holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Most people associate ``the spirit of Christmas'' with
self-sacrifice _ the deliberate giving of oneself, body or soul (or
both), in the name of a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, Newton does not appear to have sacrificed
himself; he fled the plague to survive, not to help humanity.
However, once safe in his mother's garden, he managed to help
humanity by bequeathing a most marvelous, useful and powerful gift
_ the gift of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Newton was able to offer so mighty a gift because he did, in a
very real sense, sacrifice himself. Newton _ like Galileo and
Shakespeare before him, or Einstein and Picasso in our own century
_ gave himself up to his art.
</P>
<P>
   He dedicated himself, body and soul, for two years, to the
highest standards of intellectual excellence and the unwavering
commitment to scientific truth. And it was this willing dedication
_ this selfless commitment _ that led to the greatest outburst of
scientific inspiration in world history.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Isaac Newton is that the giving of oneself, in the
name of a greater good, takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   This season, we can all be thankful for, and inspired by, those
who have so sacrificed, whether by giving their time, their wealth,
or their very lives _ or by committing themselves to the high
calling of knowledge and the simple pursuit of truth.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a problem that has countless women grumbling in store
dressing rooms across America and catalog retailers like Eddie
Bauer, L. L. Bean and Lands' End complaining bitterly about
millions of dollars in merchandise returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic world of women's clothing sizes, the numbers that
shoppers see on garment tags, from tiny 2 all the way to 20, have
become all but meaningless. Women waste hours trying on clothes
that droop or squeeze, and catalog vendors end up with costly
returns from similarly frustrated mail-order customers.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog companies say the answer to decades of frustration
over finding the right fit is simple: Create sizing standards
across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that is anathema to upscale clothiers such as Donna Karan
and Ellen Tracy, which use ``vanity sizing'' to make shoppers think
they are spending their big bucks on fashionably small-sized
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   High-end designers have learned that it is profitable to flatter
women by offering tiny sizes on big garments. The result is that a
woman could fit into a size 6 from one manufacturer but have to
jump all the way to a 12 from another.
</P>
<P>
   The push to eliminate the decades-old guessing game in women's
apparel is being spurred largely by the fast-growing mail-order and
Internet apparel businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog retailers know that accurate sizing is critical since
women can't try on their merchandise. More and more catalogs devote
pages? catolog pages are devoted to explaining sizes and
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Some department stores, such as Target, also are pushing for
consistency to help their customers, and are urging vendors to
comply with a current? (or is comply wrong verb?) set of standards
in sizing.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since 1942, a major three-year was it a
3-yr study in 42? study is underway to measure the size and shape
of American woman.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative pleases many in the industry who say too many
women are suffering from fitting-room fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the market transitions to a more relevant set of standards,
it will make more obvious those who are not in synch,'' says
Michael Alexin, vice president of design and product development
for Seattle-based Eddie Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-end designers are not eager for any of this. They
have made money on vanity sizing, and that has led to today's
haphazard size labeling. (The exception to the high-end rule that
smaller is better is, no surprise, in bra sizing. For more
expensive bras, size labels tend to run big.)
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Goldsberry, associate professor of retailing at the
University of Arizona in Phoenix, says pricey designers have
learned all too well that many women love to exclaim, ``I have a
wonderful dress! And it's a size 2!'' And that they will cough up
extra dollars to say that.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Hunton, vice president of Wolf Form Co. in Englewood, N.J.,
which makes garment-fitting forms for companies such as Donna Karan
and Ellen Tracy, says high-end designers will never go along
willingly with a uniform sizing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still want to do their own thing. . . . It makes the
woman customer feel better,'' Hunton says.
</P>
<P>
   He says Ellen Tracy sells size 8 clothes with measurements that
other apparel makers sell as a size 12.
</P>
<P>
   While some shoppers may feel flattered and pay for the
privilege, the sizing game infuriates others, who would like to see
women's clothes come with meaningful, consistent measurements _ in
inches _ as men's clothing does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see measurements on clothes,'' says Meredith
Pooler, 18, after using holiday gift money to buy herself
custom-fit jeans at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``You never know
with different makers what your size is or what a size small,
medium or large means.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people in the industry don't think manufacturers will
start displaying actual measurements on garment tags, as is done
for women's clothing in many parts of Europe, any time soon. They
say American women don't want to see their hip measurement on a
tag. And some clothes makers say the standard trio of measurements
(bust, waist, and hips), plus height, are often overly simplistic
predictors of fit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they are eager for standards, almost everyone in
the industry agrees that there's a need for updated information on
the size of the American woman as we approach the millennium. This
information will help all clothing manufacturers develop
better-proportioned and better-fitting clothes, regardless of how
sizes are labeled.
</P>
<P>
   The only sizing chart based on actual measurements of American
women dates to 1942, when more than 10,000 military women were
measured at different body points. The US Department of Commerce
used this data to assign size numbers from 2 to 20 to correspond to
different sets of measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, this data is hopelessly outdated. The average
woman then was 5 feet 2 inches and weighed 129 pounds. Today, the
average woman is about 5 feet 4 inches and weighs about 142 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While makers of mass-produced clothes may have followed these
guidelines in the 1940s, companies later began to realize that the
shape and size of the typical American woman were growing. Each
company tinkered with its numbers in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five decades, women's sizing became increasingly
haphazard. Finally, in 1994, the American Society for Testing and
Materials, which sets sizing standards in the industry, came out
with new guidelines. It was based on then-current practices in the
industry, but no new measurements.
</P>
<P>
   According to this chart, which is followed more or less by
catalog vendors and some product lines today, a size 10 woman would
measure 36 inches at the bust, 28 inches at the waist and 38 1/2 at
the hips. In 1942, a 10 measured 33 1/2, 24 1/2, and 35 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But many apparel makers aren't happy with the chart, and even
the society acknowledges it should have updated the measurements of
women. But an attempt several years ago to drum up funding for a
new measurement study failed, largely because many manufacturers
didn't want to help.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged in its place is a three-year study, sponsored and
funded by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the US Air Force and
some apparel manufacturers. For different reasons, they all want
updated figures on the size of the typical male and female aged 18
to 65. The Air Force wants to make better flight suits, the auto
makers want better-fitting seats, and clothes makers want
better-fitting garments.
</P>
<P>
   The study began last December and will measure more than 10,000
people in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a database, businesses can begin to cater to a
particular clientele,'' says Jo Ann Pullen, who heads the textiles
committee for the Testing and Materials Society and is also a high
school instructor of consumer and health issues in Northfield.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an alternative to standardization: mass
customization. Some companies envision customers outfitting
dressing rooms with high-tech body scanners that record multiple
body measurements. Garments would then be custom-designed for a
particular body type.
</P>
<P>
   David Bruner, manager of research and development for TC
Squared, a company in Cary, N.C., says the beauty of body scanning
is that women won't ever have to know any numbers. The information
can be put in a file, and used to make their clothes. ``There's no
stigma attached to a size,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner acknowledges that a big obstacle to this effort is the
cost. Body scanners sold by his company cost about $100,000 each,
and so far, he says, he has sold exactly two.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is experimenting with a program called ``Original
Spin'' that allows Meredith Pooler and other customers to obtain
jeans for $55 that are custom-fitted to their measurements, though
for now that information is obtained with old-fashioned measuring
tapes. The system also allows customers to choose options for
color, fly and leg opening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the wave of the future turns out to be standardization
or mass customization, ``the status quo is very difficult for
women,'' says Susan Ashdown, associate professor in the textile
department at Cornell University. ``The industry is finally waking
up. The whole level of frustration with clothes shopping has
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW WOMEN GROW BUT STAY THE SAME SIZE &QL; 
 &QL; 
In 1942 manufacturers relied on a US Department of Commerce chart
to put sizes on their clothes. Since then, companies have departed
from the chart and each has gone its own way. The only updated
sizing chart in 1994, from the American Society for Testing and
Materials. It attempted to summarize the typical sizing practices
in the industry today, though many companies deviate wildly from
it. &QL;

Highway 15 was ripped away by a raging river, that Nelson Martinez
met Jerry Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez owns a cement company near the river and has been
working overtime to make cement culverts for Harris, the chief of a
US Navy construction battalion that is rebuilding the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   They met only a month ago, but they sound like best friends.
``Great guy,'' Harris said of Martinez. ``I'm glad they're here,''
Martinez responded.
</P>
<P>
   Through the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch,
there are signs throughout this hurricane-damaged country of
stronger ties between Hondurans and the US military.
</P>
<P>
   These new bonds may prove even more valuable as American
officials start shopping for new locations in Central and South
America for military forces that must soon leave Panama. Already,
preliminary discussions for new US locations have begun with
governments in Honduras, Peru, and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement to hand over control of the Panama
Canal by the end of next year, the United States must close Howard
Air Force Base, its main airfield, by May 1. The base has been the
center of most of the US-led operations to stem the flow of cocaine
and other illegal drugs from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Already, plans are underway to move some Panama operations _ as
well as some Miami-based US Southern Command offices _ to Puerto
Rico. But there is still a desire to have an operating location
elsewhere in Central or South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at some places, but this is still in the very
early stages,'' a State Department spokesman said. ``I don't
believe any formal requests have been made to any country.''
</P>
<P>
   The US military has maintained a base of operations since 1983
at the Soto Cano Air Base north of the capital city of Tegucigalpa.
As many as 2,000 troops were stationed here in the late 1980s, when
Honduras served as the base for American-backed Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the base is home to an assortment of humanitarian,
reconstruction and anti-drug efforts throughout Central America
known as Joint Task Forces Bravo. More than 2,000 US troops are now
stationed in Honduras, most of them involved in medical and
rebuilding projects following Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closure of Howard is a great concern strategically for
this theater,'' said Colonel Chuck Jacoby, commander of US forces
at Soto Cano. ``There will be some migration of missions, but there
is a general belief that no one site can replace Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no immediate plans to expand the US presence
at Soto Cano, Jacoby and other officials said, it is likely that
some of equipment currently housed in Panama may be sent to
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Honduran government offered to take in more US
personnel and equipment from Panama, but the Americans declined
because they were negotiating an extension to their stay at Howard.
Those talks broke down in September.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stronger feelings of cooperation that have blossomed
recently with the Hondurans, the idea of a permanent presence of US
soldiers here is still a sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the American military has been at Soto Cano for 15
years, permanent barracks have never been built for troops who
still sleep mostly on wooden cots. In addition, officials have been
cautious to closely coordinate hurricane cleanup efforts with the
Honduran government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful about the messages we send to the Honduran
people,'' one US officer said. ``We don't want to make them think
that we're trying to control things.''
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Flores, who has requested a free trade
agreement between Honduras and the United States, is in Washington
this week to meet with other Central American presidents, financial
institutions and Clinton administration officials. Flores has not
commented publicly on the issue of a larger American military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Mario David Villanueva, the Honduran military's chief
spokesman, praised his US counterparts for ``their constant support
and cooperation over the years and especially after Mitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva added: ``They responded quickly because they were
already here. With our history together, it might make sense'' to
expand their presence at Soto Cano. ``But that is something that
must negotiated at the highest levels of government and with the
permission of the Honduran people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some US officials say a larger site at Soto Cano might
logistically restrict efforts only to Central America. For that
reason, distributing some of the Panama personnel and resources to
Ecuador or Peru would provide more immediate access to anti-drug
efforts in South America.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jacoby said, his troops will continue to help rebuild
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission remains relatively unchanged as the strategic
gateway to Central America,'' he said. ``This has been a calamity,
but it's given us a brighter picture of how well we can work
together.''

LET REALITY IMPINGE BEFORE BUYING LATEST VIDO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by the crop of Christmas computer games, it seems game
developers have finally grasped the concept that, just as not every
car on the highway is a Corvette, not all gamers own screaming
systems with processors churning at 300 MHz and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Games have become more egalitarian and more accommodating of the
variety of configurations populating the real world, but before
anyone cues the orchestra to play ``Fanfare for the Common Man,''
there's a bit of reality to consider first.
</P>
<P>
   While minimum game system requirements have hovered within the
same range over the past year, most hot new games still severely
tax the processing power of most PCs under $1,000, the
fastest-growing area of computer sales. Those requirements are
listed on every box, and any potential game buyer should heed
carefully these estimates of the lowest-powered configuration that
will support the calculation-intensive graphics a game will demand.
</P>
<P>
   Console video games usually don't encounter those pesky hardware
compatibility problems, which is one reason for their popularity.
Just remember that a PlayStation is to a Nintendo 64 machine what a
PC is to a Macintosh _ they're totally different systems. Sega is
another animal altogether, and don't even ask about Dreamcast. It's
a new console developed, in part, by the Sega and Dreamworks
partnership that was supposed to hit stores this Christmas but is
still available only in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Console buyers have less to worry about, and can forget about
squinting at the bottom-of-the-box declarations designed to give
PC-game buyers advance warning. Those fine-print details only
assure that a game will load and run somewhat without crashing; no
guarantees are made that the graphics won't look like day-old
scrambled eggs, regardless of how great they appear on the box. No
doubt hundreds of people who bought a $500 Wal-Mart special will
discover this when they attempt to play Shogo: Mobile Armor
Division or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, two of 1998's best action
games. (Speaking of Wal-Mart, strong sales of Deer Hunter and Big
Game Hunter II have launched these stalk-and-shoot games into the
bestseller list. Also a hot ticket at the nation's megaretailer:
Deer Avenger, a hunting game parody in which the animals exact
their revenge.)
</P>
<P>
   With so much to consider before dropping $50 on a stocking
stuffer, there's a need for guidance _ especially for the gamer who
doesn't have everything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Details, details
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that special someone has a 486-66 or a Mac II, nearly all
current games are beyond the capabilities of these once-powerful
machines, which, to the gaming industry, are now little more than
oversized Palm Pilots. All is not lost; some children's software
will perform adequately on these machines, and major retailers
usually bundle ``old'' games in packs of three or five and sell
them at deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   More options emerge when there's a Pentium or PowerMac in the
home, and these make up the bulk of the home computers sold in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Rally Championship is a great racing game that performs
surprisingly well on low-end Pentiums, even those powered by
relatively poky P75 and P90 chips. (The numbers indicate the speed,
in megahertz, of transactions handled by the microprocessor; higher
is faster.) It sacrifices detailed scenery for smooth transitions
between each computer-rendered picture. The faster these
transitions, or frame rate, the more realistic the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Most children's software will operate quite well on Pentiums
running at 120 MHz, and the best news is that the excellent titles
tend to stick around for several years. We've seen little to
dethrone the Logical Journey of the Zoombinis from this year's
list, a great game that emphasizes problem solving and fortifies
symbolic logic skills. It has strong company in SimSafari, designed
by the developers of the gaming classic SimCity. In this virtual
safari, children build their own game park and populate it with a
variety of animals, with the goal of ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
   Teens and adults who love chess might enjoy Chessmaster 6000,
the latest version of a long-running PC game. It harnesses
computing power as a teaching tool, and can help beginners build
talent and hone the skills of intermediate players. There's a
well-designed, intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, but is
a supplement to a human coach, not a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Speed and status
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bigger still are the choices available for buyers with computers
that are a smidgen faster (P133-200) and with a tad more memory (16
to 32 megs of RAM). These machines can display most of the games on
shelves, with some tweaking needed for high-graphics simulations
and action games. The PC version of Final Fantasy VII immediately
rises to the top, a smooth version of the breakthrough role-playing
game that was last year's must-have for the PlayStation. Ignore the
cartoonish characters drawn in the Japanese anime style and focus
on the cinematic plot-development techniques, which make this one
of the most engaging games ever developed for a console or
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few games share that same rarefied ``classic'' status
with Final Fantasy VII, and two of them are available in one gift
package. Ages of Myst combines Myst with its sequel, Riven, and
links two of the best-selling adventure games of all time. These
are games for those quiet nights when introspection and mental
dexterity can help erase the day's toil. They use lush images and
detailed puzzles to create an absorbing experience that few games
can replicate.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Arts dives into the quirky end of the game pool with
releases like Grim Fandango, a twisted journey through a stylized
underworld. It's a cult hit that blends a rollicking adventure with
intricate gameplay, and delivers well-timed adrenaline rushes
moderated with humor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Microsoft-headed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft endures its trials in Washington, the company's
games division continues to release well-made, challenging titles.
One of this year's best is Combat Flight Simulator, probably the
most aptly named game of the bunch. It's an elegant marriage of
World War II air battles and the sim genre-leading physics of the
Microsoft Flight Simulator graphics engine.
</P>
<P>
   It boasts stellar graphics, especially on a computer outfitted
with the optional 3D-accelerator card, and here we begin to see the
benefits of higher-end machines with processors skipping along at
more than 200 MHz. A fast machine definitely helps Combat Flight
Simulator, but much of its performance can be attributed to the
game developer's careful choice of vintage aircraft that operate at
half the speed of modern jet fighters. With the Mustangs,
Thunderbolts, and Messerschmitts moving relatively slowly, the
computer can draw the detailed terrain faster, eliminating frame
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Jet lovers should consider Jane's F-15 and Total Air War from
DID, which both deliver impressive realism and sophisticated flight
modeling but put players behind the controls of flame-belching
fighters. Of course, Jane's is a well-established chronicler of
military and civilian vehicles, so there's attention to detail in
its electronic entertainment products that help them live up to the
venerable name.
</P>
<P>
   Combine science-fiction fantasy and a nearly flawless strategy
game and the result is Starcraft, easily one of the best games of
the year. It was released this past January and quickly developed a
strong word-of-mouth buzz due to addictive gameplay and detailed
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Console fans have a wide selection this year, but among the best
is Zelda: Ocarina of Time, a role-play/adventure game for Nintendo
64 that was a show stopper at last summer's Electronic
Entertainment Expo. It's the latest ``how'd-he-do-that'' creation
from Shigeru Miyamoto, the godfather of gaming at Nintendo, who
created Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and other design hallmarks.
PlayStation owners should consider Tekken 3, the console version of
the popular arcade fighting game; Xenogears, a dark morality play
that looks like Final Fantasy VII in the present; and Cool Boarders
3, a snowboarding game that still has a lot of work ahead to catch
up to its Nintendo 64 counterpart, 1080 Snowboarding.

PATRIOTS WIN SHOWS HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As the Patriots danced off the field after
Sunday's win over the 49ers, all were ecstatic. But one went out of
his way to send a message as well as share his joy.
</P>
<P>
   From the 50-yard line all the way to the runway leading to the
locker room, Larry Whigham kept pounding his heart with his fist.
Whigham turned toward the stands behind the New England bench and
pounded his heart, and then Whigham faced those true Patriot
loyalists in the end zone seats and pounded his heart even more.
</P>
<P>
   The message was obvious: This football team had just
demonstrated that it has heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't look at this football team this year and show that
we have a lot of heart, that we have a lot of guys willing to put
everything they have out on the football field, then I don't know
what you're looking at,'' said Whigham. ``I mean, it meant a lot to
our coach (Pete Carroll) to win this game, it meant a lot to us
players to win this game, and it meant so much for all us to get
into the playoffs. We're going to have Willie McGinest back next
Sunday . . . and we're going to show that heart as long as we keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The absolute requirement of any coach is that he gets his team
to play hard, to play up to its ability. This is true in all sports
but most essential in football, where effort often means as much
as, if not more than, execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not do that in St. Louis; the Patriots clearly
did so a week later against San Francisco. Just as they had in the
wins over Miami, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh during the last improbable
month after injuries decimated the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows much the character of the team and the players, for
a team to step it up when it loses so many of its key players,''
said linebacker Marty Moore. ``When guys go down, other guys step
it up. And that's what we've been doing all year. That's what
football is all about; when you have guys hurt and other guys step
in and help the team win, that makes the whole team a lot
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of our bigger wins since I've been here,'' said
linebacker Chris Slade. ``With so many ups and downs we had this
year, and so many injuries, this was big. With Drew (Bledsoe) and
Terry (Glenn) and Ted (Johnson) and Willie (McGinest) out . . .
this showed a lot about the heart of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an intangible. But for the Patriots to lose their two
most-feared threats on offense _ not to mention their blocking back
_ and also to lose two of their best players on defense, not to
mention assorted injuries that have slowed those still playing, and
still win is a credit to Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Take four of the best players off any playoff team such as the
Broncos, Jets, Vikings, Bills, 49ers (Steve Young and Jerry Rice
gone?), Packers, or Bills, and surmise what may have happened.
Jacksonville without Mark Brunell already gives a pretty clear hint
of the dire consequences of such losses.
</P>
<P>
   But the tangibles of Carroll's input also were evident Sunday.
In so many ways, this was his most important game since he took
over the Patriots job because he was a Californian, the 49ers had
been his team growing up, he had coached there, and he knew the
personnel and strategy intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot fans always will treat any Jets game with Bill Parcells
coaching the team as the game of games. Of course. And what has
been so frustrating to Patriot fans has been that Parcells (and
Bill Belichick, of course) have used their intimate knowledge of
the Patriots and their players to concoct game plans that have kept
the Patriots off stride in all three games the teams have played
since Parcells took over in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches also have done this against their old teams. Mike
Holmgren's Packers have virtually owned the 49ers in the last five
years, mainly because Holmgren is a former 49ers assistant coach
who used his intimate knowledge of San Francisco to his advantage.
Dan Reeves brought his Falcons into Giants Stadium this year and
absolutely crushed his former team, for much the same reason. Mike
Shanahan's Broncos also have owned the Raiders since Shanahan left
Oakland as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Could Carroll do the same against his old team?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stuck to our game plan,'' said Slade, when asked how
the Patriot defense took away so many of San Francisco's familiar
weapons. ``It was a good game plan.'' San Franciso's conservative
play-calling also helped.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the fourth quarter, Young was sacked on key third- down
plays as he looked to his left to throw that usually so-effective
slant pass that is the trademark of the 49er offense. But both
times, as Young looked to his left, Slade had ``jumped'' the slant,
was between Young and the receiver, and the quarterback had to hold
the ball. Too much time passed, and he was sacked.
</P>
<P>
   On that final sack by Greg Spires with little more than 2
minutes left, and the 49ers facing third and 1 from their 20, the
down-and-distance the 49ers always seem to make with the short
slant pass, ``I saw (Garrison) Hearst leaking out in the flat and
that's my man,'' said Slade. ``I remember thinking that if I went
after (Young), he was going to dump it over my head and complete
the ball and get a first down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Slade stayed ``home,'' stayed inside of Hearst, ``and I
could see that's where (Young) wanted to throw the ball. But he saw
me in coverage and he held the ball, and Greg got him. It was a
coverage sack.'' On San Francisco's bread-and-butter play.
</P>
<P>
   It was similar to what the Jets have been able to do to the
Patriots, take away what they do so well and have done so well.
This time, it was Carroll who took away the San Francisco treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been tough for him,'' said Slade of Carroll's so
often being compared to Parcells. ``He's following a legend:
Parcells. Let's face it, that's the real reason why he's taking
heat. But he's done a good job for us this year. He's following in
big footsteps, and again we're back in the playoffs for his second
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Slade knows New England and New England's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take anything away from what (Carroll) has done,''
said the linebacker. ``But until we beat the Jets, it's going to be
that way.''

NEW BATTLE FRONT: JOB CLASSIFICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a chilly November morning last year, Mike Gallagher left his
house at dawn and headed to his new $22-an-hour job installing
drywall at Sun Microsystems Inc. in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher didn't have much to say when his new boss, Gerard
Poulin, president of Jerry Construction Co. in Hudson, N.H.,
allegedly told him that instead of being classified as a company
employee, he would be working as an independent contractor and
would have to supply his own insurance, and deduct his own state
and federal taxes, pension benefits, and Social Security payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, however, the 34-year-old Walpole carpenter
talked. So did Jim Cunningham, Roldo Cesaroni, and six others, all
part of a nine-member team of undercover union members _ or
``salts'' _ from the New England Regional Council of Carpenters.
Their statements and pay stubs led to a September 1998 raid of
Poulin's business and home office by the Massachusetts attorney
general's office, which is continuing to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Poulin's attorney, Andru Volinsky, of Concord, N.H., said no
action has been filed against his client. The attorney general's
office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars in benefits and pay at stake, unions
and workers from academia to high tech to the blue-collar trades
are battling the misclassification of employees as independent
contractors and contingent workers. Many are turning to the courts
or, as in the case of unions, to salting, organizing campaigns, and
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for workers' anger? No benefits. ``For many, what's
at stake is no workers' compensation coverage in the event of
injury, no health coverage in the event of sickness, no employment
compensation in the event of layoffs, and no Social Security
coverage when they retire,'' said Mark Erlich, senior assistant
administrator for the Boston-based 22,000-member carpenters
council.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one case involving white-collar workers, a court has
ruled that long-term contingent workers are ``common law''
employees. Such workers are like partners in a common law marriage:
they have the same experiences without all the legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   For example, temps and independent!contractors at Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric in California won a lawsuit in October when a judge ruled
they were common law employees.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, employees at Allstate Insurance Co. slapped
the company with a suit alleging that an estimated 10,000 temporary
workers were really long-term temps or commonlaw employees, and
deserved the same rights and benefits as their permanent
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Also this fall, the US Department of Labor, following a probe
into journalists' complaints, sued Time Warner Inc., accusing it of
denying pensions and health benefits to some full-time workers by
wrongfully classifying them as temps or independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Angered by what they described as substandard
treatment, contingent janitors and union activists at Yale
University held a series of high-profile protests that led to a new
six-year contract last year that includes formulas to determine
whether a contingent or temporary janitor ought to become a
permanent, full-time employee.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, meanwhile, a group affiliated with the
Communications Workers of America is attempting to organize
independent contractors and temps at Microsoft Corp., which has
been embroiled in a battle over classification since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that employers find themselves facing lawsuits or
union protests is increasing as the number of contingent employees
entering the work force rises, say experts. They say deciding who
fits the legal definition of an independent contractor or temporary
employee gets murkier as the length of time such workers are
employed extends beyond a few months to a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now have is a new species of temps or independent
contractors,'' said Joshua Davis, an employment lawyer at Hill &AMP;
Barlow in Boston. `` We are no longer talking about the temp or
independent who fills in for a few days or months and then
leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 8.5 million independent contractors
representing nearly 7 percent of the US work force, according to a
1997 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey. Temporary workers, by
contrast, now represent just over 2 percent of the work force, up
from 0.5 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A separate federal survey by the agency last year showed that 29
percent of 1.3 million temporary agency workers have been at the
same job for one year or longer, up from 25 percent of 1.1 million
temps in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the misclassification of workers has mushroomed
since a 1987 report by the Internal Revenue Service estimated 3.7
million workers were illegally reported to the IRS as independent
contractors. The latest statistics, from a study by the former
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers), include a
projection of at least 5 million by 2005. But with temps and
independent contractors now constituting more than 9 percent of the
work force, even that estimate may be too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Misclassification) is happening in construction, in
high-tech, in education, and in medical services,'' said University
of Massachusetts economist Randy Albelda.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing craze of the 1990s led not only to a rapid
increase in the number of contingent workers, she says, but also in
the rehiring of laid off full-time employees as independents,
making it even harder for the government to document abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 study, Coopers said that misclassification leads to a
loss in federal revenue because of uncollected income taxes, Social
Security, and unemployment payments. The researchers said if
adequate resources were used to insure proper compliance,
reclassification of independent contractors as regular employees
would raise more than $4.9 billion in revenue between 1996 and
2004. If no action is taken, however, the total cost to the US
government over nine years would be $29.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A recent spate of court rulings in favor of long-term
independent contractors and temps has some management attorneys and
consultants scrambling to help corporate clients avoid liability.
</P>
<P>
   While some misclassified workers must pay their own state and
federal taxes and Social Security, high-tech specialists who work
on a contingent basis often rely on temporary agencies to pay
standard health and vacation benefits and make the required
deductions. Many do not receive the stock options, pensions, or
profit-sharing that full-time company employees enjoy, and that
make technology companies especially vulnerable to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   By not clarifying long-term temps' work arrangements, employers
run a risk of being slapped with lawsuits and court fines. ``I've
been advising computer companies that they need to create a
contractor deployment strategy,'' said Linda Pittenger, chief
executive of People3 Inc., a New Jersey information technology
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contractors should come in, do a project, leave or transfer
their knowledge of new technology to permanent people, and then
leave,'' Pittenger said. ``What employers don't realize is that
they get in trouble when they have independents working
side-by-side with permanent employees indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Length of service is not key in deciding whether a tradesperson
should be classified as an independent contractor. For these
workers, the central factor still boils down to who controls the
work _ the employer or the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal worker classification is pervasive in the construction
trades, said Stuart Rossman, head of the Massachusetts attorney
general's Business Labor Protection Bureau. ``Whenever an employer
misclassifies someone as an independent contractor, it results in
employment fraud, insurance fraud, federal withholding or Social
Security fraud, and it can result in the nonpayment of prevailing
wages on public projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Krause, an attorney at the Massachusetts Insurance Fraud
Bureau, says misclassification cases as a whole ``account for $29
million, or 19 percent of all'' fraud fines collected.
</P>
<P>
   David Powell, director of labor relations for the Massachusetts
chapter of Associated General Contractors, said many employers in
the construction trades are worried, too. ``By misclassifying
people as independents, contractors who don't play by the rules
don't pay prevailing wages, insurance or taxes so they can put in
the lowest possible bid for a job,'' he said. ``Legitimate
employers like us are losing millions of dollars as a result, and
it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roldo Cesaroni began working for Jerry Construction last
year, company owner Poulin told him he would not be paid unless he
obtained his own workers' compensation and liability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Cesaroni, a union salter who was hired to work at the Marriott
Residence Inn in Dedham last year, later told state investigators
that Poulin's wife, Joanne, paid him as an independent contractor
and did not deduct taxes, Social Security, or other withholding
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IRS requires 1099 forms be filed for all payments to
vendors exceeding $600, the Poulins insisted Cesaroni give them the
names of other individuals to whom they could make out his
paychecks, according to the search warrant. One check was made out
to Cesaroni's girlfriend; another was made out to his brother,
Steven.
</P>
<P>
   Cesaroni hardly fit the profile of an independent contractor. He
was being paid by the hour and not by the job. He was not working
for several companies at once. And he had not furnished his own
tools. The most important factor, however, was that he had no real
control over his job.
</P>
<P>
   After Cesaroni, Gallagher, and seven others went to the state
attorney general's office, Poulin's offices were raided. A search
warrant alleges that by classifying more than 50 carpenters at
various Massachusetts work sites as independent contractors, Poulin
avoided paying thousands of dollars in workers' compensation and
liability insurance premiums, state and federal taxes, and pension
and Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing the allegations,'' said Poulin's attorney
Volinsky. But he added, ``we are concerned that the search warrant
may have been issued at the insistence of the local carpenter's
union. We feel the attorney general's office should maintain
complete independence from union activities.''

IN HOUSTON, HELP GATHERS FOR OCTUPLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This sprawling city of sudden skyscrapers, of oil and
space exploration, of cowboy boots and sombreros, is as far removed
from the tiny farm town of Carlisle, Iowa, as Oz was from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   But when some or all of the Chukwu octuplets leave their
hospital womb, the response from this city will no doubt be
measured against the extraordinary embrace the McCaughey septuplets
have received from their hometown of Carlisle in the 13 months
since their birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Houston wants to be known as a supportive community, it's
going to take a concerted effort on their part to help this family
with all its needs, and those needs will be great,'' said the Rev.
Robert Brown of the Missionary Baptist Church of Carlisle,
heaquarters of the McCaughey volunteer effort.
</P>
<P>
   While Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, focus on
every breath, every heartbeat of their critically ill babies,
Houston already seems to be giving a Texas-sized welcome to the
littlest celebrities in its midst, showering them with prayers and
promises of goods, money, and time.
</P>
<P>
   And though some observers wondered if criticism from ethicists
about Chukwu's use of fertilty drugs or the race of the babies
might affect the response _ the parents are Nigerian immigrants
with US citizenship _ early signs suggest this is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the community of all persons _ black, white,
everyone _ will lend a part of their hearts to these kids, helping
us look at them beyond biological wonderment to see them as human
beings needing and requiring our support,'' said Chido Nwangwu, a
local newspaper publisher who has organized the USAfrica Children
Support Network on behalf of the octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   The six girls and two boys remained in critical but stable
condition Tuesday, with ``no significant changes'' in their
outlook, said Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas
Children's Hospital. ``In these cases, no news is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the smallest infant, known as Baby E because the
parents have not yet announced names, is 10 ounces and 9 3/4 inches
long _ approximately the size of a Beanie Baby toy _ and can fit in
a woman's hand. Weisman said no infant that small had ever survived
at Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   The seven babies born Sunday were still breathing with the help
of ventilators Tuesday, leaving only Baby A _ a girl born 12 days
before the rest _ breathing on her own. All were being fed
intravenously; Baby E and one other continued to receive
supplemental oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that they all will survive,'' Weisman said, ``but
the reality is that we may not be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, 27, was described Tuesday by officials at adjacent St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital as ``much improved and in very good
spirits.'' She had successful surgery Monday to stop bleeding in
her abdomen caused by efforts to postpone delivery as long as
possible so as to help the babies mature.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu was expected to go home Friday, but the babies probably
will be in the hospital for two to three months, at a cost of
$250,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the family released a statement praising the
hospitals for their care and adding: ``We are very appreciative of
the worldwide support over the past few days, particularly the
prayers and spiritual connection at this special time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   On the family's southwest Houston street _ amid a surburban
development of well-kept, three- and four-bedroom brick homes _
neighbors said Chukwu and Udobi kept to themselves but that would
not prevent them from helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never going to sleep again,'' said Sandi West, who lives
two doors away with her four children. ``I'll do what I can, even
it's just to wash some clothes for her so she can get a little
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another neighbor, Charles Massey: ``Everybody around here
pretty much looks out for each other, so I expect we'll go down and
see what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nwangwu said the USAfrica Children Support Network also was
ready to help. ``In my culture, those kids are all of our kids, and
we expect there to be a flood of material and financial support to
help us raise them,'' said Nwangwu, who said he is friendly with
Udobi and is from the same ethnic group, the Igbo of eastern
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The first caller to the new organization was Vicki Bell of
Houston, who owns a company that helps cancer patients administer
chemotherapy at home. She said she hopes to ``change diapers, hold
bottles, whatever they need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot have children of my own, so the only children I will
ever get close to are other people's children. It seemed like a
neat way to make a difference and feel good at the same time,''
Bell said. She also was inspired by reports about teams of
volunteers helping Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey with their children.
``I thought, `Why should they have all the fun?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Williams, program director of the Black Heritage Society
of Houston, said he and others wondered if there would be a
different response to the Chukwus than the McCaugheys because of
race. The general issue arose last year, when a black woman in
Washington who gave birth to five surviving sextuplets was largely
ignored, compared with the McCaugheys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question has come up, but I see the gifts coming
already,'' Williams said. ``Houston is a giving city. Regardless of
color, people have always been helped, and I don't see where this
should be any different now.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's philanthropy office offered proof of that,
recording promises of lifetime supplies of diapers, wipes, and
training pants, as well as lifetime oil changes and car tires, and
one-year supplies of groceries and baby formula. A local department
store also pledged unspecified gifts, and ``The New Maury Show,''
starring Maury Povich, promised eight cribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect money to start coming in (Thursday),'' said Marianne
Dwyer, assistant director of health care philanthropy at St.
Luke's. ``One sweet little woman said she's sending in $5 because
that's all she can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Local television and radio stations also have become involved,
asking their audiences to drop off donations. Ernie Jackson Jr.,
vice president and general manager of Magic 102, the city's top
black-oriented radio station, said he is organizing an on-air
campaign to help the family.
</P>
<P>
   The model for Houston will no doubt be Carlisle, where in any
given month 70 or more volunteers work shifts helping the
McCaugheys.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the family's pastor in the town of 3,400 people, said he
is part of a team of advisers that has assembled around the
McCaugheys, including a lawyer, an accountant, an agent, and a
financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the octuplets, the key thing is to sit down with the
family and ask how we can help you most. Don't assume that they
will want the help the people want to give them,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope there is as good a response worldwide as we had
here,'' he added. ``We're excited for them, but we also know some
of the roads they are going to travel. Our prayers are certainly
with them.''

A LATIN REEXAMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Supreme Court appeal makes for good theater, but with thin
prospects for victory, the Boston School Committee is better off
with an entirely new admissions process for Boston Latin School.
</P>
<P>
   It can start by weaning itself from the entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   Latin is well on its way to becoming a citadel of segregation
after the one-man demolition derby of Michael McLaughlin. His
lawsuit forced Latin to accept his white daughter Julia, who was
denied admission with exam scores higher than African-American and
Latino students. Latin had to drop its policy that granted 35
percent of seats to African-American and Latino students.
</P>
<P>
   The McLaughlin suit spurred Latin to admit 154 more white and
Asian students with higher exam scores. Latin devised a weaker form
of affirmative action, admitting 50 percent of new students on exam
scores alone and 50 percent on the basis of the racial makeup of
the remainging qualifying applicants. The new policy meant a sharp
drop in African-American and Latino students. Only 20 percent of
seventh graders are African-American or Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan was meant to be a compromise between those who
think test scores equal ``merit'' and those who understand that
``merit'' is much too often a euphemism for white privilege, class
advantage, and hoarding of scarce educational resources. But
McLaughlin thrust a battering ram against even this plan. He sued
on behalf of white Sarah Wessmann, who also had higher test scores
than African-Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   In May, US District Court Chief Joseph Tauro upheld Latin's
50-50 policy, recognizing the need for affirmative action when
studies have shown that racism can depress test scores. The School
Committee estimates that eliminating affirmative action would make
Latin 87 percent white and Asian American. The Boston Public
Schools are 75 percent African-American and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declared the
policy unconstitutional and ordered that Wessmann be immediately
admitted to Latin. A disparaging appeals court said the School
Committee gave ``absolutely no competent evidence'' how past
discrimination fuels the racial gap in test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee meekly responded as if it had no
alternative. It dropped affirmative action and announced that exams
were the only way to get into Latin, Latin Academy, and the John D.
O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted to appeal to the Supreme Court. But equal
opportunity is such a low priority on the high court that none of
its 34 law clerks are African-American. Such a court is far more
likely to side with the appeals court than Tauro.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the Boston School Committee as the trustee of two
systems, one of low resources and menial expectations for black and
brown children and one that rewards white families who prepare for
Latin by abandoning public schools or taking over the spots in the
few public schools that suit them. In 1996, the Globe found that 70
percent of new Latin students came from private schools or only
five of the city's 75 elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee can no longer allow tests to be the primary
determinant of ``merit.'' For all of Latin's hallowed history, it
is being conveniently forgotten that for the first 329 years of its
363-year existence, you did not need an exam to get into it as long
as you had high grades in major subjects and a strong
recommendation from your school. It has only been since the
mid-1970s that a nationally standardized independent school test
began to be used.
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative climate that so equates merit with test scores
that even the Globe substitutes ``merit'' for scores in its prose,
McLaughlin's crusade has made exams even more the executioner's ax,
even as studies show that test scores are not an accurate long-term
predictor of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee and Payzant can, should they choose, create
a system that holds the ax at bay. It can have a rigorous
admissions system where test scores are optional.
</P>
<P>
   Exam school applicants are now ranked on a combination of grades
and tests. A new system could qualify students for an interview via
either a high base-level or pass/fail test score and an essay or a
high grade point and an essay. An interview committee would decide
the final mix of students. The committee can factor whether the
life a child with qualifying grades from the projects in Roxbury or
Southie is worth as much as the life of a child who earned a high
test score in relative comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Or it can enact a system similar to the University of Texas,
which, after the demise of affirmative action there, now admits the
top 10 percent of students from each public and independent high
school in the state to its flagship Austin campus, regardless of
test scores. The plan has already seen a rise in the percentage of
African-American and Latino students.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could take all students who have qualifying test scores
or qualifying grades, or take the top 10 percent of students from
each elementary school and conduct a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that in a time when Michael McLaughlin is
single-handedly destroying affirmative action, the School Committee
and Payzant must offer more than a sheepish bleating before a
Supreme Court slaughter. Otherwise, Latin will be our white
flagship of privilege while African-American and Latino children
are told that their struggle for excellence against the odds of
public education is a struggle always doomed for second place.

IN WHICH CURIOUS GEORGE LEARNS ABOUT `CHARITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Margret Rey, co-creator of the classic children's book
character Curious George, died two years ago this week. She died
childless and left a considerable fortune to charity _ a legacy
that has been the subject of curious monkeyshines by some of
Boston's best-known ``charitable'' institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential Cantabrigian, Rey left a multimillion-dollar
estate to be divided up among public television's WGBH, the Harvard
student social service agency Phillips Brooks House Association,
the Sierra Club, the World Wildlife Fund, and 12 other worthy
causes. Her will built upon an already sizable philanthropic
commitment. Before her death, she had established the charitable
Curious George Foundation and also donated $1 million each to the
Boston Public Library and Beth Israel Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rey died, lawyers for beneficiaries WGBH, Brooks House
Association, and WBUR have been warring with Rey's executors over
what portion of the estate is rightfully theirs. Five mainline
Boston law firms have thrown bodies into the fray, and litigation
costs are threatening to devour Rey's estate. ``What's 'GBH
underwriting here _ `Bleak House'?'' asks investment adviser John
Spooner, a co-trustee of Rey's foundation. ``Maybe they've shown
too much Dickens over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The man being fitted for the Scrooge suit, 'GBH president Henry
Becton, says he has a fiduciary duty to recover the full donation
he believes the station is entitled to. Like everyone else in this
imbroglio, he claims to be doing what Rey would have wanted him to
do: ``Future donors have to have confidence that we are going to
honor their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Rey's deathbed recommitment to her Jewish roots. The
granddaughter of a Hamburg rabbi and the daughter of parents who
fled Nazi Germany, Rey acknowledged her ethnicity though she was
not religiously observant. But as she lay dying, her co-executor
and friend Lay Lee Ong says, Rey added several gifts to her will.
These included sums for VNACare Choices, the hospice organization
that cared for her; the two hospitals where she received treatment;
and a much larger, $1.8 million-dollar donation to the Combined
Jewish Philanthropies of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. Rey died before she could amend her will.
(Her husband and collaborator, Hans, had predeceased her.) Six
million dollars of her estate was to be divided among 'GBH (20
percent), the Brooks House Association (20 percent), and the 14
other charities. Because Rey never put her belated bequest in
writing, Ong decided to sign away rights to a separate $3 million
securities account jointly held by her and Rey, and assigned that
money to the new beneficiaries. But 'GBH got wind of the deal and
sicced their lawyer on Ong, blocking the added gifts. 'GBH asserts
that the $3 million joint account was part of Rey's estate and that
the station deserves 20 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   How ugly is this? Pretty ugly. Here are two echt-WASP outfits,
'GBH (founded with Lowell money) and the Phillips Brooks House
Association (Harvard money), working with white-shoe law firm Ropes
&AMP; Gray to snatch money from the Combined Jewish Philanthropies.
Becton shrugs off the possible negative public relations
consequences for 'GBH: ``You can't do the right thing by worrying
about what's written in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to redirect her $3 million bequest to charity, Ong
needed the assent of Rey's 16 beneficiaries. But 'GBH's lawyer
fired off a dissenting letter to the same groups, trying to torpedo
Ong's proposal. Signed by attorney Carolyn Osteen of Ropes &AMP; Gray,
it was taken by the Rey camp as a declaration of war. ``Without
more detailed evidence of Margaret (sic) Rey's intent that the
joint account assets be distributed to `Jewish charities' selected
by Lay Lee Ong and John Spooner, I am troubled by your proposal to
disregard the clear statement of intent set forth in the (will),''
Osteen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to strike a compromise, Ong offered to distribute
15 percent of the $3 million to the 16 original beneficiaries, plus
the $800,000 appreciation in the account. No go, said 'GBH. Rather
than share 15 percent of the money earmarked for the added
beneficiaries, 'GBH wants its full 20 percent of the $3 million _
or thinks that a court will give it a better settlement than the
one Ong is offering. ``They're saying, `We'll see you in court,' ''
Ong says. ``We'd like to see them exhibit some kind of good will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want this to be a battle,'' Becton insists. He says
other beneficiaries, including the American Civil Liberties Union,
WBUR, and Brooks House Association, support 'GBH's stance on the
will. Boston University general counsel Todd Klipp contributed a
belligerent letter on WBUR's behalf, but did not return my phone
call seeking comment. (Privately, the 'BUR brass just wants this
flap to go away.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Brooks House Association, executive director Paul
McDonald now regrets that its lawyer, Samuel Sichko, questioned
Ong's integrity at a meeting concerning the will. ``It's clear that
Lay Lee has a strong moral case,'' he says. ``We're not on
anybody's side at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, several beneficiaries, including the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Boston, the humanitarian Petra Foundation, and
Somerville's Family Center will probably oppose 'GBH in the Rey
dispute. Ultimately, the opponents square off on whether to believe
Ong's account of Rey's deathbed wishes. ``I don't know whether I
believe them,'' Becton says. Family Center chairman Anne Peretz
does believe Ong. ``That sounds like Margret,'' she says. ``I feel
comfortable going along with what Lay Lee is suggesting. I think
she is corrrectly stating Margret's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Peretz, who also sits on the Brooks House Association board, has
already taken steps to tamp down the rhetoric and negotiate a
settlement. Becton has appointed a trustees' committee to examine
the dispute for 'GBH: ``We'd be willing to consider mediation,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Rey is not alive to sort out the tangled juridical knot
woven by her mischievous, fictional lunch ticket, Curious George.
Second-guessing the intentions of the intelligent, spiky writer,
who once blurted out, in a moment of weakness, ``I hate
children!,'' may become the work of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Ong, who lived with Rey for the last seven years of her
life, has no doubt what her friend would say to those who are
opposing her deathbed philanthropy: ``If Margret were here, she'd
tell them all to go to hell.''

NEW OAKLAND MAYOR FACES A HUGE URBAN CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Standing in line last week at Peet's coffee
shop in Oakland, I overheard the following conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Woman in her 30s: ``I'd like to shop in Oakland, but I've had to
go to San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Man in his 30s: ``We've been going to Walnut Creek, which is so
un-Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   This being the December holiday gift-buying season, the lament
of these two Oaklanders highlights a deficiency that faces Jerry
Brown when he becomes Oakland's mayor on Jan. 4: a lack of
retailing choices in the East Bay's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The relative dearth of retailers isn't a life-and-death
situation. Yet it is one problem that Brown could attempt to solve
that would go a long way toward making his imminent ascent to power
in urban America memorable, at least for Oaklanders starved for
retailing choices.
</P>
<P>
   Any improvement in Oakland's retailing prospects that Brown can
effect would be a plus for him, despite fast-changing consumer
trends. Buying goods over the Internet is the coming wave, and
catalog shopping is already popular. Nonetheless, as the coffee
line conversation indicated, Oakland residents now go to San
Francisco, Alameda, Emeryville, Walnut Creek and San Leandro to
shop for goods that could very well be sold in Oakland, but aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland once had a lot of stores which sold clothes, appliances,
furniture, shoes and other consumer goods. Along the once-glorious
Broadway between 14th and 20th streets, only one major retailer
remains _ a Sears.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease in shopping options in Oakland is a symptom of a
larger problem _ the flight of the white middle class to the
burgeoning East Bay suburbs and the loss of good-paying industrial
jobs. Oakland still has middle-class people who live in some lovely
neighborhoods, but the city has a larger proportion of poor people
than other cities in Alameda County. Retailers don't like to locate
near a lot of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the former California governor with a flaky reputation,
inherits a city with more problems than just a retailing shortage.
A weak economic base, for one. A troubled school system, for
another. A nagging crime situation, to cite a third.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has said his highest priority is to reduce crime. That
makes him sound like any other politician, not one known for his
far-out, sustainable-environment views.
</P>
<P>
   Even as its downtown continues to struggle, Oakland is showing
signs of surprising health elsewhere. Jack London Square is
booming, with new restaurants, a famous jazz club, a multiscreen
movie theater, and a Barnes and Noble bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the desultory Broadway corridor is the Old Oakland
neighborhood, which for years stood dormant. It is now coming to
life with new housing being built and a popular Vietnamese
restaurant drawing enthusiastic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Other Oakland neighborhoods like Piedmont Avenue, Rockridge,
Lake Shore and Grand Lake, Chinatown, Temescal and Dimond-Laurel
are in pretty good shape with good housing values and small-ticket
shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for Brown remain high. For all of his fame,
however, he has never been known to be attentive to economic
nuts-and-bolts issues like creating good jobs and enticing the
middle class to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   He can talk environmental sustainability all he wants, but
Oaklanders want a broader economic base so they won't have to leave
town to buy Christmas gifts _ or leave town altogether to find a
good school system.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown is going to find out soon that winning an election
is a lot easier than governing a city with a weak economy and a
huge inferiority complex.

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ Santa had just started his midday break at
the Burlington Mall, where two shopper-clogged corridors stood
between his throne and the tranquility of a back office.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that Santa of Burlington gets just two breaks
during a 13-hour work day here. Biology would suggest the guy might
make a dash of it. But not this Kris Kringle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, wassup?'' he offered as greeting to two teenagers coming
out of a CD store. He chatted with them about the latest Tupac
release. Then he went down on his haunches to meet and hug a pair
of disabled visitors in their wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a man on a break from a myth. This was a veteran
politician working the crowd as only someone who truly believes in
himself can do. Santa is doing the same thing at other large malls,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Santa nowadays is living his myth as never
before, according to members of his most critical audience, the
beard-pulling children, not to mention parents and mall marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to notice a change a few years ago,'' said Sheila
Hennessy, a spokeswoman for the Burlington Mall. ``Santa came to us
with a real beard, a real gut, and, most importantly, a real
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The pillow-packed Santa stand-ins with polyester whiskers and a
ho-ho hum attitude would appear to be a dwindling lot. While the
Santas at several malls declined to discuss their salary, some can
earn upwards of $2,000 weekly for the seasonal gig.
</P>
<P>
   It may be proof that sometimes nice guys finish first.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the Santa at the Natick (Mass.) Mall. He
asked that another name he uses not be published.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be right. Santa is the name I identify with
most,'' he explained between visits. For the four years he's been
at Natick, his wife has worked by his side, making children smile
for the camera. Her name? Mrs. Claus, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When the Natick Santa is off duty, he said he lives in Wilbraham
as a retired scout camp manager.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer he volunteers at a state park in the
Berkshires where he cuts grass and where his off-season wardrobe
includes a green elf's hat and red suspenders. The neighborhood
kids are convinced his primary mission is reconnaissance,
monitoring behavior prior to deciding who gets what.
</P>
<P>
   This Santa's repartee with the children on his knee typically
went like this:
</P>
<P>
   Santa: What did you bring me?
</P>
<P>
   Child: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Santa: Oh yes you did! You carry it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Child: Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Santa: You've got love! You've got a hug for me!
</P>
<P>
   (Big hug.)
</P>
<P>
   Santa: See, I told you so.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 seconds have passed and a new child climbs upon his
knee. He is one of the 11,000 children visiting Santas this season
at each of the country's 1,800 enclosed malls, according to
industry estimates. What is missing from the Natick exchange _ and
exchanges in a growing number of malls, according to Santa _ is
forced laughter or any protracted discussion about what toys are
wanted for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a paradox shadowing the new, improved, ``real''
Santa. Increasingly, he's talking love, not greed, in the heart of
American malls where, figuratively speaking, management might be
content to have patrons shop 'til they drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's just fine,'' said Sally Hertz, a spokeswoman for
the South Shore Plaza in Braintree. ``Santa _ the real Santa _ is
what we want at the center of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braintree Santa also goes by the name of Dan Headstream, a
retired teacher from Conyers, Georgia. He has a southern accent,
but explains it to Massachusetts children this way: ``I spend time
at the South Pole, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Santa/Headstream work with children is to watch a
grandparent dawdle over his namesakes. This is his second year at
the Plaza, where management provides him with an off site
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He contends children can spot a fake Santa faster than a camera
can flash. ``That's why a lot of them cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Laura Doerfer, 5, and her brother Byron, 6, clambered
upon Santa's knees to discuss the type of cookies he liked best.
The Doerfers live in Needham, where, at least in one home, Santa's
cookies will be sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Priscilla, watched from a distance, her eyes fixed
on the exchange and the ease with which her children and Santa
talked recipes.
</P>
<P>
   And in the gaze was just a hint of mystery, or maybe it was
hope, that this bearded man in red was the real thing.

DENOMINATION DRAWING A NEW KIND OF CATHOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new Catholic parish begun in Peabody, Mass. last year with
just a handful of people now regularly draws 50 worshipers to
Sunday Mass. Nothing unusual about that.
</P>
<P>
   Except that St. Francis of Assisi is not the the kind of
Catholic church that would immediately come to mind. It is
Catholic, but not Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis is the first parish in Massachusetts belonging to
the Catholic Apostolic Church in North America, a denomination
whose existence can be directly attributed to Christianity's
complex and, often, tumultuous history.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, as the Roman Catholic Church grew around the
bishop of Rome into an institution that now rules one billion Roman
Catholics worldwide, not everyone wanted to be governed by the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Most history students know about the schism with Orthodox
Christians in the 11th century or the Protestant Reformation in the
16th century, which gave birth to new Christian religions.
</P>
<P>
   Much less known, principally because they are relatively small,
are several independent and self-governing Catholic churches that
bear many similarities to the Roman Catholic Church, including
celebrating the same sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these denominations have broken away or refused to be
part of the Roman Catholic Church for theological or administrative
reasons. They all claim to be as genuinely Catholic as the church
headed by the pope, although the Vatican does not recognize most of
these denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been around for hundreds of years, while others, like
the Catholic Apostolic Church in North America, are newcomers to
the Catholic world.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Apostolic Church distinguishes itself from the
Roman Catholic Church because it does not believe the pope has the
authority to teach infallibly, allows priests to marry, and is less
strict in its views on gays and people who are divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching out with the vision of what would Christ do,''
said Bishop Willard Schultz of New York, the denomination's
presiding bishop. ``We don't turn people away. We try to find in
each other Christlike images and examples rather than being
judgmental. We seek to teach and learn from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1949 in New Mexico, the Catholic Apostolic Church
claims 30,000 to 35,000 members in the United States, including
several former Roman Catholic priests. But in the last three years,
Schultz said, the church's membership has grown by several
thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination, Schultz said, is benefiting from two trends in
American society: the desire by many Americans to find deeper
spiritual meaning in their lives and the disenchantment some Roman
Catholics feel toward a church they believe is too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis, which was started in July 1997, was born out of
controversy involving Roman Catholic parishioners angered by the
Archdiocese of Boston's decision to close their church, St.
Joseph's in Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Gerry Clements, a priest ordained in the Catholic
Apostolic Church, saw parishioners protesting in front of St.
Joseph's _ one of several churches shuttered by the archdiocese in
recent years _ he offered to help.
</P>
<P>
   The parishioners asked Clements to say Mass, a move that
archdiocesan officials tried unsuccessfully to stop. A short time
later Clements and some former members of St. Joseph's started St.
Francis, which meets at a Lutheran church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very close family because many of the people here
came to this church as a group from St. Joe's,'' said Clements, who
is now one of three priests from the Catholic Apostolic Church
serving in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Another of them, the Rev. Joseph Reynolds, a former Roman
Catholic priest, recently launched St. Jude's, a new parish in
Methuen.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said he has long had a desire to be a priest but the
Roman Catholic Church was never a possibility because he is
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much searching, the Catholic Apostolic Church became the
one I felt most comfortable in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Stewart, a professor of nursing at Simmons College and a
baptized Roman Catholic, recently became an ordained permanent
deacon at St. Francis. In the Roman Catholic Church women are not
allowed to be ordained deacons. Women are still excluded from the
priesthood, however, in the Catholic Apostolic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to be part of such an inclusive church, one
that elevates the role of all members, including women,'' said
Stewart, who helps provide nursing care to homeless people in
Boston. ``This is the Catholic church I feel is right for me.''

ENVIOUS STARR; A DISNEY CENSOR; THE FUN OF WRITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all read that bawdy bestseller known as The Starr Report
(``Unimpeachably spellbinding! I couldn't put it down!'' _ W. J.
Clinton), and we've all wondered at times about the character and
motivations of its ``author,'' Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's Time magazine, in his most extensive interview
this year, the independent counsel lets slip a few tantalizing and
telling remarks about the president he spent so long pursuing, and
whose downfall he may yet achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Eric Pooley and Michael Weisskopf observe that when
Starr talks about President Clinton, ``a hint of envy creeps into
his voice,'' and that certainly comes across when Starr says of
Clinton: ``It must be nice to have that kind of I.Q. Doing well
academically . . . but not having to spend all that terribly much
time doing it.'' Starr recounts details of a chance encounter with
President Clinton in a crowded elevator two decades ago, when
Clinton was a boy-wonder governor and Starr was a young lawyer with
his nose to the grindstone. ``I just remember him as being very
attractive,'' says Starr. ``There was a buzz about him in the
elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fascination of the battle between Clinton and Starr
_ who share the cover as Time's Men of the Year _ is that two such
polar opposites would end up locked in mortal combat with a
president's fate hanging in the balance. One irony begets another:
Pooley and Weisskopf write that ``Starr believes his reputation
died for Clinton's sins'' _ and of course, Clinton feels the same
way about Starr.

   When the Walt Disney Co. bought ABC in 1995, executives on both
sides vowed that the editorial independence of the network's news
division would not be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge began to ring hollow to many in October when ABC
News president David Westin killed a story that was highly critical
of ABC's corporate parent. The story by investigative reporter
Brian Ross found that convicted pedophiles were working at Disney
World and blamed Disney's failure to conduct background checks on
new hires.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Brill's Content nails Westin and ABC News for the
decision to spike the Ross report, which was, according to writer
Elizabeth Lesly Stevens, ``a well-sourced story, one that . . . met
the standards of fairness and reportorial backup commonly found in
investigative television pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   But it apparently didn't meet Westin's standards. Stevens
reports that when Westin got a look at the show's script in
October, he repeatedly demanded of Ross, ``Are you crazy?'', before
killing the story.
</P>
<P>
   Dishearteningly enough, Stevens concludes that the most likely
scenario is not that Disney ordered the story yanked, but that
Westin _ a former corporate attorney who is trying to move out of
the shadow of his formidable predecessor, Roone Arledge _ ``moved
proactively to avoid grief from his bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mess validates the viewing public's worst fears
about conglomerate ownership of major news outlets,'' Stevens
writes. ``In this case, an otherwise powerful, prestigious news
operation has shown itself incapable of covering _ or unwilling to
cover _ a major cultural and economic force in American life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There will always be an England, of course, but its national
heroes come under some eye-opening scrutiny this month in the
British magazine Realm.
</P>
<P>
   Take King Arthur, among the most enduring of English national
legends. Author Michael Jenner points out that whichever
sixth-century nobleman the Arthur story is based on, he and his
knights fought to defend not an English realm but a Celtic one.
Moreover, Jenner notes that Arthur's sworn enemies were ``the very
Angles and Saxons who eventually prevailed and went on to give
England both her name and identity.'' (It's as if we Americans were
suddenly told that George Washington was actually a Tory.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Arthur wasn't technically an Englishman, but surely St.
George, England's patron saint, was? Nope. It turns out that St.
George was a Palestinian soldier who ``never actually set foot in
England.'' Jenner even questions whether the robber-archer upon
whom the Robin Hood myth is based actually stole from the rich and
gave to the poor: The 18th-century book on which the legend is
based is now considered suspect by scholars, having been proven to
have been ``strongly influenced by the ideology of the French
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Delbanco delivers a wonderfully word-drunk valentine to
the writing craft in the January Harper's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Delbanco structures his piece around the duke of Gloucester's
famously fatuous put-down of Edward Gibbon upon the completion of
Gibbon's ``The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire'': ``Another damned, thick, square book! Always scribble,
scribble, scribble! Eh! Mr. Gibbon?''
</P>
<P>
   Delbanco's answer to the ``Why write?'' question implied by the
dismissive duke takes many forms, but the one I liked best is this:
Writing is simply fun. ``If there weren't pure pleasure in the way
words edge up against one another, in the way paragraphs fit . . .
then we'd all have to be a higher- and bloodier-minded bunch,''
writes Delbanco. ``Because the average wage is maybe a penny a
page, or a dime each twenty hours, and the average reward is
anonymity.''

 BOSTON: ... have shrunk.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Immigrants at the top of educational attainment are as
educated or more educated than comparable Americans,'' says Miriam
Wasserman, author of a recent article on immigration for the
Regional Review magazine of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The India contingent is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   So many Indian and Pakistani entrepreneurs have converged on the
Boston area that they established an East Coast chapter of The
Indus Entrepreneurs, or TIE, a network started in Silicon Valley
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Open Market Inc.'s co-founder, Shikhar Ghosh, the son of a
businessman in India, came to Boston in 1978 to attend Harvard
Business School. He believes that Boston's Indian population is
markedly different from New York's, where ``the news stands and
cabs are run by people from south Asia.'' In Boston, ``you go to a
high-tech convention and you'll run into more Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright students denied admission to the prestigious Indian
Institute of Technology in Bombay _ students like Eswar
Priyadarshan _ are easily admitted to US colleges, say Indian
expatriates. India's best high schools provide excellent
preparation for high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the hot shot there. When I came here I was on fire,''
says Priyadarshan, the son of a Cambridge-educated English
professor. The younger Priyadarshan came to Boston in 1982 from
Bangalore, India, to attend Boston University. ``Once I started to
get those 4.0s I was on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer
science, he joined Open Market as an engineering director.
</P>
<P>
   While reasons for immigrating differ by country, goals converge
at Sitara Networks, which calls itself the ``International House of
Software.'' More than one-third of employees at the Waltham
Internet company, headed by a Pakistani, hail from some 15
countries _ from China and Cuba to Indonesia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to come in if you have any amount of
education,'' says Boris Boruchovich, Sitara's director of software
engineering who emigrated in 1979 from St. Petersburg, Russia.
``You take a number of classes, learn some basic things in computer
engineering, and find a job. Most people I know who immigrate _
this is the route they take.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has one of the biggest Russian immigrant populations in
the country. Communities such as Brookline have large populations
of Russians Jews, who first came to the city in droves around 1890.
</P>
<P>
   When Fima Furman's father brought him and two siblings to Boston
in 1991, soon after their mother had died of cancer, the family
relied on two other Russian families for support. One for financial
help; one for a place to stay while his father searched for work as
a software engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The Furmans, who are half Jewish but are Russian Orthodox in
practice, fled Moscow amid rising anti-Semitism and the frightening
prospect of military service, which might require they ``go to
Chechnya and kill your own people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The family chose Boston ``because we have already friends here,
connections here,'' he says. A second reason: ``Boston is an
economically growing city with lots of high-tech and biotech and
software companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Furman, 24, completed his high school education at Newton South,
earned a bachelor's degree from Brandeis University and now works
in a lab at Hybridon, a biomedical company. And his education
continues. He is taking an intensive course in C++ computer
language and hopes to combine it with his biology expertise.
</P>
<P>
   After years in this country, Nguyen has acquired the
accoutrements of a suburban family man, including a soft briefcase
with his employer's logo and a Nautica windbreaker. He lives in
Everett with his wife, whom he met on the boat from Vietnam, and
two children. He won the gold medal for Ping Pong in Massachusetts
and set up classes in Chelsea to teach English to Vietnamese
children. He still carries the well-worn letter from the Bureau of
Immigration &AMP; Deportation in Manila, dated Oct. 16, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nguyen never wanted to leave Vietnam, he says he is
happy to be employed in a field in which anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vietnam, I cry sometimes at night. You love something but
you can't do anything,'' he says. In this country, ``I am like a
fish in the ocean _ I can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TRADITION OF IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS &QL; 
 &QL; 
With its many universities, the Boston area has long been a magnet
for foreign-born people. In recent years, the attraction has
intensified along with the boom in the state's technology
industries. Here is a sampler of foreign-born businesspeople who
started local technology companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a problem that has countless women grumbling in store
dressing rooms across America and catalog retailers like Eddie
Bauer, L. L. Bean and Lands' End complaining bitterly about
millions of dollars in merchandise returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic world of women's clothing sizes, the numbers that
shoppers see on garment tags, from tiny 2 all the way to 20, have
become all but meaningless. Women waste hours trying on clothes
that droop or squeeze, and catalog vendors end up with costly
returns from similarly frustrated mail-order customers.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog companies say the answer to decades of frustration
over finding the right fit is simple: Create sizing standards
across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that is anathema to upscale clothiers such as Donna Karan
and Ellen Tracy, which use ``vanity sizing'' to make shoppers think
they are spending their big bucks on fashionably small-sized
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   High-end designers have learned that it is profitable to flatter
women by offering tiny sizes on big garments. The result is that a
woman could fit into a size 6 from one manufacturer but have to
jump all the way to a 12 from another.
</P>
<P>
   The push to eliminate the decades-old guessing game in women's
apparel is being spurred largely by the fast-growing mail-order and
Internet apparel businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog retailers know that accurate sizing is critical since
women can't try on their merchandise. More and more catalogs devote
pages? catolog pages are devoted to explaining sizes and
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Some department stores, such as Target, also are pushing for
consistency to help their customers, and are urging vendors to
comply with a current? (or is comply wrong verb?) set of standards
in sizing.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since 1942, a major three-year was it a
3-yr study in 42? study is underway to measure the size and shape
of American woman.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative pleases many in the industry who say too many
women are suffering from fitting-room fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the market transitions to a more relevant set of standards,
it will make more obvious those who are not in synch,'' says
Michael Alexin, vice president of design and product development
for Seattle-based Eddie Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-end designers are not eager for any of this. They
have made money on vanity sizing, and that has led to today's
haphazard size labeling. (The exception to the high-end rule that
smaller is better is, no surprise, in bra sizing. For more
expensive bras, size labels tend to run big.)
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Goldsberry, associate professor of retailing at the
University of Arizona in Phoenix, says pricey designers have
learned all too well that many women love to exclaim, ``I have a
wonderful dress! And it's a size 2!'' And that they will cough up
extra dollars to say that.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Hunton, vice president of Wolf Form Co. in Englewood, N.J.,
which makes garment-fitting forms for companies such as Donna Karan
and Ellen Tracy, says high-end designers will never go along
willingly with a uniform sizing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still want to do their own thing. . . . It makes the
woman customer feel better,'' Hunton says.
</P>
<P>
   He says Ellen Tracy sells size 8 clothes with measurements that
other apparel makers sell as a size 12.
</P>
<P>
   While some shoppers may feel flattered and pay for the
privilege, the sizing game infuriates others, who would like to see
women's clothes come with meaningful, consistent measurements _ in
inches _ as men's clothing does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see measurements on clothes,'' says Meredith
Pooler, 18, after using holiday gift money to buy herself
custom-fit jeans at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``You never know
with different makers what your size is or what a size small,
medium or large means.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people in the industry don't think manufacturers will
start displaying actual measurements on garment tags, as is done
for women's clothing in many parts of Europe, any time soon. They
say American women don't want to see their hip measurement on a
tag. And some clothes makers say the standard trio of measurements
(bust, waist, and hips), plus height, are often overly simplistic
predictors of fit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they are eager for standards, almost everyone in
the industry agrees that there's a need for updated information on
the size of the American woman as we approach the millennium. This
information will help all clothing manufacturers develop
better-proportioned and better-fitting clothes, regardless of how
sizes are labeled.
</P>
<P>
   The only sizing chart based on actual measurements of American
women dates to 1942, when more than 10,000 military women were
measured at different body points. The US Department of Commerce
used this data to assign size numbers from 2 to 20 to correspond to
different sets of measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, this data is hopelessly outdated. The average
woman then was 5 feet 2 inches and weighed 129 pounds. Today, the
average woman is about 5 feet 4 inches and weighs about 142 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While makers of mass-produced clothes may have followed these
guidelines in the 1940s, companies later began to realize that the
shape and size of the typical American woman were growing. Each
company tinkered with its numbers in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five decades, women's sizing became increasingly
haphazard. Finally, in 1994, the American Society for Testing and
Materials, which sets sizing standards in the industry, came out
with new guidelines. It was based on then-current practices in the
industry, but no new measurements.
</P>
<P>
   According to this chart, which is followed more or less by
catalog vendors and some product lines today, a size 10 woman would
measure 36 inches at the bust, 28 inches at the waist and 38 1/2 at
the hips. In 1942, a 10 measured 33 1/2, 24 1/2, and 35 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But many apparel makers aren't happy with the chart, and even
the society acknowledges it should have updated the measurements of
women. But an attempt several years ago to drum up funding for a
new measurement study failed, largely because many manufacturers
didn't want to help.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged in its place is a three-year study, sponsored and
funded by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the US Air Force and
some apparel manufacturers. For different reasons, they all want
updated figures on the size of the typical male and female aged 18
to 65. The Air Force wants to make better flight suits, the auto
makers want better-fitting seats, and clothes makers want
better-fitting garments.
</P>
<P>
   The study began last December and will measure more than 10,000
people in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a database, businesses can begin to cater to a
particular clientele,'' says Jo Ann Pullen, who heads the textiles
committee for the Testing and Materials Society and is also a high
school instructor of consumer and health issues in Northfield.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an alternative to standardization: mass
customization. Some companies envision customers outfitting
dressing rooms with high-tech body scanners that record multiple
body measurements. Garments would then be custom-designed for a
particular body type.
</P>
<P>
   David Bruner, manager of research and development for TC
Squared, a company in Cary, N.C., says the beauty of body scanning
is that women won't ever have to know any numbers. The information
can be put in a file, and used to make their clothes. ``There's no
stigma attached to a size,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner acknowledges that a big obstacle to this effort is the
cost. Body scanners sold by his company cost about $100,000 each,
and so far, he says, he has sold exactly two.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is experimenting with a program called ``Original
Spin'' that allows Meredith Pooler and other customers to obtain
jeans for $55 that are custom-fitted to their measurements, though
for now that information is obtained with old-fashioned measuring
tapes. The system also allows customers to choose options for
color, fly and leg opening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the wave of the future turns out to be standardization
or mass customization, ``the status quo is very difficult for
women,'' says Susan Ashdown, associate professor in the textile
department at Cornell University. ``The industry is finally waking
up. The whole level of frustration with clothes shopping has
increased.''
</P>
<P>

HOW WOMEN GROW BUT STAY THE SAME SIZE &QL;

In 1942 manufacturers relied on a US Department of Commerce chart
to put sizes on their clothes. Since then, companies have departed
from the chart and each has gone its own way. The only updated
sizing chart in 1994, from the American Society for Testing and
Materials. It attempted to summarize the typical sizing practices

TOUGH TOPICS TACKLED ON NEW YORK STAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When plays with difficult subject matter fail,
critics and producers often blame a lazy and feckless audience more
interested in theater as diversion. That's the argument trotted out
for the failure of the critically favored musical about Siamese
twins, ``Side Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people will leave home to see tough issues explored onstage.
Look at the success of ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' and ``Wit,''
both on and off Broadway. Two new plays, one about lesbian love and
gay-bashing, the other about civil war and matricide, are playing
to packed houses while the producers of another wait nervously to
see if a musical about the lynching of a Jewish man in Atlanta will
be a success.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Parade''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly nothing new for musicals to deal with grim
subject matter. ``West Side Story'' and Stephen Sondheim raised the
bar, and until ``The Lion King,'' you couldn't get a musical to be
taken seriously unless it dealt with mass death (``Titanic''),
prostitution (``The Life''), or a serial killer (``Jekyll &AMP;
Hyde'').
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, these were about other things as well, with large
helpings of heroism, romance, and redemption. There is so little of
any of those virtues in the story about the hanging of Leo Frank
that it's easy to see why ``Parade'' makes its producers nervous,
particularly since one of them, Livent, recently filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   There is much that is right with ``Parade,'' which opened last
week at Lincoln Center, including the unique collaboration between
the center and Livent. Jason Robert Brown finds a middle ground
between Sondheim and more melodic predecessors. Carolee Carmello as
Mrs. Frank has a gorgeous voice and does as much justice to ``You
Don't Know This Man'' as ``Ragtime'' diva Audra McDonald does on
her CD. The staging, under Harold Prince's direction and with
Riccardo Hernandez's sets, keeps things flowing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first act is quite striking, from the prologue of a
rebel soldier singing about ``The Old Red Hills of Home,'' which
sets the stage for the conflict between Southern tradition and
Yankee interloping. (Frank came from New York to run the National
Pencil Factory in Atlanta.) Britt Craig, playing a drunken reporter
lamenting the lack of ``Big News'' on his beat, turns in a
terrific, brassy solo.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum is largely spent, though, by the time the stage is
set for the murder of Mary Phagan, a factory employee, and Frank's
trial. If you know the story, there aren't any surprises. Worse,
there aren't any surprises in the music, which stops driving the
story forward in the second act.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is an overly mousy performance by Brent
Carver. Part of the point, of course, is that Frank didn't fit in
with the good ole boys, but Prince goes too far in stereotyping
both sides. Alfred (``Driving Miss Daisy'') Uhry, who wrote the
book, wanted to show how torn he was between his Jewish pride and
Southern pride, but you wouldn't know he was particularly proud of
either from ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Stop Kiss'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Diana Son's ``Stop Kiss,'' Sara has her identity splits as
well _ she's a completely assimilated young Asian-American on the
one hand and a straight woman increasingly attracted to Callie,
another straight woman. Their first kiss results in a ferocious
gay-bashing that leaves her fighting for her life.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention that this is a comedy? Not a funny ha-ha comedy
perhaps, but it is funny. Son alternates scenes between the
couple's developing relationship and the aftermath of the beating.
As in ``Parade,'' the best part is the first scene, in which we
meet Callie, played to hiply spaced-out perfection by Jessica
Hecht. Sara, played by Sandra Oh, has just arrived in New York and
comes to Callie's apartment to deposit her cat and the two begin an
awkward push-pull dance with each other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sara: I hate jazz. I don't like the sound of saxophones.
</P>
<P>
   Callie: My sister plays the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   Sara: Oh, I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Callie: I hate my sister.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not Oscar Wilde, but Hecht in particular has such charisma and
timing that we feel we're watching more than a sitcom. (Hecht was a
regular on ``The Single Guy'' and plays a recurring part on
``Friends.'' Oh won a Cable Ace for ``Arliss.'') But despite the
excellent acting and fine writing and staging, how much more than a
sitcom are we getting?
</P>
<P>
   The Public Theater audience, one would assume, is already on the
side of the two women just as the Lincoln Center audience is
already on Frank's side. It's also dubious how well this would play
outside of New York with all its Village references.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Stop Kiss'' is more than the sum of its
parts. It isn't a ``lesbian comedy''; it's a comedy . . . with
lesbians. Its rewards are in the simple chemistry of two people
making their way in a confusing world. As the relationship
develops, that chemistry is reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Electra'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making difficult subject matter easy is not always, perhaps
ever, the most satisfying for audiences. Note the near-ecstatic
reaction to Zoe Wanamaker and the very tough adaptation of
``Electra.'' Like ``The Blue Room'' and the new adaptation of
``Cabaret,'' this is an import from England of a Donmar Warehouse
production, although Wanamaker is supported here largely with
American Equity actors.
</P>
<P>
   If sex is a degraded commodity in those two productions, life
itself is in a ``Mad Max''-like shambles in ancient Greece.
Wanamaker's Electra even looks like a postnuclear survivor with
bloody scabs all over her head. Her clothing is off the Salvation
Army rack, including an oversize overcoat. It belonged to her
father _ Agamemnon _ the victim of her mother's murderous rage.
Clytemnestra (Claire Bloom) conspired to do away with him after he
sacrificed another daughter, Iphigenia.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McGuiness's adaptation is similar to Paul Schmidt's
``Phaedra'' adaptation at the American Repertory Theatre. Elements
of modern idiomatic language underline the contemporaneousness of
the issues. Once violence becomes the option, all sides in a civil
war feel equally justified. Electra, her brother Orestes, and
Clytemnestra are equally right from their perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Wanamaker and Bloom are so powerful in their agony, however,
that anything but revenge seems an unsatisfactory option. Director
David Leveaux's program notes suggest a more pacifist conclusion
and we may agree with him, but Sophocles's tragedy lies in the
inevitability of the characters' obsessions. Electra becomes
Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kidman bares her body onstage in New York, but Zoe
Wanamaker bares her soul.
</P>
<P>
   (``Stop Kiss'' runs through Jan. 31 at the Public Theater and
``Electra'' through March 28 at the Barrymore Theatre. Tickets for
``Parade'' at Lincoln Center are on sale through the end of March,
but it might be extended.)

TRIMARCO'S TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Trimarco is heading for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   He's 59, a lawyer, who'll serve on a couple of boards. The four
kids are educated. He heads for the the country house in New
Hampshire when his wife, a Superior Court judge, can get away. Half
his career has been in government service, which is not bad for a
Massachusetts Republican. For eight years he has been first deputy
treasurer under Joe Malone, the political consigliere in an office
that has been run, by virtually all accounts, in a model fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Trimarco is a big boy, and understands how the game works.
But he's at the stage where he really doubts whether the public or
the press really give a rat's fanny about whether government works
honestly or just groans along out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going out as a whiner. It was fun. We did it our way.
We didn't buckle. We go out with a helluva record. We cut the
treasurer's budget in half. We cut the staff from 280 people to
135. At the state pension funds, we took them from the worst
performing funds in the country to one of the best. We brought in
professional managers, we used no political investors. You can
still make mistakes, but when you make political investments,
instead of purely professional investment decisions, you make more
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Trimarco ``played Mr. Inside to Joe's Mr.
Outside.'' Trimarco is philosophical about Malone's up-or-out
kamikaze challenge to Acting Governor Cellucci in the bitter GOP
primary last fall. He is more disheartened by the public's
indifference and the press's lack of aggressive monitoring of
government. When the media cares not enough about what goes on,
beyond the titillation of scandal or the whiffs of incense given
off by smoldering ambitions, doing the right thing by the public is
an uphill grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this is automatic pilot. It needs administering, and
decision-making, and paying attention'' by those running important
public offices, he said. ``The press doesn't want a `good news'
story about a program that's working right; it's only interested in
controversy, in bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Had his luck been better, he might have been a GOP member of
Congress. Trimarco ran twice and lost against former Representative
Nick Mavroules, subsequently unhorsed by scandal. Trimarco grew up
in the Bronx, graduated from Dartmouth and BC Law School, where he
was on the Law Review and afterword clerked for Chief Justice
Joseph Tauro on the state's Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   If he had gone to Congress, he would have voted on the Clinton
impeachment last week, a development he sees as injurious to the
Republican Party everywhere. Acknowledging the GOP House losses of
last November, and the public's siding with Clinton during that
election, he asked: ``Has something changed? Did I miss
something?'' Trimarco is one of the GOP moderates, in the tradition
of the Sargents, Saltonstalls, Richardsons, Brookes, Volpes, and
Welds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wield power very well, as if they were born to
it.'' Frank Sargent, Ed Brooke, Mike Dukakis, Bill Weld were some
of the names he ticked off. ``Other guys get drunk with it; they
live to see their names in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   With Malone, he continued, ``We came in, tried to make a
difference, and I think we did. But I ask myself: `Does anybody
care?' '' He answered his own question. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the press care? Does the public? He can't answer that. He
said neither he nor Malone wanted to hang around in the treasurer's
office beyond two terms. He's seen too many other lifers under the
Dome. ``They hang on. They delude themselves that they're
indispensable to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   When the late Governor John A. Volpe was appointed as the first
Italian-American to be ambassador to Italy in the early 1970s,
Trimarco went with him as his counselor. He got an early lesson in
how a government functionary with gumption can change things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1972, Nixon and Kissinger were flirting with a coup against
the Italian government, do you believe it?'' The US ambassador
preceding Volpe, Graham Martin, had been moved to South Vietnam,
where his strong anticommunist sentiments mirrored those of
Nixon's. Trimarco said Martin had approved a stream of US funding
for a secretive group of ``right-wing Italian Catholics'' who
wanted to topple the Fanfani government. Martin sent Volpe a
scorching letter from Vietnam demanding Volpe maintain the secret
funding channel.
</P>
<P>
   When Volpe politely refused to reinstate the funding, said
Trimarco, the ambassador got a visit from General Vernon Walters, a
national security operative. Trimarco said, ``Volpe says that
General Walters made it very clear that Nixon and Kissinger want me
to continue this money thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimarco: ``Volpe was a man of good instincts, who always tried
to do the right thing, very humble. I said to Volpe: `You have all
the cards. Send a message that the only way you'll do this is if
they fly you back to the Oval Office and give you a direct
face-to-face order. They can't stand the flak. He said, `OK, let's
send that message.' And they never called him back on it, and to
the best of my knowledge, the money stopped. It was a great moment.
It showed me that one person can make a difference in government,
if you have some moral convictions. You look back on that today,
and it's laughable. But you have to be willing to step up and
challenge.''

   Vietnamese refugees crowding around Nguyen, awaiting news of
their own, grabbed the letter that would grant or deny him
political asylum in the United States. ``I hear, `You got it! You
got it!' '' he says, recalling the joy overwhelming him as the
message of freedom sank in.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Jeet Singh's passage was papered with college
letters of acceptance. From Princeton University, Columbia
University, Swarthmore College, and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``I came to MIT,'' says Singh, the only son of an
Indian diplomat who has lived on five continents, ``because I liked
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a world of difference in the life experiences that
brought Nguyen, 38, and Singh, 35, to Boston. What they share is
membership in the growing group of immigrants who have succeeded in
making careers in a center of cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   Boston universities have for decades been a magnet for foreign
students. But in more recent years a uniquely well-educated
immigrant population is also being attracted to the area by its
booming high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many are like Nguyen, who worked his way through college and, as
a software writer for Cambridge-based Lotus Development Corp.,
helps fill a yawning gap in the local supply of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   A few, like Singh, founder of Art Technology Group, a Boston
designer of Web sites, are continuing the entrepreneurial tradition
perhaps best represented by Chinese immigrant An Wang, founder of
Wang Laboratories Inc., one of Massachusetts' early computer
company successes.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-born residents _ 13 percent of the state's population of
6 million _ say that software, the Internet, and biotechnology
provide a discrimination-free arena in which they are judged by
what they can do. And they do a lot, either through tenacity or
with advantages of being educated in school systems superior to the
American system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the skills, the competence, the desire, you can do
anything you want,'' says Malik Khan, the 43-year-old founder of
Sitara Networks Inc., who emigrated from Pakistan in 1974 to attend
MIT. ``I've lived in Asia, in Europe, the US _ I've never found a
system quite like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of immigrants arrive in this country with little
money or advanced schooling. Many labor in low- and moderate-paying
service and manufacturing jobs in hopes of improving their lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big lump (of immigrants) at the bottom end and a
small lump at the top end'' of educational attainment, says George
Borjas, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government and expert on immigration patterns. But, he adds, ``The
small lump ends up in a place like Boston'' due to its
concentration of universities and technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the state's immigrant population is better educated than
immigrants nationwide. According to Massachusetts Insight, a public
policy consulting group, 33.2 percent of immigrants arriving here
after 1990 have bachelor's or graduate degrees. That is up from 28
percent of the immigrant population arriving in Massachusetts
before 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That counters a national trend in which 25.2 percent of
post-1990 immigrants hold college degrees, down from 32.8 percent.
By comparison, about one-fourth of US-born residents in
Massachusetts _ and nationwide _ have college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian immigrants head to Boston, for example, ``because
they had technical jobs in the country where they were from,'' says
Miriam Stein, communications director for the Massachusetts
Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. ``And Boston is a
high-tech magnet, so it's easy for them, and there's a low
unemployment rate so jobs are available.''
</P>
<P>

   Back in Vietnam, a college education was Nguyen's goal when he
slipped into the night in 1989 to board a wooden boat docked on the
beach of his home town, Nhatrang. It took six days and seven nights
for 150 refugees to cross the South China Sea and arrive at a
Philippine refugee camp, from which Nguyen would eventually be
admitted to the United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he was denied an education at home because his older
brothers had been in the South Vietnamese army. Nguyen still
carries his application to study oceanography in Vietnam. On it, he
detailed his brothers' affiliation; Nguyen never heard back from
the college. His mother languished in poverty while his brothers
were in jail. Finally, Nguyen left Vietnam after authorities
accused him of plotting to leave and he was regarded as an illegal
resident in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Boston, Nguyen attended Bunker Hill Community College
and then the University of Massachusetts-Boston, earning a
bachelor's degree in computer science. Turning down two other job
offers, he joined Cambridge-based Lotus last year and was recently
promoted, he says. ``I'm happy to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   John C.C. Fan, president of Kopin Corp., was a pioneer when he
emigrated in the early 1960s from Hong Kong to attend the
University of California at Berkeley. He came to Boston to earn a
doctorate in applied physics at Harvard University and, in 1984,
founded Kopin, a Taunton maker of computer parts.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from a former British colony gave him an advantage:
fluency in English. Today, many immigrants not conversant in
English, he says, are drawn to high tech because they are at ease
with the universal languages of math or science and ``they don't
need to be fluent in the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan employs a polyglot work force _ as do many other immigrant
entrepreneurs in high tech _ a practice that reinforces the
immigrant influx. One in five of Kopin's 150 workers emigrated _
many hold advanced degrees _ from countries like Russia, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, and South Korea. ``We have everybody,''
Fan says.
</P>
<P>
   At growing high-tech companies desperate for talented
programmers, immigrants can be a life-saver. Massachusetts' work
force is growing only 1 percent a year, according to a recent
study; without immigrants, the work force would have shrunk.

PARCELLS: NO TIME FOR PATS ON THE BACK YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   The screws, as he likes to say, are being tightened. For his
part, they will be not let up even if the game has no affect on his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to play this game just like we play all of the
others,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells after practice at the
team's Long Island facility. ``To win. At this time of year (going
into the playoffs) it is important that you keep your team playing
a high level. We will approach this like it is a playoff game. We
won't rest guys. We will play our best people as the game
dictates.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his wont before so-called ``big games,'' Parcells was not
happy with the way his team worked out Tuesday. ``Let's just say
that I yelled a lot,'' he said when asked why his voice was raspy.
``Seems that we got some players that forgot how they got here. We
tried to remind them how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells watched video of the Patriots' victory over San
Francisco and was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they did a very good job,'' he said. ``(Robert)
Edwards ran the ball well. He did a good job of picking where he
wanted to go. Scott (Zolak) made some nice throws in tough
situations. In that touchdown drive (in the fourth quarter) he hit
two big ones. One of them looked like a third and 16 or 17, and the
other was fourth down. Defensively, they did some nice things in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game for them. They have a lot at stake. I know
most of the kids on that team and what they can do. They'll come in
here giving it everything they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said the Jets have not finalized a new long-term
contract for quarterback Vinny Testaverde, but thinks it will get
done within the next couple of weeks. Most of the important
elements of the deal have been completed, but there are a few
things to be ironed out. When someone asked Parcells earlier in the
day why he was giving a new deal to Testaverde when the team held
an option for next year, his retort was: ``because he deserves it .
. . that's why.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parcells thinks the AFC was as good as any division in the
league this year, and that the four teams headed into the playoffs
will benefit from it. ``All these teams should be
battle-hardened,'' he said. ``We had an awful lot of big games
against each other during the season, and those are the kind of
games that get you ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   How the divisions fared:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Division ! Out of Div.! v. AFC! v. NFC &QL; 
(! used as column separator) &QL; 
 &QL; 
AFC East ! 23-14 ! 32-25 ! 9-8 &QL; 
AFC Central ! 14-23 ! 26-32 ! 7-10 &QL; 
AFC West ! 23-14 ! 27-28 ! 13-6 &QL; 
NFC East ! 15-24 ! 6-13 ! 27-29 &QL; 
NFC Central ! 21-16 ! 10-7 ! 30-28 &QL; 
NFC West ! 20-18 ! 8-9 ! 29-29 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The AFC holds a five-game lead over the NFC in games between the
conferences this year, but there will be five more games this
weekend. &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local fans think the Patriots have had injury problems this
year, but they are nothing compared with what has happened to the
Jacksonville Jaguars, who have 12 players on injured reserve,
including Don Davey, Jeff Lageman, and Seth Payne (all starting
defensive linemen), starting running back James Stewart, who was
having his best season, starting center Mike Cheever, and seven
other players who were on the 45-man roster at the beginning of the
season. It is still questionable whether Mark Brunell will be ready
to play in the playoffs. It looks as if the Jaguars will host
Pittsburgh next Monday night with their third-string quarterback,
rookie Jonathan Quinn, at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Pittsburgh, backup Mike Tomczak was tough on starter
Kordell Stewart in a Steeler postgame radio show last Sunday.
Tomczak said Stewart did not work hard enough at preparing for
games, and some of the other players, in the midst of a
tremendously disappointing season, care about themselves more than
team accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AFC playoff picture illustrates the importance of home
cooking. Look at the teams that have qualified. Denver is 7-0 at
Mile High, where it will play the rest of the season in its quest
of another Super Bowl. Miami is 7-1 at home, and the Jets and
Jacksonville are 6-1. New England and Buffalo are 6-2. The
Patriots, Miami and Buffalo all have losing records on the road,
and all three are on the road this weekend . . . Jerry Seeman,
director of officials, said referee Phil Luckett made a great call
Monday night on the so-called ``backward pass'' thrown by John
Elway. ``As soon as the passer's arm starts forward, no matter
where it goes after that, it is a forward pass,'' said Seeman.
``Elway was hit from behind as his hand was coming forward to throw
the ball. The ball went behind him and hit the ground. When it did,
it was an incomplete pass, just like it was called.'' . . .
Consider this: Zolak was the 33d backup quarterback in the league
to start a game this season, which indicates the physical beating
the quarterbacks have been taking. And it appears that just one has
taken every snap for his team _ Colts rookie Peyton Manning.

RED SOX GM ISN'T FAZED BY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dan Duquette seemed almost at peace with himself
Tuesday as the Red Sox general manager held court to discuss the
team's offseason: a period in which the club has lost Mo Vaughn to
the Anaheim Angels and has yet to achieve equal value in return.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the signing of pitchers Mark Portugal and Mark Guthrie,
plus second baseman Jose Offerman, counts for something. But things
looked a lot worse last winter, and good things happened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say lightning can't strike again?
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be steady year-round in this business,'' said
Duquette. ``We've been able to help our ball club for next year and
for the long haul with some of the acquisitions we made. They may
not be established players, but they should be players who can help
us have a good, competitive ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   You heard this first when Vaughn turned down the Red Sox and
opted for a $80 million payday. Duquette had similar thoughts after
the winter meetings in Nashville, where instead of a power hitter,
he landed Guthrie, a 32-year-old relief pitcher. And you're going
to keep hearing it until Duquette can either pull off a trade or
sign one of the 39 free agents who weren't tendered contracts by
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said now is not the time to give in to his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those jobs where you're not going to please
everybody all the time,'' he declared. ``You really need to focus
on what it takes to have a good competitive team year in and year
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Abraham Lincoln said. If he spent all his time
trying to answer all the charges against his administration, he
wouldn't have time in the day to do the job he needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has sought to impeach Duquette _ yet. But there have been
many negative articles written about his tenure in Boston and the
ball club's immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette makes no apologies about his offseason moves or the
loss of Vaughn. The team will continue to seek a top power hitter,
although now he mostly likely qill arrive via a trade. In the
meantime, the Sox will be built as much around pitching as it is
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   If no trade presents itself, Sox fans will see the latest
products of the farm system, outfielder Trot Nixon, for example.
This still doesn't explain how a club that finished 22 games behind
the Yankees in the American League East can hope to do better. Or
beat out the improved Orioles or Angels for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   It's all how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good things about this ball club going into
the 1999 season,'' said Duquette. ``The addition of Offerman. The
continued maturation of Garciaparra. The maturation of the
catchers, Jason Varitek and Scott Hatteberg. We are going into the
season with four established major league starting pitchers (Pedro
Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, Tim Wakefield, and Portugal), something
we didn't have a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand Texas and California have been very active. But
our primary competition will be in the AL East. You never know
what's going to happen going into the season. If you look at the
way the final standings were, you'd see some big gaps from the
start. We should be able to supplement the ball club and still be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was mentioned by Duquette several times during the
interview, but qithout a trace of anger. It has become a business
deal that didn't work out for traditional reasons. Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough resources to put together a competitive ball
club,'' insisted Duquette. ``And the fact that we've made the
playoffs two of the last four years bears that out. We have an
established farm system now. That's going to be very helpful to us
over the long haul.

<P>
   ``But the money that some of these top players are getting is
obscene. The biggest challenge for our club is paying that kind of
money to one player. This isn't the NBA, where you have one star
and four complementary players and win the title. You need a number
of top-quality players to win the pennant. A number of decisions
for your franchise are made based on your economics. But if you
make the right number of common sense decisions, you have a pretty
good ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   If the season opened today, replacing Vaughn could be done in
several ways. The key spot becomes second, not first base. If Jeff
Frey starts at second, it makes Offerman the designated hitter, and
either Mike Stanley or Reggie Jefferson will play first. If
Offerman is at second, look for Jefferson to DH and Stanley to play
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Stanley played first when Vaughn got hurt last
season. In fact, the same thing happened two years ago. We're
making good progress toward having a championship-caliber team.
We'd like to have a top quality ball club that our fans can be
proud of when we host the All-Star Game next July.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette added that while the Sox may not have Vaughn, the Sox
roster is full of players with multiple-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've communicated directly to our fans that we'd like to have
a good ball club year in and year out,'' he said. ``Since the
advent of free agency in 1976, the Red Sox have the best record of
any team but one (Yankees). Our fans know we have a number of
top-quality players under contract for several years under salaries
we can support.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why so many free agents have turned down a chance to play
in Boston, Duquette said there is no one answer. Certainly, it's
not the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players understand the significance of playing in
historic Fenway Park,'' said Duquette. ``They understand the fans
are there to appreciate your effort. We've always built our ball
club through the farm system and trades. We've utilized free
agency, but it hasn't been the primary route for great Red Sox
players. The bottom line is that we'd like to win a World Series
championship and we have the resources to put together a
top-quality team here in Boston.''

   After four years of searching the Far East for the right arm,
the Sox Tuesday acquired righthander Tomokazu Oka from the Yokohama
Baystars, the 1998 Japan Series champion.
</P>
<P>
   Oka had only a 7-8 record in 25 games for Yokohoma's top farm
team, but struck out 98 and walked just 31. Oka will report to Fort
Myers, Fla., and will likely open the season at Pawtucket.

   BOOMER-TOYS (New York) _ Not since Kane whispered Rosebud has
the nation thought so hard about the toys from its past.
Baby-boomers, now parents and grandparents, are hitting their
second childhood. A generation about to slip into senior
citizenship has created a growing market for newly-produced classic
toys, log-building sets to electric football boards to Dr. Seuss
books, and they don't have to go to toy stores to find them. By
William L. Hamilton.

   KIDS-ROOM (Undated) _ To a child, one of the sweetest and most
long-lasting Christmas gifts is a room of one's own. And it's
clear, as every parent knows, that children are sometimes their own
best interior designers. By Elaine Louie.

   STORE-GATES (New York) _ Unconsoled by recent drops in reported
crime, store owners in New York City continue to seal their
investments each night behind riot-proof shields that first
appeared in great numbers here during the late 1960s. The
persistence of this riot-proofing is a sign that retailers, like
old generals, are still stubbornly fighting the last war. But a new
type of gate that is now becoming more widespread is the perfect
addition to the streetscapes of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's safer
but sterner New York. By Philip Nobel.

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   NEA-ROBBINS (Undated) _ After years under congressional siege _
and a spring rally on the Right to annihilate it _ the National
Endowment for the Arts, whose budget was finally secured in
September, might understandably be looking for steady ground to
tread. But under the leadership of a new chairman, William J. Ivey,
who has said that he believes the endowment should be as important
as the Department of Defense, the NEA is marching, not slinking, to
the front lines in its support of the arts. On Tuesday, Ivey
announced the bold appointment of Mark Robbins, a curator, teacher
and artist, as the new design director, a position that has been
vacant for more than 18 months. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   FLOWER-ARRANGING (New York) _ Japanese women coming to New York
for lessons in flower arranging seems as absurd as New Yorkers
going to Tokyo for rudeness seminars. Three centuries ago, when
forest covered Manhattan, the art of floral design called ikebana
flourished in Japan, where the intricate craft is still revered as
a national treasure, like the tea ceremony. By Jessica Siegel.

<P>
   VIRTUAL-APARTMENTS (Undated) _ Let's say you're a developer with
a pile of rubble where a new building is going to be. How do you
move those multimillion-dollar three bedrooms before you can say,
``The stock market's down 512 points again''? In the old days, you
rented an office (preferably ground floor) in a fancy location, put
some easels around the room, stuck up architects' renderings and
handed out embossed brochures _ and coffee. But now there's virtual
reality _ the catchall term for computer-generated videos that
mimic a visit to an existing or still-imagined building. It is
becoming part of a growing number of sales pitches. By Tracie
Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   HOMEMADE-WINE (Minneapolis) _ Looking at a wish book from
Semplex of U.S.A., one of the country's leading specialty houses,
serving amateur winemakers since 1962, I spied a $154.25 trilevel
Steam Juice Extractor imported from Finland and used to crush
grapes painlessly and efficiently. I also noticed the $389 Buon
Vino Super Jet Filter, an Italian import capable of pumping 80
gallons of wine an hour. But no way was I buying any of it. My
family has its own claptrap tin wine press, which my uneducated
country-boy grandfather quixotically lugged across Europe and to
the United States three generations ago. By Neal Karlen.

LONG ROAD BACK FOR TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Mike Tyson's newest sweatshop is a boxing gym from
back in the day. It is a squat, cinder block building that sits
broken down and beaten at 1755 Van Buren, where it shares broken
glass and a plot of dirt with a metal taco shop called Taqueria
Hermosillo. It is a place of work but also a place to remind Mike
Tyson how far he strayed from his roots.
</P>
<P>
   To say the neighborhood is seedy would be to insult the word,
not the neighborhood. It is a place where there are few dreams
left, and the ones that remain were long ago broken. It is the kind
of place that produces fighters.
</P>
<P>
   It is here amid the smell of sweat and hot sauce where the
youngest man to ever win the heavyweight championship comes five
days a week in a dark blue Rolls-Royce to try and rebuild his own
broken dream. Here, in a place they used to call Madison Square
Garden until Tyson started coming around, he is preparing himself
to go back to the day when he was the most feared fighting machine
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not even his exile to Arizona has allowed him to avoid the
bizarre legal twists that have dogged him for years because the
minute word got out that Tyson would be training for his return to
boxing at the Madison Square Garden gym, letters started coming to
Richard Rodriguez that were not nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't Madison Square Garden no more,'' the gym owner said
despite the huge sign that hangs between two boarded-up windows.
``Ever since Mike came here, New York started getting on our ass.
They been on our case with (threatening) letters (about using the
Garden's name). So now it's Mike Tyson Enterprises-Ricky Ricardo
Gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodriguez better hope the estate of Lucille Ball and
Desi Arnez doesn't get wind of that because that is how life goes
around Tyson. Always a whirlwind. Always someone suing somebody or
someone accusing somebody or someone hollering at somebody or
someone punching somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is all Tyson is interested in for now. He is back in
the punching business, having rid himself of nearly all the angry
elements that seemed to make chaos his constant companion.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, Rory Holloway, John Horne, and Richie Giachetti are
all gone, replaced by a quiet businessman from New York named
Shelly Finkel and a quiet trainer named Tommy Brooks, both of whom
once worked for Tyson's fistic albatross, Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was a cacophony of sound and fury whenever
Tyson would prepare for a fight, now there is only rap music and
the swish of a jump rope as he readies himself for a Jan. 16
appointment in Las Vegas with South African heavyweight Frans
Botha. Those sounds and the ever present drone of Steve
``Crocodile'' Finch, Tyson's personal loudspeaker, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pound for pound, baby!'' Finch is screaming on a cool
afternoon four days before Christmas as Tyson works the jump rope.
``Ezzard Charles! Joe Louis! Dick Tiger! Pound for pound! Bob
Foster! Bobby Chacon! We goin' to war! All-time, baby. Pound for
pound! All-time greats! Mike Tyson! Sonny Liston! Mike Tyson!
Archie Moore! Mike Tyson! Mike Tyson! Mike Tyson!''
</P>
<P>
   As Finch hollers his eyes are fixed on a small, black stopwatch
around his neck. Tyson is seemingly oblivious to the small crowd of
scruffy-faced kids, neighborhood hangers on, media watchers, and a
strange guy in the back in a spray-painted jacket that read in
several places ``Bleep the Police!''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel sees the latter and quickly grows concerned. Soon he is
talking to James Anderson, father of Atlanta Falcons running back
Jamal Anderson and a former New Jersey cop who is starting his
second tour as Tyson's chief of security. Within minutes, the man
in the potentially offending jacket has quietly disappeared while
Tyson goes on about his business.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it is not the hurt business. He sparred six rounds
Monday and Brooks keeps him on a tight schedule of alternating days
of hard work followed by review. This is a day for reviewing
techniques Tyson had long ago forgotten, things the Old Man, Cus
D'Amato, taught him back in the day when he was a boy with dreams
being raised by an old eccentric who had dreams, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Tyson wants to go back to. He wants to go back to
when his life was more about boxing than drama. When it was more
about opponents than lawsuits. Back to when it was simple to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stay humble,'' Tyson said Tuesday. ``Cus used to tell
me the more important you are, the more humble you should be. I try
to get people not to look at me as a superstar but it's hard.
Sometimes I forget who I am but when I'm around people, I remember
who I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man who was bringing me some food one day says, `Hello, Mr.
Tyson.' I told him to call me Mike. He says, `No, no. You're Mr.
Tyson, sir. I would love to be you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Please don't say that brother. You don't want to
be me.' And he says, `Yes, I do. I got six children and but one
check.' I told him I got millions and no friends. You can always
get some financial aid. But you can't get no friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is not here to serve in that role. He is not here to be
Tyson's friend or his lawyer or his psychiatrist. He is here to
refresh his memory of things that once made him impregnable in a
boxing ring. Here to bring him back, if a 32-year-old power puncher
on a two-fight losing streak who has fought an average of 2.9
rounds a year the past seven years can come back.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years as an assistant to his father-in-law, Lou Duva,
and to Holyfield's head trainer, Don Turner, Brooks accepted
Tyson's offer to go on his own and took over his training in
November. It was odd, leaving Holyfield for Tyson, but it was a
move Brooks acknowledges was done for the reason most everything is
done in boxing.

<P>
   ``Evander gave me a platform to show my talents as a trainer,
but Evander has two or three fights and then he'll go on about his
business,'' Brooks said. ``This is a kid with eight or 10 fights.
Holyfield and I will always be tight as far as I'm concerned. He'll
always be in my heart. But this is a business. I got to look out
for me and my family. It was a hard decision but it wasn't, because
how long can you be an assistant?''
</P>
<P>
   Not any longer for Brooks, who made his mark with Tyson their
first day of training when he had him do a drill in which he had to
punch as fast as he could in those 30-second bursts. When it went
on too long, Tyson doubled over and threw up in exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done, Brooks said, ``Punch! You can't stop punching
in a fight if you throw up.'' In recent years, Tyson has had no
such taskmaster. He has had people who knew they were employees and
acted accordingly. Brooks knows it, too, but he also knows he's
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys around him have been yes men,'' Brooks
explained. ``He was training them. That's not the way it's supposed
to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   That day it didn't. Tyson kept punching as sweat poured down his
face and his stomach rumbled. Finally he yelled, ``Kill me!'' Then
he kept on punching.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight losses to Holyfield, a 17-month suspension
for biting Holyfield's ears in the rematch, financial collapse and
the banishment of his former friends and management team to a
courtroom where men in suits will fight over him, Mike Tyson has
come back to the basics. Back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the hard, clean stuff of boxing. And back to a
broken-down gym and a new trainer intent on pushing him back to
where he once thought was his rightful place in the world _ the
throne room of boxing's most glamorous division.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a refresher course no matter how long you've
been fighting,'' Brooks said. ``Now that he's been beat twice, guys
aren't intimidated like they used to be. That bully syndrome
doesn't work. Now he's got to fight. Maybe he needed to get beat to
realize the bad habits he got into.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Tyson brushes that notion off while acknowledging he
hasn't done this kind of fundamental work in a gym ``since I was a
kid.'' Then for nearly an hour he banters with a half-dozen writers
from around the country, discoursing on why Bill Clinton shouldn't
be impeached (``We knew who he was. We all get caught up in that
situation. We're all men. We're just glad we didn't get caught.''),
and on how he hopes his children ``become good people and not bums
because they're in a position to make a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains why he paid for the funeral of a poor white teenager
in Phoenix who was shot in the throat when she pushed two young
black girls down to get them out of the line of fire during a
neighborhood shootout because ``we gotta be socialists about
things. It's the 21st Century and we human beings can't take care
of our own. I'm not a communist. I'm a socialist. Jesus Christ was
a socialist. Allah was a socialist. We have to love each other or
we'll all die together because no one in the government is going to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later he wanders off to corporate sweatshops in Honduras
that makes clear to him that ``we're all capitalistic pigs. We
don't care.'' Then it's on to the bombings in Iraq and the need for
welfare reform because ``welfare is like crack. The government
needs to give people a job. Then if you don't want to do nothing
send your ass to jail . . . My mother was on welfare because she
was broken. She was an educated lady. She went to college. But her
spirit was broken. This is all deeper than being a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that but at this juncture of his life he remains a fighter
first, wich is why he is back in this broken part of Phoenix
looking for answers and himself. As he works to get back the head
movement and flurries of punches that once made him a champion,
Mike Tyson thinks about things and has come to a conclusion about
his life that is simple and clear and clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fighter,'' he says. ``Now I realize, with not much chaos
in my life, I wasn't conscious of some things. I'm sorry if I
grabbed a girl's butt or cursed her out or what not. I'm sorry if I
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I'm an (expletive) sometimes but the spotlight
is not on you all. I'm sure you're (expletive), too. I'm just in a
different position. I'm a complex person just happy to fight
again.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, word comes from one of his PR men that it is time to
join Santa Claus in the ring to hand out Christmas toys to
neighborhood kids. Tyson and Jamal Anderson have supplied the toys
and as Tyson looks up a line of kids _ black, white, Hispanic, all
poor _ has formed from the ring, down the steps to the floor, along
the wall, out the door, passed the taco shop, and around the corner
for half a block. They have gathered at a place where he is
learning to fight again to wait for a toy. Santa Claus is in the
ring, red hat and white whiskers, waiting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Before he leaves, Tyson is asked one last thing. He's asked
about the perception that he's some kind of animal, a perception
fueled by his rape conviction and the cannibalism Holyfield drove
him to 17 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The once and perhaps future heavyweight champion thinks for a
moment and then smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm a good animal,'' he says. ``I hope I'm
domesticated.''

SEC LEVELS CHARGES AGAINST W.R. GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. needs right now: another ``Civil
Action'' of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday filed a civil
suit against Grace and a administrative complaint against seven
former Grace executives, alleging they manipulated financial
results at the company's former Waltham, Mass. subsidiary, National
Medical Care, from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC charged that Grace employed a ``cookie jar'' accounting
strategy that stashed as much as $20 million of excess profits at a
time the company believed it would not be rewarded for beating
financial expectations. The idea, according to the SEC, was to
declare the profit at some later date when operations were not
running so well in a process known as financial ``smoothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine L. Hampers, the well-known and sometimes
controversial chief executive of National Medical Care, was among
the seven executives named in the administrative complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Grace denied the allegations Tuesday in a written statement.
``Grace continues to assert the financial statements were not
fraudulent,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the first of its kind since SEC chairman Arthur
Levitt focused on the government's concern over corporate
``earnings management'' and shady accounting practices in a closely
watched speech three months ago. Levitt specifically cited cookie
jar reserves among five ``hocus pocus'' accounting practices in his
comments.
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials said Tuesday the Grace suit was the first of a
string of cases it expected to file over the fraudulent reporting
of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly financial fraud in its many forms is our top
priority,'' said Richard Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement.
``There are a number of cases that are going to be coming in the
first months of the (new) year.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt has outlined a handful of accounting issues that will
come under increased regulatory scrutiny, including some that are
commonly found in high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Large ``big bath'' special charges that sweep many expenses and
problems under the rug, creative accounting for acquisitions and
mergers and questions of when a sale is recognized as actual
revenue are among the leading accounting issues raised by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has settled one other ``cookie jar'' reserve case this
year, involving Sensormatic Electronics Corp. The new Grace suit,
filed in US District Court in Miami, alleged that the company
deferred unexpected earnings of National Medical in 1991 and 1992.
Grace assigned the money to reserves, which it drew upon in 1993
and 1995 to hike the reported profits of both the health care unit
and Grace itself, the SEC alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of the kind of situation in which
we've been critical of the process of earnings management,'' said
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Grace said its outside auditor was aware of
the reserves and issued unqualified opinions on each of the
company's annual statements in question. It said it had disclosed
the SEC investigation leading to the suit in public filings.
</P>
<P>
   National Medical, at various times the subject of a bidding war
in the mid-1990s among Hampers himself, Baxter International and
Fresenius AG of Germany, was merged with Fresenius in 1996. Grace
shareholders got $2.25 billion and a 44.8 percent stake in the new
Fresenius Medical Care AG.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting charges come at a time when Grace is already
bracing for a wave of negative publicity, anticipating the release
of the film ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta. The film,
based on the best-selling book by the same name, recounts the legal
battle of three companies, Grace most prominent among them, and
eight Woburn, Mass. families who blamed toxic waste that leached
into the town's water supply for six deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were dropped in 1986 in return for an $8 million
settlement. The film, which opens Christmas Day in New York and Los
Angeles, will premiere in Boston on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is already directing reporters and film reviewers likely
to write about the movie to a company Internet site, ``Beyond A
Civil Action, Woburn Issues and Answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The site attempts to support the company's contention that it
did not contaminate the town's water, though it concedes ``we made
mistakes in addressing the concerns of the community and government
agencies regarding the impact of waste disposal practices'' at
Grace's Woburn plant.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the same artists are involved, this sequel to
``Babe'' loses its way in the big city, turning the noble piglet
into little more than a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' PG (mild sexual talk)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor's movie brings out all the weaknesses and
few of the strengths of Brian Friel's prize-winning play about five
unmarried sisters living in rural Ireland in the summer of 1936.
However, whatever's worth having in this movie belongs to star
Meryl Streep, who shines as the uptight, controlling oldest sister.
1 hour, 34 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1
hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen.2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''
</P>
<P>
   44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated, but contains sexual themes and brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center. 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Catherine O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-fried hokum about an unwed mom-to-be (Drew Barrymore) and
the stepsons (Luke Wilson and Jake Busey) of her late boyfriend.
One wants to kill her, the other wants to kiss her. A mix of
Hollywood blandness and small-town condescension, the movie can't
decide if it's a romance or a farce. But Catherine O'Hara chews the
scenery nicely as the boys' vengeful mom.1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. We're not making this
up. The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of
those stale Hollywood sermons about taking time out for your kids.
It's less substantial than a snowball in July. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper. 2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan. 1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n' roll
to the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' R (violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock classic. It's very
well made and acted, with a terrific performance by Vince Vaughn as
Norman Bates. But it's an odd cinematic experiment that never seems
to know exactly what it intended to prove. 1 hour, 38 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Kung fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. Chan and Tucker learn to work together, in part by
imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one works. 1 hour, 37
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but simple. It's a
character-driven black comedy with some powerful moral-qualm
undercurrents. In the deep snows of rural Minnesota, two brothers
(Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a
downed plane with $4 million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to
split the money leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events.
1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew saves an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal its juju. The movie is full of jokes
and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed for
Trekkers who need an update on their intergalactic family album. 1
hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' R (profanity, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   When a stag party goes murderously out of control, the
groom-to-be and his pals (Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern
and Christian Slater) go to great lengths to cover their tracks.
Even if it means killing a bunch of people, or each other. This
pitch-black comedy from Peter Berg is the sort of sick-joke
experience you'll tend to love or hate.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny village
(population 52) when it's discovered that one of the residents is
the holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie
is a little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish.
But the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David
Kelly, are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
write for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

RETAIL SALES MAY NOT BE AS MERRY AS FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Retailers and analysts said as recently as last
month they had the no-fail ingredients for successful holiday
sales: low unemployment and inflation, high consumer confidence and
a healthy stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Christmas, those bright expectations are dimming.
Retailers are projecting sales at stores open at least one year to
increase 3 percent to 4 percent over last year instead of the more
optimistic 5 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (retailers) are fully aware of the fact this holiday
season is turning out to be a disappointment,'' said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J.
``Many are beginning to cut prices further than they already have
and doing everything imaginable to get people into the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard recently adjusted his 4 percent to 5 percent sales
increase projection, which he said retailers had criticized for
being low, to 3 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The BTM/Schroeders retail chain store index reported Tuesday
that sales for the week ending Dec. 19 fell 1.7 percent from the
same week last year. The forecasting service has lowered its
year-over-year increase projections for the whole season to 4.5
percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Shopping Centers said sales at mall
specialty stores dipped 0.7 percent during the third full week of
the holiday period compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite positive economic indicators, it appears the
unseasonably warm weather as well as dramatic domestic and
international political events have distracted shoppers,'' said
John Konarski, ICSC's senior vice president of research, referring
to President Clinton's bombing campaign in Iraq and the impeachment
process in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said retailers generally underplayed the impact of
developments in the second half of the year, including the Asian
economic crisis and the bearish stock market during the summer. In
addition, he said, planned layoffs at blue-chip companies such as
Boeing, Citigroup and Johnson &AMP; Johnson have dampened holiday
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   According to First Data Corp.'s TeleCheck Services, which tracks
sales paid for by check, same-store sales from Nov. 27 through Dec.
20 on the West Coast were down 1.9 percent over the same period
last year with a dramatic 9.3 percent drop in sales in the San
Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based service blamed the West's weak export market,
cutbacks in oil and refinery production, and consolidations in the
financial sector and other industries for the downturn. TeleCheck
spokeswoman Marjorie Fowler said the summer's market fluctuations
had an especially strong impact on the Bay area because of its
concentration of volatile high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The generally balmy autumn across much of the nation may also
have affected sales of items such as coats and cold-weather
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gagne, senior vice president of Strategic Weather Services,
a Pennsylvania-based company that provides advice to retailers and
manufacturers on the effects of weather and shopping, said the
later the warm weather continues through the season, the less
likely merchants will recover lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will think I got this far into it without buying an
overcoat, so I'll just ride it out and make do,'' he said. ``And
when retailers look back and consider the recent cold and snowy
weather, it will be a case of too little too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gagne said since people are compelled to shop for holiday
gifts, other categories of merchandise benefit from the unseasonal
weather. Those include such all-season items as jewelry, consumer
electronics and home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of home furnishings rose 9.1 percent in the second week of
December over the same period last year, according to the ICSC's
poll of specialty stores. The group reported clothing sales were
nearly flat, rising just 0.1 percent during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said housewares and home goods would continue their
strong showing, fueled by solid home sales and an aging population
that spends time and money on their homes. Barnard also predicted
other winners this season would be the discount stores, with sales
increases of 5 percent to 7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said department stores would be the big losers because
price-conscious shoppers look elsewhere. ``Department stores are
going to limp badly, depending on how good a cane they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, however, said the department store chain is ``on plan''
with the sales expectations it set earlier this season, although
the store does not disclose its predictions. Macy's spokeswoman
Merle Goldstone confirmed that sales of home furnishings were
especially strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warm weather did hurt us a little bit. With the return of
cold weather, things are turning out OK,'' she said. ``It's not the
greatest, not the worst.''

<P>
   The world is now digesting the grave consequences of the use of
force by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. By
arrogating to itself the functions of prosecutor, judge and court
marshal, the United States has dealt a heavy blow to the United
Nations _ and to the hopes of establishing a just and effective
international legal order.
</P>
<P>
   One theme is prominent in Russian comments on the U.S. air
strikes: Russia has been snubbed; its opinion was simply ignored.
Many politicians, even such serious ones as Moscow's Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, are now saying that as a response to this show of power,
Russia should be rebuilding its own economic, political and
military might.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by using military force, Washington was not defying
just Russia alone. In the same way, the United States dismissed
curtly the viewpoints of other nations too _ including China,
India, France, Italy and the League of Arab States, all of whom
subsequently objected strongly to the bombing raids. The reaction
in Russia, at this time, is symptomatic. It follows naturally from
what has happened to the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   By now, with the close of 1998, the failure of Boris Yeltsin's
political and economic course has been laid bare. One crisis after
another this past year has dramatized the consequences of his
misguided policies. The financial collapse that started last August
has hit even those people _ the 10 percent to 15 percent of the
population _ who actually had benefited from the ``reforms.'' As
for the majority of Russian citizens, even Yeltsin himself has had
to admit that, yes, they live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these pseudo-reforms, which have done great harm to
Russia's economy, to its health and education systems, to its
science and culture, were applauded by the West. There was pro-U.S.
euphoria in Russia at one point; but today this has given way to
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our people are wondering: ``Why does the United
States so much like the policies that are so bad for us?''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, Washington's reactions are just wrong. When, for
example, the failure of Russia's previous governments forced yet
another change and the appointment of the cabinet of Yevgeny
Primakov, Washington's response was not right. By freezing the
loans promised to the previous Russian cabinet, the International
Monetary Fund followed suit and made things even more difficult _
all of this at a time when Primakov is desperately trying to
stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the West and in the Russian media, his cabinet is often
called pro-Communist and anti-reform. As I have said time and again
_ both in Russia and during a recent lecture tour around the United
States _ this is far from the truth. In fact, the new Russian
cabinet is made of pragmatic, no-nonsense people, with a great deal
of experience. Its leaders are far from being fly-by-night
trend-setters; they are not fooling around. They are wise men who
are concerned about the country's future and understand that there
can be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of cabinet that gives Russia a chance
to gradually extricate itself from a post-Cold War crisis that dims
the bright future we envisioned just a short time ago. It is
Primakov's kind of cabinet that will give this country a chance to
integrate into the global economy and establish long-term
cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are not going to simply jump on the bandwagon and
support without reservation whatever the United States might do,
nor should the rest of the world expect such thoughtless
endorsement. With a cabinet like Primakov's, Russia is an honest
and reliable partner with which other leaders and nations can deal.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that, but for the U.S. attack against Iraq, the
Primakov government would have secured the Russian parliament's
ratification of the START II treaty. It has collected dust in the
Duma since 1993; after promising work by Primakov, the talks were
likely to resume. Some opponents were won over. The limits of 6,000
warheads under START I would be cut in half. Now, after the battle
was fought, it must be fought again. After what has happened, this
will be an uphill task. Once again, resentment has built up and is
cresting thanks to this aggressive bombing. As it is, one aide to
President Yeltsin has already stated carelessly that ``one may well
give up'' on the arms-control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   How disappointing on the eve of the new century, when peace and
diplomacy are still the right road.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, as on many others, the Russian cabinet has to
contend with interference from all kinds of quarters. What is
needed is something quite different _ to help this government and
thus help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Americans often ask me: Why should we help Russia? Often the
question is posed sincerely and in good faith. But other times one
detects the barely submerged tone of a self-proclaimed ``victor''
in the Cold War. There is no victor; I believe it is plain that
moving into the 21st century, we all must stand together.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of America's omnipotence, now so
common among U.S. politicians, will one day vanish and it will
become clear that in today's boundaryless world NO ONE can have a
monopoly on leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the bombs rained on Iraq and shortly thereafter, new
centers of economic power and political influence were continuing
to emerge. Alliances may shift; Russia could become a strong and
friendly partner to the West. But today many people regard such a
prospect as highly unlikely, and recent U.S. actions have not
brought it any closer.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a major effort by both sides in the coming year to
put things back on course.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Four decades ago a Third World dictator threatened American
interests in a crucial region. Unwilling to pay the costs of an
invasion or settle for containment, U.S. policymakers convinced
themselves that a cheap and easy third option existed: support for
some of the dictator's domestic opponents, whose efforts would
supposedly spark a popular uprising and topple the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting invasion attempt by Cuban exiles at the Bay of
Pigs turned into one of the worst fiascoes in the history of
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently _ perhaps incredibly _ one of the hottest
foreign-policy ideas in Washington has been to use the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From congressional leaders to former government officials, this
option _ to ``roll back'' the power of Saddam Hussein by supporting
opposition groups within Iraq, has been touted as the way to go.
From the pages of The Weekly Standard, National Review and
Commentary to The New Republic and columnists at The New York
Times, The Washington Post and The Nation, support for the Iraqi
opposition has become the leading alternative to the Clinton
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   One recent letter urging the president to back Saddam's foes
more strongly was signed by three former Republican national
security advisers, three former Republican secretaries of defense,
and seven former Republican subcabinet officials. Yet another
prominent supporter of the idea has been Clinton's first CIA
director, R. James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in October Congress even rushed to embrace an Iraq
Liberation Act, authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid
to democratic Iraqi resistance groups. The president's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the option is simple: The United States
should refuse to accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and
help install the Iraqi opposition in his place.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) put it, ``The
doctrine here has to be rollback, not containment.''
</P>
<P>
   In The New Republic, former Under-Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz wrote, ``Toppling Saddam is the only outcome that can
satisfy the vital U.S. interest in a stable and secure Gulf region,
because, to a degree unique among contemporary tyrannies, the Iraqi
regime is Saddam Hussein. ... The vast majority of Iraqis want him
out, though only those with a death wish say so openly. We must
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that Saddam could supposedly be replaced at
relatively low cost _ even, many advocates argue, without ever
committing American ground troops. The world could be free of
Saddam, Wolfowitz argued in recent testimony before Congress, if
the Clinton administration would only ``muster the necessary
strength of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly in the ointment is that this is simply not true. Even if
mere ``rollback'' were desirable, any policy to bolster a
successful attack by the Iraqi opposition would have to be
militarily feasible, amenable to American allies whose cooperation
would be required for implementation, and acceptable to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tout this prescription as superior to existing U.S.
policy are either engaging in wishful thinking or cynically playing
politics. For the United States to undertake a policy of rollback
in Iraq _ using any of already stated plans, at least _ would be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression sometimes given by backers of the
Iraqi opposition, there is no single, simple rollback plan.
Instead, three competing variants of the idea have been put
forward: using airpower to oust Saddam, helping the opposition
seize large chunks of Iraq or sponsoring a guerrilla war by his
foes.
</P>
<P>
   In the airpower approach, the United States would team up with
the Iraqi opposition for a decisive military campaign against the
regime. The problem here is that almost all the heavy lifting would
be done by the United States, which would incur huge costs without
being assured of success in return.
</P>
<P>
   It would be undertaken after the United States had helped the
Iraqi opposition recruit, train and equip tens of thousands of
soldiers for limited conventional warfare. Ultimately, when this
opposition army was ready to take the field, the United States
would launch an air offensive against Saddam's forces to devastate
Iraqi combat formations, logistics, command and control, and
rear-echelon positions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require the opposition to capture Iraq's cities
from the regime's armed forces. Opposition troops would have to
fight these battles largely on their own, because it would be
difficult for U.S. planes and missiles to destroy Iraqi ground
units hiding in the concrete jungles of modern cities and because,
in order to limit civilian casualties, U.S. rules of engagement
would prohibit bombing urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even battered Republican Guard divisions would be too much
for the weak opposition forces to handle in urban combat. Saddam's
foes would probably lose on the ground even if the United States
were to devote a massive air campaign to aiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the approach might lead Saddam to unleash his chemical
and biological weapons _ his jealously guarded ace in the hole _
against the United States and its Middle Eastern allies. Saddam was
never close enough to being toppled during the Gulf War to use
these weapons of last resort. Slowly pushing him to the wall would
give him every reason to lash out with his arsenal, while removing
all incentives for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, in short, would involve fighting a preventive war
against Iraq from a standing start but using opposition troops
instead of U.S. ground forces. Its costs and risks would make it an
extremely grave and unpopular endeavor, even if it were sold as a
way to settle the problem of Saddam once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the opposition might well lose, leaving the
administration with the agonizing choice of either leaving Saddam
to crow over his escape, continuing the air campaign or sending
U.S. troops to occupy Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   To have attempted a rollback of Iraq's regime by relying on an
opposition ground attack, along with U.S. airpower, then, would
have been incredibly risky and more likely to box in Washington
than liberate Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the generous assumptions that only 12 of Iraq's 23
divisions would actually fight (six army and six Republican Guard)
and that each division could be effectively destroyed with 500 air
sorties, it would take 6,000 sorties to deal with these units
alone. About the same number would be required to attack Iraqi
military installations, logistical support and tactical
command-and-control assets _ a combined total of 12,000 sorties, or
just over half of the 22,000 flown against similar targets by
coalition aircraft during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   An air campaign supporting an Iraqi opposition ground offensive
would also require significant attention to targets that were not
high priorities in Desert Storm. The United States would have to
move to stop periodic counterattacks by Iraqi heavy divisions
against the lightly armed opposition formations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air forces would have to pummel a handful of Iraqi units
for weeks until they cracked, wait for the opposition forces to
move in and brace themselves for counterattack, then start pounding
the next set of Iraqi ground formations, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's pace would also be dictated by the weakness and
inexperience of opposition units. Because Iraqi targets and combat
formations would have to be kept suppressed and dispersed for
months, the air campaign in question would probably require 80,000
to 100,000 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is best unproven and at worst foolish to argue that
U.S. airpower could eliminate Iraqi ground forces and enable an
opposition army to march on Baghdad virtually unopposed.

<P>
   Four decades ago a Third World dictator threatened American
interests in a crucial region. Unwilling to pay the costs of an
invasion or settle for containment, U.S. policymakers convinced
themselves that a cheap and easy third option existed: support for
some of the dictator's domestic opponents, whose efforts would
supposedly spark a popular uprising and topple the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting invasion attempt by Cuban exiles at the Bay of
Pigs turned into one of the worst fiascoes in the history of
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently _ perhaps incredibly _ one of the hottest
foreign-policy ideas in Washington has been to use the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From congressional leaders to former government officials, this
option _ to ``roll back'' the power of Saddam Hussein by supporting
opposition groups within Iraq, has been touted as the way to go.
From the pages of The Weekly Standard, National Review and
Commentary to The New Republic and columnists at The New York
Times, The Washington Post and The Nation, support for the Iraqi
opposition has become the leading alternative to the Clinton
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   One recent letter urging the president to back Saddam's foes
more strongly was signed by three former Republican national
security advisers, three former Republican secretaries of defense,
and seven former Republican subcabinet officials. Yet another
prominent supporter of the idea has been Clinton's first CIA
director, R. James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in October Congress even rushed to embrace an Iraq
Liberation Act, authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid
to democratic Iraqi resistance groups. The president's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the option is simple: The United States
should refuse to accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and
help install the Iraqi opposition in his place.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) put it, ``The
doctrine here has to be rollback, not containment.''
</P>
<P>
   In The New Republic, former Under-Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz wrote, ``Toppling Saddam is the only outcome that can
satisfy the vital U.S. interest in a stable and secure Gulf region,
because, to a degree unique among contemporary tyrannies, the Iraqi
regime is Saddam Hussein. ... The vast majority of Iraqis want him
out, though only those with a death wish say so openly. We must
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that Saddam could supposedly be replaced at
relatively low cost _ even, many advocates argue, without ever
committing American ground troops. The world could be free of
Saddam, Wolfowitz argued in recent testimony before Congress, if
the Clinton administration would only ``muster the necessary
strength of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly in the ointment is that this is simply not true. Even if
mere ``rollback'' were desirable, any policy to bolster a
successful attack by the Iraqi opposition would have to be
militarily feasible, amenable to American allies whose cooperation
would be required for implementation, and acceptable to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tout this prescription as superior to existing U.S.
policy are either engaging in wishful thinking or cynically playing
politics. For the United States to undertake a policy of rollback
in Iraq _ using any of already stated plans, at least _ would be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression sometimes given by backers of the
Iraqi opposition, there is no single, simple rollback plan.
Instead, three competing variants of the idea have been put
forward: using airpower to oust Saddam, helping the opposition
seize large chunks of Iraq or sponsoring a guerrilla war by his
foes.
</P>
<P>
   In the airpower approach, the United States would team up with
the Iraqi opposition for a decisive military campaign against the
regime. The problem here is that almost all the heavy lifting would
be done by the United States, which would incur huge costs without
being assured of success in return.
</P>
<P>
   It would be undertaken after the United States had helped the
Iraqi opposition recruit, train and equip tens of thousands of
soldiers for limited conventional warfare. Ultimately, when this
opposition army was ready to take the field, the United States
would launch an air offensive against Saddam's forces to devastate
Iraqi combat formations, logistics, command and control, and
rear-echelon positions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require the opposition to capture Iraq's cities
from the regime's armed forces. Opposition troops would have to
fight these battles largely on their own, because it would be
difficult for U.S. planes and missiles to destroy Iraqi ground
units hiding in the concrete jungles of modern cities and because,
in order to limit civilian casualties, U.S. rules of engagement
would prohibit bombing urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even battered Republican Guard divisions would be too much
for the weak opposition forces to handle in urban combat. Saddam's
foes would probably lose on the ground even if the United States
were to devote a massive air campaign to aiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the approach might lead Saddam to unleash his chemical
and biological weapons _ his jealously guarded ace in the hole _
against the United States and its Middle Eastern allies. Saddam was
never close enough to being toppled during the Gulf War to use
these weapons of last resort. Slowly pushing him to the wall would
give him every reason to lash out with his arsenal, while removing
all incentives for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, in short, would involve fighting a preventive war
against Iraq from a standing start but using opposition troops
instead of U.S. ground forces. Its costs and risks would make it an
extremely grave and unpopular endeavor, even if it were sold as a
way to settle the problem of Saddam once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the opposition might well lose, leaving the

<P>
   In Washington recently, three separate plans have been advanced
by which the U.S. armed forces would support Iraqi opposition
groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein. One of these
unwise ideas is called the ``enclave option.''
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents argue that the United States essentially would
help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi National
Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq, from
which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, however, is militarily ludicrous and would almost
certainly end in either direct American intervention or a massive
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave approach calls for the United States to declare the
rebel group, INC, as the legitimate government of Iraq, provide it
with the Iraqi regime's frozen assets, and help it recruit, train
and equip a highly mobile light infantry force of 10,000 to 20,000
troops, most of whom would be former Iraqi military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   These forces would then invade and occupy Iraqi Kurdistan, in
the country's north, and all of Iraq west of the Euphrates River
and south of the 32nd parallel, which would collectively be
declared ``Free Iraq.'' The United States would lift economic
sanctions on these zones and use airpower to help defend them from
Iraqi counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a haven for defectors and reducing Saddam's area of
control to the Mesopotamian river valleys, Baghdad and some of the
northwest, the INC argues, this strategy would either make the
Iraqi regime disintegrate or leave it vulnerable to an independent
rebel military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The INC has suggested that the entire operation would cost
little, take only a year or two and require such scant direct U.S.
military involvement that there would be almost no risk of
substantial American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the INC's president, Ahmed Chalabi, told a Senate hearing
last spring, ``Give the Iraqi National Congress a base protected
from Saddam's tanks, give us the temporary support we need to feed
and house and care for the liberated population, and we will give
you a free Iraq, an Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, and a
free-market Iraq. Best of all, the INC will do all this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan promises a huge payoff at a tiny cost, it has
unsurprisingly become the darling of Congress and critics of the
Clinton administration. It could well become popular with the
American public too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it
would lead inexorably to a replay of the Bay of Pigs. U.S.
officials would ultimately face the choice of intervening directly
or watching the rebels get butchered _ as happened with the INC's
last attempt to spark an insurrection, in northern Iraq from 1992
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East Institute's Andrew Parasiliti has observed,
``the INC enjoys more support along the Potomac than the
Euphrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the opposition's combat power comes from
two Kurdish militias operating in the north, Massud Barzani's
Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and one Shiite militia operating in the
south, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has its own agenda, and all have distanced themselves
from the umbrella organization. The leaders of all three groups
have said they are willing to coordinate their efforts but will not
follow the lead of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Internal opposition squabbling aside, America's regional allies
hate the plan. The Kuwaitis, Saudis, Jordanians and Turks adamantly
oppose all rollback efforts that do not include the direct use of
U.S. military power to ensure victory, fearing that half-hearted
efforts will fail and leave them facing Saddam's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that this plan is not just militarily
infeasible but downright dangerous. Even if one believes that
Kurdish forces alone, say, could hold the north, the plan still
would require some 10,000 to 20,000 lightly armed opposition troops
to control roughly 1,000 kilometers of land inside southern and
western Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This is an absurd force-to-space ratio. In contrast, U.S. Army
doctrine calls for a 20,000-man armored division to defend no more
than 15 to 35 kilometers of front.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the entire regular Iraqi army were to just remain
passive _ which has not been the case over the last eight years _
opposition troops would still face attacks from Saddam's 70,000-man
Republican Guard and 25,000-man Special Republican Guard. They
would have to hold vast stretches of territory without armor and at
a five-to-one numerical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a strategy of defending enclaves inside Iraq cedes the
initiative to Saddam once the opposition forces reach the Euphrates
and the 32nd parallel, letting him choose the time and place of
subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. air support could not protect the opposition troops
because Iraqi attacks could come during bad weather or simply at
night, when the U.S. ability to interdict ground troops is greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The United States simply does not have enough all-weather strike
aircraft to keep enough warplanes in the Persian Gulf to respond
instantaneously to regime attacks on opposition units inside Iraq
for the months and perhaps years that it would take to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Iraq is also particularly ill suited to this kind of
insurrection. The south's open desert terrain would be ideal for
Iraqi armored operations, and the area southwest of the Euphrates
is extremely sparsely populated. New opposition recruits would have
to come from Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, which Saddam would
be certain to defend furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Saddam could muster 10,000 to 15,000 loyal troops in
Basra's defense _ and remembering that U.S. air support would be of
limited help in urban operations, because of the doctrine to limit
civilian casualties _ Basra poses an insurmountable obstacle. A
tiny Iraqi rebel army could not survive without taking it but would
almost certainly be destroyed if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   For this enclave approach to have even a remote chance of
success, one of two assumptions would have to prove correct: that
the Iraqi regime and its armed forces would simply fall apart when
presented with a serious challenge, or that a few inexperienced
opposition light infantry brigades could somehow rise up to defeat
several Iraqi heavy divisions in open combat. Both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Iraq's armed forces were subjected to 39
days of incessant bombing, leaving them thoroughly demoralized. But
during the ground war, key units like the Republican Guard still
fought extraordinarily hard. These troops would fight once more
against the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the Iraqi rebels' military track record to date.
At Basra and Kirkuk in 1991 and again at Irbil in 1996, Iraqi army
and Republican Guard units easily crushed dug-in rebel Kurdish and
Shiite light infantry. The only opposition success came against the
Iraqi 38th Infantry Division _ the worst formation in the Iraqi
army, and at a time when that unit was demoralized, depleted,
surprised and without much armor or artillery support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INC bravely claims that it could emulate the success
of Chad in 1986-87, whose rebel forces smashed Libyan armored
power. But the Chadian army was made up of battle-hardened veterans
who had fought together for years and developed a high degree of
unit cohesion. Its military leadership was superb. And the enemy
Libyan army in 1986 was one of the most inept on earth.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly first-rate, the Iraqi army is more professional,
more experienced and better trained. And the combined Iraqi
opposition has no military organization at all. If the past is any
guide, it probably could not field a competent force even if given
years to train and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The INC leadership has shown little flair for field command,
identifying competent leaders, or honing their command skills. And
the finest soldiers the Iraqi opposition could boast would be Iraqi
army defectors, collected in dribs and drabs, and then thrown
together with political dissidents, tribesmen, intellectuals and
other opponents of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Such men are unlikely to suddenly discover a capability for
maneuver warfare that they heretofore utterly lacked. Worst of all,
many of these turncoats would be Saddam's spies, who would help
scuttle this bid to oust him just as informants have destroyed
every past opposition effort to do so. Clearly, relying on the
INC's battlefield prowess would be the mother of all mistakes.

you a free Iraq, an Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, and a
free-market Iraq. Best of all, the INC will do all this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan promises a huge payoff at a tiny cost, it has
unsurprisingly become the darling of Congress and critics of the
Clinton administration. It could well become popular with the
American public too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it
would lead inexorably to a replay of the Bay of Pigs. U.S.
officials would ultimately face the choice of intervening directly
or watching the rebels get butchered _ as happened with the INC's
last attempt to spark an insurrection, in northern Iraq from 1992
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East Institute's Andrew Parasiliti has observed,
``the INC enjoys more support along the Potomac than the
Euphrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the opposition's combat power comes from
two Kurdish militias operating in the north, Massud Barzani's
Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and one Shiite militia operating in the
south, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has its own agenda, and all have distanced themselves
from the umbrella organization. The leaders of all three groups
have said they are willing to coordinate their efforts but will not
follow the lead of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Internal opposition squabbling aside, America's regional allies
hate the plan. The Kuwaitis, Saudis, Jordanians and Turks adamantly
oppose all rollback efforts that do not include the direct use of
U.S. military power to ensure victory, fearing that half-hearted
efforts will fail and leave them facing Saddam's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that this plan is not just militarily
infeasible but downright dangerous. Even if one believes that
Kurdish forces alone, say, could hold the north, the plan still
would require some 10,000 to 20,000 lightly armed opposition troops
to control roughly 1,000 kilometers of land inside southern and
western Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This is an absurd force-to-space ratio. In contrast, U.S. Army
doctrine calls for a 20,000-man armored division to defend no more
than 15 to 35 kilometers of front.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the entire regular Iraqi army were to just remain
passive _ which has not been the case over the last eight years _
opposition troops would still face attacks from Saddam's 70,000-man
Republican Guard and 25,000-man Special Republican Guard. They
would have to hold vast stretches of territory without armor and at
a five-to-one numerical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a strategy of defending enclaves inside Iraq cedes the
initiative to Saddam once the opposition forces reach the Euphrates
and the 32nd parallel, letting him choose the time and place of
subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. air support could not protect the opposition troops
because Iraqi attacks could come during bad weather or simply at
night, when the U.S. ability to interdict ground troops is greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The United States simply does not have enough all-weather strike
aircraft to keep enough warplanes in the Persian Gulf to respond
instantaneously to regime attacks on opposition units inside Iraq
for the months and perhaps years that it would take to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Iraq is also particularly ill suited to this kind of
insurrection. The south's open desert terrain would be ideal for
Iraqi armored operations, and the area southwest of the Euphrates
is extremely sparsely populated. New opposition recruits would have
to come from Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, which Saddam would
be certain to defend furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Saddam could muster 10,000 to 15,000 loyal troops in
Basra's defense _ and remembering that U.S. air support would be of
limited help in urban operations, because of the doctrine to limit
civilian casualties _ Basra poses an insurmountable obstacle. A
tiny Iraqi rebel army could not survive without taking it but would
almost certainly be destroyed if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   For this enclave approach to have even a remote chance of
success, one of two assumptions would have to prove correct: that
the Iraqi regime and its armed forces would simply fall apart when
presented with a serious challenge, or that a few inexperienced
opposition light infantry brigades could somehow rise up to defeat
several Iraqi heavy divisions in open combat. Both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Iraq's armed forces were subjected to 39
days of incessant bombing, leaving them thoroughly demoralized. But
during the ground war, key units like the Republican Guard still
fought extraordinarily hard. These troops would fight once more
against the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the Iraqi rebels' military track record to date.
At Basra and Kirkuk in 1991 and again at Irbil in 1996, Iraqi army
and Republican Guard units easily crushed dug-in rebel Kurdish and
Shiite light infantry. The only opposition success came against the
Iraqi 38th Infantry Division _ the worst formation in the Iraqi
army, and at a time when that unit was demoralized, depleted,
surprised and without much armor or artillery support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INC bravely claims that it could emulate the success
of Chad in 1986-87, whose rebel forces smashed Libyan armored
power. But the Chadian army was made up of battle-hardened veterans
who had fought together for years and developed a high degree of
unit cohesion. Its military leadership was superb. And the enemy
Libyan army in 1986 was one of the most inept on earth.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly first-rate, the Iraqi army is more professional,
more experienced and better trained. And the combined Iraqi
opposition has no military organization at all. If the past is any
guide, it probably could not field a competent force even if given
years to train and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The INC leadership has shown little flair for field command,
identifying competent leaders, or honing their command skills. And
the finest soldiers the Iraqi opposition could boast would be Iraqi
army defectors, collected in dribs and drabs, and then thrown
together with political dissidents, tribesmen, intellectuals and
other opponents of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Such men are unlikely to suddenly discover a capability for
maneuver warfare that they heretofore utterly lacked. Worst of all,
many of these turncoats would be Saddam's spies, who would help
scuttle this bid to oust him just as informants have destroyed
every past opposition effort to do so. Clearly, relying on the
INC's battlefield prowess would be the mother of all mistakes.

   Proponents of toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq have
advanced an option known as ``the Afghan approach.'' They argue
that the United States could simply help the Iraqi opposition mount
an insurgency on the model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan
Contras or the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that one key to successful guerrilla
war is a friendly neighboring country willing to provide the
insurgents with a secure base _ and none of Iraq's neighbors are
viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan approach calls for the United States to help the
Iraqi opposition establish a safe haven next to the theater of
operations. It would then recruit, train and equip a force that can
conduct a guerrilla insurgency against Saddam's regime. Guerrilla
warfare is the strategy of the weak, who can win only by slowly
wearing down their opponents' strength while slowly building up
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao's classic three-step approach _ start on the
defensive, force a stalemate, then go on the offensive _ the
opposition would start small and avoid conventional battles with
the Iraqi army until the rebels had a good chance of winning. After
many years, the insurgents would topple Saddam's regime and gain
control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   One can surely surmise that this plan, which requires only a
modest commitment of outside resources and no risk of substantial
American casualties, would be acceptable to the United States,
where it could be sold to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the Afghan plan is unacceptable to U.S.
regional allies, and their cooperation would be needed for it to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Successful guerrilla insurgencies require a secure rear area
where the rebels can train new recruits, shelter dependents, care
for their wounded, stockpile weapons and supplies, prepare for new
operations, and retreat and regroup in the face of government
offensives.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan played this role for the Afghan mujahideen, Honduras
did so for the Nicaraguan Contras, South Africa for UNITA, China
and later North Vietnam for the Viet Cong and so on. But no country
on Iraq's borders will host the opposition today. None of them is
prepared to live in a state of open warfare with Iraq for as long
as the rebellion takes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to prove _ most of the candidates for the job can
be dealt with quickly. Saudi officials have repeatedly stated that
they are not willing to go to war with Iraq indefinitely. Besides,
the Saudi territory bordering Iraq is sparsely populated desert _
awful terrain for mounting an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, while eager to see Saddam go, is also chary about a
long-term state of belligerency _ and also has uninhabited desert
on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which supported past measures to overthrow Saddam, has
consistently balked at allowing direct military moves against Iraq
from its territory, and it too has a vast unpopulated desert on its
Iraqi frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was always only a half-hearted member of the anti-Saddam
coalition and has never been willing to participate in direct
military operations against Iraq, even during the Persian Gulf War.
It too has mostly uninhabited desert on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only two plausible candidates, Turkey and Iran.
Turkey is certainly geographically suitable; the Turkish-Iraqi
border area consists of forested mountains and is well populated.
Unfortunately, the Turks have removed themselves from the running
because they know that any anti-Saddam insurgency based in Turkey
and northern Iraq would center around the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ankara worries that supporting such an insurrection would fuel
Kurdish political aspirations in general and embolden its own
Kurdish rebels. Despite repeated pleas from U.S. officials, the
Turks actually prefer to keep Saddam Hussein in power and have even
favored his efforts to reassert control over Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the final possibility, is the ideal staging ground for an
Iraqi insurgency. Indeed, it has sponsored both Kurdish and Shiite
guerrillas over the last four decades. Iran's border with Iraq runs
through abundant mountains, hills, forests and swamps; many
communities actually straddle the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since the United States and Iran are barely on speaking
terms these days, getting them to cooperate in sponsoring an
anti-Saddam insurgency would pose a formidable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems with the Afghan approach stem from the lengthy
time frame it would take to work. First, a long, drawn-out
guerrilla war in Iraq would eventually stick in the craw of world
opinion. The United States would find itself increasingly isolated
at the United Nations and elsewhere, which would affect other
foreign-policy issues _ including maintaining the sort of sanctions
and inspection regimes that keep Saddam relatively weak and
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this plan might eventually get rid of Saddam, but it
says nothing about how to manage the challenge he poses in the
present and foreseeable future. By embracing the Afghan approach,
the United States could easily find itself stuck in a couple of
years with a rebellion still in its larval stage and a resuscitated
Iraq increasingly free from international restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even if the Afghan approach succeeded, it might open up
a Pandora's box of new troubles. Destabilizing Saddam is not the
same as installing a pro-U.S. government in Baghdad. Instability in
Iraq could eventually lead to a military or security-service coup,
but this would not necessarily help the Iraqi National Congress,
the country's umbrella opposition group, or any other pro-Western
group gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iraq might even collapse into civil war. The result of
an Afghan-like insurgency, in other words, could be an Afghan-like
descent into chaos.

 Lost and Found

<TEXT>
<P>
   An identity crisis is part of many American lives. But whether
the quest for self comes at 14 or 40, the average person can depend
upon a few unshakable facts, like her name and the names of her
siblings. Sarah Saffian assumed she knew these basics about
herself. Adopted at birth, the daughter of Marvin and Kathy
Saffian, sister to Max and Rachel, Saffian planned to research her
origins someday, but hadn't got around to it before the telephone
rang one morning when she was 23. ``Sarah, my name is Hannah
Morgan,'' the caller said. ``I think I'm your birth mother.''
</P>
<P>
   That happens on the first page of ``Ithaka,'' a multilayered
memoir that probes profound questions of identity. This is not a
typical story of a birth mother and child reuniting -- if such a
story exists. For openers, most adoptees choose to find their birth
parents, not the other way around. The difference meant that
Saffian had no control over whether she wished to make contact; it
was done for her.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few minutes, Saffian learned that not only her
birth mother but an entire biological family had found her. Her
birth parents, Hannah Morgan and Adam Leyder, were unmarried when
they gave Saffian up for adoption. But they later married and bore
three additional children, Saffian's full siblings. Saffian
responded to this stunning news with some of her own: Her adoptive
mother, Nancy, had died when Saffian was only 6. Kathy, her
stepmother, had filled Nancy's place.
</P>
<P>
   Saffian explores this complicated material in beautifully
nuanced prose to create a book that grows richer page by page. It
chronicles a three-year correspondence with her birth parents, as
Saffian tries to decide if she will ever be ready to meet them or
even talk with them again by phone. The story shifts from present
to past and back, giving readers a sense of the tension Saffian
felt as she struggled to place her birth family in her world --
indeed, as she tries to discover where her world might be.
</P>
<P>
   Through letters she learns the most intimate details of her
birth parents' early lives, including their disagreements about
whether to keep their child. Perhaps because of Leyder's own
traumatic background -- his parents died when he was very young,
leaving him to be raised by family friends -- he was much more
overbearing than his wife in pressing Saffian for a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Both birth parents talked about how much they love and take
pride in Saffian, sentiments she appreciated but questioned. How
could these strangers say they love her when they last saw her as
an infant and have little knowledge of the person she is now? At
the same time, she wondered how they have influenced her through
the unbreakable bond of biology. Her personality traits, her
interests, her way of approaching the world -- how much of that is
genetic?
</P>
<P>
   As Saffian's sense of identity splintered, even her name became
open to question. She discovered that in a surreal quirk of
bureaucracy she exists only under her birth name, Susan Morgan, in
the Birth Record at the New York Public Library. At the Bureau of
Vital Statistics, where birth certificates are kept, she exists
only as Sarah Saffian.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual story hardly insures a great memoir. But Saffian
selects language with finesse, creating images that deepen the
story. Her book's strong rhythm and pacing, particularly its
provocative chapter endings, keep the reader engaged. The only
section that falters is ``Origin,'' Saffian's embarrassing fantasy
of herself in the womb. Even in a personal account, there is such a
thing as too much intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   One could also question her brashness in comparing herself to
Odysseus, who took 10 years to reach his homeland, Ithaca,
following the Trojan War. Given the complexities of her story, the
allusion is reasonable if a bit excessive. Saffian succeeds in
making the reader care about her journey, and her conclusion
suggests she reached where she hoped to go. It is surely no
accident that the last word of the text is ``whole.''

  By Marilyn Stasio 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let the down-home charms of Margaret Maron's Southern
mysteries con you with their coziness. Behind their honeyed
accents, the friendly characters in HOME FIRES (Mysterious
Press/Warner, $22) have plenty of secrets to hide and grudges to
settle. Even Deborah Knott, the fair-minded circuit court judge who
knows all the clan issues in the backwoods of North Carolina, where
she dispenses justice, has to remind herself that race and religion
have a way of changing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desegregation's been a real mixed bag down here,'' Deborah
acknowledges. ``Took away some of the old sore spots, brought in a
bunch of new ones.'' But when someone starts burning down black
churches and her own rowdy nephew is implicated, the judge realizes
the issues go deeper than she thought. Even among her own kith and
kin, the old ``ain't-no-racists-here'' protestations won't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what Maron manages to pack into the whodunit
format: soft-focus scenes of a country summer, witty descriptions
of fractious families and feuding neighbors, and wonderful
anecdotes about the legendary locals who can dowse a well and talk
the warts off your hand. All that, plus a keen understanding of the
ambiguities of race relations in the rural South and pointed
character insights that nail the sinners but leave them enough
dignity to stand up in church on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Joh Rowland's latest period novel, THE CONCUBINE'S TATTOO
(St. Martin's, $23.95), makes me wonder: Would any well-bred
20-year-old bride of a high-ranking official in the court of a
17th-century Japanese shogun 1) refuse to perform the domestic
duties for which she has been trained; 2) demand that her husband,
the shogun's ``most honorable investigator of events, situations
and people,'' allow her to investigate a murder; or 3) express
herself in the tone of a modern woman? (``I'm educated; I can read
and write as well as any man. . . . You think I'm weak and stupid
because I'm a woman. . . . I'd rather die than submit to you or any
other man!'') Offhand, I would say, not in a million years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lady Reiko's contemporary sensibility and anachronistic
manner, Sano Ichiro's new wife does a pretty job of spying in the
palace quarters where the shogun's favorite concubine has been
poisoned ingeniously, with the ink she mixed for a tattoo. Rowland
has a painter's eye for the minutiae of court life, as well as a
politician's ear for intrigue, so the sleuthing is conducted amid
sumptuous scenes of imperial excess and under the watch of
imperious villains. Although some characters get lost in this
panoply of settings, which include a puppet theater, a morgue and a
martial arts academy, everyone (especially those who are not to be
trusted) is beautifully dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Fairchild, the amateur sleuth in The Body in the Bookcase
(Morrow, $22) and earlier mysteries by Katherine Hall Page, is so
perfect you want to go for your gun. A classic blonde with a nice
figure and a successful catering business (she shares her recipes,
of course), Faith has a perfect husband (a minister, no less), two
perfect children (well-behaved, naturally) and a lovely home in
Aleford, one of those picture-perfect Massachusetts towns where it
never rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel as if I'm living in a Currier &AMP; Ives
calendar,'' says Faith, whose saving grace is her good-natured
refusal to take herself too seriously. It isn't her sense of humor,
though, but a burst of outrage that jolts her into action for this
smartly executed excursion into the shady side of the antiques
trade. When an elderly librarian dies during a house burglary,
Faith is horrified; and when the thieves hit the parsonage, making
off with her own family heirlooms, she goes into attack mode.
``Aleford had been violated'' is her battle cry as she tears
through New England towns quaint and cruddy, searching pawnshops,
auction houses and dealers' markets for her lost treasures.
Although the master thief is too close to home to make the
conclusion believable, this undercover look at the dark side of the
antiques trade turns up all kinds of inside dope sure to fascinate
-- and infuriate -- paranoid property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter was setting in,'' Skye Kathleen Moody tells us in
WILDCRAFTERS (St. Martin's, $23.95), ``and in Toleak, Wash., winter
is a dank, still, deeply melancholy time.'' Still, it is a great
time for spinning tall tales about the half-human, half-elk monster
the Indians call ``the Unknown.'' When an Indian child goes missing
from the Bogachiel National Wildlife Preserve and his frantic
parents see elk hooves in the snow, one thinks, Uh-oh, it's that
darned Unknown, all right. But Moody, who is after bigger game,
grafts the regional folk legend to a more disturbing environmental
story about the ``wildcrafters'' who roam the rain forest,
illegally harvesting devil's club and valerian root -- and poaching
forbidden species of wildlife -- to supply the $5 billion market
for antiaging products. Moody makes a chilling case for the impact
of the ``Fountain of Youth'' industry on the ecosystem; but in
these wild and gorgeous settings, I still tend to go for the
Unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that Gail Bowen is such a stodgy writer, because
she does a couple of remarkable things in her new Joanne Kilbourn
mystery, VERDICT IN BLOOD (McClelland &AMP; Stewart, $20.95). For one
thing, she presents us with the appealing portrait of an amateur
sleuth who is neither young and improbably perky nor old and
absurdly feisty. Joanne, who is ``past 50'' and a grandmother,
teaches political science in Regina, Saskatchewan, and is raising
two adopted children. She's no ball of fire, but she's very real.
So are her adopted children, her Indian boyfriend and his troubled
nephew and an 83-year-old houseguest from Saskatoon whose holiday
visit is wrecked when her friend is beaten to death in a public
park. Joanne's investigation of the murder is less than inspired;
but Bowen writes so unaffectedly about unromantic matters -- the
lives of older characters, their extended families and
nontraditional domestic arrangements -- that it's worth tagging
along.

UNCOLLECTING CHEEVER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Family of John Cheever vs. Academy Chicago Publishers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Anita Miller &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 363 pp. Lanham, Md.: Rowman &AMP; Littlefield
Publishers. $27.95 &QL; 
 &UR; -------- &QL; 
 &UR; The 5:48 Is Canceled &QL; 
 &UR; By Richard Dooling &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After a mere 12 years on the bench, Learned Hand, a Federal
judge whose influence was so great that he was sometimes called the
``10th justice'' of the Supreme Court, reportedly said, ``As a
litigant I should dread a lawsuit beyond almost anything else short
of sickness and death.'' Reading ``Uncollecting Cheever,'' by Anita
Miller _ a tale of litigious woe _ it's easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a small publisher, Academy Chicago, signed a contract
with John Cheever's widow, Mary, for the right to publish an
unspecified number of hitherto uncollected short stories. It paid
an advance of $1,500 against royalties. Half the advance and
royalties were to go to Franklin Dennis, the publisher's
representative who had approached the Cheevers with the idea.
Instead of a book of 68 Cheever short stories (which Academy
Chicago thought of as a companion to the 1978 edition of ``The
Stories of John Cheever'' issued by Alfred A. Knopf), the
ill-defined terms of the publisher's contract produced four years
of litigation, four court judgments, legal fees of over $1 million
and, finally, a book of 13 Cheever stories already in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the publishing world will recall reading about the
interminable lawsuits or being called as witnesses or being asked
to write articles on behalf of one side or the other. Law students
and legislators will learn a lot from ``Uncollecting Cheever''
about the mortal perils of careless drafting. Lawyers and veteran
litigants will not be surprised to learn that the legal dispute
brought out the worst in everyone connected with it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest weakness of the book is also its main attraction _
the litigant-author. Anita Miller and her husband, Jordan, were the
owners, operators and editors of Academy Chicago. Unlike other
prodigious nonfiction anatomies of pitched legal battles,
``Uncollecting Cheever'' vividly shows us what acrimonious civil
litigation looks like from the perspective of the acrimonious
litigant: Exhibit A in a kind of Caine Mutiny of the author's
sanity induced by years of legal warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Miller inventories and catalogues all the foibles and
shortcomings of her adversaries, every slight she or her enterprise
received from the Cheevers and their media sympathizers, their
lawyers and the judges who ruled against her. All the petty,
lawyerly behavior of opposing counsel is set forth, seasoned with
the helpless outrage of the losing side, whose own lawyer lacked
legal authority or a sound contract to administer direct
chastisement to the adversaries. The book is at its weakest when it
merely summarizes the depositions of the major players _ Mary
Cheever, her daughter, Susan, and her son Ben _ and filters
excerpts of their testimony through the manifestly strabismic eye
of Anita Miller.
</P>
<P>
   She and her publisher take pains to position this book in part
as the story of a small publishing house struggling against the
corporate, big-money, big-book mentality of East Coast publishers.
The Cheevers were advised by people like the literary agent Andrew
Wylie (described in quotations Miller takes from Vanity Fair as
grasping and avaricious) and Martin Garbus, the renowned First
Amendment lawyer who zealously, and therefore despicably,
represented them. Garbus said materialistic things to Miller like
``You won't sell as many books as Random House.'' He called
witnesses like Robert Gottlieb, the former head of Knopf. But
ultimately Academy Chicago was litigating not with those people but
with the Cheever family, who (horrors!) thought they could make
more money if these stories were published by a major publisher and
who probably matched their adversaries in legal fees for the
pleasure of venting spleen and winning lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Studs Terkel says in a blurb on the jacket, this
book does not read like ``a case of a small press bullied into
defeat.'' It sounds more like the tale of a small publisher that
carelessly drafted an important contract (without consulting a
lawyer) and the family of a renowned author who foolishly signed it
(without consulting a lawyer). Then both parties called in lawyers
and fought for four years to best each other in a species of combat
that differs from violence only insofar as there is usually no
bloodshed in litigation. Perhaps both sides now appreciate
Voltaire's observation: ``I was never ruined but twice, once when I
lost a lawsuit and once when I won one.''
</P>
<P>
   In her perceived role as a victim of injustice, Miller urges
that there was nothing unusual about this contract and that the
court decisions against Academy Chicago threaten all authors and
publishers. But most publishing contracts are with living authors,
and the dimensions of the manuscript are expressed by estimating
the number of words. Here the contract named Mary Cheever and
Franklin Dennis as ``author'' of ``The Uncollected Stories of John
Cheever'' with nothing said about number of pages or number of
stories. True, after the litigants presented four courts with their
dispute, Miller correctly observes that the court decisions
``invaded the traditional relationship between publisher and
author.'' But isn't that what the parties paid their lawyers a
million dollars to obtain?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately we can't say if these opinions will invade the
relationship of other authors and publishers; the opinions are not
in this volume, presumably because the judges made the mistake of
unanimously ruling against Academy Chicago. Miller scrupulously
chronicles every letter, comment and fact favoring her right to
publish 68 Cheever stories for a $1,500 advance. But she denies us
the opportunity to see for ourselves what four different courts _
including the Illinois Supreme Court _ said about her case when
they ruled against her and Academy Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of including the opinions in an appendix or quoting them
at length and perhaps analyzing their shortcomings, Miller simply
complains about the rulings, or relates how one of the Illinois
appellate judges nodded off during oral arguments, or how James
Heiple, the Illinois Supreme Court Justice who wrote the court's
opinion voiding Academy Chicago's contract with the Cheevers, later
resigned as Chief Justice after being censured for trying to use
his position to escape traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we are served endless passages chronicling the
helplessness of courts when it comes to resolving the intractable
rancor of committed legal adversaries. Judges who preside over
divorce disputes and custody battles will recognize the sort of
litigants who schedule a hearing to divide evenly seven Bruce
Springsteen albums. In the context of the Cheever litigation, we
find judges attempting to resolve the parties' differences about
how many pages the collection should contain. The two sides had
used totally different ways of estimating word counts per page in
different hearings, and a Chicago judge, Roger Kiley, found serious
inconsistencies when he wrote an order specifying the size of the
book that was not to be. ``I dealt with the evidence I had,'' Kiley
said. ``I couldn't read anything into it.'' Academy Chicago's
lawyer said the judge was ``off 36 pages on my estimation.'' He
could have said 180 pages, Kiley said, or 230. He was just trying
to fix what he thought ``was a fair refinement on a difficult
concept,'' intending that the ``parties wouldn't use it as a device
to incorporate in their adversarial positions, but would actually
use it to solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A fter treating us to the minutiae of other squabbles over line
spacing, margins and whether a piece is a story or a ``sketch,''
``Uncollecting Cheever'' becomes a pathetic case study of the
insidious effects of litigation on the human psyche. Think of
``Bleak House'' as narrated not by Dickens, but by one of the
suitors of the endless fictional quagmire of Jarndyce v. Jarndyce.
By the time it's over, the reader keenly appreciates how one must,
at all costs, ``keep out of Chancery. . . . It's being ground to
bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow fire; it's being
stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by drops; it's
going mad by grains.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the notable publishing figures featured in ``Uncollecting
Cheever,'' perhaps the literary agent Lynn Nesbit proved on
hindsight to be the most perspicacious. When confronted with the
dispute and the Academy Chicago contract, which had reportedly been
vetted by one of her underlings and signed by Mary Cheever _ a
contract, which, if enforced, would have allowed Nesbit and her
agency to receive a percentage of the profits from this book _
Nesbit said: ``I'm not going to get embroiled in a mess. I'll just
drop this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, if the litigants had been half so wise.

MISS NOBODY
</HEADLINE>
  By Tomek Tryzna 
 Translated by Joanna Trzeciak 
 296 pp. New York: Doubleday. $23 
 -------- 
 Into the Woods 
 By Brian Hall 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the opening scene of Tomek Tryzna's fearlessly ambitious
debut novel, ``Miss Nobody,'' his protagonist, Marysia Kawczak, a
15-year-old girl living in the final years of Communist Poland,
experiences her first period. Having thus symbolically discovered
adolescence, she clutches it and for the next 300 pages never lets
go.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a novel of character but a literary fairy tale, and
Tryzna lays down his scheme at the start. Marysia is at work in a
potato field _ we could think of it as a Polish avatar of the
Garden of Eden _ when she feels ``something very odd'' in her
stomach. Leaving the garden, she goes into nearby woods _ yes, they
are dark _ and has a confused vision involving a princess abducted
by ``ugly hairy monkeys'' dressed as men, and a beautiful young man
with a spear sprouting painfully from his belly, who begs her to
``grab it and pull.'' Disgust and fascination mingle within her as
the young man's blood mingles with the blood flowing down her leg.
</P>
<P>
   Next we learn that Marysia and her family must leave her village
of Jawiszow, a word carrying connotations of ``openness,'' to take
up residence in the nearby city of Walbrzych, whose German name,
Waldenburg, means ``forest city.'' The country girl is lost in the
urban landscape until she meets two schoolmates who will be her
Virgilian guides through this dark wood: Katarzyna Bogdanska,
familiarly called Kasia, and Eva Bogdaj. Most readers, one assumes,
would immediately notice the complementary surnames, but Tryzna
here, as in several places in his novel, belabors the point:
``Bogdanska and Bogdaj,'' Marysia muses. ``Strange. As if
everything went in pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   When fairy-tale characters are surprised by the fairy-tale
aspects of their lives, they are asking to be mistaken for real,
but with Marysia this is something we cannot do _ nor, I think, is
it Tryzna's intention that we do so. His book is highly colored,
emotionally stylized, stuffed tight with meaning and deliberately
two-dimensional. Since indeed everything in it comes in pairs, it
most resembles a painted diptych, whose form it embodies.
</P>
<P>
   Part 1 is the left panel, and its presiding genius is Marysia's
first guide, Kasia Bogdanska. Her surname derives from
``God-given,'' and she is ethereal and sickly, golden-haired, a
tormented musical prodigy, a genius in both senses. Her mother's
professional plaque on the apartment door identifies the daughter
as well: ``Internal Medicine Specialist.'' She is Spirit. The right
panel, Part 2, belongs to Eva Bogdaj, black-haired, beautiful,
superficial, concupiscent. Put a colon between her two names and
you get a line from a playscript about the Fall: ``Eve: God,
give!'' You are what you eat: she is the apple itself, all juicy
and tempting Flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Kasia and Eva hate each other. They vie for Marysia's
soul, as though whispering from her right and left shoulders. Both
are anti-Christian, or, more specifically in Poland, anti-Catholic.
Kasia's Spirit is not the Holy one but the anima, as in animism.
Unlike Marysia's mother, when Kasia loses a screwdriver she doesn't
pray to St. Anthony, whom she calls a ``monopolist,'' she prays to
the screwdriver. Thus she is a radical individualist who believes
that everyone is her own God, and her First Mover isn't the Father
or Fate but Freedom. Her efforts in Part 1 are directed toward
getting Marysia to cast off her religious chains.
</P>
<P>
   Kasia ultimately succeeds, and Part 2 describes Marysia's
hedonistic exploitation of her newfound freedom in the company of
Eva Bogdaj, whose rich family owns a country estate that amounts to
a pleasure dome of food, sex and consumer goods. The name of the
place derives from a traditional Polish soup, presumably the very
one they eat on Marysia's first visit, as though partaking, at the
entrance to the Dionysian grove, of an aphrodisiac. Dreams follow,
of snakes and ``stinky ponds,'' of fluorescent tubes and ashtrays.
The atmosphere of this hothouse is encapsulated in the line ``So we
sat hugging each other, until dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   One can read in all this a parable not merely of the
individual's journey from innocence to experience, or of the soul's
vacillation between spirit and the world, but also of Poland in the
last decade. Marysia re-enacts her country's transition from the
paradise, ironically conceived, of its twin safe houses of
Communism and Roman Catholicism into the materialist freedom, also
ironically conceived, of the West: a freedom that is not sunlit, as
the usual epithet would have it, but dusky (dark woods, Eva's black
hair), confusing and dangerous. Tryzna's freedom seems like
adolescence, like an endless forking of shadowed paths, like
turbulence leading toward something as unimaginable within the
confines of his novel as maturity is to a 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A fine novel could result from the fleshing out of this
skeleton, and Tryzna deserves credit for wiring it together. But
for the most part he clothes the bones in gauze and chintz. Fairy
tales for adults need either subtle ideas or fresh images. Part 1
is Tryzna's ``idea'' panel, and Kasia's teachings run to wheezing
apothegms along the lines of ``Happiness is being true to one's
self'' and ``We have one life and our moral obligation is to live
it according to our own inner nature.'' (Perhaps this sounds less
trite to Polish ears than to American ones.)
</P>
<P>
   Part 2 must skate on a bright, melting surface. We don't expect
ideas from Eva, we expect seduction. She does seduce Marysia, but
the language is too flat, Tryzna's eye too lazy, to corrupt the
reader. Tryzna straitjackets himself throughout in Marysia's anemic
voice, rendered into a shorn English by Joanna Trzeciak. Much of
this section reads like a banal soft-core tease _ when will the two
girls do it? _ with a lot of quickened breathing, moaning and
shivering. There is also a persistent element of sadomasochism that
signals not revelry at all but fastidiousness, a guilty conscience
(those stinky ponds, those ashtrays). Granted, this might have been
the point of the scheme, but it doesn't appear to be the point of
the narrative voice, which lingers hungrily over these passages in
a way that suggests we are to find them as arousing as the other
humid entanglements. I sensed at this point, and occasionally
elsewhere, a confusion of intent, a blurred vision.
</P>
<P>
   There is talent here, waiting for a more controlling hand. And
this novel will find its admirers because it _ like, for example,
``The Magus,'' by John Fowles, or Hermann Hesse's ``Demian'' _
enacts in its own voice and vision the adolescence of its
characters. Its view of the creative process, through Kasia's
musical composition, is an archromantic one, full of satanic
overtones, suffering, exhaustion, transfiguration. (She ought to
have a bust of Adrian Leverkuhn on her mantelpiece.)
Adolescentlike, the narrative touches frequently on large subjects
without risking any real comment on them: ``We talk about music and
philosophy until evening.'' When we do get philosophical details,
they tend to sound like these thoughts of Marysia's: ``It's warm,
the stars are shining. The earth seen from afar is a little star
just like they are. A little light in the darkness. That's what we
all are here, on this earth. Somehow I feel comfortable with that
thought.'' And this is toward the end of her spiritual journey.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, she's only 15. But I think _ and I have to add
``personally'' because I am of course aware of the immense
popularity of ``The Magus'' and ``Demian'' _ that what makes
adolescence interesting to an adult reader is the ways in which it
must eventually confront adulthood. That confrontation never
occurs. Marysia looks in every mirror she sees: ``I could stand
here and stand here and look at myself until the end of the
world.'' That she wants to is plausible. But that she is allowed to
-- that the narrative not only provides her with a succession of
admiring alter egos but itself mirrors her overcharged,
underinformed rhapsodies -- is an artistic failure.
</P>
<P>
   To take the careerlong view, however: ambition and fearlessness
in first novels should count for more than achievement. ``She
really knows how to talk about all this stuff very concretely, but
at the same time, you don't really know what it's all about. In the
end, you don't know anything but one thing: that it's all
wonderful.'' That is Marysia talking about Eva, but it sounds
equally like authorial pleading, hence a suspicion on Tryzna's part
that he can do better. This, plus his closing pages, which finally
cast doubt, albeit too late, on the soft solipsism that comes
before, are promising signs for his next effort.

 Southern Exposure: A roundup of books about Antartica  By Robert R. Harris 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spring of 1912 was not kind to the British Empire. On April
14, the Titanic met its fate with the ice in the North Atlantic.
Just a few weeks earlier, at the opposite end of the earth, Robert
Falcon Scott had met his, although word of his disaster didn't get
back to England until the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six years later, the popularity of tragedies involving
ice and death _ movies like ``Titanic'' and books like ``Into Thin
Air'' _ has led to renewed interest in what the British like to
call the heroic age of exploration, and specifically in the
expeditions led by Scott and Ernest Shackleton. The lucky result
for those who've long been fascinated by these polar journeys is
the publication of new books about Scott and Shackleton and the
reissuing of many others, some long out of print and hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The two new books are ``A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY: Robert Falcon
Scott and the Race to the South Pole'' (Houghton Mifflin, $25), by
Diana Preston, a British journalist, and ``THE ENDURANCE:
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition'' (Knopf, $29.95), by
Caroline Alexander, the guest curator of an exhibition of the same
name that will open next April at New York's American Museum of
Natural History (in association with which her book is published).
Together the books frame the story of the epic struggles to explore
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Shackleton first went south together on Scott's
Discovery expedition of 1901-4 (although all these forays to
Antarctica had long official titles, they are more popularly known
by the names of the ships the men traveled on). It proved to be an
unhappy match. In his recently reissued biography, ``SHACKLETON''
(Carroll &AMP; Graf, paper, $18.95), Roland Huntford notes that both
men were ``spectacularly inept and unprepared.'' Neither could ski
or drive the few sled dogs they had with them, and when they headed
toward the pole (man-hauling along with Edward Wilson, who later
perished with Scott), progress was excruciatingly slow. Relaying
for most of the 850 miles they journeyed, they barely crossed the
82d parallel and had to race death back to their ship. Both Scott
and Shackleton came away from the effort with a mistrust in the
usefulness of dogs in crossing the polar landscape _ a prejudice
that was to have profound consequences later _ and with an abiding
dislike, bordering on hatred, of each other.
</P>
<P>
   On the journey all three men suffered from scurvy. Shackleton
was the worst off. The facts are muddied, but it is clear that at
times he could not help pull; at one point he also rode on a sledge
in order to brake it. When the men returned to the Discovery, which
had been frozen in the ice, a relief ship was waiting. Scott, who
was staying another season, had Shackleton invalided home. When
Scott later published ``The Voyage of the 'Discovery,' '' he wrote
that Shackleton had been carried on a sledge _ twice _ but didn't
mention that he might have been on the sledge to slow it down. The
insult was too much for Shackleton, and the final spur to organize
his own expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton's 1907-9 Nimrod expedition was either a spectacular
success or a failure _ depending on whether you think it's better
to succeed and die or fail and live. Along with Frank Wild, Jameson
Boyd Adams and Eric Marshall, Shackleton crossed the 88th parallel
and got to within 100 miles of the pole, besting Scott's Furthest
South by 360 miles and making, in Huntford's words, ``the greatest
single leap forward to either pole of the earth that anyone had
ever achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   As Scott had done _ and was to do again _ Shackleton took ponies
on his trek, animals that are horribly unfit for polar travel (they
sink through the snow's crust, and all their food must be carried;
by contrast, dogs eat dogs). Had he known how to handle dogs,
Shackleton would surely have attained the pole. As it was, he might
have. The men were done in. They could have forced their way
through, but in all likelihood they would have died on the way
back. Within reach of his goal, Shackleton turned, and he and all
his men lived.
</P>
<P>
   Another success of the Nimrod expedition was the first journey
to the South Magnetic Pole (the one a compass actually points at,
as opposed to the point that marks the axis of the earth's
rotation), accomplished by an Australian, Douglas Mawson, and two
others. Mawson later led a team to the Antarctic on the Aurora
expedition of 1911-13, during which he embarked on his own epic
sledge journey, although he wasn't seeking the pole. Two companions
died, one disappearing into a crevasse, and Mawson tells the
dramatic tale in the excellent and until recently long out-of-print
memoir ``THE HOME OF THE BLIZZARD: A True Story of Antarctic
Survival'' (St. Martin's, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton returned from the Nimrod expedition a hero. Scott was
livid. Before Shackleton left England he had promised _ had been
forced to promise, really _ to stay clear of Scott's Discovery base
at McMurdo Sound. Ice conditions forced Shackleton to land there.
In Scott's view, he was a poacher. Still, the South Pole was up for
grabs, and Scott meant to take it. A Norwegian named Roald
Amundsen, who had just conquered the Northwest Passage, had other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the story of the subsequent race for the South Pole
has best been told in a book that has not been recently
republished. Roland Huntford's ``Scott and Amundsen'' is one of the
great debunking biographies. It was reissued in paperback in the
mid-1980's as ``The Last Place on Earth,'' the title changed to
match that of a television series based on the book and shown here
on Masterpiece Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Huntford devastates Scott's reputation, examining in detail
every plan, decision and action related to the expedition of
1910-13 with the whaler Terra Nova. It was on this journey, of
course, that Scott did reach the South Pole, only to find he had
been forestalled by Amundsen, who got there a month before him.
Scott and four other men died on the return trip: first, Edgar
Evans; then, Lawrence Edward Grace (Titus) Oates; finally, Scott,
Wilson and Henry Robertson (Birdie) Bowers starved and froze in
their tent in a blizzard just 11 miles from a depot of food. (Diane
Preston points out that had they averaged but 350 more yards a day,
they would have reached it.)
</P>
<P>
   After Evans died, Oates was badly racked by frostbite and scurvy
and was slowing the others down. It was his sacrifice, futile as it
turned out, that was immortalized by Scott in his posthumously
published diary, ``SCOTT'S LAST EXPEDITION: The Journals'' (Carroll
&AMP; Graf, paper, $14.95). ``It was blowing a blizzard,'' Scott wrote.
Oates said, '' 'I am just going outside and may be some time.' He
went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it happen that way? Scott, if nothing else, was a very good
writer, and the (heavily edited) account of his last expedition is
what made him a hero, the glorious failure who so captivated the
imagination of the waning British Empire. In fact, his writing is
bettered by only one other of the participants. The youngest member
of the Terra Nova expedition, almost chosen for the final, doomed
polar party, was Apsley Cherry-Garrard (whose biography is being
written by Sara Wheeler, the author of ``Terra Incognita: Travels
in Antarctica''). Years after he returned to England he wrote what
is arguably the masterpiece of polar exploration. ``THE WORST
JOURNEY IN THE WORLD'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, paper, $16.95) is Edwardian
in outlook and sentiment, understated, sincere yet ironic, full of
subtle hints about what really went on with Scott, definitive about
what the men endured.
</P>
<P>
   Even Huntford grants Scott's literary ability. But, with
relentless determination, he shows that Scott was, above all, a
bungler on a grand scale. Huntford comes close to calling him a
murderer. Huntford's Amundsen, on the other hand, is a latter-day
Viking, the consummate polar traveler, aware of the value of skis
and dogs, obsessed with perfecting equipment, intent on not
stretching supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A First Rate Tragedy,'' Preston sets out to rehabilitate
Scott. After Huntford, it's an enormous task, and she doesn't
manage it. She provides a concise and readable narrative of Scott's
two expeditions. But when it comes to refuting Huntford she accepts
as accurate and incorporates just about all his criticisms of Scott
_ that he relied on ponies (again) and not enough on dogs; that he
still didn't know how to use skis to good advantage; that he
ignored Oates's early advice to force the ponies on as far as
possible, shoot them and lay the crucial depot (the one he came so
close to on the return) farther south; that he failed to learn an
early lesson regarding the evaporation of his cooking fuel; that he
didn't take enough food; that the late decision to take a fifth man
along on the final push for the pole threw off all the calculations
for supplies and nearly resulted in the deaths of three more of his
men, those in the last of the support parties.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a 90's sideshow to the debate over Scott.
Huntford has charged that while Scott was in Antarctica, his wife,
Kathleen, was having an affair with Amundsen's mentor, Fridtjof
Nansen. Nansen was the Chuck Yeager of polar exploration. He
pioneered skiing and sledging techniques and improved much of the
equipment used on the ice. His renowned Arctic drift (1893-96) in
the specially designed ship Fram (which he later reluctantly
allowed Amundsen to use in the south) resulted in a dash for the
North Pole that brought him and Hjalmar Johansen farther north than
anyone had been before.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of an affair between Nansen and Kathleen Scott
caused a storm in England, and Huntford repeats it in his new
biography, ``Nansen'' (which has been published in England but does
not yet seem to have an American publisher). Kathleen Scott met
Nansen when her husband went to Norway seeking advice before
leaving on the Terra Nova expedition. To little avail, Nansen urged
Scott to rely more on skis and dogs. Early in 1912, Nansen was
lecturing in Berlin. Kathleen attended, and she and Nansen stayed
in the same hotel. Huntford says they slept together. After Scott's
death, Nansen proposed marriage and was turned down. Preston says
that Kathleen was visiting relatives in Berlin and that she was too
sensible to have an affair. The books leave things there, but in
England the controversy has turned on Kathleen's chronicling of her
menstrual cycle in her diary; and the discussion, it seems, has
come down to arguing about just what are sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   And so after pretty much granting all of Huntford's points,
Preston says, in effect, that Scott was a hero anyway, that we
should appreciate his achievement rather than criticize his
failure. That's fine, but she is not persuasive that Scott was the
leader Shackleton proved to be in the final episode of the heroic
age of British exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Shackleton's Endurance expedition of 1914-17 has
everything a polar saga could possibly have _ fierce storms, a
relentless ice pack, heroic fights for survival, a near-miraculous
open-boat journey, an almost continuous doubling of the danger
every time salvation looms. It has everything except death, and
that is what has kept it in the shadow of Scott's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914 Shackleton set out to cross Antarctica on foot. He sent
a party in Aurora, Douglas Mawson's old ship, to the Ross Sea to
lay depots for his party to use when they crossed the continent.
Shackleton and a crew of 27 went to the Weddell Sea on the
Endurance. They never made it to land. Ice conditions were bad, and
the Endurance was frozen into the pack in January 1915. The men
wintered in the ship until November, when the Endurance lost its
battle and was crushed. From November till April 1916 they camped
on the ice floes. They had only dogs with them this time;
Amundsen's lesson had been learned.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton and his men drifted far to the north with the ice
pack, and on April 9, when it finally broke up (and after the last
dogs had been shot), they took to their three small ship's boats
(named after expedition patrons) _ the Dudley Docker, the Stancomb
Wills and the James Caird. After six terrible days, during which
Shackleton and Frank Wild, his second in command, went sleepless
for 100 hours, they all made it to Elephant Island, the first land
they had set foot on in 497 days. But Elephant Island was nothing
more than a dismal rock north of the Antarctic Peninsula; they were
without radio and knew no one would look for them there. So they
reinforced the largest of the boats, the James Caird, which was all
of 22 feet long, with a freeboard of just over 2 feet, and got
ready to sail for help. For what was to be an 800-mile open-boat
journey in the fiercest waters on earth, Shackleton chose Frank
Worsley, the captain of the Endurance; Harry McNeish, the ship's
skillful carpenter and something of a troublemaker; Tom Crean, Tim
McCarthy and John Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   They set out for the island of South Georgia on April 24 and
sailed for 16 days, battling winds of 80 miles per hour and waves
60 feet and higher. And it was winter. If they missed the island,
there would be nothing but ocean between them and Africa. They
didn't miss, although they met with a fierce storm just as they
were drawing toward land (nearby, the same storm sank a 500-ton
steamer). But they anded on the opposite side of the island from
where the whaling stations were. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean
crossed the island's uncharted mountains in three days. They then
retrieved the three others and the James Caird, and made plans to
rescue the men left on Elephant Island. Three times Shackleton was
stopped by the ice, but he finally got through and rescued all the
men. They had spent 22 months living on the ice and the barren
island.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great adventure stories (Wolfgang Petersen,
the director of ``Das Boot,'' is making a movie version), and it's
been told well many times. There is Huntford's ``Shackleton,'' of
course. Alfred Lansing's ``ENDURANCE: Shackleton's Incredible
Voyage'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, paper, $10.95) is short, riveting and the
book that introduced many to Shackleton. And now back in print _ in
two editions _ is Shackleton's own account: ``SOUTH: A Memoir of
the Endurance Voyage'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, paper, $13.95) and ``SOUTH:
The Last Antarctic Expedition of Shackleton and the Endurance''
(Lyons, paper, $16.95). He dictated the book to a New Zealand
journalist, Edward Saunders, but it's a rousing read nonetheless.
``We had reached the naked soul of man,'' he famously summed up,
with only small hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition,''
by Caroline Alexander, features the work of the expedition's
photographer, Frank Hurley. When the Endurance was crushed in the
ice and sinking, Hurley went back and retrieved the tins that held
his glass plates from the icy water. He and Shackleton selected the
best and, because they couldn't afford to haul the extra weight,
destroyed many more. Some of these photographs appear in many of
the books about the Endurance expedition, but Alexander has added
ones that have never been published, and nowhere are these stunning
photographs so well reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander retells the entire story, of course, but she also
complements Hurley's photographs with moving word portraits of the
crew. Frank Wild, who was with Scott on Discovery and with
Shackleton on Nimrod, was greatly responsible for the survival of
the Endurance's men on Elephant Island (his diaries are being
prepared for publication). Harry McNeish, who never seems to have
forgiven Shackleton for having his ship's cat shot when they had to
abandon the Endurance, was the lone crew member to mutiny
(Shackleton threatened to shoot him). Tom Crean had been with Scott
on the Terra Nova and should have been chosen for the dash to the
pole; physically, he was probably the strongest man to serve with
both leaders. Perce Blackborow was a young stowaway whose
frostbitten toes were amputated under awful conditions on Elephant
Island. Tim McCarthy survived on the ice floes for nearly six
months, held his own on the hellish trip to Elephant Island and
served admirably on the open-boat journey to South Georgia.
Shackleton called him ``the best and most efficient of the sailors,
always cheerful under the most trying circumstances.'' He returned
to England to find the world still at war and, three weeks later,
was killed at his gun in the English Channel. F. A. (Frank) Worsley
expertly guided the James Caird to South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Worsley, who during the 16 days at sea in the Caird was able to
obtain only four navigation sightings and still managed to get the
tiny craft to South Georgia, wrote his own charming book,
``SHACKLETON'S BOAT JOURNEY'' (Norton, paper, $13). ``In steering a
small boat before a heavy gale,'' he writes, ``don't look back --
it may disconcert you.'' He also wrote an equally fine longer
account of the expedition, ``ENDURANCE: An Epic Polar Adventure''
(Norton, $25.95). Long out of print, it will be published again
next May.
</P>
<P>
   That both Scott and Shackleton were flawed we cannot doubt.
Shackleton's expeditions all failed to attain their goals; Scott
reached the South Pole but paid a heavy price. From our distance it
is hard to judge them as leaders. But Apsley Cherry-Garrard was
with Scott and took his measure. During the winter before Scott
left for the pole, Cherry-Garrard, Wilson and Bowers completed a
brutal Antarctic journey (fighting temperatures as cold as 77 below
zero Fahrenheit) in search of, of all things, emperor penguin eggs.
He was an unassuming young man, who learned polar exploration by
experiencing conditions at their worst, and he was perceptive about
his fellows. As fate would have it, he also reviewed Shackleton's
``South.'' ``I believe Shackleton has never lost a man,''
Cherry-Garrard wrote. ``He must have had some doubts as to whether
he would save one then. But he did, he saved them every one.''
Still, Scott, like another British icon, Princess Diana, died
tragically, and that is what so often seems to capture the public's
heart; the disasters that ended their lives became the foundation
for their myths.

 Charity Stories 
 By Mark Richard 
 147 pp. New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $19.95  Fever Dreams 
 By Tobin Harshaw 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time an actual carnival appears in Mark Richard's story
collection, ``Charity,'' it seems a bit superfluous. After all,
Richard's world outside the fun house includes an ex-con whose
teeth are filed into daggers, a boy whose legs have become ``stiff
sticks of long black hair,'' a corpulent patriarch bedecked in
garbage bags and speaking in tongues, someone called the Human
Skeleton, a cheerleader who ``got a tattoo that look like a man's
organ'' and enough other grotesques, oddities and freaks of nature
to keep P. T. Barnum flush until doomsday.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, it's surpris-ing to find that Richard's baroque
plotting and opaque prose belie the heart of a sentimentalist. The
best stories in the collection _ those few with story lines tight
enough to constrain Richard's unruly language _ deftly illuminate
the most primary of emotional experiences: in ``Gentlemen's
Agreement'' a son discovers his real bond with his oft-absent
father; in ``The Birds for Christmas'' two hospitalized boys find
true charity in the form of a drunken Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's characters are often children (all are boys, actually)
who for the most part are broken and unloved. But don't think for a
minute that they're victims _ the sense of menace that pervades
these stories more often than not emanates from these urchins. One
of the tamest is Michael Christian of ``The Birds for Christmas,''
a patient in leg braces whose dearest holiday wish is to see
Hitchcock's ornithological invasion on ``The Late Show.'' Forget
Frosty the Snowman, says Michael, '' 'I want to see 'The Birds,'
man. I want to see those birds get all up in them people's hair.
That's some real Christmas TV to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the boy with a tail in the title story, who
threatens another patient in his hospital wing, a child in a body
cast: ``I paid them money to kill you for me, the boy with the tail
told the broken child. . . . You don't have any money, said the
broken child, and the boy with the tail opened a fist and showed
him a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Creepiest of all, perhaps, is the child in ``Memorial Day'' who
collects scorpions while chatting with Death, here a dapper figure
in a white dinner jacket who munches on fortune cookies and
characterizes himself as ``a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't write these children off (well, the boy with the
tail maybe); they've been dealt a poor hand in Richard's
determinist world and they can't help acting in character. How was
the son in ``Gentleman's Agreement'' going to make good on a
promise to stop throwing rocks at cars when that ``baby-headed
tomahawk stone revealed itself in the dust''?
</P>
<P>
   Richard's adults are equally trapped by circumstance. In stories
like ``Where Blue Is Blue,'' a sort of murder mystery, he gives a
glimpse into the dead-end lives of the human flotsam populating the
tourist and fishing towns of the Virginia and Carolina coasts.
Richard has lived in this world, and not much seems to have changed
in the century since the locals' wounded longing for an easier life
found voice in sea chanteys like ``Riley'': ``Wish I were Cap'n
Riley's son, I'd lay around and drink good rum.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard finds unexpected decency and humor in these characters
when he keeps the action in the recognizable world. But when he
relaxes his grip on plot and language, the entropy isn't pretty.
Typical is ``Fun at the Beach,'' a sort of postapocalyptic
Frankie-and-Annette story that, after a very funny epistolary
prologue, lapses into a tedious exercise in black humor.
</P>
<P>
   But my deepest qualm about this story and Richard's other fever
dreams (as well as his earlier novel, ``Fishboy'') is that the
grotesques that pop out from behind every corner don't seem to be
anything more than curiosities -- they don't cause us to think
differently about our lives or question things we take for granted.
Sometimes, it seems, Richard is no less an exploitationist than
Barnum.

MAKING THE WISEGUYS WEEP
</HEADLINE>
  The Jimmy Roselli Story 
 By David Evanier 
 Illustrated. 258 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. $24 
 -------- 
 The Wedding Singer 
 By Vincent Patrick 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``JIMMY ROSELLI is Hoboken's other great singer,'' David Evanier
asserts in the opening line of ``Making the Wiseguys Weep.''
Evanier quotes Scott Harlan, a vocal coach: ``There's no other pop
singer I can think of that can sing . . . in such a pure, romantic
style _ certainly not Sinatra or Tony Bennett _ and also have the
capability of doing the pop stuff too. . . . This guy could sing
bel canto at Carnegie Hall as well as at a little corner bistro.''
Another vocal coach, Carol Lees, said: ``A person without a great
voice can get up and perform a song and never hit a note right but
put it over. There are people who can do that, and it's a lot of
what actors have to do. There's Walter Huston's 'September Song';
Durante's 'I'll See You in My Dreams.' Sinatra did it in the later
years. That's all about style and interpretation and how they play
with the song. Roselli doesn't do any of that. He honors the music
as it was written and the meaning of the words as they were
written, and he allows it to come through his beautiful voice in a
really pure way.'' Since a reader's receptiveness to a book about a
performer is influenced by his opinion of the performer's talent,
let me go on record as a big fan of Roselli.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Roselli's mother died two days after giving birth to him
in 1925; his father, a prizefighter and the black sheep of the
family, left him for good, though he remained in Hoboken during
Jimmy's childhood there, working as a bartender and rebuffing the
young boy on the few occasions he tried to establish a
relationship. Jimmy was taken in and raised by his paternal
grandfather, a longshoreman who permitted only Italian to be spoken
in his household, which included his four daughters and two
sons-in-law (of whom he said that at the dinner table, ``You only
see the tops of their heads; everybody's eatin' ``).
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's fine voice became apparent early on. By the age of 10 he
had discovered that a shoeshine box gained him entry to some of the
240 saloons that thrived in Hoboken in the 1930's, where he could
sing tunes like ``Danny Boy'' and ``My Gal Sal'' for sailors,
soldiers and prostitutes and collect $10 or $15 after a night of
passing his hat. During those years, Evanier writes, his
grandfather took him each week to the Italian theater and
vaudeville; after each performer, his grandfather would tell him,
``You can sing better than this guy.'' He was good enough at the
age of 13 to win first prize on the radio show ``Major Bowes'
Original Amateur Hour.'' The major slipped him a shiny quarter,
dime and nickel and said to tell no one. It was the beginning of
some 50 years of Jimmy's feeling he was being badly underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting question about the long career of Jimmy
Roselli (he is, at 73, still in fine voice, and packs them in when
he chooses to do a concert) is a question that lies at the heart of
this book: Why did he never achieve a level of recognition
commensurate with his talent? Evanier writes, ``The what-ifs about
Roselli's career center on two factors: Sinatra's influence and
wise-guy connections.''
</P>
<P>
   (Roselli incurred a lifelong enmity with Sinatra, and may have
paid dearly for it.)
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a more fundamental factor, which underlay his
problems with Sinatra and the mob and nearly everyone else whose
path crossed his professionally: Jimmy Roselli was a paradigm of
perversity and obstinacy. He could (so he claimed) cause the mob
boss Angelo (Gyp) De Carlo to paste his photograph on the bottom of
De Carlo's toilet seat. When a major agent, Lew Perry, suggested
that some mildly animated stage antics be added to his act, the
22-year-old Roselli replied: ``Listen to me. I came up here to
sing. . . . That's for guys who have no talent,'' and walked out.
He turned down the role of Peppino, the Neapolitan singer in ``The
Godfather Part II'' as well as appearances on Johnny Carson's
``Tonight Show'' and ``Regis and Kathie Lee,'' because none of them
would pay what he thought he was worth. He once answered Ed
Sullivan's admonition, ``It's exposure, Jimmy,'' with the
statement, ``I got so much exposure, I'm gonna catch pneumonia.''
He walked off a ``Merv Griffin Show'' engagement when told that
after singing he would not be invited to sit on the couch beside
the host. Evanier attributes Roselli's behavior to a streak of
self-destructiveness and a fear of success. I wonder if it might
not be, along with an unwavering respect for his own talent, a
level of prideful guilelessness almost incomprehensible in late
20th-century America, but not unknown in the cafes of southern
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Evanier, a magazine journalist, discusses the Sinatra-Roselli
feud frequently, but never makes clear its specific origins. It is
tempting to attribute it to the normal emotional responses of young
rivals raised just five houses apart in Hoboken, but the 10-year
age difference (Sinatra the older) and Sinatra's early success cast
doubt on it. What is clear is that these two men of very different
temperaments developed a lifelong mutual dislike whose intensity
can be gauged by Roselli's certainty that Sinatra was behind a New
York radio station's yanking him from the airwaves in the early
1970's, the ban lasting until 1991. (Evanier reaches no definite
conclusion regarding Sinatra's involvement.) Roselli's trouble with
the underworld is documented more thoroughly. During the crucial
early years of Roselli's career, ``a singer in that situation
really did not have any choice at all, if he wanted to play in the
restaurants and clubs,'' Robert Buccino, of New Jersey's Organized
Crime and Racketeering Bureau, told Evanier. Like other performers
of the time, Roselli dealt with the mob. Unlike the others, he was
apparently unable to kowtow sufficiently and show the respect
demanded by them. He drove the wiseguys crazy, in what seems to
have been a love-hate relationship; when they weren't threatening
his life they were at his shows, accompanied by wives and mothers,
literally crying through his Neapolitan classics or his English
renditions of songs like ``Little Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Jimmy Roselli, from the older Italian-Americans who
revere him to those like Evanier himself -- captivated years ago by
the singer's arresting voice coming from a jukebox in those most
Neapolitan of surroundings, Lanza's on First Avenue -- will welcome
this thorough treatment of Roselli's career. (A minor omission is
any discussion of formal, classical voice training, which one
assumes, upon hearing Roselli, that he must have had.) Those who
know nothing of Roselli will meet in ``Making the Wiseguys Weep''
an American original _ a performer who finally succeeded not only
in spite of his enemies but in spite of himself. If it sends them
out to sample his singing (as it ought to) Evanier will have
performed a well-needed service.

 Amsterdam 
 By Ian McEwan 
 193 pp. New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $21  Publish and Perish 
 By William H. Pritchard 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAST year, Ian McEwan's novel ``Enduring Love'' failed to make
the short-list for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize in fiction.
This year, his latest novel won it. ``Amsterdam'' may be compared
with McEwan's first two novels, ``The Cement Garden'' and ``The
Comfort of Strangers,'' which have been cleverly, and accurately,
tagged with three of Hobbes's adjectives (slightly modified) to
describe life in the state of nature -- nasty, British and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amsterdam'' is very British and, despite its title, takes
place mainly in London and the Lake District. On the scale of
nastiness, it gets high grades as well. But it is less unsettling
than McEwan's earlier solemn-gory fables since its humorous
dimension is everywhere apparent -- granted that the humor is
distinctly black. Its tone overall, as well as part of its theme,
reminded me more than once of the excellent 1990 Masterpiece
Theater production ``House of Cards,'' in which Ian Richardson
plays a sinister Tory cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   What readers tend to remember from McEwan's fiction is its
penchant for contriving scenes of awful catastrophe: human
dismemberment in ``The Comfort of Strangers''; a confrontation
between a woman and two deadly wild dogs in ``Black Dogs''; the
tour de force balloon disaster that brilliantly opens ``Enduring
Love.'' Nothing in ``Amsterdam'' quite measures up to these events.
Instead, the tribulations of its two main figures -- a composer,
Clive Linley, and a newspaper editor, Vernon Halliday -- are
treated in a cooler, more ironic manner, even as they move toward
disaster. This chilliness is an extension of McEwan's habitual
practice of damping down the sensational aspects of his imagined
encounters by narrating them in a precise, thoughtful,
unsensational way. It may, in fact, make the violence, when it
occurs, seem that much more natural and inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amsterdam'' avoids the first-person expansive telling by which
Joe Rose, the protagonist of ``Enduring Love,'' drew the reader so
tightly into his orbit. As that novel unfolds, Joe's stalking by
the pathological Jed Parry becomes a gathering nightmare. By
contrast, the narrative voice in ``Amsterdam'' is clipped, assured,
with a strongly sardonic edge. In the novel's splendid opening
sequence, at the crematorium chapel where Molly Lane is being paid
her last respects, Clive and Vernon, both former lovers of Molly,
reminisce as they put off speaking to the dead woman's highly
managerial husband. Both Clive and Vernon dislike George Lane, and
that dislike has only been heightened by his authoritative
surveillance of the dying woman's swift decline. (``Brain-dead and
in George's clutches,'' remarks Clive, mordantly.)
</P>
<P>
   The brisk, concentrated touches with which the scene is put
before us have a more than personal authority in their
perceptiveness, as Clive registers how the crematorium crowd in
daylight looks ``terrible, like cadavers jerked upright to welcome
the newly dead.'' Julian Garmony, the right-wing Foreign Secretary
whom Clive is summoned to meet, displays the politician's
characteristic ``eye movements, the restless patrol for new
listeners or defectors, or the proximity of some figure of higher
status.'' The mourners are of a generation that grew up in an
England of ``full employment, new universities, bright paperback
books, the Augustan age of rock-and-roll, affordable ideals,'' so
they were already safe when the state, under Margaret Thatcher,
withdrew its largesse and ``became a scold.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the book, Clive and Vernon share the focus of
attention, appropriately in a novel that builds to the disposition
of their twin fates. Clive sees himself, not without some
justification, as the heir of Ralph Vaughan Williams; he has
written a book in reaction to modernism's ``old guard'' and its
attempt to banish melody and harmony. In that book, ``Recalling
Beauty,'' Clive describes a composition by one of modernism's
zealots: ``a publicly subsidized 'concert' in a nearly deserted
church hall, in which the legs of a piano were repeatedly struck
with the broken neck of a violin for over an hour. An accompanying
program note explained, with references to the Holocaust, why at
this stage in European history no other forms of music were
viable.'' Clive has been commissioned to write a symphony from
which the committee hopes a single tune can be incorporated into
the millennial celebrations. Already two deadlines behind, he is
approaching completion of the work and is fixed on the
``irresistible melody'' he will produce as ``the dead century's
elegy.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like McEwan is setting up his composer as fatuously
taken in by his own importance, such is not wholly, or solely, the
case. Clive's reflections on the arduousness of writing a symphony
are informed with musical know-how, and his attempts to compose the
melody _ especially during a revelatory moment while hiking in the
Lake District _ are fully and convincingly imagined. In thinking of
his task as analogous to Beethoven's composing the ``Ode to Joy,''
Clive is surely overreaching, setting himself up for a fall. But
McEwan makes you believe that the composer possesses real talent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vernon Halliday, editor of a downmarket
London broadsheet called The Judge, is ``within his profession . .
. revered as a nonentity.'' He is fighting to raise the circulation
numbers and keep his job. His great opportunity for doing both
comes when Molly's husband offers him deeply compromising pictures
of Julian Garmony (who likes to ``dress up'') taken by Molly. But
when Vernon tells Clive about this opportunity, his friend is
disgusted and accuses him of insulting Molly's memory, thus
precipitating the serious coming asunder of her two ex-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds highly plotted (and I've left much out), it
is. ``Amsterdam'' is a well-oiled machine, and McEwan's pleasure in
time-shifting, presenting events out of their temporal order
(flashing back in Clive's mind, say, to a conversation he had the
day before) is everywhere evident. Vladimir Nabokov, asked whether
sometimes his characters didn't break free of his control, replied
that they were galley slaves, kept severely under his thumb at all
times. McEwan follows this prescription in spades.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment that typifies the book's cruel wit, Vernon, with
Clive's approval, humiliates an obnoxious critic named Lanark by
telling him that he's recently seen Lanark's name on a list of
distinguished people, including judges and government ministers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lanark flushed with pleasure. 'All this stuff about a
knighthood is complete nonsense.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'It's certain to be. This concerns a childrens' home in
Wales. Top-notch pedophile ring. You were videoed going in and out
a dozen times. We were thinking of running a piece . . . but I'm
sure someone else will pick it up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is the book at its best. But when the cruel wit is turned
on the two central figures, especially on Clive, I wondered whether
he (or McEwan) had quite deserved or earned it. Although we suspect
that comeuppances are in store for both Clive and Vernon, it is
hard to credit _ after some of the sharp and clever things Clive
has said and thought earlier _ that on the verge of finishing his
symphony he thinks ``quite simply, that it might not be going too
far to say that he was . . . a genius,'' and that geniuses were few
and far between in his country: ``There had been no Beethovens
here.'' The long narrative knife is clearly out. And is it quite
conceivable that the agent of Vernon's editorial fiasco (the
published pictures of Garmony backfire) should be the politician's
wife, who happens also to be a crack surgeon? Her televised defense
of her husband shows her emerging ``from the operating theater,
tired but happy, after performing open-heart surgery on a
9-year-old black girl named Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   If such narrative happenings are too neat to be true, if the
dispatching of characters and the tying-up of ends in the book's
final chapters constitute striking effects rather than moral
exploration and understanding, they are no less entertaining for
that _ entertaining in the mode of earlier nasty British satirists
like Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis. (Or like McEwan's gifted
contemporary A. N. Wilson, whose recent novel, ``Dream Children,''
is as ruthless and amusing as ``Amsterdam.'') Who knows if the case
may not be as another British satirist, Robert Graves, put it at
the end of his poem ``The Devil's Advice to Story-Tellers'': ``Nice
contradiction between fact and fact /

human, then something more like art.

ON SUNSET BOULEVARD
</HEADLINE>
  The Life and Times of Billy Wilder 
 By Ed Sikov 
 Illustrated. 675 pp. New York:Hyperion. $35 
 -------- 
 From the Kaiser to the Oscar 
 By Andrew Sarris 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The epigraph to the preface of Ed Sikov's finely wrought and
prodigiously researched biography of Billy Wilder quotes the
congenitally feisty filmmaker thus: ``In real life, most women are
stupid -- and so are persons who are writing biographies of
Hollywood celebrities.'' This pronouncement helps explain why
Wilder refused to grant Sikov even a token interview, but it is
wildly inaccurate when applied to the author of ``On Sunset
Boulevard.'' With the insights of a sophisticated film scholar and
the expertise of a tenacious reporter, Sikov takes us with Wilder
on a 90-year roller-coaster ride from the twilight years of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire through Weimar Berlin, Hitler and the
Holocaust to the last sunsets of the Hollywood studio system.
</P>
<P>
   But if the second part of Wilder's derisive quotation is
incorrect, the first part, with its woman-hating bravado, has
misled even so astute a chronicler as Sikov to take Wilder at his
word too often and too relentlessly. Indeed, I lost count of the
number of times Sikov uses variants of the word ``misogynous'' to
describe Wilder's work. Misogynous compared with whom? John Huston,
Orson Welles, Sam Peckinpah? Any writer-director responsible for
the ecstatic explosions of romantic love in ``The Major and the
Minor'' (1942), ``The Lost Weekend'' (1945), ``Sabrina'' (1954),
``Love in the Afternoon'' (1957), ``The Apartment'' (1960) and
``The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' (1970) can hardly be
singled out for censure amid the overall sexism of the motion
picture industry both in Wilder's time and in our own.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the facile allegations of cynicism leveled at Wilder,
even by a onetime and repentant detractor like me, tend to be
overemphasized in the book, which is otherwise a perceptive and
profound appreciation of one of Hollywood's most accomplished and
consistently iconoclastic filmmakers. Sikov acknowledges that
Wilder's harshest films seem in retrospect gentler and more
civilized than the brutish spectacles to which we have been
conditioned in the increasingly apocalyptic 1990's. Yet it can be
argued that Wilder even in his own era was compelled by his
contrarian tastes to inject new twists and turns into the familiar
Hollywood formulas for comic and dramatic shock effects. He
particularly enjoyed persuading big stars to undertake roles
radically at variance with their amiably sympathetic screen
personas. Ginger Rogers was induced at the peak of her popularity
to play a 12-year-old pre-''Lolita'' pseudo-nymphet in ``The Major
and the Minor.'' Handsomely likable leading men, like Fred
MacMurray in ``Double Indemnity'' (1944) and Ray Milland in ``The
Lost Weekend,'' were virtually rediscovered as a cold-blooded
murderer and a nasty drunkard, respectively. William Holden, a
boyish all-American type, vaulted to maturity and stardom as a
self-loathing screenwriter-gigolo in ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), a
part turned down by Montgomery Clift. (The role also reflected
Wilder's own checkered past as a taxi dancer and gigolo in Weimar
Berlin.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that Wilder ever lacked other reasons to be cynical. From
the day of his birth on June 22, 1906, in Sucha Beskidzka, south of
Cracow, in the Galician province of the decaying Austro-Hungarian
Empire, his existence was clouded by a virulent anti-Semitism that
long antedated the Nazis. He faced it in Vienna, where he began his
career as a journalist in 1925, and in Berlin, where he plunged
into screenwriting.
</P>
<P>
   These years are shrouded by Wilder's lifelong flair as a
fabulist of the first order. Many of his recollections of this
shadowy period are contradicted by other people's memories, but
Sikov keeps the narrative flowing forward by treating the most
muddled material as revealing in its own right. After all, what
Wilder may have fabricated in his interviews as biography he later
transformed into movie scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Sikov follows Wilder through a maze of paradoxes. Though
Hollywood considered him more a screenwriter-director than a
director-screenwriter, he very seldom wrote a script without a
collaborator. To explain Wilder's professional survival in
Hollywood's ultra-Darwinian jungle _ his directorial career
extended from 1942 to 1981, with a very high percentage of critical
and commercial successes, including six Oscars _ Sikov skillfully
interweaves the myriad details of moviemaking. In particular, he
describes the contrasting chemistries of Wilder's two collaborative
``marriages'' with his writing partners Charles Brackett (from 1938
to 1950) and I. A. L. Diamond (from 1957 to 1981). Wilder's
unilateral ``divorce'' from Brackett _ who was older, more highly
educated, more socially prominent than Wilder, but pathetically and
vulnerably dependent _ right after the co-writing coup of ``Sunset
Boulevard'' is treated as a sour note in Wilder's triumphant
processional through talking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder's first project after breaking with Brackett was ``Ace in
the Hole,'' an angry assault on the public's morbid fascination
with human disaster on a scale intimately identifiable enough to
incite a press feeding frenzy. (Sound familiar?) Unfortunately, the
paying public in 1951 stayed away in droves. Sikov aptly considers
this to be one of Wilder's most personal films, because of his
biographical proximity to the morally marginal reporter
protagonist, played by Kirk Douglas with an unmodulated
self-destructive intensity. Wilder, after all, had cut many corners
himself as a struggling reporter in Vienna and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder rebounded from this setback with a succession of less
personal but more commercially palatable movies with a variety of
screenwriting collaborators. Then in 1957, with ``Love in the
Afternoon,'' he joined forces with Diamond, a young screenwriter
with whom he could work much more smoothly than he ever had with
Brackett. As with his second wife, Audrey Young, to whom he has
been married for close to half a century, Wilder was second-time
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was more than luck. When Wilder chose to flee Germany
virtually the day Hitler came to power, and could not persuade his
mother and other family members to do likewise, he did not follow
other Jews into doomed German-speaking Austria but decided instead
to move to Paris, where he had few contacts and little familiarity
with the language. But his ultimate destination was always the
United States, a country he had learned to love from the movies he
had seen as a child with his Americanophile mother. In fact, she
had changed his name from Samuel to Billie in honor of Buffalo
Bill. (Much later, ``Billie'' defeminized his name to Billy.) The
point is that Wilder never became a full-fledged participant in the
German Jewish diaspora of the 30's and 40's. Though he has never
lost his German accent, he has spent most of his adult life in
pursuit of the American idiom in movies, radio, sports and popular
music. His published interviews and movie dialogue are peppered
with up-to-date American slang and pithy turns of phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his fellow German Jewish emigres, Wilder most admired and
adored Ernst Lubitsch, with whom he and Brackett had worked on
``Ninotchka'' (1939), with Greta Garbo. But the director who
influenced him the most stylistically _ and this is one of Sikov's
most notable revisionist coups _ was Howard Hawks, with whom he and
Brackett collaborated on the 1941 comedy ``Ball of Fire.'' What
Wilder admired in Hawks was his ability to edit in his mind, so as
to leave no ``covering shots'' for producers to play games with in
the editing room. Also, Hawks, in Wilder's eyes, never betrayed the
script for the sake of a personal flourish of visual virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   Sikov, whose previous books include ``Screwball: Hollywood's
Madcap Romantic Comedies'' and ``Laughing Hysterically: American
Screen Comedy of the 1950's,'' can be credited for emphasizing at
long last the crucial contributions of the composers Miklos Rozsa
and Franz Waxman to the emotional sweep of many of Wilder's best
films. Also acknowledged are Wilder's two favorite alter egos,
William Holden and Jack Lemmon, who served repeatedly as the most
conspicuous icons in the Wilder oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Sikov has painted as good a portrait of Billy
Wilder, the man, the artist, the showman, the self-promoter, the
profitably prescient art collector and the successful businessman,
as we are likely to get from the outside. Indeed, Sikov's is less a
still portrait than a blurry, moving picture of an eternally
restless human being, racing from country to country, pacing up and
down during screenwriting conferences, dashing about from one set
to another and from one story idea to another.

SHAKING A LEG
</HEADLINE>
  Collected Writings 
 By Angela Carter 
 Edited by Jenny Uglow 
 641 pp. New York: Penguin Books. Paper, $15.95 
 -------- 
 Mysteries of the Normal and Ordinary 
 By Wendy Steiner 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELA CARTER would surely have smiled at the fact that Jenny
Uglow, the editor of ``Shaking a Leg,'' has arranged this
collection of Carter's journalism in odd categories so as ``to
define and separate but also to tease and provoke.'' How fitting to
cast these prose provocations in the language of a mascara ad _ or
one for lingerie! Carter herself had been tempted to describe Grace
Paley as a martini: ``wry, dry, tender, ironic.'' Equal parts
esthetician and folklorist, Carter used Kant to explain industrial
blight and the Greeks' golden section to advocate high heels with
long skirts. Had this book been organized chronologically, from its
first entries in the 1960's until her death in 1992, she would have
emerged as a faultless barometer of the shifting pressures of her
era. As it is, this Borgesian mishmash is the structural equivalent
of Carter's truculent whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   With the publication of her brilliant first novel, ``Shadow
Dance,'' in 1966, Carter began emphatically to speak her mind. Her
eight subsequent novels and her folk-tale and essay collections
punctuated a continual outpouring of cultural journalism. Ah, the
privilege of being a woman writer in heady post-1960's London! She
thought of these days as ``a brief period of public philosophical
awareness that occurs only very occasionally in human history;
when, truly, it felt like Year 1, that all that was holy was in the
process of being profaned and we were attempting to grapple with
the real relations between human beings.'' Women for the first time
in history were free to shake off the Blakean ``mind-forg'd
manacles'' of their femininity and shape their own identity,
exploring the luscious codes of female semiotics _ beauty, sex,
art, fairy tales, fashion, domesticity _ that had been trivialized
so very long by men.
</P>
<P>
   Carter approached the task with utter fearlessness. She would be
titillating if she wanted to be, or just irreverent: ``The question
every thinking woman in the Western world must have posed herself
one time or other,'' she wrote of Beauvoir and Sarte, is ``why is a
nice girl like Simone wasting her time sucking up to . . . boring
old . . . J.-P.?''
</P>
<P>
   She made a specialty of subverting sentimentality, noting in an
essay called ``Constructing an Australia'' that the koala ``has
been stricken by a sexually transmitted disease, an affliction that
severely damages its reputation as the marsupial most suitable for
children.'' She portrays D. H. Lawrence as a stocking fetishist,
and William and Dorothy Wordsworth as a pair of drug-crazed hikers
searching for a connection. ``Only a handful of eccentrics enjoyed
mountains until a mountain got up and followed Wordsworth across a
lake,'' she observes. Shocking, willful, extravagant _ every cut
and quip at the same time reveals a striking intellectual acuity.
Roland Barthes's mind is ``clockwork on odd days and fireworks on
even.'' In discussing Josef von Sternberg's film ``The Blue
Angel,'' she remarks that ``the significance of the femme fatale
lies not in her gender but in her freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   I have never read sequences of sentences whose trajectory is so
utterly unpredictable. Carter gives and gives and then snatches
away before you know what hit you. In an essay about her Scottish
relations, she describes ``my ain'' as ``simple, poor and plain
folk.'' So ``we proclaim with the characteristic disingenuousness
of the colonialized.'' Here she knew what was coming and tricked
us, but elsewhere she walks us through her own surprise.
</P>
<P>
   We visit a Norwegian art gallery with her in ``Munch and
Antibiotics,'' gazing at pictures of ruddy-cheeked farmers and
saucer-eyed children. One of them has ``the terrible beauty of
innocence . . . so that you look at him as if he were just glimpsed
before being swept away by some storm.'' And then it dawns on her
that he is about to be swept away: ``Dear God -- it isn't an art
gallery at all; this is a terminal ward. . . . The death bed, the
fatal diagnosis, the child who will not live and therefore must be
idealized, sentimentalized, or the death will be quite
intolerable.'' She leaps from there to our century, when children
are not expected to predecease their parents, and back to Munch's,
in which a mother avoids the eyes of her suffering child because
she knows that someone -- but who? -- is to blame, and finally
onward, headlong, to the conclusion: ``Munch's vision is
incompatible with antibiotics. . . . And they say there's no such
thing as progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly an essay in the collection does not harbor such surprise.
We might trace it to Carter's ``family talent for magic realism.''
Her mother's people had no indoor bath, but had a piano and went to
see Shakespeare at the Old Vic. The ``but'' here is mine, not
Carter's. She reports these facts in an autobiographical essay in
an uninflected sequence, as if the absence of a bath and the
presence of a piano are as unremarkable as the reverse. Her history
is full of such reversals. From a childhood rich in love she
emerged an anorexic adolescent. At the university, studying
English, she was drawn to stories of monsters and continued to find
them everywhere: reviewing a 1983 exhibition of Tudor artists, she
fixed on a portrait of Elizabeth I that ``shows her stiff as an
ironing board and stuck with pearls like lice, water-monsters
embroidered on her skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``ordinary,'' in Carter's magic realist mind-set, is
mysterious. After the Cuban missile crisis, ``nobody could ever be
ordinary again,'' she writes, but her loved ones taught her that
nobody ever had been ordinary. ``As my grandmother used to say:
There's nowt so queer as folk.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's nonfiction is pervaded by an ethnographic wonder that
renders the Sunday advertising supplement in a Providence, R.I.,
newspaper as exotic as tattooing practices in Japan or Portuguese
festivals of the phallus. She was an unofficial expert on such
festivals, by the way, along with pub songs, wrestling, pornography
and a vast array of topics whose naughtiness is the preoccupation
of outmoded minds. But at the same time, she could take Tom Wolfe
to task in a review for merging ``a jamboree, filigree way of
writing'' with a ``polemical stand for social realism'' or attack
the historian Robert Darnton for insisting on the unfamiliarity of
the past and hence ``marginalizing otherness.'' She loved to have
things both ways -- and why not? She could exercise her female
prerogative if she wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   In Carter's family, ``to love Shakespeare was a kind of class
revenge,'' and esthetics was a perfectly good tool for political
analysis. The results of such thinking are sometimes tiresome.
After all, not everything objectionable can be laid at the door of
``Thatcher's Britain'' or ``the twilight of capitalism,'' and even
if the proliferation of ``gourmet'' food books is proof of ``a
widespread and unashamed cult of conspicuous gluttony in the
advanced industrialized countries,'' should food enthusiasts really
hang their heads because children starve in Ethiopia? Carter,
recovered anorexic, is wryly repulsed by the voluptuousness of
cookbooks, but she can still stomach a little class superiority.
There is something not quite right to her ``about a coconut kirsch
roulade as a concept. It is just a bit . . . just a bit Streatham.
Its vowels are subtly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But just when you think you've got her _ Carter, the 1960's bore
_ she turns the cliche on its head. ``The sense of limitless
freedom that I, as a woman, sometimes feel is that of a new kind of
being. . . . I am the pure product of an advanced, industrialized,
post-imperialist country in decline.'' Well then, bravo for the
whole post-this-and-that imperialist-industrialist shooting match.
It can't be so bad if it produced a woman who could value D. H.
Lawrence's fiction and yet mock him mercilessly because he would
have hated her _ a female ``blackbeetle,'' she imagines him calling
her.
</P>
<P>
   Post-1960's liberation gave us a woman who was proof even
against Clark Gable's Rhett Butler: ``Irresistible Rhett,'' she
described him, ``his ears rampant as if ears were secondary sexual
characteristics.'' This was a woman who searched all through
literature for a model of female fulfillment and found it in
Chaucer's Alison, who managed to have sex with the man of her
choice ``to her own satisfaction and with no loss of either her own
self-respect or the respect of her male creator, which is more than
a girl like her will be able to do again, in fiction, for almost
more than half a millennium.'' Alison's ``giggle'' at her success
is the equivalent, in Carter's cosmos, of the Buddha's smile.
</P>
<P>
   It may be puzzling to consider Angela Carter's charms as a
writer: her irreverence and rock-bottom good sense; her petulance
and surprising erudition; her willful self-contradiction and sense
of moral responsibility. Add it up and you have something like
Enobarbus' verdict on Cleopatra: custom cannot stale her infinite
variety _ a male take on feminine perfection if ever there was one.
But Carter is ahead of us here, as always. ``Perhaps we mistook
permissiveness for liberty,'' she opines. ``Who is it, do you
think, who is permitting you to do all those exotic things?''
Whoever it is _ or, sadly, was _ we should be profoundly grateful
that Carter did them and left us this image of a woman:
contradictory, fulfilled, quite often giggling.

  New &AMP; Noteworthy Paperbacks 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 Casanova: The Man Who Really Loved Women 
 By Lydia Flem. Translated by Catherine Temerson. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $13 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Belgian scholar argues that Casanova was far more than a
sexual athlete _ in his high-spirited virtuosity he was the
embodiment of the Enlightenment. ``Perpetually captivated by
Casanova, as lover, adventurer or wanderer, Flem makes us
determined to seek out his company,'' Jonathan Keates wrote here in
1997.
 &UR; Pfitz &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Crumey. Picador USA, $12 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this slender novel, an 18th-century German prince mobilizes
the collective mental powers of his subjects to create an elaborate
imaginary city. Unfortunately, reality creeps into his vision of
esthetic purity, in the form of a young cartographer who falls in
love with another worker. '' 'Pfitz' is a surprisingly warm and
likable book, a combination of intellectual high-wire act and good
traditional storytelling,'' Andrew Miller wrote here in 1997. The
author ``develops his story with admirable rigor, seizing on both
the comic and the philosophical potential of a world in which the
actual and the imagined have become fatally blurred.''
 &UR; Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight &QL; 
 &UR; By Pat Shipman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the fossilized skeleton of a prehistoric creature that was
half bird and half reptile was discovered in Bavaria in 1861, it
touched off a long-running debate about the dinosaurian ancestry of
birds. The author of this account makes a strong case for such a
link. ``Shipman brings to her excellent book the authority of a
paleontologist and the talent of an accomplished writer on science
for popular audiences,'' John Noble Wilford said here earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After Man: A Zoology of the Future, by Dougal Dixon (St.
Martin's Griffin, $15.95), envisions the species on earth 50
million years from now, like the vortex, a giant whale-like
creature descended from penguins. In 1982 in these pages, Timothy
Ferris found this illustrated book full of ``endearing and
plausible specimens'' that ``engender reflection about the
mysterious forces at work beneath the skin of real animals.''
 &UR; Panther in the Basement &QL; 
 &UR; By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patriotic boy is accused of treason after befriending a gentle
British soldier in Jerusalem just before Britain's departure from
Palestine in 1947. In 1997 our reviewer, Lee Siegel, called this
``an insightful, inventive and lyrical'' novel that uses ``the
theme of betrayal to explore the status of the individual in a
country where public and private landscapes are constantly
merging.'' The Far Euphrates, by Aryeh Lev Stollman (Riverhead,
$13), is a first novel about a lonely rabbi's son growing up in
Ontario during the 1950's and 60's and the extended family of
troubled adults around him. '' 'The Far Euphrates' is remarkable
both for Stollman's eloquently understated prose and for the ease
with which he constructs his artful plot,'' Margot Livesey wrote
here last year.
 &UR; The Sea of Trees &QL; 
 &UR; By Yannick Murphy. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set in Indochina during the 1940's, this first novel is narrated
by a young girl who comes of age in a Japanese internment camp and
in postwar Saigon. ``Her story unfolds through a dreamlike
progression of glinting surfaces, telling gestures and precisely
rendered moments, in which matter-of-fact horror butts up against
absurdist hilarity,'' Catherine Bush wrote here in 1997.
 &UR; At Risk &QL; 
 &UR; By Alice Hoffman. Berkley, $13 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A middle-class family's comfortable world is shaken to the core
when their 11-year-old daughter contracts AIDS from a blood
transfusion. ``In its simplicity and directness and restraint there
is very often a compelling power'' to this novel, Jim Shepard said
here in 1988.
 &UR; Gershwin &QL; 
 &UR; By Edward Jablonski. Da Capo, $17.95 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   The author maintains that the brash optimism of George
Gershwin's music was emblematic of a vibrant young America rising
to its potential in the arts and business. In 1987 our reviewer,
Francis Davis, said this biography features ``a wealth of pertinent
detail and fresh musicological insight.'' The same publisher has
reissued The Complete Lyrics of Ira Gershwin, edited by Robert
Kimball ($35), which tracks the artistic growth of George's older
brother and his search for fresh ways to avoid cliches. In 1993 in
these pages, Sheldon Harnick said this book should be ``in the home
of everyone who has an interest in the art of the musical
theater.''
 &UR; Empire of Light: A History of Discovery in Science and Art &QL; 
 &UR; By Sidney Perkowitz. Joseph Henry, $16.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A physics professor explores the nature of light and the complex
human responses to it, as well as various theories of the
phenomenon through the ages. In 1996 one critic called this a
``smoothly written, comprehensive and thoroughly enjoyable''
overview written with ``a fine awareness of light's appeal to our
esthetic senses.''
 &UR; Skull Session &QL; 
 &UR; By Daniel Hecht. Signet, $6.99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-work teacher with Tourette's syndrome, hired to fix up
a vandalized Hudson Valley estate, finds that the damage may be
linked to some missing high-school students. This is ``an
accomplished first novel . . . that keeps the reader guessing till
the very end,'' Charles Salzberg said here this year. _Scott Veale

 SEXUAL McCARTHYISM 
 Clinton, Starr, and the Emerging Constitutional Crisis 
 By Alan M. Dershowitz 
 Basic Books, $23 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who eagerly defended O. J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow
has little good to say about anyone involved in the investigation
of President Clinton. America's most vigorous and least
self-effacing legal commentator, Alan M. Dershowitz, feels that
this inquiry is rooted in dubious politics, that Kenneth Starr has
pushed it too far and that Clinton's evasions do not justify his
impeachment. For the White House, however, this is only tepid
comfort. A self-proclaimed Democrat and Clinton supporter,
Dershowitz nonetheless rips ruthlessly through what he calls a
``remarkable series of blunders'' committed by Clinton, his
advisers and his lawyers. When Paula Jones sued, Dershowitz argues,
the President should simply have filed no answer. Taking a default
judgment might have minimized embarrassment and cost as little as
$25,000 (versus the $850,000 Clinton has now agreed to pay), as
well as denied prosecutors their grounds for hunting obstructions
of justice. In needless litigation, Clinton recklessly fought his
way to where his lawyers should never have let him go, the point
where lies and denials risked perjury charges. The only mercy shown
in ``Sexual McCarthyism'' (which collects five years of columns and
opinion pieces) is its reluctance to say that Clinton's ``sex
lies'' actually constituted perjury. Dershowitz chides Paula Jones,
ridicules Monica Lewinsky, second-guesses Clinton's lawyers, paints
Starr as a minion of the tobacco lobby and damns Clinton himself
for weakening criminal defendants' rights, censoring the Internet
and opposing gay marriage. Dershowitz eloquently vents his scorn --
shared by many -- for the mirthless satire that the Starr
investigation has become. _Allen D. Boyer

 Grown Up All Wrong 
 75 Great Rock and Pop Artists From Vaudeville to Techno 
 By Robert Christgau 
 Harvard University, $29.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Applying the language and ideas of academic critical theory to
popular music, and adding a good dose of gonzoesque irreverence,
Robert Christgau, the senior music critic at The Village Voice,
created a brand of music writing that inspired a small but fierce
group of critics at alternative weeklies. The subjects in ``Grown
Up All Wrong,'' a collection of previously published pieces,
include Elvis Presley, the punk girl band Sleater-Kinney, the rap
artist KRS-One, the country singer George Jones and the minstrel
singer Emmett Miller, among many, many others. He writes on each
with equal erudition, examining the artists and their music as both
cultural products and influences. No pop act is too weird, arty,
commercial or schlocky for Christgau's contemplation. His
antielitist impulse makes him a likable critic, but his attempt to
straddle the ivory tower and bohemia produces a labored writing
style that tends to grate. Alliteration and contrived rhythms
abound (think Derrida meets Wolfman Jack), as do academic
hand-me-down-words like ``bricolage'' and ``pomo.'' In the end,
however, the results are brilliant; his exploration of the Rolling
Stones' relationship to black music, for example, is enlightening.
And though Christgau mostly writes about the ``human beings
rock-and-roll'' creates for him, whenever he pauses to offer a
close reading of music, the results invariably satisfy. _Laura
Jamison

 AFFIRMATIVE ACTS 
 Political Essays 
 By June Jordan 
 Anchor/Doubleday, paper, $12.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike so many other radicals of her generation, June Jordan has
not abandoned her revolutionary fervor. Whether protesting the gulf
war, the verdict in the Rodney King case or the end of affirmative
action at the University of California, where she teaches
African-American studies at the Berkeley campus, Jordan remains
earnestly engaged in left-wing causes. ``Affirmative Acts,'' her
new collection of essays, many of which are interspersed with
poems, is an interesting, if uneven, analysis of those and other
pitched battles of the decade _ the conflict in Bosnia, the
implementation of workfare, the appointment of Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court. Jordan is at her best when she uses personal
experience to bolster her arguments for political change. An essay
about the need for more breast cancer research is emboldened by a
frank discussion of her mastectomy. Similarly, a vivid, haunting
poem about being raped _ once by a white friend in East Hampton,
and then, some time later, by the head of her local N.A.A.C.P. _
aids her development of a polemics of resistance. Not all of these
efforts to intertwine her private and public lives are equally
successful. ``Root Canal to the Future of Women'' is a far-fetched
attempt to extract political significance from her oral surgery;
likewise, ``My Mess and Ours'' draws a gratuitous parallel between
Jordan's penchant for organizing her home and that of Americans for
compartmentalizing and ignoring social ills. Also problematic is
Jordan's frequent use of the overwrought prose of politically
correct cliche. Still, her lyric writing is a powerful mix of the
inspirational and the dispiriting. ``Revolution,'' she writes,
``means telling the truth.'' _Johanna Berkman

 CHARLES AT FIFTY 
 By Anthony Holden 
 Random House, $24.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Prince Charles. For the last 20 years, Anthony Holden has
been his unwanted and dogged shadow as the author of two previous
biographies, the second of which Charles called ``fiction from
beginning to end.'' This new one, ``Charles at Fifty,'' is irksome
from beginning to end. Holden, who also wrote ``Diana: Her Life and
Her Legacy,'' makes his feelings for the late Princess of Wales _
``the innocent young girl'' whose ``habitual candor was
delightful'' _ as clear as the Queen's English. ``What kind of man
could throw away such a pearl?'' he asks. He tells us: one with ``a
built-in selfishness'' who forced his paramours to ``call him
'Sir,' even in moments of intimacy.'' In other words (which Holden
is all too glad to supply), a man who has a ``butterfly mind.'' And
those ears! Holden writes that Charles had been told point blank by
Earl Mountbatten, ``You can't possibly be King with ears like
that.'' While Holden certainly does his best to keep the reader
from adoring his subject, it is impossible not to feel sad for
Charles, the little prince whose ``first word was not 'Mama' but
'Nana,' '' for his nanny. ``What is it about Charles that seems to
have made him his own worst enemy?'' Holden wonders. What, indeed!
With biographers like Holden, why turn on yourself? _Andrea Higbie

<TEXT>
<P>
   Infants, as the French ethnologist Alain Epelboin observes in
the preface to BABIES CELEBRATED (Abrams, $39.95), are the
``tyrant-kings'' of most cultures, and some 200 color photographs
in this glossy volume prove his point well. With the guidance of 16
cultural anthropologists, the authors, Beatrice Fontanel and Claire
d'Harcourt, explore _ in words and in photographs collected from
numerous sources _ the many ways that anxious parents around the
world clothe, feed, soothe, transport, bathe and otherwise protect
and placate the fussiest members of their societies. Readers will
find no end of exotic traditions: diapers made of yak hair and
camel dung, the smoke ``baths'' given to Australian aborigine
babies, the smearing of soot and yak butter on the infant's
fontanel in Tibet. Here, too, are the elaborate predecessors of the
Snugli: fur-lined in Siberia, beaded in Senegal, gorgeously
embroidered in Guizhou, China. The authors note that a pervading
concern in these societies, as in our own, is the fragility of
small children. In many parts of South America, Africa and Asia,
where infant mortality is high, babies are viewed as ``vagabond
souls'' who may, at any moment, wander out the door of earthly
life. Hence, in Burkina Faso, Vietnam, Yemen and elsewhere,
necklaces, bracelets and cords are strung around a baby's body as a
means of tying the child to life. Some readers, particularly
parents, may find practicality behind the symbolism _ the bright
red pompoms adorning the headgear of Yao babies in Thailand, for
example, may attract good fortune but also serve as effective head
bumpers. Coins, beads and shells dangling from baby carriers and
clothing, used to ward off evil in many cultures, provide a
comforting distraction as well. _Suzanne MacNeille

 BEYOND THE LIMBO SILENCE 
 By Elizabeth Nunez 
 Seal Press, cloth, $24; paper, $12.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she leaves her native Trinidad on a scholarship to the
College of the Sacred Heart for Women in Oshkosh, Wis. (a town that
``had no Negroes, so it had no Negro problem''), Sara Edgehill, the
fragile protagonist of Elizabeth Nunez's second novel, has
apprehensions about America. Her ambivalence is echoed by her
grandmother: ``Listen to me. America is like the sea. You think
it's good. You think you can swim in it and you'll be safe. . . .
But when you're not looking, not thinking about it, America can
drown you like the sea.'' Indeed, in this year of 1963, the civil
rights struggle in the South is revealing America's ugliest
undercurrents. When Sara becomes involved with Sam Maxwell, a black
law student and political activist from Milwaukee, racial awareness
and painful family truths bubble to the surface _ most notably the
lynching of a great-uncle who immigrated to America years earlier
and the tragedy of Sara's white great-grandmother, who was
institutionalized after falling in love with an African obeah man,
or voodoo priest, in Trinidad. Sara's own mental balance is further
threatened as Sam becomes embroiled in events in Mississippi,
especially after the disappearance of his colleagues, the real-life
Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney. Eventually, Sara succumbs to the sea
of emotions, both personal and racial, that engulfs her during her
first year in this cold and colorless land _ even as the novel
sinks under the weight of an interior language of ancestral
mysticism._Anderson Tepper

 BLAST FROM THE PAST 
 By Kinky Friedman 
 Simon and Schuster. $23 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kinky Friedman has achieved cult status by being ingratiatingly
offensive, both with his country band, Kinky Friedman and the Texas
Jewboys, (cq) and with his superbly silly series of detective
novels, which mix real and fictional characters and feature
Friedman himself as a funky private eye, operating out of a
Manhattan loft with the help of his buddies, the Village
(Greenwich, that is) Irregulars. Friedman has raised political
incorrectness to something like an art form, but with such patent
good will that only the most humorless could disapprove. ``Blast
From the Past'' is a prequel to Friedman's previous books, shifting
back to the 1970's to show how the Kinkster got started as a
detective. This time around, the cast includes a Vietnam casualty
who returns from the grave, Abbie Hoffman (fleeing the Feds under
the name of Barry Freed) and a band called the Shalom Retirement
Village People. The ``mystery'' is of the flimsiest and wouldn't
mystify an idiot, being merely an excuse for Friedman to show off
his inspired tomfoolery. From beginning to end, the Kinkster keeps
the gags coming fast and thick. If this kind of stuff makes you
laugh, then you'll like ``Blast From the Past.'' And what's not to
like, anyway? _Brooke Allen

 OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE 
 By Peter Farrelly 
 Main Street/Doubleday, paper, $12.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of ``Outside Providence,'' someone asks the novel's
narrator, Tim Dunphy, ``Ain't you gonna say something funny?'' When
Tim responds with ``I'm gonna miss you,'' his questioner replies,
``That supposed to be funny?'' ``No,'' Tim counters, ``it's
supposed to be sad.'' It's easy to imagine Peter Farrelly,
co-writer and co-director of the movie ``Dumb and Dumber,'' having
the same exchange with his readers. Those who expect slapstick
guffaws will be surprised to find that much of ``Outside
Providence'' is quite grim. Its central character, the
aforementioned Tim, is wallowing in working-class Pawtucket, R.I.
Looking to improve his son's lot, Tim's father cashes in a whole
lot of favors and manages to get him into a tony boarding school,
Cornwall Academy _ which turns out to be no less hazardous than
Pawtucket, except the kids have more money and fewer morals. Tim
and his girlfriend are exceptions: though not angelic, they're
honest, compassionate and don't make as many jokes about
flatulence. Tim survives Cornwall, but the novel struggles there,
since it's hard to make a story about brutish boarding school
students seem fresh. Fortunately, Farrelly also spends a good deal
of time in Pawtucket, where his descriptions are raw and unnerving
_ and as mesmerizing as a traffic accident. _Liam Callanan

 No 
 By Carl Djerassi 
 University of Georgia, $24.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renu Krishan, a Madras-born, American-educated Ph.D., is sent to
Israel by her department head at Brandeis University to work on a
reproduction research project. While there, she falls in love with
Jephtah Cohn, a sabra who is her fellow researcher. Together, they
discover that nitric oxide (NO) can help cure male impotence. From
this starting point, Carl Djerassi, the originator of the
contraceptive pill as well as the author of a number of novels in
what he calls the ``science-in-fiction'' genre, follows the growth
of an international vogue for this new wonder drug. Djerassi
peoples his pages with scholar-scientists both dedicated and
conniving, jackal lawyers and Nobelists with surprisingly sharp
eyes for profit. The author himself has a sharp eye for his female
characters, especially Renu. All this should have added up to
great, readable fun, except that ``NO'' often appears to have been
hastily slapped together, with depressingly obvious seams in a
choppy narrative. It's as if Djerassi had pulled the draft of an
earlier work off the shelf and given it the once-over-lightly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   First published in France in 1986 as ``Le Pierrot Noir,'' Roger
Grenier's spare and elegant novel, ANOTHER NOVEMBER (University of
Nebraska, cloth, $40; paper, $12), is a meditation on personal and
political loyalties. The unnamed narrator reminisces about Pau, in
southwestern France, where he and his friends grew up at the time
of the Spanish Civil War. When World War II comes to France, the
stresses of the Occupation bring out the essential characteristics
of each individual, particularly those of Charles Merlin, the
richest boy in town and the most spoiled. Charles's collaboration
with the Nazis is not so much an ethical collapse as a confirmation
that morals are as nothing to him when measured against his
personal comfort. In contrast, the narrator performs admirably in
the Resistance (as did Grenier in real life), but his heroism is
related in an offhand manner, as if it were not a choice but
something inevitable _ ``It wasn't much.'' Seamlessly translated by
Alice Kaplan, the novel is built around the recurring image of a
carousel at the St. Martin's fair, which comes to town every
November. Among its other attractions are a Pierrot figure who
wears black silk instead of the star-struck lover's lunar white
and, conversely, a boat ride with gondolas that are painted white
rather than the jet black of the Venetian originals. These devices
suggest that life is not what it seems; yet the melancholy tone of
``Another November'' appears to exist not because a thing can prove
to be its opposite but because in the end there are no surprises.

 The Greatest Generation 
 By Tom Brokaw 
 Illustrated. 390 pp. 
 New York:Random House. $24.95  The Class of '45 
 By Michael Lind 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In the spring of 1984,'' Tom Brokaw writes in the introduction
to ``The Greatest Generation,'' ``I went to the northwest of
France, to Normandy, to prepare an NBC documentary on the 40th
anniversary of D-Day.'' Prepared for a conventional assignment,
Brokaw, the anchor of ``NBC Nightly News,'' went through what he
describes as ``a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches
with the American veterans . . . I was deeply moved and profoundly
grateful for all they had done.'' Brokaw found himself recalling
his childhood on an Army base in Igloo, S.D.: ``The grown-ups all
seemed to have a sense of purpose. . . . Whatever else was
happening in our family or neighborhood, there was something
greater connecting us all, in large ways and small.''
</P>
<P>
   What Brokaw calls his ``missionary zeal for the men and women of
World War II'' is admirable, but missionary zeal and historical
fact are not always compatible. With the best of intentions, he
reinforces two myths -- the myth that World War II was an
uncontroversial war, and the myth of generations. Brokaw writes:
``The Vietnam War deeply divided not only the country but the World
War II generation as well.'' But the World War II generation had
earlier been divided -- by World War II. On the eve of Pearl Harbor
only 31 percent of Americans were willing to go to war against
Germany and Italy. Once the war began, dissent was suppressed.
``They faced great odds and a late start,'' Brokaw writes of
Americans during World War II, ``but they did not protest.'' In
fact, many of the leaders of anti-cold-war protests, like the
pacifist A. J. Muste and the poet Robert Lowell, had protested
American intervention in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II generation, Brokaw writes, ``made breakthroughs
in medicine and other sciences. They gave the world new art and
literature. They came to understand the need for Federal civil
rights legislation. They gave America Medicare.'' Generations do
not discover cures or write books. And why give credit for civil
rights legislation and Medicare to an entire cohort, rather than to
the liberals who backed these reforms -- particularly when the
reforms were opposed by conservative veterans of World War II?
Equally questionable is Brokaw's attempt to contrast the values of
the World War II generation with those of later generations.
``There is a common theme of pride in all that they've accomplished
for themselves, their families and their country, and so little
clamor for attention, given all they've done.'' In 1980, 77 percent
of Vietnam veterans agreed: ``Looking back, I am glad I served my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in ``The Greatest Generation'' Brokaw succeeds in his
goal of memorializing the experiences of representative Americans
in the deadliest war in history. As he notes, ``They were proud of
what they accomplished but they rarely discussed their experiences,
even with each other.'' It is a tribute to Brokaw's skill as a
reporter that he has managed to elicit so many memorable stories
from reticent people.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw recounts the heroism in combat of people like the Navy
medic Bob Bush, who lost an eye and suffered serious wounds during
the fight to take Okinawa while holding off Japanese troops and
administering plasma to a fallen marine. Much of the book, though,
is devoted to Americans who contributed to the war effort in less
conventionally heroic ways -- like Dorothy Haener, whose wartime
work in industry led to a career as a United Auto Workers
organizer, and Mary Louise Roberts, whose medical unit, offered the
option of leaving the combat zone of Anzio, ``decided if the
infantry was going to stay, we were going to stay.'' Noting the
irony that the United States fought against racist Germany with a
segregated military, Brokaw describes how black Americans fought
both the enemy and discrimination: Martha Settle Putney, a WAC,
``remembers to this day the anger she felt when a group of German
officers, who were P.O.W.'s at a garrison in the Des Moines area,
were invited into the the Fort Des Moines officers' club while the
black officers were barred.''
</P>
<P>
   The wartime experiences and subsequent careers of celebrity
politicians and journalists are amply recounted, but it is the
ordinary American heroes that linger in the memory. Brokaw takes us
to ``Kerry Corner, the Irish working-class neighborhood not far
from the leafy sanctuary of Harvard Yard'' and introduces us to the
Romeo Club (Retired Old Men Eating Out). ``None became a highly
decorated hero or senior officer, but the boys of Kerry Corner, and
millions more like them from neighborhoods across the country, were
the muscles and bones of the U.S. armed forces,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most moving story is that of Daphne Cavin, a
beautician in Lebanon, Ind., whose husband, Raymond Kelley, went to
war only months after their marriage and was killed in France in
June 1944 at the age of 22. Daphne had children in a later
marriage, but keeps a scrapbook called ``Lost Love Remembered.''
Among its contents is a sonnet Daphne had written that Raymond was
carrying when he was killed. It begins: ``When you come home once
more to me, /
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, dear, that I shall be /
</P>
<P>
   Articulate; the words I've wanted so /
</P>
<P>
   To say, I'll try in vain to speak.'' Brokaw says, ``The paper on
which it is written is stained with the blood of his mortal
wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw writes that ``no block of marble or elaborate edifice can
equal their lives of sacrifice and achievement, duty and honor, as
monuments to their time.'' In ``The Great Generation,'' he has
compiled a moving scrapbook as a tribute to the members of the
World War II generation to whom we Americans and the world owe so
much.

   WEATHERWRAP _ ATLANTA _ Winter's harsh debut has resulted in
three deaths in Texas and plunging temperatures across the nation.
A homeless person froze to death in Austin and two more people were
killed in a 50-car collision on icy I-35 in the Texas capital. And
in North Carolina, high temperatures tumbled 40 degrees from the
low 70s
</P>

   Tuesday to 33-34 degrees. The story will be 12-15 inches and
will move by 8 p.m. EST. WITH PHOTOS

   SARALEE-RECALL _ At least one person in Georgia has been
sickened with listeria, the bacteria that is forcing Sara Lee to
recall cold cuts and hot dogs nationwide. CDC is investigating four
deaths _ three elderly people and a fetus _ and more cases are
likely, because the illness has a three-week incubation period.
It's unclear how much meat is involved or whether it just involves
meat that might have been sold in a grocery story or meats that
would have been sold as sandwiches in cafeterias and delis. (Kim,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BUSH-PRESIDENT _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In public _ in the kinds of
things political advisers politically advise _ and in private _ in
the kinds of things your mother tells you to do _ uncandidate
George W. Bush is doing the kinds of things a presidential
candidate does. Texans saw it recently when he named longtime and
trusted family friend Chase Untermeyer as chairman of the State
Board of Education and when State Insurance Commissioner Elton
Bomer moved over to the governor's staff. And one man in Davenport,
Iowa saw it recently when the governor of Texas thought it was
important to offer long-distance congratulations on the birth of a
child. Bush insists he is still undecided on whether to run, but
the Iowa dad said Bush sounds like a candidate. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   IRELAND-BANISHEDBABIES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Between 1949
and 1973, at least 2,200 babies born to unwed mothers are known to
have been spirited out of Ireland and adopted to families in the
United States. Many birth records were altered and many
intentionally misplaced. Church and state acknowledge they
conspired to keep the secrets. ``You have to understand that to
have a child out of wedlock in Catholic Ireland back in the '50s
was the most heinous thing you could do,'' says Bill Neylon. ``It
was considered shameful and despicable. It was a mortal sin in the
eyes of the government as well as the church.'' Neylon, a
44-year-old West Palm Beach physical trainer, was one of the 2,200
who would become known as the ``banished babies'' of Ireland.

   INTERNET-PIGS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's got a pig picture
gallery. It's got Paul Thompson's views on the benefits of playing
music for pigs. It's even got a little section on pig humor.
Welcome to www.pigfarmer.com. The 6-month-old site was set up by
Thompson's daughter and son-in-law in response to the Stuart pig
farmer's continuing problems with his golf community neighbor.

   MYLAN-LAWSUIT _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When she went to the drug store
last spring for her monthly $30 prescription, Barbara Gamsu was
``horrified'' to learn the price had more than tripled. Her generic
anti-anxiety medication, lorazepam, now cost $96.85. ``The people
all knew me at the drug store, so I had a fit right there at the
counter,'' Gamsu recalled Tuesday. ``'What the heck is going on
here?!' This was a generic drug.'' The indignation of Gamsu and
countless other lorazepam customers will surface in court through
lawsuits filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 10 state
attorneys general. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: One America elected Clinton, another America
impeached him
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America that impeached President Bill Clinton is strikingly
different from the America that re-elected him just two years ago _
far whiter, far more male, far less female.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are a disturbing feature of the House's action.
In effect, the decision to remove the president from office was
made by the America that voted not to re-elect him in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Run the numbers in three key categories: Clinton's re-election
voters were 58 percent female, 17 percent African American and 31
percent white male. Of the 228 House members who voted to impeach
the president, all but 17 were white and male _ 92.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the impeachment electorate was female and, of
course, the single black vote for impeachment was an infinitesimal
.004 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The skewered demography was there from the get-go, in the
Judiciary Committee as it took up impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 committee Republicans are white. Only one is a woman.
None is black. Nearly half come from the South. Of the 16 Democrats
in the committee, five are African American, three are women. The
Democratic muster leaned to the northeast states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those disparities were sustained when the issue moved to
the full House. Only the regional tilt was righted. (Twenty-five
percent of Clinton's re-election vote came from the 11 former
Confederate states; ditto impeachment.)
</P>
<P>
   This impeachment, when you get right down to it, was the work of
a bunch of 55-year-old white guys sitting around talking to
themselves, and talking themselves into it.
</P>
<P>
   No one could expect that the impeachment vote would be a perfect
match with the electorate or an exquisite microcosm of the
population at large. But disparities this great, especially when
combined with the overwhelming partisanship of the vote, go a way
toward explaining why the radical decision to unhorse the president
strikes so many Americans as inauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   A representative democracy like ours can take a lot of
roughhousing. As mean and defamatory politics has been in recent
years, it still hasn't hit the low set by the richly slanderous
election of 1800 that sent Thomas Jefferson to the White House,
with Sally Hemmings as the Monica Lewinsky of her time. No
journalist these days would write the billingsgate the opposition
press routinely heaved at Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drift of the Republican Party into hard-shell
ideology, computer-driven reapportionments that are making more
purely Democratic and purely Republican districts and the now
common resort to personally and mutually destructive political
campaigns are driving large numbers of voters out of the system and
leaving it disproportionately to eager disputants.
</P>
<P>
   To those strains add, now, a divisive impeachment carried out by
a cadre that is not even close to being representative of the
American citizenry. We are, all in all, giving our political system
as severe a testing as it has faced since its breakdown into civil
war. It is a testing prudent managers would have never let happen.

   STORE-GATES (New York) _ Unconsoled by recent drops in reported
crime, store owners in New York City continue to seal their
investments each night behind riot-proof shields that first
appeared in great numbers here during the late 1960s. The
persistence of this riot-proofing is a sign that retailers, like
old generals, are still stubbornly fighting the last war. But a new

   NEA-ROBBINS (Undated) _ After years under congressional siege _

Endowment for the Arts, whose budget was finally secured in
September, might understandably be looking for steady ground to
tread. But under the leadership of a new chairman, William J. Ivey,
who has said that he believes the endowment should be as important
as the Department of Defense, the NEA is marching, not slinking, to
the front lines in its support of the arts. On Tuesday, Ivey
announced the bold appointment of Mark Robbins, a curator, teacher
and artist, as the new design director, a position that has been
vacant for more than 18 months. By Julie V. Iovine.

   FLOWER-ARRANGING (New York) _ Japanese women coming to New York
for lessons in flower arranging seems as absurd as New Yorkers
going to Tokyo for rudeness seminars. Three centuries ago, when
forest covered Manhattan, the art of floral design called ikebana
flourished in Japan, where the intricate craft is still revered as
a national treasure, like the tea ceremony. By Jessica Siegel.

   VIRTUAL-APARTMENTS (Undated) _ Let's say you're a developer with
a pile of rubble where a new building is going to be. How do you
move those multimillion-dollar three bedrooms before you can say,
``The stock market's down 512 points again''? In the old days, you
rented an office (preferably ground floor) in a fancy location, put
some easels around the room, stuck up architects' renderings and
handed out embossed brochures _ and coffee. But now there's virtual
reality _ the catchall term for computer-generated videos that
mimic a visit to an existing or still-imagined building. It is
becoming part of a growing number of sales pitches. By Tracie
Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   HOMEMADE-WINE (Minneapolis) _ Looking at a wish book from
Semplex of U.S.A., one of the country's leading specialty houses,
serving amateur winemakers since 1962, I spied a $154.25 trilevel
Steam Juice Extractor imported from Finland and used to crush
grapes painlessly and efficiently. I also noticed the $389 Buon
Vino Super Jet Filter, an Italian import capable of pumping 80
gallons of wine an hour. But no way was I buying any of it. My
family has its own claptrap tin wine press, which my uneducated
country-boy grandfather quixotically lugged across Europe and to
the United States three generations ago. By Neal Karlen.

HOW THE NET CHANGES THE ANCIENT GAME OF GO

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Asian board game of Go was the game of the samurai. Among
noble accomplishments for Chinese gentlemen, Go ranked with
calligraphy, poetry and music. For centuries, Go has been used as a
tool to teach military strategy. It is the game from which Japanese
businessmen draw metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Now Go is on the Internet, and the ancient game's relatively
sudden encounter with modernity has produced a microcosm of the
tension that exists between virtual worlds and the real one.
</P>
<P>
   Go players can now log onto a computer and play 24 hours a day.
The advent of online Go has erased barriers of language and
distance, while lifting the game from obscurity in the United
States. At the same time, the online version of the game comes at
the expense of many traditions surrounding its play.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, some local Go clubs, the lifeblood of the
Go-playing world, are suffering a decline in membership as more
people play from their homes via computer.
</P>
<P>
   Go originated in China sometime around 2300 B.C. and was later
adopted by Korea and Japan. The game is played on a board divided
into a grid by 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines. Black and white
pieces called stones are placed on the intersections of the grid.
The object is to win and defend territory by surrounding it with
stones.
</P>
<P>
   Go is an easy game to learn to play, but it is extremely
difficult to master. ``I can teach you the rules in 20 minutes, but
the strategy will take a lifetime,'' said David Saunders, a lawyer
in New York who is an avid player. Go is often compared with chess,
another game of skill and strategy, but Go players are careful to
distinguish between the two. They view chess as one big bloody
skirmish, and Go as an endlessly complex process of negotiating for
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In China, Japan and Korea, Go is a national pastime, and
millions of people play. The United States, by comparison, has
relatively few players. The American Go Association has just 1,300
members.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and most popular virtual venue for playing Go is the
Internet Go Server, or IGS, where hundreds of people _ amateurs and
professionals alike _ from around the world play some 4,500 games
each day (igs.joyjoy.net).
</P>
<P>
   Now owned by NKB, a Japanese communications company, IGS was
created in 1992 by two American Go players, Tim Casey and Mark
Okada. The IGS server is in Tokyo, and Casey and Okada do their
administrative work from northern California.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet connections in Asia have grown more reliable, the
popularity of IGS and other Go servers has soared. Usually at least
250 people are logged on to IGS at any one time. At night in the
United States, as people in Asia are starting their day, the server
really comes to life, with as many as 700 players logged on at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Face-to-face games are surrounded by ritual. Before a game in
Japan, the weaker player says, ``Dozo o ne gai itashi masu''
(``Please teach me''), to the stronger player, accompanied by a
slight bow.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, IGS has all the ambience and decorum of a singles
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast game, anyone?'' flashes onto the computer screen in
``shout'' mode, for all to see. Some non-English speakers simply
send a computer-generated match request to another player. Banter,
some of it related to Go and some of it not, is continuous.
</P>
<P>
   Face-to-face games can last for hours. Every game on IGS is
timed, and many people who play on the server say their games last
about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At a local Go club, when two professionals play, the handful of
spectators are careful to remain quiet and discreet. If two
well-known professionals are playing on IGS, there can be 500
people watching and typing their commentary, which is often very
blunt, into a separate kibitzing channel. The players cannot see
the comments.
</P>
<P>
   For all its intellectual rigor, Go is also very tactile, and its
esthetics are carefully prescribed. The board, often made of a
Japanese fir-like wood called katsura, is a source of pride to its
owner, as are the stones, made of slate and clamshell.
</P>
<P>
   Before being played, each stone is held with practiced precision
between the forefinger and middle finger, and it is placed on the
board with an equally practiced, satisfying clap. All of that
contributes to what players describe as the delight of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pleasure in having that big whap as you put
the stone down feel just right,'' said Lloyd Gowen, a longtime
player who is president of the San Francisco Go Club.
</P>
<P>
   As cyberspace eliminates these dimensions of the game, however,
it adds others.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest appeal of online Go is its convenience.
``You can play Go in your shorts at 3 a.m., if that's your
pleasure,'' said Saunders, who uses the screen name dsaun on IGS.
Saunders is helping to start a scholarship for online lessons for
those who cannot afford professional Go lessons. ``You can find
people your level or stronger or watch people of professional
strength 24 hours a day,'' he said. ``It's a larger universe of
players than any local Go club has.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more players opt to play from home rather than
drive to their local Go club. ``A lot of stronger players have
stopped going to local clubs because it's difficult for them to get
a good game,'' said Okada, a strong player himself whose IGS handle
is simply tweet. ``A lot of them are playing on line because
there's a stronger variety of players to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Straus, 47, the former president of the American Go
Association, discovered IGS. in 1993. ``Suddenly I was able to play
people at any strength I wanted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,'' he
said. Even with the arrival of a a new Go club within walking
distance of his house, Straus said, he prefers to play on IGS.
``It's harder to get away than to find half an hour to play someone
on IGS.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He Jian, a 26-year-old player in Hangzhou, in eastern China,
said he still played a three-hour face-to-face game with a friend
every weekend but had grown addicted to playing on IGS. since he
registered last July. He pays $30 a month for his Internet
connection, one-fifth his monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Celmer, 34, a player who helped organize the Go club in
Chapel Hill, N.C., laments the trend away from face-to-face play.
``It has hurt the intangibles, the romance of the game,'' he said.
Further, Celmer said, local players no longer show up at area
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Celmer recounted the lonely tale of Yoshiteru Suzuki, one of the
strongest players in the area, who started a Go club there last
year. ``There have been times when I have been the only person at
his club,'' Celmer said. ``Here is a man willing to share his time
and formidable skill, yet most do not want to be inconvenienced by
the time it would take to drive to his club. This lack of interest
would never have happened in the days before the Internet, I assure
you. Suzuki's time and skill would have been as precious as gold.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, online Go is helping to attract players who
might not otherwise be interested. Susan Weir, an avid Go player
and a strong proponent of the cognitive benefits of Go playing,
teaches the game to fourth and fifth graders in public schools in
Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On the first Friday of every month, Ms. Weir's students attend a
``cybercamp'' on IGS, where they play people from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing popularity of Go among young people, Ms. Weir
and her husband have started a weeklong summer Go camp on the
Michigan shore, the first of its kind in the United States. At the
camp, only face-to-face games are played.
</P>
<P>
   On-line playing has introduced to the Go-playing world a new set
of troubles, which may be intrinsic to online life but have
stripped the game of much of its dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaters _ players who consult books or have someone sitting in
for them _ are one problem. So-called escapers _ people who vanish
into cyberspace as soon as they start losing _ are another.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the problem of escapers, the IGS administrators
imposed a new rule: if an interrupted game is not completed within
30 days, the person who dropped out takes a loss. ``You see lots of
shenanigans,'' Okada said. ``It's no different from other corners
of cyberspace but still out of character for the Go-playing
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether on line or off, Go playing is likely to remain human to
human for many years to come. Unlike chess, Go has yet to succumb
to the computational muscle that helped Deep Blue, a chess-playing
computer, beat the world's best chess player in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   An expert Go-playing computer program must be able not only to
analyze moves but also to recognize complex patterns. Piet Hut, an
astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., and a fan of the game, said it could be several decades
before a computer could beat an expert human player at Go.
</P>
<P>
   IGS isn't for everyone. For one thing, Internet connections are
still expensive in some parts of Asia, especially China, where 20
to 30 people often share one IGS account. For elderly retirees in
Japan, who are among Go's most avid players and have no trouble
finding an opponent, the Internet is not just unwanted but
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like Philip W. Anderson, a Nobel-prize-winning
physicist at Princeton University, IGS is simply a bad fit.
Anderson has played Go for 45 years and began playing on line four
years ago. ``I find playing on the Net very frustrating because I
don't visualize patterns well on the small screen,'' he said. ``And
I think I play a couple of ranks below my true strength as judged
by nonvirtual games.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hsiang, an engineering professor at the University of
Rochester who is one of the strongest amateur players in this
country, said IGS had improved his game, mostly because of the ease
with which he can observe professionals' games and play against
stronger players.
</P>
<P>
   But playing on the Net, he said, has also encouraged some bad
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet games tend to be fast,'' Hsiang said. ``One major
disadvantage is the tendency to play sloppily.'' Earlier this year,
Hsiang represented the United States in the World Amateur
Championship in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hsiang held his own quite well in the first seven rounds, he
said. Winning his final game would have made him the third-ranked
amateur in the world. But while he was leading by a wide margin, he
made a careless mistake and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be attributed to my Net habit,'' Hsiang said. ``But,
of course, if I had not been practicing on the Net, I would
probably have never gotten that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Players like Hsiang still show up at the big tournaments. At
next year's annual Go Congress, to be held in San Francisco in
July, as many as 400 people are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still get a charge out of face-to-face contact,
conversations and direct, over-the-board competition,'' Straus
said. ``That says to me that people have a craving for physical
community.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Go Server, or IGS, is the Jones Beach of virtual Go
parlors. It's wall-to-wall players. At peak times, as many as 700
people can be logged on at once, some flexing their muscles, others
just lounging around and taking in the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is relatively easy to carve out a spot for yourself.
You can take an online lesson or watch one. You can observe a match
between professional players or watch a replay of an old match. It
is also very easy to find someone of your strength to play with. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can reach IGS with the telnet command. (Windows 95, 98 and
NT machines have telnet software already installed, but Macintosh
computers do not.) Telnet software is also available on the Web. A
variety of Windows telnet programs are listed at
www.davecentral.com/telnetclnt.html, and Macintosh programs can be
found at www.cstone.net/rbraun/mac/telnet and
www.macatawa.org/mthomas/telnet.html.
</P>
<P>
   To play the game with a realistic picture of a Go board,
download software from the IGS Web site (igs.joyjoy.net). Then,
connect via telnet by typing in the host name igs.joyjoy.net 6969.
IGS is free for all players outside Japan. Most players in Japan
must pay $20 a month, or $2 per game.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a less crowded spot than IGS for your Go
match, there is Yahoo's gaming area, games.yahoo.com, which uses a
Java-based applet for playing. Go is also available at Microsoft's
MSN Gaming Zone, zone.msn.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo and Microsoft sites are not for serious Go players.
Unlike IGS, they have no rating system, and there are no official
tournaments. That's good for rank beginners, who might feel a bit
intimidated by the IGS crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are also several IGS lookalikes, accessible through
telnet. One, called the No Name Go Server, or NNGS, is available by
telnetting to nngs.cosmic.org 9696. It looks exactly like IGS, but
far fewer players go there.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Scores of Iowa middle-school students were
squirming on a recent afternoon as they inspected tumors inside a
colon as part of a career-information seminar about the medical
profession.
</P>
<P>
   The students, however, were not even in the same room as the
diseased colon _ or the same county, for that matter. The hundred
or so middle schoolers were spread out all over the state, at six
different schools.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the colon, preserved in a jar in Des Moines, as
well as the reactions (``Gross!'' and ``Cool!'') were carried over
hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable that make up the Iowa
Communications Network, which is nearly a decade old but is still
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the state-owned and operated network, the only one
of its kind in the nation, was pushed forward by a group of state
legislators during the administration of Gov. Terry E. Branstad in
1990. Approved and paid for with hundreds of millions of dollars by
the Iowa Legislature, the network links Iowa's 99 counties,
enabling the instantaneous transmission of two-way interactive
video, data and audio communications.
</P>
<P>
   The network began as an educational tool for the state's
schools; the goal was to open up opportunities for rural Iowa. The
idea of children in rural Iowa taking foreign-language classes via
the network struck state leaders as a prime example of how
opportunities afforded to students in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids
could be made available to those in rural Inwood.
</P>
<P>
   The network could go a long way toward satisfying an Internet
user's lust for bandwidth _ technojargon for the size of the
pipeline that carries data to and from a computer. The more
bandwidth a user has _ the fatter the pipeline between the computer
and the Internet _ the faster and more useful that computer is.
</P>
<P>
   And a fiber optic network is a fat, fat pipeline. While that fat
pipeline is now available to only a limited number of public and
educational institutions, there is a public debate about expanding
that availability and about the state's role as a communications
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   City and county governments want to be included in the network,
and there is even talk of forging public-private partnerships that
would make the network available for more private uses.
</P>
<P>
   The network has wired the state with cables made of individual
strands of optical fiber spiraled together. Harold M. (Tommy)
Thompson, the chief operating officer of the network, said that
while an entire encyclopedia could be downloaded in 38 minutes with
a copper T-1 line, one of the fastest widely available means of
connecting to the Internet, the Iowa network could transmit the
same information in 1{ minutes. He said he hoped that financing
would be allocated to update the network, tripling its bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that since the network's inception, the state
has spent close to $300 million to build and run it. That includes
$178 million for the original cable that wired every county, plus
an additional $95 million for the current effort to wire every
school, which would put all the state's residents closer to a
network access point.
</P>
<P>
   Even though federal and state agencies pay for network access,
rate subsidies and the expense of building up the network are
costing the state around $25 million a year. To encourage
educational uses, the state subsidizes the service for schools,
charging public and private elementary and high schools an hourly
fee of $5.25 for two-way interactive video; public and private
universities pay $6.30 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries' rates are similar. Hospitals and state and federal
agencies are charged $45.50 an hour, which is what providing the
service costs the state. To use the network for phone calls and
Internet hookups, users pay the network for production costs, which
varies depending on the kind of hookup.
</P>
<P>
   Private individuals and businesses cannot gain access to the
network under the state law governing it. The legislature has
refused to pass several bills that would widen access by allowing
city and county governments to participate. (Some counties are
already connected for law enforcement and disaster services.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite some public grumbling over the network's costs, its
advocates insist that the investment will be well worth it and that
costs are dropping as usage expands.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has run the network for four years, said: ``In
addition to direct savings that the network creates for state
agencies _ for example, phone service that they don't pay private
sector rates for _ there are savings that are impossible to
quantify, such as savings from a sick veteran not having to leave
his hospital to see a specialist. Those kinds of things you just
can't price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows if fiber optics will continue to be desirable as a
high-bandwidth Internet conduit as technology changes; cable modems
and wireless technology, among others, are also strong contenders.
But Thompson said the Iowa network would remain valuable for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, maybe 25 years from now there will be a new
technology and somebody will be able to do what we're doing better
and cheaper,'' he said. ``If that's the case, we'll try to position
ourselves so that we can adapt to any of those changes, but it's
pretty far in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Though born as a tool for education, the Iowa network has been
tapped for telemedicine, telejustice (a term coined by Iowa
judicial officials) and even military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Twedt, an administrative judge, used to spend hundreds
of hours on the road conducting parole revocation hearings. Now
Twedt travels down a flight of steps in the Polk County Courthouse
in Des Moines to a former conference room that has been transformed
into a network video room, equipped with a monitor, camera,
microphone and all the other fixings of a network access point.
There, the judge can listen to three cases in 45 minutes. Twedt
estimated that he could process three times as many cases with the
network than he could before.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Parole Board also uses the network for parole hearings.
That eliminates the travel and security costs previously incurred
with transporting criminals. Twedt said more than 1,000 parole
hearings had been held over the network.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The network is also used in telemedicine. While telemedicine is
practiced in other states as well, the Iowa network makes the most
sophisticated system possible. It allows instantaneous,
high-quality two-way interactive video so the doctor and patient
can talk to each other. Of course, that does not substitute for
face-to-face contact, but it does allow for great technological
leaps.
</P>
<P>
   For example, from his office at the University of Iowa Hospitals
in Iowa City, Dr. Michael Kienzle is able to use the network to
listen to the hearts of patients anywhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to establish a rapport with the patient,''
Kienzle said. ``As a doctor, 80 percent of the information you need
to make a diagnosis comes from conversation with the patient. This
network allows that as though you're sitting in the examining room
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kienzle said that while equipment and maintenance costs for the
network might seem exorbitant, telemedicine saved money.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Iowa, a patient who needs a specialist has four
alternatives, Kienzle points out: not seeking medical attention,
driving to where it is available, seeing a specialist from a city
who periodically visits rural towns or using telemedicine.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient needs immediate attention, the choices are
limited to the last two, and the costs of missed work to family
members and the transportation costs of driving for treatment can
be quite high, Kienzle noted.
</P>
<P>
   The first consultation over Iowa's network was conducted in
early 1997, and several hundred took place in that year. Kienzle
said he expected those numbers to increase a lot as insurance
companies became more comfortable with the practice. In addition to
private patients, Kienzle said, telemedicine is used in Iowa to
treat most prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The network is also used for programs like training seminars for
state workers and a pilot program allowing plastics molders in
private industry to take community college courses to get their
certification more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the National Guard uses the network for
mobilization and emergency services planning. With National Guard
personnel scattered throughout the state, the network lends itself
to military use, network officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders and policy makers can hold meetings over the network,
eliminating travel to a central location near Des Moines, and
training exercises have recently been developed to take advantage
of the network. Thompson said that in the last few months, state
military personnel at different network points around the state had
participated in a war simulation over the network; communications,
tactical maneuvers and strategy were planned and carried out via
the network.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa's network has not been given an easy ride by the state
legislature. There was heavy opposition from the state's
telecommunications industry, which said that with more than 150
long-distance phone companies already operating in Iowa, the
government should not get into the business as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the network's proponents were able to convince the
legislature that to provide service to the whole state, only the
government would be willing to wire areas that might not otherwise
be profitable for private industry.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those involved agree that the state must form some
sort of partnership with the private sector at some point,
expanding the network's availability to private corporations. That
same uneasy telecommunications industry, however, still fears
expanded competition from the state.
</P>
<P>
   And the state wants to maintain its original vision of servicing
all Iowans, regardless of profitability. The solution, optimists
say, is to transfer some operations to the private sector but to
have a state regulatory body make sure that costs remain affordable
and that the service area continues to expand throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that some sort of hybrid arrangement can promote
growth and still accommodate the public good, I would be for it,''
Kienzle said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development officials say they hope that a partnership
will allow the private sector all of the network's advantages and
attract new business to Iowa. But many officials are not so
optimistic because other states, like North Carolina and Wisconsin,
have encountered problems with similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the state runs the network, we only have to break even
and we're not paying taxes and fees _ it's just cheaper,'' Thompson
said. ``If we turn it over to a private carrier, in order for them
to cover costs and then profit, I'm afraid prices will get too
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the legislature has promised $3 million, largely for
subsidies, in the next fiscal year, and Thompson says the network's
technology will continue to push boundaries. That means that
middle-school students will continue to squirm at human innards,
even when they are halfway across the state.

HEART OF MODERN ART, POLLOCK, BEATS LOUDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)

 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON POLLOCK, AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to second- guess the show _ to question, say,
whether the classic years are too tendentious or the last pictures,
like ``Blue Poles,'' are shortchanged. But great exhibitions are
supposed to make you think twice.
</P>
<P>
   This is a landmark survey of a painter whose value, which
remains difficult for many people to grasp, goes to the heart of
what makes modern art modern. Art exhibitions don't usually have
the dramatic pace of theater, but this one does.
</P>
<P>
   The climax comes with the big drip paintings, when the size of
the gallery expands to match the scale of the pictures and the
effect is a little like arriving at a precipice: as the space opens
up, one has a sense of being on the edge of something amazing.
Because it's as cogent and beautiful as it is, the show (organized
by Kirk Varnedoe and Pepe Karmel, on view until Feb. 2) ought to
convert Pollock skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   PIERRE BONNARD, AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With this show Americans had a chance to see why Europeans rank
Bonnard with Picasso and Matisse among painters, although an
equally germane comparison might be Proust, Bonnard having turned
everyday details, the stuff of the life around him, into a
profound, associative art of observation and memory.
</P>
<P>
   John Elderfield, the Modern's curator, made the museum's
basement galleries look good, for once. Bonnard's paintings of his
wife were true elegies of love, and the self-portraits, which ended
the show, were so touching that they broke my heart.
</P>
<P>
   `FLOWERS UNDERFOOT: INDIAN CARPETS OF THE MOGUL ERA,' AT THE
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   Having opened late last year, the show, strictly speaking,
doesn't belong on the list, but it's too good to go unmentioned.
This was a once-in-a-lifetime assemblage of Indian carpets, a
curatorial feat that was historically rich and above all drop-dead
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Daniel Walker, it provided a concise lesson in
Mogul history while delighting the eye. Woven from pashmina or
Himalayan goat's wool and silk, spectacularly colored, the prime
rugs (there were 50 carpets in all, many of them enormous)
represent an imperial civilization at its peak. We are talking
about an art so refined that the most intricately woven Mogul
carpet had 2,100 knots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   GABRIEL OROZCO, AT MARIAN GOODMAN GALLERY
</P>
<P>
   This show (through Jan. 9) is by one of the more ingenious young
artists to come along in a while, who makes unanticipated poetry
out of a Ping-Pong table and turns trash into art. There are also
videos, drawings and a pavilion, with pianos for walls. Part
Surrealist, part Conceptualist, part formalist, Orozco is someone
whose diverse and unpredictable work raises a basic question: what
is the point of looking if you are not open to what you see?
</P>
<P>
   `SACRED ARTS OF HAITIAN VODOU,' AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF
NATURAL HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   A celebration (on view to Jan. 3) of an amazing culture, which
mixes African, European and indigenous New World influences. The
show's success involves the way it bridges the gap between
ethnology and art. While carefully describing the history and
theology of Haitian Vodou, it presents works by painters like
Hector Hyppolite that convey the religion's visual efflorescence _
altogether, in other words, a spiritual and esthetic tour de force.
</P>
<P>
   MARK ROTHKO, AT THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART
</P>
<P>
   It looked better at the Whitney than at the National Gallery in
Washington, whence it came, and it had one unforgettable section:
Rothko's pictures of the early 50s, their ecstatic colors layered
in veils with the quality of breath on a pane of glass. They
conveyed something truly exquisite and mysterious, like fresh love.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ART OF THE MOTORCYCLE,' AT THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up. So what if the show turned the museum into a big
parking-garage ramp? It looked spiffy, attracted more visitors per
day than any exhibition in the Guggenheim's history and was, if not
the blockbuster of the year, then the novelty blockbuster of the
year. It also added to art jargon terms like single-overhead-cam
valve gear with enclosed rockers.
</P>
<P>
   SIGMAR POLKE, AT MICHAEL WERNER GALLERY
</P>
<P>
   With two dozen strange, beautiful new paintings by this
visionary German master, the show (through Jan. 16) is a tiny
fraction of the size of the gigantic, amazing retrospective that
was in Bonn then went to Berlin earlier this year. But a little
Polke is still a lot to contemplate. What he does is always magic:
clever, wild and, from a technical point of view, nearly impossible
to figure out.
</P>
<P>
   These works are perfect examples, their images suspended in
translucent layers of resin, like insects in amber.
</P>
<P>
   `PICASSO AND PHOTOGRAPHY: THE DARK MIRROR,' AT THE MUSEUM OF
FINE ARTS IN HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
   The postcards, cartes de visite and other photographs Picasso
collected somehow escaped widespread scrutiny until this show last
winter, which broke new ground. Picasso turns out to have been
directly inspired by these images when he painted ``Les Demoiselles
d`Avignon.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the exhibition (organized by Anne Baldassari) was
therefore out of proportion to its size, and it confirmed that the
sources of Picasso's genius, like the sources for all great art,
are endless.
</P>
<P>
   BEATRICE WOOD (1893-1998) The ``It'' Girl of the American
avant-garde, Wood, who died on March 12, a few days after her 105th
birthday, made luster-glaze pots that are objects molded in light.
Apart from her art, she was also famous for having been one of the
great American characters: an actress and dancer, she was a
co-founder of the Dadaist journal ``The Blindman'' and a
mischievous romantic who, when she was past 100 told interviewers
that she had become a teetotaler because ``if I was going to be
seduced, I wanted to be sober.''
</P>
<P>
   She became the inspiration for Rose in the film ``Titanic,'' and
James Cameron apparently even thought of casting her in the role.
Too bad he didn't.

<P>
   LAURYN HILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While most hip-hop stayed in a holding pattern, Lauryn Hill of
the Fugees came out with a solo debut album, ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill'' (Ruffhouse/Columbia), that accepts no boundaries. She
raps and sings; she uses rhythm-and-blues, pop, reggae and gospel;
she balances preaching and reminiscences, romance and
self-assertion, single motherhood and a career.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill can sound righteous or utterly unguarded and
heartbroken; throughout the album, her grace matches her
determination. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE RIO PMP300 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A $199, 2.4-ounce, cigarette-pack-size gadget from Diamond
Multimedia announces an era when music will be zapped over the
Internet instead of preserved in plastic. With the Rio, computer
music files in the MP3 format, which can be bounced around the
Internet, become portable outside the computer, without the
physical presence of a cassette or CD.
</P>
<P>
   Major labels have refused to release their catalogs as MP3s, but
CD tracks can easily be compressed into MP3 files; most of the MP3
music on numerous Web sites is unauthorized and free for
downloading. The major labels fear piracy and have sued to get the
Rio off the market. Meanwhile, independent labels, free-thinking
bands and avid fans as well as sleazy bootleggers are taking
advantage of music's new mobility. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALANIS MORISSETTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rock's avenging banshee returned to claim her loyal audience
with an album, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick),
of song therapy: wailing and crooning about all kinds of past
turbulence, from eating disorders to romantic misfires to crippling
depression. She proved that at least one 1990s superstar has a
loyal audience, and on stage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in
October, she sounded even better, supercharging her songs with
bruising Led Zeppelin stomps and seething, spiraling guitars.
Remembered fury still sounded raw. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLOQUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The power of rock, too often taken for granted in the United
States, is just gathering force across Latin America. Bloque, a
band from Colombia, hot-wires local traditions from across Colombia
with funk, hard rock and jazz; it doesn't imitate American and
English styles, it colonizes them. Bloque improved on a superb
album, ``Bloque'' (Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers), with some of the
year's most galvanizing performances in live shows at Fez, making
music that was smart, sly, passionate, funny and utterly committed
to making a significant racket. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOAO GILBERTO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To mark the 40th anniversary of the first bossa nova record,
Gilberto's ``Chega da Saudade,'' the gentle singer and master
guitarist played a few select concerts, including one at Carnegie
Hall during the JVC Jazz Festival. Never raising his voice, smiling
just once, and accompanied only by his own lithe, restlessly
syncopated guitar, he brought to the songs of his youth an older
man's reflections on how fleeting pleasure can be, suffusing them
with the wistful, untranslatable melancholy that Brazilians call
``saudade.'' Subtlety never sounded more profound. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BECK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the mix-and-match overload of ``Odelay,'' Beck proved he
didn't need jack-in-the-box sounds or ironic distance. He took his
band into the studio and, in two weeks, came up with a thoughtful
album, ``Mutations'' (DGC), about ``the end of the end.'' Folksy
but skewed, the music slips free of the dead ends Beck sings
about. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sense of occasion was unmistakable when this confederation
of older-generation Cuban musicians, younger traditionalists and
their catalyst, Ry Cooder, gathered for the Carnegie Hall debut
that few of them had ever expected to make. With the razzle-dazzle
of the pianist Ruben Gonzalez and the fervent voices of Ibrahim
Ferrer and Compay Segundo, the music was courtly and flashy, tinged
with old-fashioned romance and eager showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   It summoned nostalgia for an imaginary pre-revolutionary Havana
of ease and elegance. And it added historical perspective to an
influx of Cuban music that has swept through jazz and _ with
American appearances by top Havana dance bands like Paulito y su
Elite, David Calzado y la Charanga Habanera and N.G. La Banda _
taught salsa fans some new steps. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEARL JAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that one band couldn't unconsolidate the concert
business, finding that its sales weren't always going to be
stratospheric and shedding some self-importance in the process,
Pearl Jam settled into making music. It came up with one of its
best albums, ``Yield'' (Epic), and returned to touring with a
recharged sense of purpose while it played to enough loyalists to
fill arenas. The band sounded magnificent on stage, and a live
album, ``Live on Two Legs'' (Epic), released with little fanfare,
proved it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BURT BACHARACH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wave of rediscovery crested in 1998 for Burt Bacharach, whose
songs are being newly appreciated for their strange, off-center
melodies and the heartbreak (from Hal David's fastidiously morose
lyrics) concealed behind the lilt. Pop hipsters continued to
re-evaluate lounge and easy-listening music; current hit makers
from Sheryl Crow to the Barenaked Ladies gathered to sing Bacharach
tunes on a cable-television special; a boxed set appeared.
</P>
<P>
   And Elvis Costello seized the chance to collaborate with his
idol on an album of new songs, ``Painted From Memory'' (Mercury),
and to sing them on tour. The album and concert were both laborious
near-misses (and reminders of what a brilliant illusion Dionne
Warwick's effortlessness was), but Bacharach's reputation has
definitely been made over. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JANET JACKSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the pop concert spectacle still survives, Janet
Jackson brought the year's most impressive pop revue, ``The Velvet
Rope'' tour, from the arena circuit to HBO. Amid the choregraphy,
hit tunes and lip-synching, Ms. Jackson examined lust and power,
affection and abuse, longing and death. Who needed spontaneity?

PRESERVING NEW MUSIC JUST BECAUSE IT'S THERE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives from the major classical-music recording companies
often speak about their work with a sense of mission. But it is
hard to discern much mission at this time of market glut, as the
major labels seem to flail about, desperately trying to figure out
what will sell.
</P>
<P>
   The glut comes not just from further reduplications of the
standard repertory by heavily promoted new performers but also from
countless reissues of almost anything, and gimmicky collections
like ``The Best of Tchaikovsky'' or ``Ten Tenors in Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the major labels are also issuing many valuable
items, like Philips's series of lesser-known Russian operas
conducted by Valery Gergiev, and RCA's recent, historic nine-disk
collection of performances by the great pianist William Kapell. Yet
for a really tenacious sense of purpose, one should look not to the
major companies, which must, after all, answer to the international
conglomerates that own them, but to small, independent record
labels.
</P>
<P>
   A few _ Albany Records, GM Recordings, Bridge Records and New
World Records _ have staked out a commercially unviable corner of
the repertory, contemporary music and particularly American
contemporary music, and developed notably adventurous catalogues
and telling histories.
</P>
<P>
   If the major labels worry that even a new recording of Ravel may
sell only 1,500 copies, how many copies of a program of chamber
works by the respected but low-profile composer Donald Erb can New
World realistically expect to sell? The same question applies to
Albany's disk of piano music by Benjamin Lees, or GM's recording of
three orchestral works by the Serialist Robert DiDomenica, a rather
hermetic figure in the contemporary-music scene, known perhaps only
for his 1972 opera ``The Balcony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we record is totally based on our vision,'' said Peter
Kermani, the co-owner of Albany Records, which was founded in 1987
in the city of that name. ``We don't care about composers of other
centuries, even composers of today from other countries who are
already well represented by other labels, big and small. We have an
obligation to American composers of our own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the releases from these new-music labels can seem at
times like just more items glutting the market. Critics who
sincerely want to bring attention to worthy contemporary music know
what it is like to have to sort through piles of CDs of works by
unfamiliar composers, many of which are the recording equivalents
of vanity publications by authors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these disks can be exciting, and they fill a crucial need
not just for the field of music but also, some would say, for the
(italics)cause(end italics) of music. Kermani, for one, sees his
label as being essential to the dissemination of new music, given
the pressures on performing ensembles not to overload audiences
with contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   The composer Gunther Schuller, who founded GM Records some 20
years ago as an adjunct to his two publishing companies, takes a
similar view, adding that for better or worse, recordings nowadays
represent ``the real publishing of music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For most composers, paper publication is almost meaningless,
except in terms of rentals of parts,'' Schuller said. ``To publish
a string quartet, for example, is the most ridiculous thing in the
world. To the few players that will want to perform it, a composer
winds up giving copies away. Recordings offer some way to
disseminate this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Good theory, perhaps, but how do these scrappy, idealistic
operations stay solvent?
</P>
<P>
   Not easily, said Kermani. Although Albany has accumulated more
than 300 recordings in just over 10 years, its staff is lean: four
full-time employees with occasional part-time help. Albany also
runs a distribution service for small labels, which brings in
additional income.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of records are actually the primary source of revenue,
and some of them do surprisingly well. A recording of works by
Peter Mennin, who died in 1983 _ the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and
the Fantasia for Strings, performed by the Albany Symphony
Orchestra _ has sold more than 2,000 copies. Another Albany
Symphony disk _ works by Morton Gould, who died in 1996, including
``String Music,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 _ has sold
more than 3,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like this are exceptional, Kermani said, but sales of
1,000 are not unusual. He believes strongly in two recent disks: a
program of songs by Henry Cowell (``nobody knows this music,'' he
said, ``but it's extraordinary''), and a program of choral music by
Ned Rorem, ``Sing My Soul,'' performed by Concora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rorem disk is a beauty,'' Kermani said. ``But even with
Rorem's drawing power, a record of recent choral music will be
lucky to sell 200 copies.'' If that is so, listeners will miss
something, because the music is elegant and fresh, and the
performances are sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Some composers come to Kermani with projects partially financed,
whether by a foundation or by a university at which the composer
teaches. For example, James Yannatos, who directs the
Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, submitted a master tape of his
Symphony No. 4 and Piano Concerto from a concert he had conducted.
``The music was excellent, and the recording was beautiful,''
Kermani said. ``So we released it happily.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside sources of financing sometimes also help Schuller at GM.
But for the first 15 years, he said, he subsidized the company
annually with some $30,000 to $50,000 of his own money. The company
is driven by his conviction that composers have more to gain by
cooperating with one another than by competing.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his championing of Milton Babbitt's ``Transfigured
Notes,'' a 25-minute work for string orchestra, manifests the
intensity of his own commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transfigured Notes,'' which Schuller describes as
``horrendously difficult,'' was commissioned in the mid-1980s by
the Philadelphia Orchestra and scheduled for a premiere under the
baton of Erich Leinsdorf, who reluctantly withdrew after examining
the score. The new-music specialist Dennis Russell Davies was
brought in, but he abandoned the work after only 45 minutes of one
rehearsal. Then the Dutch conductor Hans Vonk took it up and
rehearsed it vigorously before declaring it ``unplayable at the
standard of excellence audiences are entitled to demand of a
professional ensemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt recently spoke of the affair: ``Several of the players
from the orchestra came to me very upset about the whole matter.
They felt that they indeed could play the piece in good time.''

 UNDATED: good time.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But time was the problem. Like most major American orchestras,
the Philadelphia operates in the weekly subscription-series format,
which makes it difficult to devote an exceptionally large amount of
rehearsal time to any one work.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to make a point to the symphony orchestra
establishment as well as to help an important colleague, Schuller
gave the work's premiere with a select group of 43 freelance
players in 1991 at Jordan Hall in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of the piece, though substantial, are not
insurmountable. Schuller likens it to a ``gigantic, multilayered,
collective improvisation,'' comprising restless, nonrepetitive,
overlapping lines. In its shimmering surface colors and slow but
inexorable gait, the music recalls the mood of the seminal work
that inspired it, Schoenberg's ``Transfigured Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuller scheduled 12 rehearsals, financed the concerts himself
and wound up losing $42,000. But the piece was finally given brief
life, and more: a recording drawn from those first performances has
now been released on a disk with Schoenberg's ``Transfigured
Night'' and Stravinsky's Concerto in D.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem admitting that the performance of the
Babbitt is not flawless,'' Schuller said. ``It starts off
wonderfully, but one can hear, about halfway through, the sort of
mental and digital energies of the players draining away. Still, I
felt the performance was presentable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than that: despite its complexity, the music has a
haunting surface beauty, which comes through in the performance.
And as a gesture of principle, the recording is a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge is another label founded by a composer, David Starobin,
who is also a classical guitarist. His wife, Becky Starobin, the
company's managing director, calls the company, now in its 23rd
year, ``our third child.'' And parental care has nurtured it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the budget is supplemented by grants and foundations.
Costs of projects have ranged from a few thousand dollars to
$66,000 for a recording of choral works by Elliott Carter, and what
has resulted is a catalogue of distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Significant releases include a four-disk recording of Morton
Feldman's ``For Philip Guston,'' a vast 1984 homage to the American
painter, performed by the California EAR Unit; recordings of music
by Paul Lansky; the Piano Concerto and Violin Concerto of Richard
Wernick, and a fine new rendition of John Cage's Sonatas and
Interludes for Prepared Piano, performed by Aleck Karis.
</P>
<P>
   The story of New World is significantly different. Other
new-music labels may feel like charities, but New World, in a
sense, (italics)is(end italics) one, complete with a nonprofit tax
status.
</P>
<P>
   The company, headed by Herman Krawitz, was founded by the
Rockefeller Foundation in 1976 as a special project for the
American bicentennial. The stated mission was to release a 100-disk
anthology of Americana, encompassing not just concert music and
opera but also folk and ethnic music, early 20th-century popular
songs and historic recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The anthology was given free to some 7,000 educational
institutions around the world; 2,000 more sets were sold at cost to
like institutions.
</P>
<P>
   By 1978, Krawitz had decided to keep the company going as an
independent label. Since then, financing has come from private and
government foundations (especially a program of the National
Endowment for the Arts that supports first recordings of American
music).
</P>
<P>
   But more than 60 percent of expenses are met by record sales,
this despite the fact that the commercial appeal of a project is
never a factor in deciding to undertake it, according to Paul M.
Tai, the marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mandate has always been American music, particularly
overlooked music, and contemporary works are a major component of
that,'' Tai said. ``This music by nature is not going to be
successful in the marketplace. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The New World catalogue now offers more than 300 recordings, and
it increases by about two disks per month. It is an ``absolutely
fundamental tenet'' that New World records never go out of print,
Tai said. ``We only work with distributors who respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a major label would envy the critical success New World has
enjoyed. Over the years, 17 titles have been nominated for Grammy
awards, and 3 have won: Samuel Barber's opera ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' in 1984; Leonard Bernstein's ``Candide'' (the 1985
opera house version) in 1986, and a program of Rorem orchestral
music (the String Symphony, ``Sunday Morning'' and ``Eagles'') in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Although these small labels champion the new, they occasionally
dip into the past. Bridge, for example, is issuing a series of
historic recordings from the Library of Congress, including
performances from the 1940s by the Budapest String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, major labels, to their credit, continue to
release significant recordings of works by living composers. Some
large companies even support subsidiary labels specifically geared
toward contemporary music. But whatever the merits of such
ventures, they tend to result in prestige releases, which represent
no significant risk for the major companies, and risk is the daily
fare of every small label that champions new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I am very heroic,'' Schuller said. ``Other
times I think I am totally foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Kermani, at Albany, knows the feeling. Yet he believes to his
core that his work is essential, and, despite money woes, even
enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our own little niche,'' he said, ``we are having a good
time.''

   LEVINE'S DVORAK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year's striking musical moments often came during events
ostensibly about other things. James Levine's Met Orchestra concert
at Carnegie Hall in mid-November advertised Milton Babbitt's new
piano concerto, but it was a performance of Dvorak's G major
Symphony that made the jaw drop and the heart beat faster.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a locus of points: the sophistication of a big-time
orchestra, the dead-on contact with late 19th-century style, and a
simple sympathy with the dancing and singing of rural Central
Europe. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN IN CLEVELAND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The listener went to Cleveland early in October to hear Charles
Ives's newly cobbled ``Emerson'' Concerto for piano and orchestra
but came away with a performance of Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony
that spoke of collaboration onstage and a sense of community in the
audience. Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra
provided a kind of informed fervor not often encountered in the
concert world. The audience at Severance Hall gave every indication
of appreciating just what was happening before it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PICKER'S `EMMELINE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmeline'' at the New York City Opera at the beginning of
April gave us a new American opera that might last awhile. Tobias
Picker's modest yet substantial work rises blessedly above a long
line of recent mediocrities from this country, each having promised
much and delivered less. There is a Shaker-like quality to
``Emmeline,'' a piece that sang handsomely and held together nicely
in Francesca Zambello's sparse production. Patricia Racette sang
the title role. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIGETI IN LOS ANGELES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groygy Ligeti's Requiem in late April in Los Angeles gave New
York a lesson in what festivals, large and small, are meant to do.
This big and frightening choral work was the centerpiece of
Esa-Pekka Salonen's brave series with the Los Angeles Philharmonic
based on Ligeti's music. The Requiem is both chaste and raucous,
with a cartoonish approach to the liturgy not inappropriate to our
times. Reacting to a strong performance, a big audience swallowed
hard and took it all in. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING CARTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have carefully choreographed their 90th-birthday
tributes to Elliott Carter, but I like the rich and disorganized
rush of concerts coming from every side of New York's musical
community. Speculum Musicae presented a Carter program at the
Miller Theater in late October, looking back to the imposing Double
Concerto of 1961 but also offering such airy, light-filled new
chamber pieces as ``Luimen'' for six instruments. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING GERSHWIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eurocentric symphony orchestras are making hardy, if halting,
attempts at the Gershwin centenary. But one of the most interesting
pockets of celebration was a weekend conclave in mid-March at the
Library of Congress in Washington. There practitioners, scholars,
family members and friends spent three days with music of Gershwin
and contemporaries like Vernon Duke. Some of the papers dragged,
but Dick Hyman, Alan Feinberg, Michael Feinstein, Bolcom and
Morris, and others were there to pep things up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROOK'S `DON GIOVANNI' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' continuously in the operatic
repertory since its premiere just over 200 years ago, found a
friend in the director Peter Brook, whose simple yet carefully
considered production at Aix-en-Provence, France, in July fixed
attention where it belonged. There was a young, strong cast on an
outdoor stage and a correspondingly good band of student players in
the pit, conducted by Claudio Abbado. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KREMER'S VIVALDI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it is fashionable to trash Vivaldi's ubiquitous ``Four
Seasons,'' Gidon Kremer and his Kremerata band reminded listeners
of this music's great power and originality with a concert in early
August at Avery Fisher Hall. Every familiar movement was rethought,
sometimes not to my liking but performed with a concentration and
skill that removed these pieces from the status of elevator music,
where they have languished for too long. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AX AND KREMER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two items from the ambivalence department: First, Emanuel Ax in
early August at Avery Fisher Hall playing Chopin's F minor Concerto
on an 1840 Broadwood piano with the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment. It may have been the wrong instrument for us today,
but what sensitive, graceful musicianship it was. Remember, too,
Astor Piazzolla's tango opera ``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' again with
Kremer and his Kremerata in early October at the Majestic Theater
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Overwhelmed by its own literary
ornateness, the work is nevertheless a window onto the exciting no
man's land between popular and classical cultures. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MET PRODUCTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We expect so much of the Metropolitan Opera that when its vast
resources fail us, we remember. Reviving Offenbach's ``Contes
d'Hoffmann'' in February was a gratifying success, but one mourns
the sometimes misdirected assets of this fall's ``Nozze di Figaro''
and the anti-opera self-indulgence of Franco Zeffirelli's new
``Traviata.'' The Robert Wilson-meets-``Lohengrin'' experience in
March had its opening night problems, too. Is the labor-intensive
Wilson style wrong for a big, busy repertory house? It may well be.

<P>
   There's a golden afterglow to Christmas morning. The presents
have all been opened, but the yuletide magic still lingers. Lights
twinkle on the tree, carols warble from the stereo, and the holiday
catches its breath. Christmas dinner is hours away. In the meantime
... well, it IS a holiday. So let's eat.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   THE BILL CLINTON SHOW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No fictional drama could possibly compete. During the first
presidential impeachment of the 20th century, television became
more than the playing field; it was an active participant, as the
voracious 24-hour news channels pushed the story along.
</P>
<P>
   Think of how powerfully Bill Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal was
molded by these endlessly replayed images: Monica Lewinsky, in her
black beret, standing in a rope line to greet the president;
Clinton wagging his finger at the public and saying words we now
know by heart: ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman,
Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, for four straight hours television viewers watched
the videotape of the president's testimony before the grand jury
(in polls, his approval ratings rose); last week, audiences were
the witnesses as the House of Representatives voted to impeach him
(in polls, his approval ratings rose). We have lost count of his
televised apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal highlighted the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the
24-hour news channels: the influential CNN and MSNBC and the
tag-along Fox News Channel. At their best, they offered a
comprehensive yet intimate view of the Clinton presidency in the
process of unraveling; in their tackiest moments, they became the
Psychic Friends Network of politics, with blather like ``What is
Hillary feeling?'' Yet their incessant talk and presence continue
to define this unimaginable historical drama. Next to the
impeachment, even the green-glowing night images of missiles
landing in Baghdad seemed familiar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST `SEINFELD' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True fans were disappointed in the dark, absurdist final
episode, in which the fictional Jerry Seinfeld, along with George,
Elaine and Kramer, was locked in a jail cell for a year. But the
finale is among the year's most significant television events
because of the manufactured media frenzy surrounding one comedian's
decision to end his eight-year-old series; is that really something
to be distraught about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' was a cultural touchstone (it's the reason you're
sick of hearing ``Yada, yada, yada''). Yet with network audiences
bleeding away to cable, it may also be a dinosaur, the last network
show able to whip up that kind of hysteria. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SPORTS NIGHT' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This ABC comedy-drama is the one sign of life in the wilderness
that was this network season. Set behind the scenes of a fictional
television show, it is a superbly written and acted look at the
tangle of work, life and love in the 90s, having more in common
with a comedy of manners like ``The Rules of the Game'' than with
ordinary sitcoms. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Hanks as executive producer, HBO's 12-part mini-series
about the Apollo moon missions did more than accumulate Emmys; it
has been credited with rejuvenating the genre. (Hanks and Steven
Spielberg will produce a World War II mini-series for HBO.) Viewing
the Apollo project through a haze of nostalgia for all-American
ambition, ``From the Earth to the Moon'' helped set the current
mood of longing for an age (any age) of lost heroism. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE CBS SUNDAY MOVIE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nostalgia continues. Week after week, with the mawkish
``Touched by an Angel'' as a lead-in, a sentimental, formulaic CBS
made-for-television movie lands in the Nielsen ratings' top 10. As
bland as warm milk, some of the most popular have stars whose very
names signal fuzzy longings for yesterday: Debbie Reynolds as a
granny in ``A Christmas Wish,'' Jack Lemmon as a gramps in ``The
Long Way Home.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MR. SHOW WITH BOB AND DAVID' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conservative gust that brought a battle about leadership and
morality to Washington was echoed in entertainment, as the huge
sweep of nostalgia had its countervailing trend in shows with
cutting-edge attitudes. Though schmaltzy television movies get big
ratings, cult audiences are devoted to `` Show,'' HBO's wickedly
satirical sketch comedy series with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Among their wittiest sketches: Guests on a Jerry Springer-style
show, stranded in a lifeboat. Along with Comedy Central's ``Upright
Citizens Brigade,'' another brazen sketch comedy show, it is
sometimes tasteless but always inventive, and with smaller
audiences can afford to be daring in a television climate that
prizes no-risk jokes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALL `BIOGRAPHY' ALL THE TIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If `` Show'' displays a hard-edged comic sensibility, A&AMP;E's
enormously popular ``Biography'' and its raft of clones are
evidence of the softheaded cult of celebrity. A&AMP;E's ``Ozzie and
Harriet'' episode may have proved the Nelsons were not picture
perfect, but it wasn't exactly hard-hitting. And ``Biography''
seems positively debunking next to fluffier wannabes, which include
a profile of Helen Gurley Brown on Lifetime's ``Intimate Portrait''
and Cyd Charisse on ``Bravo Profiles.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `N.Y.P.D. BLUE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There will be no guest appearances by Jimmy Smits, now that his
character, Bobby Simone, has been killed off. The Bobby episodes
were tear-jerking and toughly realistic; Rick Schroder has turned
out to be surprisingly effective as a scrappy new detective. This
tired and aging series did something almost unheard of in
television: it took risks and was rejuvenated. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACK KEVORKIAN ON `60 MINUTES' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The term ``guest appearance'' suits this headline-grabbing
stunt, which placed Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the CBS news magazine in
cahoots. When ``60 Minutes'' showed a staged death, a tape of
Kevorkian administering lethal drugs to a terminally ill patient,
the hard line separating news from manufactured reality all but
disappeared. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LOLITA' GOES TO SHOWTIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, no one would have made a nearly $60 million art
film. As it turned out, Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain were
spectacularly moving as Humbert Humbert and his nymphet in Adrian
Lyne's eloquent film of the Nabokov novel.
</P>
<P>
   Shunned by Hollywood because of its cost, slender commercial
prospects and flammable subject, the movie was bought by Showtime.
Here is proof that however haphazardly, art survives in unlikely
places.

DOG DAYS FOR SOME WEB CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call themselves the Ebay 14. While the name may sound like
a group of political prisoners, they are actually a handful of pet
advocates who say they got kicked off of www.ebay.com, the online
auction service, after complaining about the auction of several St.
Bernard puppies this month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 14, with canine-style email names like ``stbernard1'',
``rridgebacks'' and ``rescue'', said they were suspended from the
service for sending messages protesting the auction of the dogs
Dec. 16. Members of the group oppose such auctions because they
think that buying a pet through the Internet is ill-advised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Complaint: AUCTIONING LIVE ANIMALS IS AGAINST EBAY POLICY,''
wrote one of the suspended members, Deborah Busby of Hoover, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Another person, also suspended, wrote to say: `No responsible
dog-breeder would sell like this. No responsible person would
bid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notes were posted on one of the bulletin boards run by
ebay.com to allow comment on the sellers offering goods through the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Chu, a spokeswoman for ebay.com, said her company
permits the animal auctions because they are legal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chu said the members were suspended because they had
violated the site's policy by posting criticisms of a seller with
whom they had not done business.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to the members informing them of their suspension,
ebay.com said it was taking the step because it believed they had
engaged in a practice called ``feedback bombing,'' in which an
organized effort, often using aliases, is made that lowers the
level of discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Although the writers of the messages said no organized effort
had been made, it appears that some of them learned of the auction
through bulletin boards for people interested in animals.
</P>
<P>
   After issuing the suspensions, ebay.com told the members that
they could be reinstated if they posted a ``positive'' message on
the bulletin board to balance out the earlier negative ones. Ms.
Busby did so _ that is, she checked off the ``positive'' box
provided to rate the seller, but also wrote that she had had not
experience with him _ and her service was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said, ``I am left with a very bad taste in my
mouth. I don't beleive that I could, in good conscience, support
Ebay by purchasing anything through their site.''
</P>
<P>
   Some animal advocacy groups say they agree that animals should
not be bought through auction. Bob Slay, an American Kennel Club
official, said,``Auctions are bad for dogs, because so often the
dog goes to a home where the new owner has not given sufficient
thought to responsible ownership,'' Slay said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ann Church, senior director of government affairs for the Humane
Society of the United States, was also critical of the
practice.``It goes against what we tell people to do when selecting
a new pet,'' she said. ``It's going to be a member of the family,
and live for 10 to 25 years, depending on the species. It's not
something to do on a whim.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Animal advocates fear that pets bought on line who don't get
along in their new homes will be sent to shelters and euthanized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For prospective owners, buying on line can also pose problems,
say the advocates. They will not be able to tell how well an animal
is socialized or what health problems it might have. It is also
difficult to verify a pet's pedigree on line or to return an animal
that does not work out.
</P>
<P>
   The American Kennel Club has decided that as of April 1999 it
will not register dogs sold via auction or raffle _ whether on line
or otherwise _ unless they have tattoos or microchips as a form of
permanent identification prior to being sold. &QL;

THE WAR AS ART: NBC BORROWS FROM A GAME 
</HEADLINE>

   On screen, a Tomahawk missile rushes over the ocean. It is the
Persian Gulf at night, and there is cloud cover, but you can see
the texture of the waves. From the starboard side, the camera rolls
around the circumference of the missile to follow it from behind.
And you can see the flare, a flash of light from the rocket's rear
and a misty condensation trail, reflected in the water.
</P>
<P>
   This is a computer game.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``NBC News Special Report.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dec. 16, while the nation channel-surfed between
air strikes and impeachment, NBC was broadcasting footage from
Jane's Fleet Command, a strategy simulation game scheduled for
release this spring. The credited source was Electronic Arts, the
nation's largest publisher of entertainment software.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized that they could use our 3-D models and things
like that much quicker than they could develop their own,'' said
Kristen McEntire, a spokeswoman for Electronic Arts. ``They don't
have the internal resources to build a 3-D model of a carrier in an
afternoon. We've already got it built. We've got the detailed
models. We know how the elevators work and how they bring the plane
up from the hangar bay and how it launches off the carrier, the
whole thing. We can do 27 different angles of it at different times
of day. We can give them ready-made footage in one second, and we
know it's accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually played the game, recorded the whole thing and
supplied them with several hours of footage of different scenarios:
nighttime attacks, daytime attacks, different types of missiles.
Launches from airplanes, launches from ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for us to do it on the fly,'' Ms. McEntire said,
``because the game comes with a detailed mission editor so the
player can place targets in different parts of the world and then
turn on the game and see how it plays out. It takes 10 minutes. You
just go drop drop drop drop _ you just drop things in where you
want them and say go. NBC had all different sorts of situations
already recorded. And when the time came, they selected the
scenarios that fit what actually happened and credited Jane's
Combat Simulations and Electronic Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jane's brand, in this case, was rather important because
Jane's Information Group is a 100-year-old publisher that supplies
the defense community with reliable information about military
equipment _ things like ships, tanks, satellites, tracking systems,
who's looking to buy surface-to-air missiles, who wants to unload
fighter planes for extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a down-to-the-millimeter description of every
fighter plane on earth, you can buy Jane's All the World's Aircraft
on CD-ROM for $1,145. If you want the entire encyclopedia of
everything that rolls, flies or floats, it will set you back
$16,000. Jane's Defense Weekly is a must-read for 20,000 military
officials, intelligence officers and defense contractors in 165
countries. These people are hard core.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer products are, as they say in the marketing
department, a ``brand extension'' for Jane's. It's a licensing deal
between the bible of the defense industry and the 900-pound gorilla
of video game publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's bumps up the name recognition. Electronic Arts gets the
military equivalent of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for its
air combat simulations. And news outlets like NBC can feel less
squeamish about using computer game footage to illustrate world
events on the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   There is some residual discomfort about this.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Emery, the ``Dateline NBC'' program coordinator who
originally procured the Fleet Command footage, did not use the
g-word when he passed it on to the producers of the ``NBC News
Special Report.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew that it was from Jane's Combat Simulations,'' Emery
said. ``And I said to them that this was a product not out on the
market yet. But I don't say that it's a computer (italics)game.(end
italics) I don't refer to any of these kinds of things as games.
Most of the people that do computer simulations don't even call
them games. That's why they call them flight sims. They're a game,
technically, but they're a lot more technological. And I'd prefer
that you not use the term `game' when you're talking about this
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use Electronic Arts (italics)technology(end italics) that
they incorporate into a simulation. We do not pull our information
off a video game. Plus, this was something that was in development.
They built something for us, too. We have a B-52 that doesn't
appear in the game, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Methinks the program coordinator protests too much.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a computer game.
</P>
<P>
   But then, so is most of America's military activity, if you
believe the Pentagon's press releases about the smart bombs and
remote air strikes and precision missile-guidance systems (which
sometimes aren't so precise), or if you turn on the news. Because
damage and death on the news is abstract. Targets hit, buildings
destroyed, a tally, a scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the Persian Gulf in 1991 through the cross hairs of a
laser gun sight on CNN. And ever since then, we have understood war
as something tactical and technological and mediated. Something
very close to a computer game. So computer game footage on
television feels familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual cruise missiles in the moonlight are more credible than
the ghostly night-scope footage _ images filmed in another
dimension (or stolen from ``The X-Files''). Three-dimensional
models of military hardware seem more authentic than the
lantern-jawed, flak-jacketed correspondents looking stern for the
camera, playing War Reporter. They seem more real, in a way, than
the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual weapons are so perfectly measured. You can study them
from any angle. All the details are known. And it's all contained
on the surface of a CD-ROM, $49.95 at Software Etc. ``And after the
product ships,'' Ms. McEntire promised, ``we'll be able to do
real-world scenarios like the attack in Iraq and put the new
missions up on our Web site for free download for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   So you can replay the war on your home computer, just as they do
on television, with the same brand of data the real generals use.
So the military strike and the media coverage and the computer game
will all look the same.
</P>
<P>
   Viva convergence.

IN KENTE'S DANCING COLORS, SIGNS OF PRIDE AND IDENTITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTS FLETCHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kente cloth's iconic powers are both considerable and quite
possibly singular. For centuries, Asante and Ewe royalty in Ghana
have worn gloriously colored kente of fine silk on state occasions.
The garments have lent a grandeur to the festivities, and more
important, they have been a means for chieftains to proclaim their
authority and wealth. Small wonder that kente has become an almost
universal totem of black identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another cloth that carries as much symbolic
weight as kente does,'' said Doran H. Ross, the director of the
Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the University of California,
Los Angeles, who has devoted more than two decades to its study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of its potency,'' he added, ``are the intellectual ideas
embedded in kente that give it a richness difficult to find in
other textiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Such notions are explored in ``Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente
and African-American Identity,'' an exhaustive exhibition at the
Newark Museum organized by Ross in collaboration with Anne Spencer,
the museum's curator of Africa, the Americas and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated and aficionados alike, its 185 examples of
traditional and modern kente offer insight into the fabric's
history, evolution and cultural significance. The exhibit remains
on view in Newark through Jan. 3 and then travels to the Fowler
Museum, the National Museum of African Art in Washington and the
Detroit Museum of African-American History.
</P>
<P>
   Kente was developed by the Asante, a tribal people of
south-central Ghana, in the late 17th century, though it has roots
in the long tradition of African weaving that dates back to 3000
B.C. Legend has it that two tribesmen learned the art by observing
a spider weaving its web. When the Asantehene, the paramount chief
of the Asante, heard of their discovery, he ordered that it become
the royal cloth. (Kente derives from the word for basket in the
Akan language.)
</P>
<P>
   Woven on treadle looms into strips four to six inches wide,
lengths of kente are sewn together to produce large cloths. The
strips may be arranged in a checkerboard pattern or in an
alternating rhythm, creating at times an op-art effect of shifting
colors and design.
</P>
<P>
   Kente is traditionally woven by men, using cotton, rayon and
silk. Asante kente is noted for its bright primary colors and
geometric motifs, while Ewe (pronounced A-way) kente often has a
``tweedy'' effect and figurative designs. Men usually wear one long
cloth wrapped around the body, toga-like, with the right shoulder
and hand uncovered; women typically wear two pieces wrapped around
the body along with a head tie.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 300 different types of cloth designs, each
with its own name and meaning, somewhat like Scottish tartans. The
exhibit offers examples of the oldest and most popular pattern,
Oyokoman, taking its name from the Oyoko clan, which has produced
every Asantehene for the last three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It features wide gold and green warp stripes embedded in a
maroon, red or burgundy field. Also on view is a pattern named in
honor of the Akosombo Hydroelectric Dam, which opened in Ghana in
the 1960s. Highlights of the exhibit include recreations of two
stores showing the staggering diversity of kente designs as well as
sample cloths that museumgoers are encouraged to try on. (A
companion book, published by the Fowler Museum, is available at $39
in paperback, $70 in hardcover.)
</P>
<P>
   Kente came to the attention of most Americans when Kwame
Nkrumah, Ghana's first president, wore it at the United Nations
nearly four decades ago. It became associated with the
black-consciousness movement of the 1960s, and today kente patterns
can be found everywhere, on ties, handbags, book covers, picture
frames, bedspreads, even Barbie dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that it was increasingly common to see Latino students
wearing kente stoles at graduation ceremonies. Whether the trend
merely represented one minority group showing solidarity with
another, or something more profound, he said, was a matter for
further study, though clearly, he added, the role of kente was
expanding beyond ``the African-American experience.''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that wider exposure has resulted in increased
demand for kente among both museums and collectors. Ross said that
the finest cloths sell for $6,000 to $9,000, with one from the
1920's having sold for $12,000. He said that high-quality cloths
were available in New York for $1,200 to $1,500, roughly five times
what they would cost in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 51, said that his abiding interest in kente stemmed from
his first trip to Ghana in 1974. Seeing an Asante chieftain,
carried on a litter on the shoulders of his tribesmen, his robe
ablaze in color as he danced a ceremonial dance to honor his
subjects, was, as Ross put it, ``a majestic sight.'' ``These cloths
are dance,'' he added. ``They're a performance. There's a real
style to how a man carries his cloths, how the cloths rise and fall
to the rhythm of a drum orchestra.''

MUSEUM DESIGN COMES DOWN TO EARTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tadao Ando's original vision for the Modern
Art Museum of Fort Worth was so radical that it seemed not of this
world. His six concrete boxes encased within glass were stark, but
so beautiful that they captivated almost all who looked at his
drawings and models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ando's plans have been brought a bit closer to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   His new museum is less radical _ less heavenly, perhaps _ but
still promises to be a building of great beauty and historical
significance. It will show art to astounding advantage, thus
attracting important acquisitions and shows. And it will lure
visitors from around the world, affording an art experience that
will bring them back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The Osaka, Japan-based Ando was chosen in early 1997 over five
other architects to design a museum that is expected to open in
2002 on a site immediately east of the Kimbell Art Museum. Since
his commission was announced, Ando has worked with the Modern's
building committee and project supervisors to refine his proposal _
to specifically meet the needs of museum staff and programs, as
well as to reduce costs and better accommodate the extremes of
Texas weather.
</P>
<P>
   The design-development process has culminated in a model,
drawings and floor plans that give viewers an idea of what the
facility will be like. Still, changes will continue to occur and,
as they do, the Modern's installation will keep evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Because the installation is geared partly toward members of the
architectural community, some materials might seem a bit dense to
the average viewer. I know they were to me. But patient reading of
floor plans in relation to the model brings out Ando's ideas about
what will be built. At the same time, some changes can be seen by
comparing the latest model with an earlier one.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things we can anticipate:
</P>
<P>
   A smaller building. Ando's original proposal called for 75,000
square feet of exhibition space _ an awesome amount _ in addition
to back-house space, museum shop, restaurant and auditorium. Now
exhibition space has been reduced to about 53,000 feet, which is
less expensive and more realistic. The new Modern still will be one
of the largest contemporary art museums in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction was partly accomplished by shrinking the overall
plan, which initially called for six linked rectangular modules _
four short and two long _ that formed a sort of chunky L-shape. The
crux of the L would nestle a graceful pond.
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers will notice that one of the short modules has been
deleted, too _ although there is be add it later. The pond remains.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete and glass _ and metal. First, there were modules cast
from poured-in-place concrete, as opposed to pre-cast, encased
within seemingly endless expanses of glass. Glass and concrete have
a primal importance to Ando, who is known worldwide for his
virtuosic work in concrete poured into forms erected on the
building site.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fort Worth's plans may include a few elements of
pre-cast concrete as well as a third material: metal.
</P>
<P>
   Panels of subtly finished metal will flank the glass walls on
either side of the main entrance and will wrap the west corners of
each of the modules. On the museum's north side, the metal will
continue along nearly one-third of the facade. Metal will replace
some glass for a few reasons, one being the scorching Texas sun.
</P>
<P>
   Ando has made metal integral to other projects, including his
Suntory Museum in Osaka. There, metal panels introduce another
texture and another means of enclosure where concrete might have
been too much of a good thing or simply too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's debatable whether the use of metal dilutes the aesthetic
integrity or the impact of Ando's initial proposal. But I suspect
that, although the eventual experience of the building will seem
less radical, the quality of the experience will not be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   FLOATING PAVILIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The north and east facades of the museum, which can be seen
across the pond _ and which appear to be floating on the water _
remain clad in glass. Now, though, instead of being the most
powerful statement of an overall theme _ the concrete boxes inside
glass boxes _ the floating facades become the signature view of the
museum, its unique claim to fame. Other views of the building will
be handsome, no doubt, but they will lack the distinction they
originally had.
</P>
<P>
   CAR PARK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another change that reduces project cost and makes the museum
more mundane is the decision to place parking above ground. Ando's
initial design didn't specify where cars would go: His first model
was surrounded by a grassy park that suggested parking might be
underground. But now a car park, densely planted with trees and
ground cover, will wrap around the west and south sides of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   INTERIOR ISSUES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ando's team asked Michael Auping, the Modern's senior curator,
to tell them how he wanted galleries arranged. The solution is a
system of movable walls that break Ando's modules (and the spaces
between them) into comfortably proportioned rooms for art.
</P>
<P>
   Two rooms will be 2 stories high, with interior walls of poured
concrete. All other walls will be clad in drywall sheets, with one
crucial exception. From the beginning, Ando has called for an
elliptical gallery adjacent to the museum's grand staircase from
the ground floor to the second floor. Designated as a sculpture
gallery, the room had to be defined by a wall of continuous
concrete if this singular structure was to have any integrity.
</P>
<P>
   THE ENTRY EXPERIENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The metal panels flanking the museum's glass-walled grand
entrance will allow the new Modern to reveal itself to visitors
more gradually than in Ando's original plans. The entry experience
promises to combine tantalizing views (of the pond, for example)
with easy-to-comprehend options: Visitors will immediately see all
their options, from cafe to lower galleries to restrooms to the
stairs to the second floor.

IN A BUSY CENTURY, 1998 WILL STAND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even though the curtain will descend on 1998 this
week, the tumultuous events of the past few weeks, both here and
abroad, will continue to resound through the new year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   They will demonstrate the accuracy of those wise words of
William Shakespeare that are etched into the wall of the National
Archives: ``What's past is prologue.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton by the House of
Representatives was but one act in a long-playing drama that
reached a climax on Dec. 19, but will not reach its denouement
until sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment vote was one of the seminal events of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other president, Andrew Johnson, was impeached by the
House, although the Senate fell one vote short of removing him from
office in 1868. Richard Nixon would have been impeached had he not
resigned in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Repercussions from the impeachment of Clinton as well as from
the upcoming Senate consideration of Clinton's lies and
indiscretions will be felt far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest aspect of the impeachment pageant is that Clinton
continues to ride high in the public opinion polls, even though he
stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice. He has
retained a remarkable hold on public approval, while the popularity
of the Republicans has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow's generations will ask parents and grandparents if they
remember the impeachment of Clinton and where they were when it
happened. Some individuals will try to balance their reminiscences
of that event with recollections that during Clinton's presidency,
the United States enjoyed a period of unparalleled prosperity and
balanced the budget for the first time in 30 years, while the
president helped broker peace deals in Northern Ireland and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, another matter that will echo through the ages is
the public distrust of politicians in general. Millions of
Americans appear willing to forgive Clinton's bad behavior and even
revelations about the past extramarital affairs of his Republican
accusers, Reps. Henry Hyde of Illinois, Bob Livingston of Louisiana
and Dan Burton of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But many concede that their faith in their political leaders has
diminished. The unsavory conduct of our pubic leaders has simply
intensified the pessimism that engulfs many Americans when they
look to the White House and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   There are other events that will spill over into the new year
and possibly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles with Iraq will not disappear simply because we
battered that country with four days of bomb and missile attacks.
Even though the United States and Britain claim to have damaged the
Iraqi weapons program, Saddam Hussein, the bloody brute of Baghdad,
is certain to cause more trouble in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of Israel's parliament to force a new election
early in 1999 will have an important effect on peace efforts in the
Middle East. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political future
is in jeopardy as are the accords between the Israelis and the
Palestinians that Clinton helped broker this autumn in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first seminal event of the 20th century was the
assassination of William McKinley and the ascendancy of Teddy
Roosevelt to the ``bully pulpit'' of the presidency in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   As the surprise leader of a Republican Party that had
demonstrated little social consciousness in the decades since the
Civil War, Roosevelt launched a series of reforms that shocked
party stalwarts but pleased the people. He secured a lasting place
in history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, on the beach at Kitty Hawk, N.C., Wilbur and Orville
Wright made the first successful flight of a heavier-than-air,
mechanically-driven airplane. On that first flight, the flying
machine remained aloft for only 12 seconds, but in those 12 seconds
it sparked a brilliant revolution in travel, warfare and
eventually, space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions in communications were launched in 1920 with the
first licensed radio broadcast in America and in the 1950s when
television spread to nearly every home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, the United States joined World War I and emerged the
following year as a victor and a world power.
</P>
<P>
   History was made in 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt was
inaugurated president and unveiled policies to save an America
prostrated by the ravages of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   There was no more major event in this century than the beginning
of World War II in 1939, the same year that Albert Einstein
informed Roosevelt that it was possible to develop an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Seminal events of tragic proportions were Adolf Hitler's grasp
of power in Germany in 1933 and Josef Stalin's refusal at the end
of World War II to honor his promise to stage democratic elections
in Poland and other East European nations.
</P>
<P>
   History was made in a colossal way on Dec. 7, 1941, when the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor propelled America into World War
II, and again on June 6, 1944, when Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower led
the massive invasion of occupied France.
</P>
<P>
   The world entered the nuclear age on Aug. 6, 1945, when the
first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans remember where they were and what they were doing
on April 12, 1945, when FDR died. Many more remember Nov. 22, 1963,
the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated; Aug. 9, 1974, the day
Nixon resigned; and July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the
first human to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with seminal events. They have a lasting
impact.

 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five days before becoming the first president in
130 years to be impeached, President Clinton traveled to the tiny
desert sliver of Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before Yasser Arafat and about 700 of his followers,
many of them former terrorists, Clinton called on Israelis and
Palestinians to set aside half a century of enmity and bloodshed,
and find within themselves the courage and strength to forgive past
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, Clinton said, could both sides move forward and build
their own future on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the beginning of mutual respect after so much pain is
to recognize not only the positive characteristics of people on
both sides, but the fact that there has been a lot _ a lot _ of
hurt and harm,'' Clinton said, as first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and their daughter, Chelsea, looked on. ''The time has come to
sanctify your holy ground with genuine forgiveness and
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in so many speeches this year, Clinton was addressing
one conflict, but might as well have been speaking of another.
</P>
<P>
   For in a year dominated by a White House sex-and-deception
scandal that's far from over even now, perhaps no theme has more
closely echoed Clinton's intensely personal journey than the very
public efforts he has made in search of peace and reconciliation
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in South Africa or Northern Ireland, the former
Yugoslavia, the Korean peninsula or the Gaza Strip, virtually every
line Clinton has uttered about the need for political, ethnic or
racial healing has reverberated through his own struggle to regain
the trust, respect and cooperation of his family, friends and
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''These past few months have been a torturous process of coming
to terms with what I did,'' Clinton said two weeks ago in the Rose
Garden. ''Nothing _ not piety, nor tears, nor wit, nor torment _
can alter what I have done. I must make my peace with that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has struggled, so has the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For both, the heart of the problem is that Clinton's efforts at
redemption _ the faint-hearted mea-sorta-culpa in August, the
abject supplication before clergy a month later; and even his
post-impeachment plea last weekend on the darkest day of his career
for the country to ''stop the politics of personal destruction'' _
came only after seven long months during which Clinton, in his
words, ''misled'' the nation and those nearest to him, using the
full weight and authority of the highest office in the land.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate weighs whether to convict him of House charges
that he committed perjury and obstructed justice, it must do so
against the backdrop of a larger question:
</P>
<P>
   Between the day, Jan. 26, when Clinton stood in the Roosevelt
Room, wagged his finger and declared to the world, ''I did not have
sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky,'' and the day,
Aug. 17, when he announced from the Map Room, ''Indeed, I did have
a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In
fact, it was wrong,'' did Clinton so sully his office and so
thoroughly undermine his credibility as to render himself unfit to
continue as president?
</P>
<P>
   With remarkable consistency, the American public has answered
''No.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which his approval ratings have held well above
60 percent, his popularity actually surged to record levels
following the Dec. 19 impeachment votes by a House bitterly divided
along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
   He owes much of his enduring popularity to an economy that
continues to grow after seven and a half years of expansion,
bestowing upon Americans the blessings of the lowest rates of
unemployment, inflation and interest in a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, certainly, is that Clinton has succeeded in
persuading the American public that he has been busy trying to
address such kitchen-table concerns as health care, education and
public safety even as he traveled the globe working to advance and
defend the country's economic and security interests.
</P>
<P>
   There has been something else at play, though, in the national
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   At some level, the nation's sense of fairness seemed to be
offended by some Republican's relentless pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, polls showed a public dismayed by the Republican
insistence on moving forward with impeachment proceedings. Few
seemed to buy the argument that a process characterized by rank
partisanship was truly driven by conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a year in which one political tremor followed
another, it was the Republicans who seemed to bear the brunt of
public scorn for their handling of a scandal of Clinton's making.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have predicted last January that by year's end Clinton
would still be standing, but his congressional nemesis, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, would not?
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is Gingrich, R-Ga., who is leaving Congress to take
the blame for his party's disappointing showing in the Nov. 3
elections. His party, which some had expected to pick up two dozen
seats in the House, instead lost five.
</P>
<P>
   As if to further underscore the perversity of the political
year, the heir to Gingrich's throne, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La.,
also resigned after being forced by media inquiries to admit a
string of marital infidelities of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Far from taking seriously Livingston's challenge to follow his
lead and step down, Clinton wound up the year vowing to remain in
office ''until the last hour of the last day of my term,''
asserting that the notion of resignation has ''never crossed my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It's now for 100 senators to decide how to rebuke Clinton for
his conduct in the Lewinsky matter. Even before the House stained
his legacy with impeachment, however, Clinton, the office he holds
and the nation he serves had all paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Lewinsky allegations surfaced, Clinton's
every move was viewed, at least in part, according to how it might
affect or be affected by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the minds of Congress, the press and the public when
Clinton delivered his State of the Union address a few days later,
toured Africa last spring, battled to get the first balanced budget
in three decades through a hostile Congress in October and
campaigned for his fellow Democrats in November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's making it a bit complicated to get the agenda across,''
said Clinton's former spokesman, Michael McCurry, in a stunningly
prophetic piece of understatement last January.
</P>
<P>
   Just last December, weeks before the Lewinsky allegations
surfaced, Clinton gave one of the most illuminating performances of
his career. It was a 100-minute press conference at which he
articulated near-complete mastery of a complex domestic, economic
and international agenda, all but silencing critics who said he was
preparing to stagger somnolently through the remainder of a
lame-duck administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, every press conference the president has given this
year has been dominated by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether standing alongside Nelson Mandela in Cape Town, Boris
Yeltsin in Moscow, Vaclev Havel in Washington or Kim Dae Jung in
Seoul, Clinton has been pelted with question after question about
his relationship with the former White House intern and his
strategy for avoiding impeachment over it.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was so jarring two weeks ago in Jerusalem that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was reduced to pleading
with local reporters, ''as a favor,'' to ask a question about the
imperiled Mideast peace process Clinton had traveled to the region
to try to salvage.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, though, did the scandal and its many ramifications
more thoroughly occlude the message of White House action than when
Clinton launched air strikes against Iraq just 24 hours before the
House was scheduled to begin debate on four impeachment articles.
Three days later, just hours after the House approved two of those
articles, Clinton called off the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Clinton had timed the strikes to offset
impeachment action weren't confined to his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   A global survey by CNN showed that among U.S. allies and foes
alike, there was a widespread impression abroad that Clinton waged
war on Iraq to throw a public relations smoke screen across
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Moscow, CNN reported, 56 percent of this
country's former Cold War adversaries believe Clinton's troubles
with Monica resulted in death and destruction for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton's denials nor those of his national security
team have dimmed that ugly and potentially dangerous perception of
U.S. foreign policy goals, pointing to a fresh challenge for the
White House in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the strains with the press and Congress, beyond the views
from afar, perhaps the greatest toll the year of scandal has taken
has been on Clinton's overarching goal of bringing the nation
together as one. Above all else, that is the vision that carried
the young Arkansas governor to the White House six years ago. That
was the promise of the man from Hope.
</P>
<P>
   As he looks out over the country today, Clinton can't be
encouraged to see how his own conduct has polarized the land. For
while his popularity has survived the scandal, Americans are deeply
divided over how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   In an ABC News/Washington Post poll of 1,285 adults nationwide
on Dec. 19 and 20 _ the day of, and the day after the House
impeachment vote _ 59 percent said Clinton should not have been
impeached; 40 percent said he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that Clinton and the Senate have a long way to go
in trying to build a consensus for a way to move forward toward
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hope, perhaps his guiding star, is that others will
ultimately regard him as a man who, despite his complexities and
flaws, has learned at last to lead with his better instincts in a
journey he concedes is far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had to wait for perfection, none of us would ever
advance in any way,'' Clinton said early this month, in a speech on
human rights that, like so many others, held meaning in a parallel
context.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one,'' said Clinton, ''has a corner on the truth.''

IAN MOORE GOT OVER THE BLUES _ AND HE'S A HAPPIER MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hey, when are you going to play some blues, dude?''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Moore gets that a lot, usually from some guy with beer on
his breath and attitude to spare. He paid his $15 or so and he
wanted to hear the sort of deep-fried, guitar-solo-stuffed sounds
that Moore made his name with, first as a hired hand with Joe Ely
and then as a solo artist who released two CDs on Capricorn
Records.
</P>
<P>
   And Moore didn't give it to him, isn't going to give it to him
and doesn't much care if not giving it to him means that Mr.
Blueshound won't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Moore was going to be a guitar hero and play long solos all
night long; it's what everybody wanted except, well, him. And so he
doesn't do it anymore, opting instead to offer up a highly eclectic
acoustic/electric mix of rock, folk, gospel and ambient sounds, and
shows that feature instruments such as violin, melodica and
bouzouki. With a little blues thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   That has cost him his contract with Capricorn _ the label, he
says, just couldn't fathom that he didn't want to be the next
Stevie Ray Vaughan. It's also meant he's had to form his own label,
Hablador, to put out his third studio CD, the recent ``Ian Moore's
Got the Green Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, it means he sometimes faces heckling and booing at
his concerts.
</P>
<P>
   But he says it's also made him a much happier man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I can grow and change,'' says Moore, speaking from
his home on an island in Washington state, an ``inspirational
space'' where he moved this past June. Right now, he says, he's
looking at a seal sunning itself on some rocks. ``That's what I
want. I'm an artist. I'm a musician. Is someone else better able to
decide what I should play? Give me a little credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore released two studio CDs, in 1993 and 1995, and did fairly
well, opening for the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. His star was on
the rise _ or, at least, it looked that way from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, he says, that he was lacking in confidence and
wanted to make an even more eclectic CD than '95's ``Modernday
Folklore,'' which included a bunch of folk, psychedelia, soul and
gospel touches.
</P>
<P>
   Capricorn, he says, was unhappy about that direction and
underpromoted the CD. He didn't feel appreciated or understood, and
when, in 1997, he turned in his third CD, the label rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost went to blows over this,'' he says. ``I saw myself
as making a Southern Gothic thing, and they freaked out. I wasn't
doing what they were telling me _ how dare I go against their
wishes? The end was last winter, and it was pretty messy.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the label parted ways, and he looked for a deal elsewhere
_ only to find that nobody would sign him for what he thought he
was worth. He was scared to do his own CD, but singer/songwriter
David Garza urged him to give it a try, and meeting producer Mark
Addison finally convinced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things I wasn't allowed to express on CD
before,'' he says. ``I never had support for this material; Mark
gave me a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   So he cut ``Green Grass,'' a CD that goes off in a lot of
directions; there's folk-blues on ``Paris, Texas,'' acoustic guitar
and strings on ``Airplane,'' some
light-alternative-meets-the-Beatles rock via ``Pennyroyal Tea,''
and some nice covers of Terry Allen's ``Border Palace,'' the
Beatles' ``Hey Bulldog'' and Dylan's ``You're a Big Girl Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is very proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CD is very unfiltered,'' he says. ``On `Folklore,' I did a
Curtis Mayfield-ish song and a Stevie Wonder-ish song. You could
see me open up creatively. This is a logical next step from that.
I've always written country and pop and gospel songs, and the label
was never interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm changing my fans one by one, but it's a slow process,'' he
says. ``When I went out on tour, I confronted all the people who
want me to pick up my Strat and solo on every song. I've lost
people, but I've also gained people who are like, `This is what
you're about.' It's great to feel you're doing something good and
have confidence in it. It's almost cooler when people don't get it.
At least it's really me.''

 &HT;    C-SPAN ASKS SENATE TO ALLOW TV COVERAGE OF CLINTON TRIAL
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ C-SPAN urged Senate leaders Wednesday to update the
130-year-old rules on conducting an impeachment trial to allow
gavel-to-gavel television coverage of any proceedings against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson _ the
only such case in the nation's history _ the Senate decided that
all debate on procedural matters as well as on the ultimate
question of guilt or innocence would take place behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Senate makes preparations for a trial of the president,
we urge it to adopt rules that will keep this process open to the
public,'' Brian Lamb, chairman of the public affairs cable TV
network, said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically, we formally request that the Senate permit
televised coverage of its deliberations after the evidence has been
presented by the parties,'' Lamb urged. Copies of the letter were
sent to Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and other senators who
will be instrumental in establishing the rules of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules modified only slightly since 1868, the final
deliberations and vote would be closed to the public. In addition,
the Senate could vote to hear testimony from witnesses in closed
session. Some members have raised this possibility to avoid a media
circus should Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp or other controversial
high-profile witnesses be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the rules that requires that all the
witnesses be heard in open session,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell said in
an appearance on the NBC program ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we actually end up having to hear from some of the more
infamous witnesses we're now all too familiar with, there's no
prohibition under the Senate rules from hearing those witnesses in
closed sessions,'' McConnell said. ``This will not be a spectacle.
It will not demean the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1868 rules require that ``the doors of the Senate shall be
kept open'' during most of the trial unless there is a motion ``to
close the doors.'' If there were no objection to the motion, the
Senate would go into closed session. If there were an objection, a
vote would be taken with a simple majority determining the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, TV cameras were first installed in the Senate
chamber in 1974 for the possible trial of President Nixon, who
resigned rather than face impeachment, according to Congressional
Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN 2 has provided complete live coverage of every Senate
legislative session since June 2, 1986.
</P>

CIVIL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``A Civil Action,'' taken from
Jonathan Harr's absorbing, nonfiction book about a
precedent-setting pollution trial, is a far cry from the silly
melodramatics we're accustomed to in John Grisham courtroom movies.
The film is an admirably serious and intelligent look at the legal
system. Unfortunately, it's a very complicated, very tedious legal
system. 2 { Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
HURLY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ After enduring the torrent of
pretentious chatter in ``Hurlyburly,'' you will want to lock
yourself in a closet for a month just to give your ears a rest.
It's that bad. 1 star. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
STEPMOM-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Contrived, manipulative and
possessing the emotional depth of a Furby, ``Stepmom'' nevertheless
manages to work the audience's tear ducts. 2 stars. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
PATCH-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Though supposedly a true story about
an irrepressible clown who upsets medical conventions by trying to
heal through laughter, ``Patch Adams'' doesn't feel honest for a
second. 2 stars. By Bob Strauss.

MIGHTY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Kids should be enchanted and amused
by this pleasant, undemanding remake of ``Mighty Joe Young.'' 2 {
Star. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
DELTA-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Sometimes, good for you can be kind of
good. That's the case with ``Down in the Delta,'' which is
basically the kind of finger-wagging problem film that's meant to
instruct more than entertain. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
.

morning host, says he knew his 29-year association with the talk

MINYARD GET NEW STATION AND NEW PARTNER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ken Minyard, longtime KABC-AM (790) morning host,
says he knew his 29-year association with the talk station was
coming to an end at least two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would most likely be leaving KABC eventually,'' said
Minyard, who left the station last month. ``I was not happy at
KABC, and I think it was mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 4, Minyard and his son, Rick, will co-host the
afternoon-drive shift at new talk outlet KRLA-AM (1110).
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question of returning to the airwaves,''
the elder Minyard said Monday. ``Rick and I have talked about
working together since he got into broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Rick Minyard, 39, regularly filled in for his
dad at KABC, most recently last March. He is program director of
sister talk stations KFIV in Modesto and KJAX in Stockton, where he
also simulcasts a morning show.
</P>
<P>
   For its first week, the Minyard and Minyard show will broadcast
from the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the type of show I've done my entire career,'' Ken
Minyard explained. ``There'll be issue-oriented talk but it won't
be all about politics. And humor will play a big part.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Minyard said he differs from his father politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm what you'd call conservative, and dad is liberal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   KRLA's lineup includes Don Imus, Michael Jackson (who also
starts Jan. 4) and Dr. Toni Grant.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC OF CHRISTMAS: Searching for Christmas on the radio?
</P>
<P>

seasonal melodies from 6 tonight until 3 p.m. Christmas Day.

<P>
   Christmas shopping can be the shovel that digs you into the tomb
of debt. That's why I put a lot of careful thought into the gifts I
buy my family.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I got a great deal on this electronic gadget for my
sister. It's a cellular phone with a rotary dial. It's pretty
compact, so you have to use a toothpick in the finger holes, but it
came with a lovely cotton carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   See, not only did I save money on the phone, but ultimately, my
sister will save money, too. I figure that by the time she dials
10-10-324-777555666222 - 1 - AC, she'll forget who she was trying
to call. Those cell phone bills get outrageous if you're the
talkative type.
</P>
<P>
   I have a cellular phone for work and emergencies, but I keep it
in the trunk of my car so I'm not tempted to yak on it while idling
in traffic. I tried just going with a pager, but I could never find
a convenient pay phone, and if I did, I never had the correct
change.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience stores wouldn't give me change unless I bought
something. After purchasing 100 packages of gum, I figured it would
be cheaper just to buy a phone. If I have to make a call, I keep it
as brief as possible. ``It's me. Kid sick. Fever. Buy Tylenol.
Liquid. Cherry. Love.'' Click.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this is the time of the year that we strengthen our
bonds with the family, a little quality time. I am determined to
become more than an ornament to my two boys before this holiday
season is over. Toward that end, I've rented a terrific video
called, ``Wrestling For Moms'' or ``Hugging With An Attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   My young guys have called a total moratorium on hand holding,
hugs and kisses. When I walk in the door after work, all I get is,
``Hi, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   When my husband comes home, it's a totally different story:
``Dad's home! Let's get him!''
</P>
<P>
   They pile on their father as soon as he walks in the door, and
then it's a free-for-all until they break something, usually
something that I cherish. So I figure that if I learn to wrestle,
maybe I can get in on the action. I feel so left out sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   I tried it once before, but my technique wasn't very good. They
pinned me in about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, you gotta say `Uncle,' '' my oldest son ordered as he
tried to shove my right foot into my left ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle,'' I groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, `Uncle Fester,' '' my youngest son commanded while he
pinned my arms to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Fester!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, `Uncle Fester has a big boo boo head.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys! If you two don't get up off me, I'm going to ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, you're no fun. Dad never gives up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty humiliating coming from a 3-year-old and a
5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a few years have passed, and I've been watching those guys
and a little ``WD-40,'' or whatever that wrestling program is
called, and now I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   But first, I've got just a little more shopping to do. I need
three AAA batteries and a box of toothpicks to go with that phone
for my sister. I'll let you know how the big match with the boys
goes next time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shop 'til you drop. Only six more days until Christmas!

`HURLYBURLY'LIP SERVICE TO BEING MEANINGFUL

OUR RATING: 1 Star 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``Hurlyburly,'' Sean Penn's cocaine-addicted,
loser casting agent has a habit of finishing every one of his
endless, run-on prattlings with the words ``blah blah blah.'' The
trait wouldn't be so annoying if anything that came before the
``blah blah blah'' was articulate, smart or even interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, about an hour into this pseudo-intellectual exercise in
``truth-telling,'' everything uttered by the featured group of
misogynistic poseurs starts to blur together like watercolors left
to dry in a rainstorm. By the time it ends (and believe me, you
must possess remarkable patience in order to remain in your seat),
it all starts to sound like ``blah blah blah.'' And after enduring
the movie's torrent of pretentious chatter, you will want to lock
yourself in a closet for a month just to give your ears a rest.
It's that bad.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Hurlyburly,'' David Rabe has adapted his 1984 off-Broadway
play for the screen, whittling it down from three hours to a more
concise but still tortuous two hours of navel gazing,
self-absorption and phoniness.
</P>
<P>
   None of the characters feel real, and even though they're all
superficially different in a one-note sort of way, the psychobabble
that comes out of their mouths seems all of one piece. Meg Ryan's
stripper (!) spews the same claptrap as the movie's misanthropic
men. In that respect, ``Hurlyburly'' could just as well have been a
one-man show. Certainly it wouldn't have been any less tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is centered around the Hollywood Hills home occupied
by Penn's Eddie and his detached partner, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), a
man who feels nothing and readily demonstrates that absence of
conscience whenever possible. Among their friends _ and friendship
is defined a little differently by this group _ are a thuggish,
wanna-be actor (Chazz Palminteri) fond of throwing women out of
speeding cars and a smarmy screenwriter named Artie (Garry
Shandling) who courts favor with his pals by dropping 13-year-old
hitchhikers (Anna Paquin) off as ``care packages.'' (``Consider her
a pet,'' Artie says.)
</P>
<P>
   Through all the drugs and swearing and instances of statutory
rape, Eddie desperately tries to make sense of his world. He has a
girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), but has a tough time
believing she really cares for him, particularly after she has a
one-night stand with Mickey. Eddie's biggest problem, though, is
his self-hatred _ that and the fact that during a typical day he
ingests enough drugs to kill the population of a small nation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the characters' whining leads anywhere, which makes
sitting through the the film's two-hour length all the more
frustrating. There are no revelations, no discoveries, no insights
into the human condition. All we have is a bunch of disgusting men
(and masculine women) behaving very badly for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that ``Hurlyburly'' is a complete mess, it
isn't hard to figure out why such a stellar group of actors became
involved. With its long, inflated stretches of dialogue, this is
the ultimate vehicle for anyone who likes to hear the sound of his
own voice. But if you're trapped watching the movie, it's like
being stuck in the corner of some godawful party, held prisoner by
the ramblings of a self-important windbag.
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah, indeed.

A HARD CASE TO MAKE

OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``A Civil Action,'' taken from Jonathan Harr's
absorbing, nonfiction book about a precedent-setting pollution
trial, is a far cry from the silly melodramatics we're accustomed
to in John Grisham courtroom movies.
</P>
<P>
   The film is an admirably serious and intelligent look at the
legal system. Unfortunately, it's a very complicated, very tedious
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here isn't that adapter-director Steven Zaillian
loses us in the details of what was a drawn-out, highly technical
case against two large corporations. The legal issues, and even the
eye-glazing scientific evidence, is presented clearly enough.
What's wrong is that Zaillian, who wrote the screenplay for
``Schindler's List'' and made his directing debut with the
well-regarded ``Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' fails to engage us
with the material.
</P>
<P>
   The book may be harder to digest than the movie, but it is
correspondingly more interesting as well. In his desire to be
accessible, Zaillian oversimplifies the story, resulting in a film
that rarely delves below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta's lead performance is like the movie itself:
deceptively rich until you realize that it really isn't. He plays
personal injury attorney Jan Schlichtmann, a well-dressed,
oily-haired, Porsche-speeding operator who revels in his
disreputable, avaricious professionalism. He gleefully defends his
ambulance-chasing ways on local radio talk shows, and claims to
enjoy his status as one of Boston's most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to take his word on that last one, though, since one
of the film's big failings is that it never reveals anything about
Schlichtmann's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he's initially reluctant to take on the case of eight
grieving, working-class families in Woburn, Mass., who believe
polluted drinking water was responsible for the high rate of
leukemia among their children.
</P>
<P>
   The parties most likely responsible _ if, indeed, their
responsibility can be proved _ are small manufacturing concerns.
Schlichtmann's own little firm needs big pockets to go after, since
they're the type of lawyers who work on contingency and, in fact,
would have to invest loads of their own money to work up the kind
of evidence the case would require.
</P>
<P>
   But then Schlichtmann discovers that the offending businesses
are subsidiaries of giant conglomerates W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and
Beatrice Foods. Fueled by greed and arrogance, he commits his firm
to taking on the big boys. And he could just beat them _ except, at
the most inopportune moment, the killer litigator grows a heart.
</P>
<P>
   This is doubly bad news, since Schlichtmann's main opponent is
an eccentric but ruthless old legal crocodile played by a serenely
sinister Robert Duvall, who steals every scene as effortlessly as
his character steals every advantage. The movie's other great
performance comes from the always-reliable William H. Macy, who
plays the Schlichtmann firm's resourceful but increasingly frazzled
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian is at his best when detailing how the good little
lawyers lose everything in their increasingly lopsided
confrontation with the big guns. He's less successful at
delineating why Schlichtmann changes from a shrewd strategist into
an obsessive crusader. Indeed, some of his moves in the movie,
though clearly designed to evoke Schlichtmann's ethical redemption,
just make him look stupid.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the only thing ``A Civil Action'' has in common with
a Grisham film. But it's not a good thing to have in common with
them.

WAR STORIES, ON THE BEACH AND IN THE HOME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg took the enormous risk of recreating the
experience of World War II combat and reminding contemporary
audiences of all the patriotism, shock and horrific sacrifice that
it entailed. And in a film year otherwise devoted to the darkest
visions of American life, he touched a long-buried, fundamental
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   This wrenchingly visceral war epic was also a bravura visual
achievement, with the swiftness and economy of its storytelling and
the terrifying, furious immediacy of its battles. Audiences were
rightly stunned by so fierce and meaningful a re-examination of the
American character under fire. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Todd Solondz turned out to be no mean stunner himself. His
merrily outrageous, expertly written ensemble piece was a true
original, able to achieve the most perverse insights with unnerving
empathy, and without the slightest straining for effect.
</P>
<P>
   This filmmaker seems to come naturally by the skewed,
murderously funny world view that yielded the biggest and best of
the year's pitch-black comedies. And his wicked screenplay plumbed
the collective misery of its lonely characters with dazzling
finesse. As structurally elegant as it was taboo-shattering,
``Happiness'' arrived at just the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   The worst excesses of tabloid culture paled before Solondz's
matter-of-fact glimpses of family life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE BUTCHER BOY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delving into the mind of a troubled young hero might have been
solemn business from a filmmaker less imaginatively offbeat than
the director of ``The Crying Game.'' But Neil Jordan filled this
study of the boy's disintegrating sanity, based on Patrick McCabe's
equally daring novel, with ever more chilling ebullience as it
began to inhabit the boy's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliantly juxtaposing external and subjective reality, Jordan
created a wildly fanciful mental landscape within a workaday Irish
town and melted the boundaries between madness and reason to
electrifying effect. Eamonn Owens, whose only previous
international exposure had been marching with his youth band in New
York's St. Patrick's Day parade, gave an unforgettably blistering
performance in the central role. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of Hal Hartley's earlier films matched the ambitions of
this deft cultural allegory, with its wry tale of art and fame in a
tug of war. Minimalist in style yet sweeping in vision, Hartley's
story centered on a Queens janitor with a resemblance to a young
Samuel Beckett and a previously untapped genius for rousing the
populace with his written word.
</P>
<P>
   When he fell into the hands of a literary shaman with enough
overweening pretensions for the two of them, Hartley had a field
day with the possibilities. Beautifully meticulous despite the
occasional needless gross-out, it featured Parker Posey at her most
divinely petulant and the best of this filmmaker's shrewdly deadpan
style. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mischievously literate Elizabethans, hilarious backstage farce
and the sultry teamwork of Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow (as
passionate prototypes for Romeo and Juliet) made this the most
enchanting entertainment of the year. With a sparkling screenplay
by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, John Madden's film had the
temerity to speculate about Shakespeare's life on the basis of his
work. Rarely has such presumptuousness paid off so shamelessly
well. Amid a splendid supporting cast, the stars shone even more
brightly than Sandy Powell's spectacular costumes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `A SIMPLE PLAN' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sleeper of the year, this finely calibrated thriller brought
out the best in Scott Smith's novel about the poisonous effects of
a windfall on small-town characters in a stark, snowbound setting.
Its biggest surprise, beyond the way Bill Paxton and Billy Bob
Thornton outshone even their acting collaboration in ``One False
Move,'' was the transition made by Sam Raimi from cult horror films
to such adroit, subtle storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Modest as it looked, this drama built inexorable momentum as it
weighed the consequences of its characters' every misstep, and
created a shockingly smooth continuum between good and evil. The
stars, cast as brothers, played their last scene together like the
instant classic that it is. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Vinterberg made this boisterous Danish film under an
exacting set of creative restrictions, which made its freewheeling
brio that much more triumphant. The camera swiveled and soared
through an elaborate family reunion, with a skeleton in every
closet and an irrepressibly robust quality to the whole gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For its sheer vigor without tricks, stunts, makeup or fancy
lighting, Vinterberg's film was a refreshing change and a
remarkable achievement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BULWORTH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a year that cried out for political satire, Warren Beatty
delivered one with sharp claws. He played a senator driven to
despair by his own lack of conviction until, uproariously, candor
set him free. If the idea of a 60-year-old white rapper raised a
few hackles, it also embodied the anything-goes spirit that turned
a potentially broad, partisan comedy into a bona fide breath of
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's panache, vaporized in films like ``Love Affair,'' made
a welcome re-emergence. And Oliver Platt's supporting turn (as a
slick aide trying to keep the senator looking respectable) was one
of the funniest performances of the year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX' &QL;
</P>

   Family values, 1998-style, as Christina Ricci's evil minx
exploited everyone in her path. Sour as this show of nonstop
cynicism appeared, it made for an unexpectedly generous,
conciliatory comedy from the writer-director Don Roos, not to
mention a delectably funny one. And it delivered some of the year's
most knowing ideas about the making of sexual connections in these
endlessly complicated times, as it intermingled gay and straight
characters, innocent and scheming ones, with fearless aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricci and Lisa Kudrow were outstanding as diametrically
opposed characters trading acid-dipped repartee. &QL;

   Major themes and high drama were nowhere to be found in this
misleadingly titled French road movie. But its humor and
tenderness, combined with the slyest of deadpan timing, made it one
of the high points of my moviegoing experience this year. Shot in
wide-screen format amid a series of tranquil Brittany landscapes,
it watched two gentle drifters form a rueful friendship, explore
their surroundings and try amusingly and dismally to beguile women.
It's on this list only because I smile at the memory of it and
remember every frame.

`PATCH ADAMS' NEEDS A NEW Rx 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Insulin! Insulin!
</P>
<P>
   The ``Patch Adams'' sugar shock factor is remarkably high, even
by Robin Williams movie standards. A supposedly true story about an
irrepressible clown who upsets medical conventions by trying to
heal through laughter, there's so much cloying, contrived sap
clogging the film's arteries that not a sticky second of it feels
honest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only a clumsy, um, patch job of scenes from a
half-dozen other Williams hits (it could have been called, with
appropriate awkwardness, ``Awaken, Good Morning, Dead Poet'').
``Adams'' is even built around a fundamentally boneheaded,
pseudopopulist notion.
</P>
<P>
   The film claims to advocate doctors acting more human and less
objectively (read: nicer) toward their patients. A dubious concept
in itself _ who really wants a hug instead of scientific judgment
when they're sick? _ but one we could theoretically swing with for
entertainment purposes. Yet Williams' relentlessly optimistic,
impossibly imaginative medical student is idealized beyond anything
resembling a mere mortal.
</P>
<P>
   So much for putting the humanity back in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when we first encounter Hunter ``Patch'' Adams in the
1960s, he is recognizably vulnerable. In fact, he's suicidal, but
smart enough to check himself into a mental facility before he
hurts himself. There he discovers that the psychiatrists don't have
a sense of humor and concludes that's the reason why the inmates
are still crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to help the hurting, and utterly oblivious to the fact
that his smug personality could drive many people nuts, Adams
checks out of the institution and into the Medical College of
Virginia. He rarely studies there but still makes top grades, which
annoys the heck out of his snooty, brilliant roommate
(``Happiness''' Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the beautiful,
all-business classmate Carin (blond Julia Roberts look-alike Monica
Potter).
</P>
<P>
   While these two might as well have ``bound to come around''
stamped on their foreheads, one guy who's clearly not going to be
won over by Patch's antics is the humorless (what else?) Dean
Walcott (Bob Gunton). The self-controlled meanie takes great
exception to Patch's antics at the school's hospital, where the
funnyman delights leukemia kids by falling down a lot and wearing a
clown nose made from an enema bulb.
</P>
<P>
   His academic future in jeopardy, Patch opens a guerrilla free
clinic out in the beautiful Blue Ridge mountains (how destitute
patients get to the isolated spot is not explained). This gets him
in deeper trouble with real medical authorities, resulting in the
inevitable courtroom/tribunal scene where Patch's utterly
nonsensical, emotional defense makes all the little leukemia kids
who've been schlepped to the gallery cheer.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it tries to get serious, ``Patch Adams'' is terminally
whimsical. When our hero's unexamined ``I'm OK, you're OK'' credo
inadvertently causes the death of a loved one, he's briefly wracked
by a normal human response: guilt. But his depression lasts only as
long as it takes for a butterfly to cross his path.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, this Frankenstein monster of a feel-good movie is
the work of director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk.
Although a strain of sentimentality has run through Shadyac's
previous, actually funny movies, we remember ``Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective,'' ``Liar Liar'' and ``The Nutty Professor'' remake
mainly for their outrageousness. For his part, Oedekerk worked on
``Professor'' and the gross-out ``Ace Ventura'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic treacle was the last thing to be expected from either
of these guys. But then, that's what often happens when anarchic
wits attempt to warm hearts for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Robin Williams. If anybody knows about this syndrome,
he does. &QL;

`STEPMOM' GUSHES WITH SENTIMENTALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Contrived, manipulative and possessing the
emotional depth of a Furby, ``Stepmom'' nevertheless manages to
work the audience's tear ducts in such a way that half the theater
will be sniffling while the other half (or more?) will be burying
their heads in their hands, their despair born of an altogether
different source.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid to its core, ``Stepmom'' gives the thoughtful moviegoer
ample time to ponder some deeper issues of film schmaltz and
coping-with-cancer movies. Namely:
</P>
<P>
   1) Why these films seem to always time the cancer to coincide
with the holiday season. Here, much like in the earlier and
superior ``One True Thing,'' the mom (Susan Sarandon) learns of her
illness around Halloween (trick or treat!), fights it around
Thanksgiving and succumbs just in time for Christmas and the new
year. This allows ham-fisted filmmakers (in this case director
Chris Columbus and no fewer than five cliche-loving writers) the
opportunity to double-dip in holiday goo and tear-jerking,
cancer-filled bathos.
</P>
<P>
   2) Why kids in these movies never act like kids. Ostensibly
about fractured families and what happens when the father (Ed
Harris) decides to remarry a younger woman with more teeth (Julia
Roberts), ``Stepmom'' has two children that walk, talk and act like
wise old souls instead of youngsters who have a lot of issues to
sort through.
</P>
<P>
   These kids (a 12-year-old girl annoyingly played by Jena Malone
and a 7-year-old boy winsomely played by Liam Aiken) are about as
much fun as a root canal and about as childlike as Ted Koppel. No
wonder their father never spends any time with them, even though
supposedly the kids mean ``everything to him.''
</P>
<P>
   3) Why, when every plot device is so completely obvious, do the
filmmakers have to jab us in the rib cage time and time again, just
to make sure we didn't miss anything. Most egregious example:
``Stepmom'' contains not one, but two lip-synched sing-alongs to
``Ain't No Mountain High Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Gaye's estate should sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the answers to all these questions comes down to the
simple fact that the filmmakers think most people are idiots and,
confusing emotional button-pushing with emotional insight, decide
to pander instead of probe. That doesn't necessarily mean you're
stupid if you like ``Stepmom.'' It does mean, though, that you
deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   The talented cast certainly deserves better, but then they might
have thought twice about signing up for an issues-oriented drama
directed by the man who gave the world ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Sarandon spend most of the movie bickering, but you
know with complete certainty that they'll eventually become
friends. Of course, Sarandon has to contract cancer for that to
happen, but, hey, what do you want from a movie? Parenting
dilemmas? True-to-life complexities?
</P>
<P>
   Who has time for such things when there's karaoke to be sung?

<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the legal and political imbroglio in
Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual misconduct. In
a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only under oath and to
the public but also to his cabinet and White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting news commentaries on loyalty to the president can
be divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general
is an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in the cynical, materialistic 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping out
of the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends _
and finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; books by recent administration
officials have not all been discreet, much less supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the other current school of media commentary finds
the principle of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and
underutilized as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided
as a Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions.
Loyalty is derided as an instrument of ``political serfdom'' that
stifles disagreement within an administration and keeps appointees
from either resigning in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over the Clinton follies should not blind us to the
long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is indispensable to an
organized society and to orderly and effective governance. No
American president can provide consistent direction in foreign
affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his trust to also
accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. If loyalty does not require
zealotry, neither does it require sycophancy. Neither the president
nor the presidency is well served by a toady intimidated by the
atmosphere of ``fear and fawning'' surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
led to one's appointment in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters than a president who has consistently shown
``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring them
in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress or the
press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. He risks resignation or revolt if he rejects that advice
without ample explanation of his reasons and careful consideration
of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's decision involves so overriding a principle
that you can no longer in good conscience continue to believe in
his leadership, much less implement that particular decision, then
it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly submit a
resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it. If you leave a president's side, you
increase the weight of those who advised him differently than you,
and you leave shorthanded those in the administration who share
your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

   That's the case with ``Down in the Delta,'' which is basically
the kind of finger-wagging problem film that's meant to instruct
more than entertain.
</P>
<P>
   It's a serious family drama that contrasts all the bad things
about living in a Chicago housing project (absent fathers,
uneducated and substance-abusing mothers, violence) with all the
swell things about living in the Mississippi countryside (nice
house, clean living, 45 different ways to make chicken).
</P>
<P>
   It emphasizes the importance of family bonds as the only sure
cure for scial pathology. As you might imagine, it's more than a
little preachy.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also extremely well-acted. And many of the scenes,
though written by a white Southern guy named Myron Goble, have the
intelligent, authentic ring of examined African-American life,
thanks in large part, no doubt, to poet Maya Angelou, who makes her
feature-directing debut here.
</P>
<P>
   With issues ranging from the legacy of slavery to modern-day
corporate downsizing, from autism to Alzheimer's, from Habitat for
Humanity homebuilding to up-with-all-of-us entrepreneurialism, the
film risked being about everything but real people. But thanks,
mainly, to carefully layered lead performances by Alfre Woodard and
Al Freeman Jr., ``Delta'' rarely plays quite as didactically as it
really is.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard is Loretta, a discouraged Chicago woman who's been
drowning herself in drink at least since her husband left after the
birth of their second child. That little girl is autistic, and
while Loretta spends her time trying to party her pain away, her
bright preteen son Thomas (Mpho Koaho) and responsible, widowed
mother Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) do their best to raise the
troublesome tot.
</P>
<P>
   Finally fed up with her daughter's attitude, Rosa Lynn convinces
her reluctant brother-in-law Earl (Freeman) to take Loretta and the
grandkids in for the summer. He's got a fine house in the
Mississippi Delta _ indeed, it once belonged to the family that
owned his ancestors _ and runs a profitable chicken restaurant in
the neighboring small town.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great place for Loretta to dry out into the good person
we all know she can be. There's abundant fresh air and green fields
wherein Thomas can blossom to his full potential. There's even
Earl's Alzheimer's-stricken wife Annie (the late Esther Rolle) for
the imbalanced little girl to bond with.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be any doubt that this situation will enrich
everybody? Even Earl's son Will (Wesley Snipes), a high-powered
Atlanta attorney who makes a point of keeping his distance from the
old homestead, is irresistibly drawn back by all the blazing family
warmth. Increasing flashbacks to the mid-1800s put the whole
situation into perspective, with the help of a heavily symbolic
candelabrum.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou doesn't really direct a film here (it was originally
planned as a cable TV project). Rather, she tells a story about
people with cameras. The framing foregrounds the performances, and
the thing moves with a languid rhythm tuned to making sure
everybody has all the time necessary to say what they've got to get
out. It's steady but not stolid; both Woodard and Freeman manage to
convey a wide range of intriguing resentments even as their
characters move inexorably toward doing every right thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are many worse ways to deliver lectures.!end! &QL;

`MIGHTY JOE' YOUNG AT HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This pleasant, undemanding remake of ``Mighty Joe
Young'' plays like ``Free Willy'' with fur.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the 1949 kiddie favorite gives the
giant-ape-on-the-loose-in-L.A. story line an eco-conscious gloss.
This time, the 15-foot gorilla isn't shipped over from his African
homeland to headline a cheap vaudeville show; he's shipped over to
be the star attraction at a nature conservancy park. It's not
irresponsible drunks but evil poachers (Rade Sherbedgia _ who used
to call himself Serbedzija _ and Peter Firth) who get Big Joe all
riled-up and loose on Hollywood Boulevard this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is the compassionate white hunter/zoologist and
Charlize Theron is the beautiful white jungle girl who are Joe's
best friends. She and Joe both lost their mothers when they were
little primates _ courtesy of those same evil poachers, in a
sequence that owes a lot to Spielberg's ``The Lost World'' _ and
their bond, as fundamentally hokey as it may be, is genuinely
touching.
</P>
<P>
   Joe himself is a pretty cuddly creation. Slicker than the
stop-motion puppet created in 1949 by Willis O'Brien and Ray
Harryhausen (the latter, along with original ``Joe'' heroine Terry
Moore, makes a nice little cameo appearance in the new movie), the
new 2,000-pound gorilla is a state-of-the-art creation. Designed by
five-time Oscar winner Rick Baker, who has excelled at the hairy
thing in the likes of ``Greystoke'' and ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
the new Joe is a seamlessly expressive blend of animatronics,
computer graphics and guys in monkey suits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in the first film, it's impossible to believe that
this lovable lumberer actually frightens the citizens of Los
Angeles while he avoids a small army of cops. Unlike O'Brien's more
indelible creation King Kong, Joe has never generated the tragedy
and terror that his big brother unleashed. He still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Ron Underwood, who made ``City Slickers.'' He
does his best to prevent this thoroughly Disneyfied remake from
seeming more silly than it is. Of course, it wouldn't be ``Mighty
Joe Young'' if it wasn't goofy, so it's just as well that Underwood
didn't succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Kids should be enchanted and amused, and that's all this junior
varsity film fable should ever aspire to anyway.

 (Eds: Please note subslug for ROBBINS-DANCE)  
 (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEROME ROBBINS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the titans, Robbins was arguably the most original of
choreographers. He regarded the New York City Ballet as a
continuing experiment, and his death in July robs the company of a
major creative voice that influenced its profile for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Michel Fokine, George Balanchine, Antony Tudor and
Frederick Ashton, Robbins was one of the 20th century's greatest
ballet choreographers; he was not just the greatest American-born
ballet choreographer. Nonetheless, he was American and his genius
distilled the mood of his times, no matter how obliquely. His
achievement on Broadway was brilliant, but his most profound
commitment was to ballet. Robbins's gift was for the startling
image with the ring of truth. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEW BOURNE'S `SWAN LAKE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of this ``Swan Lake'' as a Broadway show rather
than a dance production will go down in the annals of hype as a
classic attempt at tomfoolery. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer
behind Bourne's modern-dress version, mounted a
ballet-is-boring-but-this-is-different campaign. Poppycock.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne has done a perfectly good job at a polished
entertainment, but it is no more original than other updated and
rechoreographed 19th- and 20th-century classics. Remember Mats Ek's
``Giselle'' in an insane asylum, Maguy Marin's ``Coppelia'' in a
housing project, Mark Morris's 1960s ``Nutcracker'' (``The Hard
Nut''), Angelin Preljocaj's ``Romeo and Juliet'' along the Berlin
Wall, and so on?
</P>
<P>
   And boring was not exactly the word for Rudolf Nureyev and
Margot Fonteyn, who drenched every ``real'' ``Swan Lake'' in
passion. By the way, many dance companies have performed on
Broadway. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ETHAN STIEFEL AND ANGEL CORELLA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the good news department, 1998 saw the artistic breakthrough
of these two already superb dancers. Different in style, both often
appeared in the same roles at American Ballet Theater. There was
astonishing depth, thanks reportedly to Kevin McKenzie's coaching,
in each dancer's debut as Albrecht in ``Giselle'' at the
Metropolitan Opera house. In ``Le Corsaire,'' Stiefel reached the
level of powerhouse technique that had previously eluded him while
Corella's natural virtuosity exploded into a higher dimension. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `FASE,' BY ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian experimental choreographer's 1982 piece to Steve
Reich's music received a stunning revival at the Kitchen. In this
tour de force, minimalist structures pack expressionist wallop.
Form generates meaning here: rigor, repetition and reductive
movement converge into complex layers, giving this seminal piece a
direct emotional impact. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIRSKY UKRAINIAN NATIONAL DANCE COMPANY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For sheer dance power, there is nothing like a first-class
professional folk company from the former Soviet Union. Pavel
Virsky, who died in 1975, founded this troupe in Kiev in 1937. The
company, performing at City Center, came back with its astonishing
virtuosity intact. A new crop of young male dancers contributed
larger-than-life bravura. These were performers to appreciate as
great dancers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE VERTIGINOUS THRILL OF EXACTITUDE,' BY WILLIAM FORSYTHE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A short, plotless ballet, danced superbly at City Center by the
San Francisco Ballet, ``Thrill'' was, in this view, the season's
best ballet. It is a brilliant outburst of neo-classical style. The
music is not electronic, as expected from Forsythe, but by
Schubert, and the classical footwork, dynamically enhanced, focuses
on changes in speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eidos: Telos,'' the full-evening work that Forsythe presented
with his Ballett Frankfurt at the Brooklyn Academy, is a more
typical experience, with its radical theatrics and dislocated
movement. ``Thrill'' takes us into a higher level of invention. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VAGANOVA BALLET ACADEMY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a historical first, there was the United States debut of 65
pupils from the training ground for the Kirov Ballet in St.
Petersburg, Russia. Americans have seen classroom demonstrations
and performances presented by the schools of the Bolshoi Ballet and
the Paris Opera Ballet. The Vaganova students, more disciplined
among the girls than the boys, offered a close-up at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music of the classical style that has developed in the
fountainhead of Russian ballet. A handful of Kirov stars were
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The continuity from classroom to stage was thus made evident and
a joint appearance with the School of American Ballet made another
link: George Balanchine founded the American school and graduated
from the Russian one. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN BALLET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him, Boris Eifman proved a revelation as a
choreographer. ``Red Giselle'' and ``Tchaikovsky,'' which the
Eifman Ballet from St. Petersburg presented in its New York debut
at City Center, showed a creative side to Russian choreography that
Americans have not seen. To call Eifman a Russian counterpart to
Kenneth MacMillan at the Royal Ballet is to suggest a similar
interest in narrative studies of character, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   Much more significant is Eifman's expressive rendering of ballet
technique. One forgives the provocative simplicities of his
scenarios; one admires the extraordinary passion of his work and
his dancers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TWYLA THARP'S `KNOWN BY HEART' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This work for American Ballet Theater is too gripping and too
good to be overlooked because, at first glance, it seems imperfect.
The shifts in music (Mozart, the percussionist Donald Knaack and
Steve Reich) are deliberate and there may be method to the overlong
Reich section. The choreography as a whole dazzles with its
outpouring of invention, especially its gleaming classicism for
Julie Kent and Angel Corella and the startling bravura for Ethan
Stiefel and his witty partner, Susan Jaffe. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LA MORT DU CYGNE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This unearthed treasure, a 1937 French feature film by Jean
Benoit-Levy, hauntingly evokes the Paris Opera Ballet on the eve of
World War II. Under the auspices of the French Institute/Alliance
Francaise, Yvette Chauvire, Janine Charrat and Mia Slavenska
movingly discussed their youthful roles in this rarely seen movie.
A masterpiece like this deserves more than a single screening.

HUMAN GUINEA PIGS TEST VACCINE TO PREVENT AIDS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doug Pfaff and Rand Snell, sexually active gay men,
are guinea pigs in the first large-scale test of an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Pfaff, 39, a salesman for a computer
training company from Fredericksburg, Va., and Snell, 43, a public
relations consultant from Washington, will regularly visit D.C.
General Hospital, roll up their sleeves and receive an experimental
inoculation called AIDSVax.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are part of a national experiment that by next June
will involve 5,000 high-risk participants _ mainly sexually active
homosexual men. The participants will be inoculated seven times
over 36 months, and have regular blood tests for any signs of
deadly infection they may contract through unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The program, managed by vaccine maker VaxGen of South San
Francisco, Calif., with help from the National Institutes of
Health, is still seeking volunteers in the gay community. About
1,000 people have signed up so far.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,000 volunteers, about 3,300 will receive the vaccine
and the remaining 1,700 will receive a placebo consisting of a
harmless mixture of sterile water and aluminum hydroxide.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers face this dilemma: There is no way to determine
whether the vaccine is effective unless the volunteers are exposed
to the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. On the other hand, medical
ethics prevent the researchers from promoting risky sexual behavior
on the part of the volunteers. In fact, volunteers are warned
against unsafe sex when they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the research is the assumption that men like Pfaff
and Snell will stray from the safe-sex regimen and have unsafe sex
sometime during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it very clear from day one that we know what safe
sex is,'' said Pfaff. ``But they don't want anybody necessarily to
change their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret McCluskey, the trial's project director for the
Washington area, stressed that the volunteers are counseled
regularly on safe sex practices.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``We all know that knowledge doesn't always
change behavior. We are relying on human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pfaff and Snell say they practice safe sex and will
continue to do so during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Snell acknowledges that, in the heat of the moment, some gay
men will opt for unprotected sex at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all take risks,'' he says. ``Hopefully, they are educated
risks. It's a reality that not everyone is perfect all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite safe-sex counseling and the good intentions of
participants, researchers estimate that during the three-year
experiment 1.5 percent of the placebo group will be infected with
the deadly virus each year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial, researchers will compare the infection
rate of the placebo group with that of the vaccine group. If
AIDSVax is effective, the vaccine group should have a lower
infection rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything under 1.5 percent, we'd be very happy about,'' said
McCluskey. ``We'd have to ask, `Did the vaccine do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The expected 1.5 percent infection rate in the placebo group is
based on previous studies by the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of gay men counseled
on safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Against other diseases, vaccines have proven to be an extremely
effective weapon. Once-deadly scourges like smallpox and polio have
been all but wiped out in the developed world as the result.
</P>
<P>
   Those successful vaccines were perfected in similar clinical
trials during which one group received the vaccine _ and ended up
healthy _ and a control group got a placebo and ended up
contracting the disease being studied.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were accepted onto the trial, Pfaff and Snell and
the other volunteers had to meet several criteria: They had to be
sexually active with other men. The study requires that they be
involved in a monogamous relationship with an HIV-positive man or
have had sex with three or more men during the last year and have
had anal sex during that period. They have to be HIV negative at
the outset and pass a physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are required to read and initial each page of a
12-page consent form that warns them that they shouldn't assume the
vaccine protects against HIV _ that's what the experiment is
attempting to determine.
</P>
<P>
   An informational pamphlet tells volunteers, ``You will not know
if you are receiving the placebo or the study vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the experiment focuses on gay men, who account for the
majority of new HIV infections each year in the United States, it
also includes a small percentage of women because they account for
a growing segment of new cases.
</P>
<P>
   Female volunteers must have contracted a sexually transmitted
disease sometime in their lives and have had at least two male sex
partners in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In both genders, the trial is ``double blind,'' meaning that
neither the volunteers nor the experiment's administrators, nor the
vaccine's manufacturer knows if the volunteer is receiving the
vaccine or the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the government of Thailand are conducting a
separate large-scale experiment in Thailand to determine the
effectiveness of the vaccine against AIDS transmitted through
intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Snell decided to volunteer because of the terrible toll AIDS has
taken on the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of friends who have died,'' Snell said. ``I
felt that the potential benefits of the trial were significant.
It's an opportunity to participate in something that expands the
basic knowledge of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioethicists worry that if the vaccine shows only partial
effectiveness, it could spark an increase in risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a vaccine is eventually licensed for widespread use, it
is very unlikely to be 100 percent effective,'' said Michael Langan
and Chris Collins of the AIDS Research Institute at the University
of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, a so-called phase III human clinical trial, is
the final rung before the federal Food and Drug Administration
grants approval for widespread use. Phase III experiments are
designed to test the overall safety and effectiveness of drugs that
have already shown some benefit in prior studies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier phase I and phase II government-approved experiments
showed that AIDSVax protected chimpanzees from HIV infection and
sparked an immune system response in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is how effective is it in real-life
situations,'' said Dr. Donald Francis, president of VaxGen and a
former AIDS specialist at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   But already researchers are dampening expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the vaccine didn't work 100 percent in earlier
trials,'' said Joe Wright, a community coordinator for San
Francisco's Department of Public Health AIDS office.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason is that the vaccine isn't yet engineered to protect
against all strains of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should see this vaccine trial as a larger process
toward a successful vaccine at some point,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said one deterrent to getting more volunteers has been a
fear that the experimental vaccine may actually infect volunteers
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists stress that the vaccine cannot infect someone with
HIV. It is derived from a synthetic protein, not a live virus like
the polio vaccine. In addition, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases has already conducted six small trials on
the vaccine to ensure its safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is zero chance of infection,'' said Francis, who himself
has been inoculated with the vaccine.

FORGET THE MOVIE. LISTEN TO THE CD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (Eds: Andrew Essex is a staff writer for entertainment weekly.)  
 By ANDREW ESSEX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's unlikely that the movie ``City of Angels'' will be
celebrated at any of the forthcoming Hollywood awards programs. The
movie, a remake of Wim Wenders' 1988 film, ``Wings of Desire,''
stars Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, opened on April 10 to bland
reviews and grossed a respectable $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as all films that fail to endear themselves to critics and
vast crowds, it was shoved aside by a new crop of movies. By late
June, it could no longer be found in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Then something odd happened. On July 4, a month after ``City of
Angels,'' the motion picture, began its inevitable journey toward
videotape, ``City of Angels,'' the soundtrack, became the No. 1
album on the Billboard chart. Today, more than five months after
the movie disappeared from the theaters, ``Music From the Motion
Picture `City of Angels' '' remains firmly entrenched among
Billboard's top 40 albums.
</P>
<P>
   Having earned quadruple-platinum status (four million units
sold) and spawned two hit singles (``Uninvited'' by Alanis
Morissette and ``Iris'' by the Goo Goo Dolls), it has become the
best-selling record to be released in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That the No. 1 album of 1998 is a soundtrack seems particularly
apropos. Though film-music sales have long been a profitable
subdivision of the music business _ the two largest-selling
soundtracks of all time, ``The Bodyguard'' (18 million copies) and
``Purple Rain'' (13 million), dwarf ``City of Angels'' _ never have
so many been released in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 16 soundtracks appeared on the Billboard album chart;
in 1998, there were more than 50. ``This is an all-time high,''
said Liz Heller, an executive vice president of Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
   Of this year's major soundtracks, ``Music From the Motion
Picture `Armageddon' '' has earned triple-platinum certification,
and ``Hope Floats'' and ``Dr. Dolittle'' (both double platinum)
have also outlasted the movies they accompanied.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, nearly a month before the film arrived,
Dreamworks set a record by releasing three separate soundtracks
(pop, country and inspirational) for a single movie, the animated
feature ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a real concerted effort now,'' said Jeff
Mayfield, the director of charts at Billboard magazine. ``All the
major companies have units that deal specifically with soundtracks.
Sony has an entire division that works with every label in its
system. They exist to actively marry music to movies.'' (Sony
produced last-year's top-selling soundtrack, ``Music From the
Motion Picture `Titanic,' '' which sold 10 million copies.)
</P>
<P>
   Since movies and their soundtracks invariably are produced by
the same corporate entity _ Warner Brothers released ``City of
Angels'' and Warner Sunset/Reprise put out ``Music From the Motion
Picture `City of Angels' '' _ a successful soundtrack would seem to
be the ultimate synergistic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks also allow record companies to piggyback on a film's
promotional campaign, which reduces the album's marketing costs.
Though ``City of Angels,'' the film, grossed $55 million
domestically, it was estimated to have cost $80 million to make.
Industry analysts speculate that ``Music From the Motion Picture
`City of Angels' '' will gross roughly $30 million to $35 million,
which, theoretically, makes the soundtrack more profitable than the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Today, soundtracks have become prefab greatest-hits packages.
``More than ever, sales are measured in the short term,'' said Ron
Fierstein, manager of the pop singer Shawn Colvin, ``and
soundtracks are the quintessential short-term product.''
</P>
<P>
   With impatient corporate parents to placate, labels are less
willing to wait around for individual artists to assemble a body of
work from which hits packages can be fashioned. Soundtracks offer
instant commercial gratification without the expensive commitment
associated with long-term artist development.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This has created a culture in which success is increasingly
measured entirely in hit singles, and artists who are unable to
deliver are as unpopular with labels as overbudget filmmakers are
with movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting all your money into soundtracks is a dangerous
investment strategy,'' said Moby, the electronic music star who
scored much of the soundtrack for the recent James Bond film
``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' ``Record companies aren't building
artistic equity.''
</P>
<P>
   But record companies seem more sanguine about the long-term
effects of a marketplace larded with soundtracks. ``Overall, I
think the positives far outweigh the negatives,'' said Jack Rovner,
president of RCA Records. ``The exposure a new artist gets on a
big-selling soundtrack is incredible. And when you have an artist
in the middle of a down time _ as you did with Alanis Morissette _
it can have incredible results.''
</P>
<P>
   By including a Morissette song on the ``City of Angels''
soundtrack (the singer's first recorded work in three years), her
label helped whet the public's appetite for a forthcoming solo
album. ``You couldn't ask for a better setup,'' Rovner said.
</P>
<P>
   Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records, rejects the
notion that soundtracks can be detrimental to artistic growth. ``I
think `City of Angels' helped make Alanis a better artist,'' he
said. ``When we asked her to contribute a song, we never said
`Write a hit record _ or else!' We just wanted something by her.
But when `Uninvited' became a hit, it was a huge compositional
breakthrough. It taught Alanis that she could do what she wanted,
and still reach people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every artist is of the magnitude of Morissette, a
performer whose mere presence can turn a soundtrack into a hit
record. Given the limited appeal of the film ``City of Angels,'' it
is unlikely that the soundtrack would have fared so well without
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $15 a CD, customers are less likely to take a risk,'' said
John Grandoni, vice president of purchasing for National Record
Mart, a retail music chain. ``That's why soundtracks are so
successful. They're usually filled with recognizable names.''
</P>
<P>
   But lesser-known performers may not be so lucky. Even with a
song on the million-selling ``Music From the Motion Picture
`Godzilla,' '' an unknown band like Fuzzbubble may never be heard
from again because its label may feel that the group has already
had its best promotional chance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the larger question of whether soundtracks
actually bear any creative relationship to the films that they
represent. In the past, songs picked to appear on soundtracks were
assumed to advance themes expressed in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most soundtracks feature songs that are barely audible in
the movie, making the term ``music from the motion picture'' less
an example of synergy than, as Grandoni put it, ``false
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these albums are music `inspired by' the film,'' he
said. `` `Godzilla' is a great example. A lot of those songs aren't
even in the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayfield of Billboard takes the view that any exposure for
an artist is better than none. ``If you're heard on a soundtrack at
all, it's usually for 10 seconds over the jukebox in a coffee shop
while a character is ordering fries. I'm not sure that's
meaningful. But with 20 million people watching, hey, it's worth
the risk.''

HUMAN GUINEA PIGS TEST VACCINE TO PREVENT AIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doug Pfaff and Rand Snell, sexually active gay men,
are guinea pigs in the first large-scale test of an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Pfaff, 39, a salesman for a computer
training company from Fredericksburg, Va., and Snell, 43, a public
relations consultant from Washington, will regularly visit D.C.
General Hospital, roll up their sleeves and receive an experimental
inoculation called AIDSVax.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are part of a national experiment that by next June
will involve 5,000 high-risk participants _ mainly sexually active
homosexual men. The participants will be inoculated seven times
over 36 months, and have regular blood tests for any signs of
deadly infection they may contract through unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The program, managed by vaccine maker VaxGen of South San
Francisco, Calif., with help from the National Institutes of
Health, is still seeking volunteers in the gay community. About
1,000 people have signed up so far.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,000 volunteers, about 3,300 will receive the vaccine
and the remaining 1,700 will receive a placebo consisting of a
harmless mixture of sterile water and aluminum hydroxide.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers face this dilemma: There is no way to determine
whether the vaccine is effective unless the volunteers are exposed
to the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. On the other hand, medical
ethics prevent the researchers from promoting risky sexual behavior
on the part of the volunteers. In fact, volunteers are warned
against unsafe sex when they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the research is the assumption that men like Pfaff
and Snell will stray from the safe-sex regimen and have unsafe sex
sometime during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it very clear from day one that we know what safe
sex is,'' said Pfaff. ``But they don't want anybody necessarily to
change their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret McCluskey, the trial's project director for the
Washington area, stressed that the volunteers are counseled
regularly on safe sex practices.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``We all know that knowledge doesn't always
change behavior. We are relying on human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pfaff and Snell say they practice safe sex and will
continue to do so during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Snell acknowledges that, in the heat of the moment, some gay
men will opt for unprotected sex at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all take risks,'' he says. ``Hopefully, they are educated
risks. It's a reality that not everyone is perfect all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite safe-sex counseling and the good intentions of
participants, researchers estimate that during the three-year
experiment 1.5 percent of the placebo group will be infected with
the deadly virus each year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial, researchers will compare the infection
rate of the placebo group with that of the vaccine group. If
AIDSVax is effective, the vaccine group should have a lower
infection rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything under 1.5 percent, we'd be very happy about,'' said
McCluskey. ``We'd have to ask, `Did the vaccine do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The expected 1.5 percent infection rate in the placebo group is
based on previous studies by the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of gay men counseled
on safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Against other diseases, vaccines have proven to be an extremely
effective weapon. Once-deadly scourges like smallpox and polio have
been all but wiped out in the developed world as the result.
</P>
<P>
   Those successful vaccines were perfected in similar clinical
trials during which one group received the vaccine _ and ended up
healthy _ and a control group got a placebo and ended up
contracting the disease being studied.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were accepted onto the trial, Pfaff and Snell and
the other volunteers had to meet several criteria: They had to be
sexually active with other men. The study requires that they be
involved in a monogamous relationship with an HIV-positive man or
have had sex with three or more men during the last year and have
had anal sex during that period. They have to be HIV negative at
the outset and pass a physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are required to read and initial each page of a
12-page consent form that warns them that they shouldn't assume the
vaccine protects against HIV _ that's what the experiment is
attempting to determine.
</P>
<P>
   An informational pamphlet tells volunteers, ``You will not know
if you are receiving the placebo or the study vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the experiment focuses on gay men, who account for the
majority of new HIV infections each year in the United States, it
also includes a small percentage of women because they account for
a growing segment of new cases.
</P>
<P>
   Female volunteers must have contracted a sexually transmitted
disease sometime in their lives and have had at least two male sex
partners in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In both genders, the trial is ``double blind,'' meaning that
neither the volunteers nor the experiment's administrators, nor the
vaccine's manufacturer knows if the volunteer is receiving the
vaccine or the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the government of Thailand are conducting a
separate large-scale experiment in Thailand to determine the
effectiveness of the vaccine against AIDS transmitted through
intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Snell decided to volunteer because of the terrible toll AIDS has
taken on the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of friends who have died,'' Snell said. ``I
felt that the potential benefits of the trial were significant.
It's an opportunity to participate in something that expands the
basic knowledge of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioethicists worry that if the vaccine shows only partial
effectiveness, it could spark an increase in risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a vaccine is eventually licensed for widespread use, it
is very unlikely to be 100 percent effective,'' said Michael Langan
and Chris Collins of the AIDS Research Institute at the University
of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, a so-called phase III human clinical trial, is
the final rung before the federal Food and Drug Administration
grants approval for widespread use. Phase III experiments are
designed to test the overall safety and effectiveness of drugs that
have already shown some benefit in prior studies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier phase I and phase II government-approved experiments
showed that AIDSVax protected chimpanzees from HIV infection and
sparked an immune system response in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is how effective is it in real-life
situations,'' said Dr. Donald Francis, president of VaxGen and a
former AIDS specialist at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   But already researchers are dampening expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the vaccine didn't work 100 percent in earlier
trials,'' said Joe Wright, a community coordinator for San
Francisco's Department of Public Health AIDS office.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason is that the vaccine isn't yet engineered to protect
against all strains of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should see this vaccine trial as a larger process
toward a successful vaccine at some point,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said one deterrent to getting more volunteers has been a
fear that the experimental vaccine may actually infect volunteers
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists stress that the vaccine cannot infect someone with
HIV. It is derived from a synthetic protein, not a live virus like
the polio vaccine. In addition, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases has already conducted six small trials on
the vaccine to ensure its safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is zero chance of infection,'' said Francis, who himself
has been inoculated with the vaccine.

INTERNET MUSIC, TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamond Rio PMP300 personal music player, one of the most
significant new products to appear in 1998, comes in a box that
promises ``Internet music in the palm of your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   We can all be grateful that Internet music is a new distribution
system, not a new musical genre. Having seen computer nerds dancing
at their company parties, I can say with little fear of
contradiction that as dancers, they are very gifted programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But these computer programmers are transforming the music
industry. The catalyst is a compression formula called MP3, which
is the basis of the $199.95 Rio player, from Diamond Multimedia,
and the music industry's sudden intense interest in the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about music on the Internet, of course.
More than 40 million copies of a free program called Real Player
have been downloaded from Real Networks (www.real.com) to enable
Web users to listen to music and radio broadcasts ``streaming''
through their computers. But with a few exceptions, the music is
transient. It goes in one virtual ear and out the other.
</P>
<P>
   MP3, whose formal technical name is MPEG Level 3, is emerging as
the most popular format for storing music on computer hard disks
and on the Internet. It will eventually be replaced by something
better, but for now, MP3 is the Internet software du jour.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 allows big audio files to be condensed to about one-tenth
their size without significantly harming the music quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio is the first and so far only portable MP3 player, so
there is a lot of pent-up demand for it among MP3 fans, especially
young people who are already using their computers as alternatives
to dorm-room stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Rio-type MP3 players could quickly become an alternative to
portable cassette or CD players, and that would further strengthen
MP3's role at the desktop. These devices will evolve quickly, as
will the technical standards, so cautious consumers may want to
wait for the chorus before plunking down a couple of C-notes.
</P>
<P>
   Compression is very important for the Rio, and indeed for music
distribution over the Internet. MP3 allows a 40-megabyte song to be
compressed to 4 megabytes or less, so it can be transferred in
one-tenth the time. As Internet connections get faster, music
downloads that once took hours will be compressed to minutes, and
minutes to seconds.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 music is often described as ``near CD quality.'' Some
people, whom I suspect were terriers in their previous lives, can
discern the subtle differences between ``near'' CD quality and CD
quality, but most normal humans cannot. MP3 music on the Rio sounds
better than FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Where is this leading us? On the fastest Internet connections,
the kind that record stores and companies like Amazon.com might
some day maintain in kiosks in malls, it might be possible to buy
and download a song, an album, an audio book, an electronic
textbook, a piece of sheet music _ anything that can be digitized
and delivered over a computer network _ in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The music, or other digital content, might be downloaded into a
portable music player like the Rio, or into a digital camera, or a
smart cellular phone, or a PC smart card, or a palm-size PC or any
other small digital device that has storage capabilities and
standard digital interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, the device could be emptied into a PC and the content
routed to the appropriate digital playback device, whether it is a
digital stereo, a digital television or an electronic book.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio PMP300 is in effect a prototype of these future digital
devices. It is about the size and weight of a pack of playing
cards, so it can be clipped to a belt or tucked in a pocket. It has
simple controls and comes with a set of ``ear bud'' speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Rio has 32 MB of flash memory on a special chip,
enough to hold about one hour of compressed digital music. You can
increase the capacity of the Rio in 30-minute increments by adding
16 MB memory cards, which cost $49.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Because the music is stored on a chip, there is no skipping or
jitter during playback, as there often is with portable CD or
cassette players. Even mountain-bikers and jackhammer operators can
appreciate a scratch-it-out hip-hop tune without those annoying
mechanical jumps and skips.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Rio cannot record music directly from the Internet. It
merely plays back MP3-encoded music that has already been recorded
onto the hard disk of a personal computer. Once the music is copied
into the Rio's flash memory, it can only be erased, but not copied
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with software (for Windows 95 and 98 only) that
enables computer users to encode their own music collections in the
MP3 format, typically through the CD-ROM drive (similar software,
both commercial and freeware, is available on line). People who
want to digitize and compress their vinyl albums, cassettes and
reel-to-reel tapes will have to surmount other hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio itself is easy to set up and to operate, although there
is plenty of room for improvement in such areas as changing the
sequence of tunes.
</P>
<P>
   So, MP3 signals the dawn of cheap, global distribution of
near-CD-quality music over the Internet. Why, then, do music
industry lawyers reach for the garlic and wolf bane whenever
someone mentions it?
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America went to court
earlier this year in an unsuccessful attempt to block Diamond from
introducing the Rio, citing its lack of a copy-protection
mechanism. The beauty of digital music, or the horror of it,
depending on your point of view, is that you can make an infinite
number of copies of an MP3 file without any loss of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Without some sort of copy protection, the record companies and
the artists they represent have no guarantee that they will be
paid. Without that guarantee, the lawyers say, artists and their
labels will have no incentive to make music or to pay music
industry lawyers. Civilization as they know it will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a coalition of music industry and Internet companies
agreed to form the Secure Digital Music Initiative, whose ambitious
goal is to develop a universal digital copyright protection scheme
that will prevent the unauthorized copying of digital recordings.
The group believes it can do in less than a year what the entire
computer software industry has been unable to do in two decades:
stop software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for the Rio is expected to appear at next month's
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Samsung Electronics of Korea announced plans
to bring its Yepp MP3 player to North America sometime next year. A
``deluxe'' version of the Yepp includes an FM radio, a voice
recorder that can store 40 minutes of speech and a display that
shows the song title, artist and even lyrics of each tune being
played. Prices were not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs showed a prototype MP3 player at last month's
Comdex trade show in Las Vegas but was coy on the timing of its
entry to market. Some companies may be holding off until the Secure
Digital Music Intitiative's efforts become clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia, maker of the Rio, said it will support the
SDMI standard when it emerges. But in response to a question sent
by e-mail earlier this week, a Diamond spokeswoman wrote, ``It's
too early to determine whether or not Diamond's current Rio would
support such a standard through software, or if the company will
support the standard through a new device.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it will be at least a year before the music
industry comes up with an alternative to MP3. When it does _ if it
does _ the current crop of MP3 players may not work with the new
format.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, MP3-encoded music is proliferating on the Web
and the Rio is for now a stylish way to tune in. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doug Pfaff and Rand Snell, sexually active gay men,
are guinea pigs in the first large-scale test of an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Pfaff, 39, a salesman for a computer
training company from Fredericksburg, Va., and Snell, 43, a public
relations consultant from Washington, will regularly visit D.C.
General Hospital, roll up their sleeves and receive an experimental
inoculation called AIDSVax.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are part of a national experiment that by next June
will involve 5,000 high-risk participants _ mainly sexually active
homosexual men. The participants will be inoculated seven times
over 36 months, and have regular blood tests for any signs of
deadly infection they may contract through unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The program, managed by vaccine maker VaxGen of South San
Francisco, Calif., with help from the National Institutes of

1,000 people have signed up so far.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,000 volunteers, about 3,300 will receive the vaccine

harmless mixture of sterile water and aluminum hydroxide.

<P>
   At the end of the trial, researchers will compare the infection
rate of the placebo group with that of the vaccine group. If
AIDSVax is effective, the vaccine group should have a lower
infection rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything under 1.5 percent, we'd be very happy about,'' said
McCluskey. ``We'd have to ask, `Did the vaccine do that?'''
</P>

   The expected 1.5 percent infection rate in the placebo group is

   ``When a vaccine is eventually licensed for widespread use, it
is very unlikely to be 100 percent effective,'' said Michael Langan
and Chris Collins of the AIDS Research Institute at the University
of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, a so-called phase III human clinical trial, is
the final rung before the federal Food and Drug Administration
grants approval for widespread use. Phase III experiments are
designed to test the overall safety and effectiveness of drugs that
have already shown some benefit in prior studies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier phase I and phase II government-approved experiments
showed that AIDSVax protected chimpanzees from HIV infection and
sparked an immune system response in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is how effective is it in real-life
situations,'' said Dr. Donald Francis, president of VaxGen and a
former AIDS specialist at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   But already researchers are dampening expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the vaccine didn't work 100 percent in earlier
trials,'' said Joe Wright, a community coordinator for San
Francisco's Department of Public Health AIDS office.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason is that the vaccine isn't yet engineered to protect
against all strains of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should see this vaccine trial as a larger process
toward a successful vaccine at some point,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said one deterrent to getting more volunteers has been a
fear that the experimental vaccine may actually infect volunteers
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists stress that the vaccine cannot infect someone with
HIV. It is derived from a synthetic protein, not a live virus like
the polio vaccine. In addition, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases has already conducted six small trials on
the vaccine to ensure its safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is zero chance of infection,'' said Francis, who himself
has been inoculated with the vaccine.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has set a deadline of the year
2007 for the development of a vaccine against AIDS
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 AIDS vaccines are being studied around the
world and three of them already show promise, according to Dr.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and a leading AIDS expert.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine closest to winning approval by the federal Food and
Drug Administration is AIDSVax, manufactured by VaxGen Inc. of
South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   AIDSVax is now in a large-scale Phase III clinical trial, the
final hurdle before FDA approval. The vaccine is derived from a
genetically engineered protein, called gp-120, that is a copy of a
protein found in the HIV virus. After being injected into a human,
the vaccine sparks the immune system to create HIV antibodies. The
Phase III test will determine whether those antibodies attack the
HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Another vaccine is produced by the U.S. subsidiary of the French
pharmaceutical company Pasteur-Merieux Connaught. The firm, based
in Swiftwater, Pa., is exploring a so-called vectored vaccine that
utilizes a harmless virus _ canary pox _ that has been injected
with HIV genes. When injected into human subjects, the resulting
brew stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has been tested on a small number of people and is
currently in Phase II clinical trials with a larger group of test
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early results have been encouraging,'' says Fauci.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA will decide next year whether to allow Pasteur to
conduct a Phase III clinical trial involving thousands of human
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The third vaccine is the so-called ``naked DNA vaccine'' being
developed by Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines of Madison, N.J. This approach
involves injecting a small amount of the DNA of the HIV virus into
a person's muscle in order to prompt the immune system to recognize
the invader and develop antibodies that protect the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preliminary data look pretty good,'' Fauci says.
</P>
<P>
   Other vaccines under development include vaccines that use
either ``whole killed'' HIV virus or live HIV virus or HIV protein
fragments or man-made viruses to stimulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists disagree over whether any of the vaccines will be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci contends that Clinton's 2007 goal is within reach. ``We
are well-positioned to meet this goal with the extraordinary basic
and applied research that is now underway,'' Fauci told an
immunization conference last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. R. Scott Hitt, chairman of Clinton's advisory council on
HIV and AIDS, believes that a working vaccine ``is not going to
happen in 10 years without a stroke of luck or intensification of
efforts to coordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Avrett, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, said that despite the scientific
activity, only slow progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably a decade or two away from an effective vaccine
that could be distributed throughout the world,'' Avrett said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the National Institutes of Health cautions that
finding am effective AIDS vaccine is a tremendous undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only prediction one can make about development of an AIDS
vaccine is the same one that can be made for the development of any
vaccine _ the path will not be straight and much will be learned in
the various disciplines of vaccinology in the process,'' the report
said.

   It is proverbial that old men plant trees as an act of faith,
precisely because they know they won't themselves live to sit under
their shade. In this spirit, we believe the time has come to put
aside political differences and plant seeds of justice and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for this, for during our presidencies each of
us made difficult and controversial decisions in efforts to heal
national divisions _ the pardoning of President Richard Nixon and
the granting of amnesty for those who had avoided the Vietnam
draft.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of President Clinton's impeachment by the House of
Representatives, America once again suffers from a grievous and
deepening wound. Our people are angrily divided. Our political
institutions are called into question. Public confidence erodes
under waves of personal smearmongering.
</P>
<P>
   Against such a backdrop of inflamed emotions, we are convinced
that the public good requires a prompt and fair resolution of the
impeachment issue. While our acts of pardon or clemency are not
directly analogous to the decision pending before the Senate, how
that body resolves the issue can have similar benefits of healing
and finality.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Senate procedures, through their flexibility and
freedom, provide the means to end this national ordeal in ways that
can uphold the rule of law without permanently damaging the
presidency. Before the senators make history, we hope they will
first turn to history for help in devising what would be, in
effect, a unique punishment for a unique set of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and thirty years have passed since the last
impeachment of an American president. At the time of President
Andrew Johnson's 1868 trial, as now, Senate Standing Rules and the
Rules of Impeachment permitted almost all motions and matters of
evidence to be determined by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   (By way of example, early in the proceedings, Chief Justice
Salmon Chase, who presided over Johnson's Senate trial, put to a
vote the question of whether to delay the trial for 40 days as
requested by Johnson's lawyers. Members responded by granting only
10 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Most recent impeachment cases involving judges have been
resolved expeditiously by having a trusted bipartisan committee
hear the evidence, either in public or private sessions, before
making a recommendation to the full body for its consideration. How
might all this bear on the current situation? In addition to
immediate dismissal of the charges against Clinton, there are four
alternatives for the Senate to weigh: a trial followed by
acquittal; a trial followed by conviction and removal from office;
a trial followed by censure; or censure without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As intended by the founders, a two-thirds majority presents a
formidable obstacle for the advocates of conviction and removal.
Moreover, the sharp divisions rending the House, though sincerely
held and based on principle, do not bode well for a quick or clear
decision on either acquittal or removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   However one now supposes a trial may end, it seems inevitable
that by rehashing the lurid evidence of Clinton's misconduct, we
will only exacerbate the jagged divisions that are tearing at our
national fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve. Make no mistake, the
judgment of history does matter. It matters profoundly. And
impeachment by the full House has already brought profound disgrace
to Clinton. Whatever happens in the near future will do little to
affect history's judgment of him.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone in standing before the bar of judgment. Our
political system too is on trial. Can we find within ourselves the
will, the vision, the generosity and, yes, the courage to resolve
the present crisis in a way that makes Americans proud of their
leaders, their institutions and themselves?
</P>
<P>
   It is with this in mind that we personally favor a bipartisan
resolution of censure by the Senate. Under such a plan, Clinton
would have to accept rebuke while acknowledging his wrongdoing and
the very real harm he has caused.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional resolution should contain language stipulating
that the president's acceptance of these findings _ including a
public acknowledgment that he did not tell the truth under oath _
cannot be used in any future criminal trial to which he may be
subject. It may even be possible for the special prosecutor
publicly to forgo the option of bringing such charges against the
president when Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Some may object that a censure can be repealed by a future
Congress, and is thus rendered meaningless. They underestimate the
power of the modern news media to foster indelible images in the
public memory. In any event, no one can undo Clinton's impeachment
by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   It is the genius of our Constitution that its authors provided
us a governing charter whose legal mechanisms permit the nation to
heal itself, so long as the end result is both justice and grace.
Clearly, the American people expect and desire an outcome that is
firm, fair and untainted by partisan advantage. That is the
challenge before us. How we meet that challenge will go a long way
toward healing our divided nation.

 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington.
 &HT;    We know that the huge majority opposes President Clinton's
impeachment. Too often, the press has attributed this irrefutable
fact, which is shown clearly in the public-opinion polls, to some
notion of economic comfort, as if Clinton were being supported only
out of the selfishness created by a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from our economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold ever
since the Clintons entered the White House, by many of the same
right-wing groups who now stand for his impeachment.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that the Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of the
National Organization for Women and other women's groups who staged
a hunger strike outside the White House in the vain hope of
dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual-harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative-action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual-harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual-harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual-harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual-harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky at all. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not
constitute a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal
status may be an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as
lawyers say. We who support sexual-harassment law are not the sex
police. Any idea that this law allows such policing will only
defeat a good and much-needed statute.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    The only thing that might be gained here is an understanding
that the religious right wing has won a disproportionate control of
Congress because so few Americans vote. If we get mad enough to
stop being the democracy with the lowest voter turnout in the
world, even this painful charade may have been worth it.

 &HT;    
 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington.
 &HT;    We know that the huge majority opposes President Clinton's
impeachment. Too often, the press has attributed this irrefutable
fact, which is shown clearly in the public-opinion polls, to some
notion of economic comfort, as if Clinton were being supported only
out of the selfishness created by a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from our economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold ever
since the Clintons entered the White House, by many of the same
right-wing groups who now stand for his impeachment.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that the Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of the
National Organization for Women and other women's groups who staged
a hunger strike outside the White House in the vain hope of
dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.

<P>
   Q: My husband and I disagree about whether Natalie Wood did her
own singing in ``West Side Story;'' I say she didn't. Who's right?
_ A.H., Northbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. The singing was performed by Marni Nixon, who also
sang for Audrey Hepburn in ``My Fair Lady'' and Deborah Kerr in two
films, ``An Affair to Remember'' and ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon sings as Grandmother Fa in the Disney film ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was not told that her singing was going to be dubbed, Nixon
told the ``St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' in 1993. ``They let her sing
the whole thing, and then threw it away. In Audrey's case, she was
actually taking singing lessons. They told her they would only dub
the high notes, and then, of course, they threw the tape away
without telling her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Moreno's songs in ``West Side Story'' were dubbed by Betty
Wand, who also performed for Leslie Caron in several films.

</P>
<P>
   A: Heritage USA, which was renamed New Heritage USA after Bakker
lost ownership, closed its doors in 1997 after several years of
declining business.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord Entertainment, owners of the Grand Ole Opry, held an
option to purchase the 2,000-acre property for a $250 million,
1,000-room hotel. That agreement was canceled in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Mill, S.C., resort and water park was one of the most
popular U.S. tourist attractions before Bakker's conviction on
federal fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bakker sold more than 150,000 ``lifetime partnerships'' offering
a free hotel room at Heritage USA three nights each year for life.
The cost was typically $1,000. He was paroled in 1994 after serving
five years of a 45-year sentence.

A RALLY AROUND THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This MEANS-COLUMN usually is filed on Thursday)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The irony of the House impeachment of President
Clinton is that he would be re-elected if the presidential election
were held today.
</P>
<P>
   It has stunned conservative Republicans, the Washington
establishment and the senators who now must put him on trial that a
hefty majority of the public is rallying behind the president
despite his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken after the House vote indicate that Clinton's job
approval ratings actually went up across the country. A New York
Times/CBS poll, typical of the others, reported that 72 percent of
those surveyed approved of the way he is handling his job.
</P>
<P>
   The 72 percent that said they approved included 90 percent of
the Democrats surveyed, 74 percent of the independents, 35 percent
of the conservative Republicans and 61 percent of all other
Republicans. An impressive sweep indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And although nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said Clinton
does not share their moral values not even half of them _ only 41
percent _ felt that Congress does any better in sharing their moral
values.
</P>
<P>
   It is important that our national leaders understand what is
going on here, although at the moment they seem to be struggling
with conflicting interpretations, complicated by their own
emotions. It is difficult for them to get past hardened opinions of
their own: Either they loathe Clinton for a pattern of lying or
they think sex is a private matter, even in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans I know who watched the House hearings are angry at
the partisanship of the Democrats, who repeated each other in their
arguments against impeachment. Democrats I know who also watched
are similarly furious at the GOP's rote exaggeration of the damage
done by Clinton to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody came away enlightened. Nobody felt justice was being
fairly meted out by an impartial body. But the burden of creating
that impression was largely that of the Republicans, who controlled
the institutional process and the majority votes. They failed, and
the public noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The same partisanship among viewers was evident after the
president's upbeat performance on the White House lawn after the
House rebuke. It either was (a) proof that he is so shameless he
doesn't realize what hit him or (b) proof that he is such a
determined leader he won't give in to what he sees as an unfair
assault by his enemies. You could view it either way, depending on
your own bias.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the president did not have much choice short of hiding
in a closet with a paper bag over his head. He does not intend to
resign, so he must try to govern. And to lead he must carry on as
though his spirit is not broken and his very being is not shaken.
</P>
<P>
   He must appear tough and resilient, as we expect our leaders to
be. Whatever the private truth, he must never let us know. It is
his strong public persona around which voters rally.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one of the reasons why the public still supports
Clinton in spite of the fact that he is a lying lecher. The House
GOP majority, the snooty Washington social elite and self-important
media biggies don't get it because they never liked Clinton in the
first place. In their view, he was slippery white trash, not one of
their own and not deserving of his position.
</P>
<P>
   But voters are more sensible and independent than politicians
like to believe. The public is happy with Clinton's policy
leadership; the budget is balanced, the economy is strong, no
American soldiers are dying on foreign soil, the nuttiest
right-wing and left-wing notions are stalled and life is generally
good. Women in particular feel his diversity programs have advanced
their opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters have no desire to change presidents. They view such
an event as an unsettling development bound to create uncertainty
and instability. They are satisfied with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue disingenuously that kicking out Clinton would
not be upsetting because another Democrat, Vice President Al Gore,
would take his place. But Gore is not Clinton; it was not Gore's
name at the top of the 1992 and 1996 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would be an accidental, unelected president and therefore
lack a mandate to do much of anything, just what the Republicans
want. And voters realize no two individuals are alike; the country
is not yet sufficiently familiar with Gore's thinking to know just
how that difference might play out.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense in the country that Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's ruthless pursuit of Clinton's private life was
gross overkill. It strikes terror in the most innocent of hearts to
realize that if the subpoena power can do this to a president,
worse can be done to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation, we have an innate sense of personal privacy. We are
curious about the messy lives of celebrities who invite media
scrutiny but we don't want our own lives exposed for others to
judge. It should not be surprising that voters identify more with
the president than Starr.
</P>
<P>
   We always rally around the flag when the flag is in trouble. It
is in our patriotic nature. And for good or ill, the president of
the United States still personifies the flag.
</P>
<P>

of the Time magazine cover of Adolf Hilter. It was 1938.)

   BAGHDAD _ He is still pulled through the skies by reindeer, but
it's under the crescent moon of the Islamic Iraqi night. He is
welcomed with ``Jingle Bells'' in English and Arabic and he is know
as Baba Noel, not Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he visit the homes of the five percent of the
population that is Christian, he'll stop at some homes of the many
Muslims who take part in Christmas in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he will not have enough treats in his sack to
keep this from being another rough Christmas in Baghdad. This city
is catching the Christmas spirit just a week after four days of
missile attacks from U.S. and British forces.

   The temperature is in the 70s, but inflatable plastic Baba Noels
dangle on the fronts of stores while the customary portraits of
President Saddam Hussein hang by the cash registers. Offices play
Christmas music for callers on hold and Iraqis are ready to
celebrate in a multi-denominational way that is unusual in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   On a busy intersection in this city of five million Arabs,
Muslim youth Samar Hussein came with his lifelong Christian friend
Ronny Latif, to pick out a Christmas tree from a street vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Latif, 16, will take the tree home. But Hussein, 17, will enjoy
the Christmas festivities also and they will share each other's
feast. Hussein will attend Latif's Christmas party, and Latif will
join in the evening's Ramadan dinner with Hussein. They will eat
minced lamb meat, kabobs and date pies. ``We are like brothers,''
says Hussein, who noted that Christ is considered a prophet in the
Muslim Koran. ``(Christ) is a prophet sent by God, just like
Mohammed.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan coincides with
Christmas. Out of respect for the majority religion, Christians are
asked not to celebrate Christmas too publicly.
</P>
<P>
   There will be fewer Christmas parties in nightclubs and no
alcohol in public. But, even many Muslims will have trees in their
homes and tell their children the story of Baba Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new year for all of us, not just for Christians,''
says Layla Aziz, 24, a Muslim who works in a flower shop that sells
Christmas decorations. She will have a tree at home this year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nahhal, a Lebanese who directs the Iraqi office of the
Middle East Council of Churches, says the participation by Muslims
in Christmas is partly because Christians and Muslims have never
had the kind of conflicts here that they have in other Arab
countries. The 11th century European crusaders, for example,
trounced Lebanon and Syria but did not reach Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 900,000 Christians in Iraq. The most famous is
Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, who is Saddam Hussein's point
man in the public relations battle with the United States. Some say
he has obtained his prominent public role precisely because he is a
Christian and therefore not a political threat to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 50 churches in Baghdad, and others are under
construction. There may be another 50 around the country and some
areas are majority Christian.
</P>
<P>
   But, things are hard in Iraq for Christians and Muslims alike
right now. Trade sanctions in place since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 have left the economy in a deep depression. Recently Virginia
Michael, a 36-year-old Christian Iraqi, brought her children to the
streetside tree stand, where you can buy a scraggly pine for about
$4. One of Michael's sons hopes to get a Sega game cartridge this
year and her little daughter wants a bicycle. Another daughter on
roller skates zipped around the Christmas trees for sale.
</P>
<P>
   With her curly brown hair, sweater and pants, and her fluent
English, Iraqi-born Michael could pass for an American shopper.
But, a month ago, she and her husband, a musician and studio
engineer, sold their 1985 Mazda for $2,000 in hopes they can use
the money for applying for visas and attempting a move to the
prosperous United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, who moved from Iraq to Chicago, send money. But she
has not seen them for nine years. Of course, their week before
Christmas was ruined by the missile strikes. ``I wish this would be
the last Christmas I spend here,'' she says, shaking her head and
appealing for Americans to stop the bombing. ``I believe it will
never be safe here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas, her family sings ``Jingle Bells'' in Arabic. But,
as they shop for trees, her 5-year-old daughter Maryann is singing
a different jingle she picked up last week: ``Down with America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you hear what she's singing?'' Michael says with disbelief.
``I would like to live anywhere it will be safe for my children and
they will not have to think of these songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week she, her husband and their four children slept
together on the kitchen floor, away from the windows that rattle
during the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling my kids that maybe Santa would not come this
year. Maybe he's busy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But, now that they have the tree, they will decorate it with
balls and angels and cook stuffed chicken for Christmas. She thinks
Baba Noel will be able to come through, after all, with Maryann's
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to do my best,'' she says. ``She's been asking for
a long time and I cannot break her heart.''

   BAGHDAD _ He is still pulled through the skies by reindeer, but
it's under the crescent moon of the Islamic Iraqi night. He is
welcomed with ``Jingle Bells'' in English and Arabic and he is know
as Baba Noel, not Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he visit the homes of the five percent of the
population that is Christian, he'll stop at some homes of the many
Muslims who take part in Christmas in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he will not have enough treats in his sack to
keep this from being another rough Christmas in Baghdad. This city
is catching the Christmas spirit just a week after four days of
missile attacks from U.S. and British forces.

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON COMPUTERS AND GADGETS

   A Business Card That Says a Lot
</P>
<P>
   Business cards have become crowded with Web page and e-mail
addresses, cellular phone numbers and other contact information,
but a New York company has found a way to include pictures,
graphics and a resume, among other things. How, you ask? Well, the
space isn't (italics)on(end italics) the card, it's embedded in it.
</P>
<P>
   Ember Media Corp. has begun selling the new card, called
DigiCard, which is about the same size and shape of paper cards,
though with a hole. That is because the card fits into the CD-ROM
tray of a computer. The card carries 16 megabytes of information,
plenty of data to make someone remember who you are, said Ember
Media's president, Clayton Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desk is filled with business cards and I have no idea who
these people are anymore,'' he said. ``I'll hand you a business
card and you'll always be able to plug that sucker in and remember
who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he said most of the cards, at more than a $1 each, that
have been ordered have not been for use as business cards but as
marketing devices. For instance, the Okidata Corp. ordered 50,000
cards to promote its new color printer to distributors and agents. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a Game, Crime Pays, If You Are Organized  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Popular simulation computer games like Sim City and Civilization
reward players for building strong, smoothly-running communities.
Now comes a new strategy game that also rewards the occasional
murder, extortion plot and torching of local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The game is Gangsters: Organized Crime, which puts the player in
the position of an aspiring mob boss. The idea in this $49.95 game,
made by Eidos Interactive of San Francisco, is to make the right
business decisions necessary to slowly take control of a city that
resembles Chicago (where else?).
</P>
<P>
   But to become an underworld king, you must be more than a mere
violent reactionary with a yen for overtaking a metropolis. You
have to recruit hoods, decide how and where to deploy them, choose
how much violence you'll use and allocate resources.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and maybe worst of all, deal with lawyers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Sim City where you build something, a fire
happens and you send out fire trucks,'' said Gary Keith, spokesman
for Eidos. ``You're a mob boss and the goal is to be the richest
and most powerful man in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should be renamed Sim-sin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple's On-Line Store Closed for Renovations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the week before Christmas, and all through North America
consumers were snatching up Apple Macintosh computers as fast as
Apple could make them. So why, then, did Apple close its online
store for the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino, Calif., computer company, which earlier this year
brazenly vowed to teach Michael Dell a thing or two about selling
computers over the Internet, has been herding potential customers
away from its Web operations (www.store.apple.com) in recent weeks,
at the height of the busiest sales time of the year. And then, this
week, visitors to the Apple Store were greeted with a notice that
the site would be closed for renovations until Jan. 5. (Apple
executives did not respond to requests for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web site message asks shoppers to patronize retail stores
that sell Apples.
</P>
<P>
   Does this signal that Apple is trying to appease its retail
dealers, who are not crazy about Apple competing with them. Not
necessarily, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies
Inc., a consultancy in Campbell, Calif. He noted that anyone who
ordered a Macintosh on line after Dec. 17 would not receive it by
Christmas anyway, because of shipping times.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who insist on buying via the Web, there are
alternatives: Macmall.com and Macconnection.com, to name two.
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin noted it is probably no coincidence that the Apple Store
is expected to reopen on the same day that Steve Jobs, Apple's
chief executive, makes his opening keynote address at the Macworld
Expo in San Francisco.

LIFE GOES ON FOR BURN VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Mary Rogers
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, just when he's found some sense of peace, Jamie
Cashion catches someone staring at him and he knows that, forever
and always, he will be different. For almost half his life, he has
lived with the prying eyes, the questions, the uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him, and Jamie will tell you that life isn't about getting a
good hand, but about playing a bad one well. He'll say life is
precious, family matters and there's no time to waste. Life goes
on, he'll say. You must go on, too.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he likes fast cars and expensive watches, kids, dogs,
dancing, old jeans, tennis shoes _ and people, most of all. He'll
tell you he's been lucky. He married his childhood sweetheart, runs
a successful Fort Worth insurance agency, owns a new 2-story home,
enjoys volunteer work and goes to church on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   He could be the all-American boy next door, the fun-loving class
favorite, the guy who seems always to win _ except for one fateful
afternoon almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Pam Harrison, wasn't worried when she signed the
consent forms for Jamie to register as the youngest volunteer
fireman in little Joshua, Texas. Her brother had been a firefighter
and a policeman, and there was never a concern.
</P>
<P>
   What could happen? She thought Jamie would be safe _ and he
might have been, if the wind hadn't turned.
</P>
<P>
   The minute the fire signal sounded, an ominous tingle rocketed
up his spine, raising the hair on his neck, and he knew that this
fire was different from all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the faint alarm ringing somewhere deep inside his head,
Jamie rushed to the Joshua Fire Hall, where he joined other
volunteer firefighters preparing to fight a ferocious fire that was
racing across a rolling grassland west of Crowley, a Fort Worth
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie was 16 that February afternoon in 1984, a happy-go-lucky
high school sophomore, the life of the party, a kid with boundless
energy and a mile-wide streak of mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Before day's end, he was barely clinging to life, writhing in
pain, his face, hands and legs gouged by the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and his mother have the same brown eyes, the same sense of
fun _ the same understanding of calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie isn't old enough to remember the car crash that put his
mother in a wheelchair. He was only a toddler then. She was 23,
with two little kids and a marriage that was ending.
</P>
<P>
   She was alone and driving too fast on a dark road. The curve
must have been a surprise. One miscalculation. One error in
judgment. A lifetime without useful legs.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, she cried if a stranger looked at her. She
withdrew, she says, sat and watched life rush past, a dizzy
kaleidoscope of color and lost opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't accept her predicament, refused to use her
wheelchair. Friends carried her from place to place in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie is different, she says. He throws himself at you. He
wants to touch you. He wants you to touch him. He's in your face
and smiling, making a joke, demanding attention _ affection, too,
if he can get it.
</P>
<P>
   He chases after life with an enviable verve. She told him not to
let it get away.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was excruciating, raw and throbbing. Jamie fidgeted and
gritted his teeth; his burned hands, excavated to the bone, were
swathed and hanging from netting above his hospital bed. The sheet
was tented above his cooked legs, and his face _ his face was a
swollen blob, blackened and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, masked attendants hoisted him into a stainless-steel
tub brimming with bleach-treated water and scraped the dead tissue
from his burns. He screamed and cried and cursed them. He bit and
kicked and tried to make them stop.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, his mother tried to comfort him, her voice low and
soothing, but Jamie grew more agitated, more demanding, more
recalcitrant.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie's aunt, Mickie Tigner, watched one day as Pam pulled
herself up out of the wheelchair and dragged herself onto Jamie's
hospital bed. She crawled closer and closer until she was only
inches from her son's scorched face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thank God for your pain,'' she whispered, tears spilling
down her face. ``I can feel nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such powerful admonitions became so common, Jamie can't remember
that particular incident. Mickie says she'll never forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Other things are burned into Jamie's memory.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jamie got to the fire hall that Saturday afternoon,
he was pumped; ready to go. His friend Duwayne Capps jumped behind
the wheel of truck No. 7724 and Jamie got on the back. Duwayne, 30,
was the father of two small children. He liked Jamie's spunk and
had arranged for Jamie to join the volunteer team.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stephens ran from the feed and veterinary supply store he
operated next to the fire hall and offered to drive one of the
trucks. Pat Clark drove another.
</P>
<P>
   When they saw the white smoke rising into the winter sky, they
knew this fire was like none they'd ever seen. More than a dozen
fire departments from all across Johnson and Tarrant counties were
racing to the blaze, sirens screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by a 40-mph wind, the flames roared across 2,000 acres of
grassland south of Farm Road 1187 _ and then jumped the road. The
heat was intense. The trucks coughed and sputtered, choked by the
thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie stood on the back of the truck, spraying water, but a
squirt gun might have been as useful. The 18-foot-tall flames
rolled through the high grass like ocean waves. Pat's truck
stalled, and he jumped out and ran. Terrified, Jamie ran, too.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, the wind shifted.
</P>
<P>
   A wall of fire rolled over the trucks. Suddenly, Pat was on fire
and running. Somehow, Duwayne got him into the cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the smell; burned skin, burned hair and the
burned-rubber smell of his boots,'' Duwayne says now.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened and fighting to keep the sputtering truck moving,
Duwayne had no idea that Jamie was lost in the inferno. MORE:
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: in the inferno. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamie smelled his own flesh burning, felt the flames gouge his
skin.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he was dying. ``Oh, God. Oh, God, don't let me die,''
he screamed. Let me live, he prayed. Let me live. Don't take me
today. Not today. I'm only 16. For one black moment, there seemed
no hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I rose up. I rose up out of those flames. It was like a
great hand _ the hand of God _ pulled me up out of that fire. I
could hear people shouting `This way. This way.' I was running
then, and I could see shadowy figures on the other side of the
flames.''
</P>
<P>
   He broke through the fire, and Duwayne and another firefighter
grabbed him and smothered his burning clothing with their bare
hands, but his life had changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   At Huguley Memorial Medical Center in Fort Worth, his frantic
mother tried to push past hospital personnel, but only banged her
wheelchair into the doorjamb. She tried again and again, calling to
Jamie over and over as hospital employees tried to quiet her. Jamie
called back, and she knew he was alive, but his words were
unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie was airlifted to the Parkland Memorial Hospital burn unit
in Dallas. For days, his eyes were swollen shut. He communicated by
wiggling his toes. Visitors tied on sterile masks and gowns before
entering his room. He felt isolated and adrift, worried that
something might happen to his family and that he would be left all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   He begged his mother to kiss him. Afraid to remove the sterile
mask, afraid she would harm him, she refused. But Jamie pleaded all
the more. Finally, she relented. She kissed him then, and every day
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie was moved to Shriners Burns Institute in Galveston. His
father, insurance executive James Cashion, chartered a jet for the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Shriners was, for Jamie, a life-changing experience. Who could
forget the children there? Some had no ears, no feet. Little
fingers had been burned away. Faces were twisted into grotesque
masks.
</P>
<P>
   Any idea that Jamie had about beauty and bravery was challenged.
He saw that some people were forced to live a life they hadn't
chosen. He was one of them. Doctors wanted to amputate his fingers,
but his mother wouldn't allow it. His fingers are misshapen now,
twisted by the fire, but useful.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Joshua didn't forget the wounded firefighters or the
one they lost, Larry Stephens, who died a few days after the blaze.
Three Crowley firefighters were also burned. At a blood drive, 400
people stood in line to give; there were benefit dances and bake
sales. Volunteers waited at the stoplight, holding out
firefighters' boots for donations.
</P>
<P>
   When Jamie returned to school, he was something of a celebrity.
Everyone knew what had happened. Joshua was like a warm cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Duwayne went by Jamie's house, even helped change his bandages,
but he didn't go often. It was too hard to see Jamie that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie's stepfather, Jim Harrison, shouldered most of the
responsibility for daily care. Each day, Jim left his job at the
convenience store and came home to bathe Jamie's hands, pull off
the dead tissue and re-dress the wounds. Then it was back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Life outside Joshua was harder.
</P>
<P>
   To graduate with his class, Jamie had to attend a summer session
at a Fort Worth school. As he stood in the registration line,
pretty girls stared or looked away. He didn't know these people.
They didn't know him. He called his mother in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to come and get me,'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come home today, you'll have to go back tomorrow,'' she
said. She might as well have said ``Life goes on, Jamie. You go on,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember the exact number of corrective surgeries he
endured _ between seven and 10 over the next year and a half. Some
released his fingers. Some freed scar tissue so he could open his
mouth wider. Some improved the appearance of the burns on his face.
He was stoic about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened, and nothing's going to change it,'' he said. ``I
know I have to make the best of what I've got. I'm lucky I've got a
face there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie tried not to think about his appearance. He got busy. He
volunteered in political campaigns: a sheriff's race, a senator's
bid for election. Gov. Ann Richards appointed him to the Governor's
Committee on People With Disabilities. He discovered he had a
talent for karate (he has just earned his third-degree black belt),
and he began teaching karate classes at a Fort Worth recreation
center in a tough neighborhood. He has been at it more than six
years now. He loves the kids but says he's not ready for children
of his own _ not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie first saw Summer Rich at a ball game. She was in the sixth
grade, his cousin's friend. Summer grew into a blond beauty, a high
school cheerleader who could have her pick of beaus.
</P>
<P>
   She picked Jamie. She says Jamie's scars never bothered her.
Theirs was a long off-again, on-again courtship that began when she
was 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie proposed during his grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary
party in 1995. He called Summer to the microphone, read a poem he'd
written and slipped a ring on her finger.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie had ordered more than 300 roses. The waiters arranged
bouquets of them in a heart shape on the floor. Jamie and Summer
were in the center, dancing slowly to ``Unchained Melody.''
</P>
<P>
   They married in September 1996. She was 26. He was 29. Like most
young married couples who haven't established their own traditions,
they fret about where they will spend the holidays; his parents'
house or hers. They try to balance time together and time alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie's mom always thought he'd go into politics. So did
Duwayne. Jamie laughs, but sometimes sadness veils behind the
lively brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he thinks about trying plastic surgery again to
improve the facial scars. He shrugs. It's painful. It takes so long
to heal. He doesn't like to be out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, I'll just keep what I've got,'' he
says. But who knows? Maybe. Someday.
</P>
<P>
   In one fateful afternoon, his whole history changed _ but not
his spirit. Ask him, and he'll tell you he grew up fast that day.
Ask him, and he'll say life is precious, family matters and there's
no time to waste. Ask him, and he'll say life goes on, and you've
got to hurry after it or it might get away.

ENTER THE COMPUTER-GENERATED CONDO AND WALK AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (js) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's say you're a developer with a pile of rubble
where a new building is going to be. Today's market for luxury
condominiums may not last forever. How do you move those
multimillion-dollar three bedrooms before you can say, ``The stock
market's down 512 points again''?
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, like the late 1980s, you really had no choice:
you rented an office (preferably ground floor) in a fancy location,
put some easels around the room, stuck up architects' renderings
and handed out embossed brochures _ and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's virtual reality _ the catchall real estate term
for computer-generated videos that mimic a visit to an existing or
still-imagined building. It is becoming part of a growing number of
sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard to explore a vision of a building with the
old techniques,'' said Jessica Schick, director of sales for the
Macklowe Organization. ``Now we're able to take buyers inside our
heads. You can understand the mood of the place, walk around.''
</P>
<P>
   Macklowe paid $100,000 for a three-minute computer-generated
video of its unfinished new condominium building at 145 E. 76th
St.It was designed by Hugh Hardy, with interiors by Peter Claman.
Apartments are priced from $1.55 million for a three bedroom (plus
library and dining room) to $6 million for the penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Macklowe sales office, prospective buyers sit in front of
a television set for an imaginary trip to see what the hulking
16-story steel frame will eventually look like.
</P>
<P>
   There are the antique-nickel front doors. See them swing open to
admit the lucky new owner. See the tall columns and the white
marble floors incised with geometric designs. There are the
Palladian-influenced doors leading to the courtyard, which the
marketers call a ``cortile'' (because anything Italian is
fashionable these days). Look! There's a tile mural on the wall of
the cortile, and in the middle something that looks like a
smokestack. It is an obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obelisk is coming out,'' Ms. Schick said. ``We're going to
have a fountain instead.'' There are no pictures of the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   If you walked around the construction site now, it would be
difficult to rhapsodize about the cortile. It is a slab of
concrete, covered with trash and surrounded by barbed wire. ``This
is where you saw the doors open,'' Ms. Schick said cheerily,
pointing to a chain-link fence near a plywood construction cabin.
</P>
<P>
   But the new sales pitch seems to be working. Eight of the
building's 20 condos have been spoken for. Occupancy is scheduled
for late March.
</P>
<P>
   While the use of action renderings to sell unbuilt buildings is
new, a handful of national real-estate chains use their own version
of virtual reality: visitors to their Web sites can click on
certain (usually high-end) apartments and houses and zoom through a
panorama of the rooms, following a pointing hand as it sweeps
across kitchen counters and up the staircase. The National
Association of Realtors reports that buying properties on the
Internet is soaring. And virtual-reality designers say that
animated renderings and those that show existing housing are both
suddenly big business.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lewis, vice president for marketing at Ipix, a large Oak
Ridge, Tenn., company that specializes in virtual-reality videos,
said that the number of real estate clients ``really started taking
off in the last six months and now doubles monthly.'' At the end of
1997, he said, there were 100 Ipix vignettes on 100 brokers' Web
sites; now there are 5,000. At David Williams 3D Media, a
four-year-old computer-animation company in Manhattan, Williams
said the use of virtual reality for selling real estate has grown
from 30 percent of his business to more than 75 percent in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Barbara Corcoran, chairman of the Corcoran
Group, a large Manhattan real estate company, tried to interest
Donald J. Trump in virtual reality to sell condominiums at Trump
International Hotel and Tower, his bronze-clad edifice at Columbus
Circle. She didn't envision a television set showing a video but a
custom-built circular room, with life-size computer-generated
images ringing the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Trump turned her down.
</P>
<P>
   In May, William and Arthur Zeckendorf began using virtual
reality to sell their new 43-story tower at 515 Park Ave., at 60th
Street, and have been refining it ever since. Last month, they
unveiled a new 15-minute ``tour'' of the building, with people,
furnishings _ and William and Arthur Zeckendorf, pointing and
welcoming in every room. Their take on virtual reality cost
$100,000, William Zeckendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   The 515 Park show comes with music by Aaron Copland. As
``Appalachian Spring'' winds down, the narrator intones that this
will be the first new apartment building on Park Avenue in 70
years. ``That's the part that always gets me teary,'' Zeckendorf
said, rising to flick off the giant television set.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketers are not so sentimental _ or so enamored with the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have just sold $2.5 billion of product without it, we
are obviously not impressed,'' said Louise Sunshine, chief
executive of the Sunshine Group. ``We're actually building a
kitchen and powder room and bathroom for the Chatham in our
showroom _ the moldings, the doors, the floors.'' The Chatham is
the building being built by Related Companies at the corner of
Third Avenue and 65th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Sunshine said, she takes a fresh look at the
state of virtual reality every six months. ``We're waiting for the
technology,'' she said. ``It's not upscale enough for us yet.''

 Alice Keim, a teacher, is the technology coordinator for the Horace
Mann Lower School in the Bronx, N.Y.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most common complaints about computers is that they
can take the place of reading. That is not a new complaint. Each
time a new distraction has arrived _ comic books, television _ the
same fear has been trotted out. Now it's the computer that looms
over children, enticing them to stare aimlessly at a screen for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, some basis for these fears. New technology
does, at times, distract children from educational activities like
reading. Do not, however, underestimate the power of interactive
technology to help build skills. Many of today's toddlers can click
a mouse and operate a computer long before they know their ABC's.
</P>
<P>
   They are learning computer skills early and are still learning
to read at an appropriate age. Building on the children's
familiarity with computers, software companies have produced
programs that help children build reading skills starting in the
preschool years.
</P>
<P>
   Reading software is available for all elementary school students
of any age, although it tends to be more effective for the earlier
elementary and preschool years. Programs can help very young
readers gain basic reading skills and confidence, and slightly
older learners build comprehension, vocabulary and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Computer programs can never replace reading books, singing songs
or working with alphabet blocks, but they are a valuable complement
to these activities.
</P>
<P>
   The programs act as personal tutors, waiting for children to
respond to questions or repeat sounds before progressing. For
decades, children have sung along as their favorite television
characters taught them to sound out letters.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive programs add a whole new dimension to this
transaction by responding to children in a way that the one-way
television broadcast cannot. Just as ``Sesame Street'' has become
an acknowledged and valued educational resource, so, too, will
educational software.
</P>
<P>
   The reading programs on the market today use a variety of
approaches: phonics, drills, visual repetition and games. When
looking for a reading program, it is important to ask what the
program does that cannot be done better through more traditional
teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the program has talking characters that are more
entertaining than the still pictures, or its audio helps a child
work more independently. Perhaps your child has difficulty sitting
for a block of time, and a software program provides enough
variation in activities to keep the child's interest.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for any educational software, remember to pick
programs with characters and activities that will appeal to your
child. Even at the preschool level, there is a huge variety
available, from simple programs based on picture books that read
aloud with your child to full-fledged programs that are like games.
While many programs are designed for independent work, others work
best if a parent is working with the child. &QL;

<P>
   READER RABBIT'S READING
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Company; $29.95; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98, and Mac
7.0.1 and higher.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Reader Rabbit programs are among the most popular programs
for early elementary students. What is really impressive are the
improvements made to this already appealing, educationally sound
product.
</P>
<P>
   The story line: Reader Rabbit; his sidekick, Sam the lion, and a
helpful mouse, Mat (short for Matilda), are on a vacation in search
of their imaginations. After you sign in, the screen flashes to a
map with points of interest marked with pictures of books. Thirty
books across three levels are supposed to be read to get to the end
of the map.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop on each level features a Sound Sorter game, which
requires the child to help a monkey by sorting colored crystals.
The monkey has three pots with a word written on each one. He holds
a crystal and then says a word, and the child is supposed to put
the crystal in the pot with that word. My first-grade students
loved this game.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey and animation made them giggle, and they became
determined to sort all the crystals. Some words in this section are
too complex for younger children to sound out, but even they can
repeat the words shown on screen again and again, helping them
memorize some words and pick correct answers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the phonics activity is completed, the child needs to read
two books. The books allow children to repeat words and then hear
their own voices played back. Children are supposed to read aloud
with the computer at every level. But I noticed that children
working alone tended to flip through the pages quickly without
repeating the words or answering the questions in an effort to move
to the next game.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second stop on each level features a picnic-basket rhyming
activity in which the player must create a huge sandwich out of
pieces of food with words written on them _ the object is to create
rhyming piles. And the user meets a friendly vowel owl looking for
her voice. She introduces short and long vowel sounds, and the
other characters on the screen emphasize these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The third stop includes two new reading books and questions
similar to those that appeared in the earlier level and a game
called Silly Syllables. In this game the player must put together
sounds to create new words.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the program is with the Help section: it was
left over from an earlier program and is essentially useless to a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Reader Rabbit uses audio throughout. There is no consequence for
wrong answers, and words and sounds can be repeated whenever
needed. That allows children to answer by process of elimination,
but it also gives them many opportunities to figure out the correct
response. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BAILEY'S BOOK HOUSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 2-5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Edmark; $19.95; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98, and Mac 7.0.1 and
later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of interactivity that fails to interact. The
Bailey's Book House program is popular but doesn't accomplish
anything that could not be better accomplished away from the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is a cat who hangs out in his play book house. Different
areas of his house lead to different learning activities. The
Three-Letter Carnival section, for example, has two different areas
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first area shows a lawn with different characters and
objects scattered around. Click on any object and the word for it
is written out and sounded out slowly. Reading with your child can
accomplish this goal better.
</P>
<P>
   The second level is better. The child must fill each car of a
roller coaster with rhyming words. If the first car has a bug in
it, the user could click on pictures of a rug, a jug and a mug to
complete the train. Every word is spoken out loud when the child
picks it.
</P>
<P>
   If the user clicks on the typewriter in Bailey's house, the
Letter Machine pops up. If your child likes to use the computer,
this is an effective tool for teaching the alphabet and letter
sounds. Clicking on any letter brings up that letter and a phrase
using it.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of the program is excellent, and it is easy to
hear the emphasis on the letter sounds. But, again, the same goal
could be accomplished with a good alphabet book.
</P>
<P>
   The Read-a-Rhyme section is a wonderful area for parents to work
with their children. The screen shows a phrase with a missing last
word. In the corner are four pictures of words that would complete
the sentence with a rhyming sound.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Rub-a-dub-dub, three kids in a ...'' could end with
tub, sub, shrub or club, depending on the user's choice, and the
completed sentence is then read aloud and the sentence is shown as
an animated picture. Children find this hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   The My Friend activity is something like a digital Potato Head.
This area should help cement the words for body parts, like eyes
and nose, but the presentation is too confusing. On the screen are
an animated creature and three columns, two with descriptive words
and one listing body parts. Click on a word to change the
character's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   I watched some kindergartners play with this program and they
clicked furiously, paying no attention to the actual words. Some of
the level's elements are effective for teaching the children to
identify body parts but not for recognizing actual written
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed for 2- to 5-year-old children and
consequently does not require any reading skills. That is
important, as many programs that cater to this age group fail to
recognize that even the simple words ``click the mouse'' on the
screen mean nothing to a child who cannot read.
</P>
<P>
   Children may learn some basic vocabulary from Bailey's Book
House, but the program is too simple. Children will probably
outgrow it quickly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR'S COMPUTER ADVENTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $29.95; Windows 95 and 98, and Macintosh.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arthur's Computer Adventure is part of the respected Living
Books Interactive Adventures Series. Several parents recommended
this program to me and when I carried the box through the halls of
my school, several children wanted to know when they could start
playing with it. While the box says it is for children 3 to 7, it
was clear from my students' responses that children as old as 10
enjoy the program.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring the activities section of the game, which stars
the Arthur character of the books by Marc Brown and of PBS's most
popular children's show, I quickly realized why my students were so
enthusiastic. There are five activity areas, all of them fun but
none of them particularly educational.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the Deep Dark Sea, where I navigated a scuba-diving
Arthur around the hazards of the deep sea but was horrified that
this could in any way be classified as educational. The game is
pure entertainment and does not, as the publisher states, help
children learn about world geography or ocean life.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankenfish, children can combine features of different fish
to create new sea creatures with funny names; I found it equally
disappointing. While it provides some basic information about fish
types, the information is superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections provide useful reading exercises. In Treasure
Hunt, the player matches pictures with the words identifying them
to move along a path to a treasure. If the given word is ``mom''
and the player correctly clicks on a picture of Arthur's mom, the
player progresses three spaces, one space for every letter in the
word. When you win the game, you get to choose what to do with the
treasure and read a newspaper article about your decision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a store run by D.W., Arthur's sister, players can hone their
counting skills by providing change to pay for various items. The
activity also has a cafe where the player follows D.W.'s direction
for various recipes by dragging various ingredients to her mixing
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   My students quickly discovered that they did not need to listen
to D.W. and that there was little consequence to not following a
recipe. D.W. does not even react when the player puts three worms
in the mixing bowl rather than eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Copter also proved disappointing. The player navigates a
remote-controlled fire helicopter around a room while trying to
drop water balloons and firefighters on targets. Although that was
initially fun for my students, they quickly tired of it and moved
on. Like too much of this program, the educational content seemed
to be an afterthought. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   READING BLASTER VOCABULARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-12 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure; $20; Windows 3.1 and 95, and Mac 7.1 and
later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kids 9 to 12 years old are a tough audience for educational
software. These children have already discovered the world of
electronic games, and some have formed a clear aversion to any
software related to learning.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Blaster picks up the challenge. This program's
characters are cute, but they are also suave and on the edge of
cool. Rave the detective is a green monster with two large eyes and
no other facial features. At a press conference on the opening
screen, players are assigned to solve a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery and clues center on a mansion where a party is going
on. Rave explains that the party guests like to play word games and
that the child, armed with a map and a word list, will have to beat
them at their own game to find the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, there is a mouse party. To earn a clue, the
player must complete eight sentences by choosing from vocabulary
words that the mice sporadically hold up on signs. But the game is
irritating because the words appear too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridor, there is a well-designed arcade-style horse
race game. You move your horse ahead by choosing a letter (using
on-screen alphabet buttons) and then pressing Go. The object is to
write the longest word possible without ending the word. If players
try to write the word ``slide,'' for example, the player that is
first to form ``slid'' moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent game and challenges students both to form
words and to recognize roots of words. The fourth graders I
observed playing this game became truly determined to keep the
words going for as long as possible in this section. It is as much
an exercise in logical thinking as vocabulary building.
</P>
<P>
   The program contains several other activities including a
crossword puzzle and a simple definitions test. For the latter, you
are seated at a card table with four monster guests and you click
on a stack of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Each card contains a vocabulary word. The monsters scribble down
a possible definition, and you must select the one that is correct.
The effect is similar to the age-old use of flash cards and can
help students prepare for tests and quizzes. It is hardly an
innovative game, but playing against the monsters in a mansion is
more fun than flipping through flash cards.
</P>
<P>
   After you have gathered all of your clues, you go back to your
detective notebook. You have six clues that you put together to
form three words that turn out to be the true clues to evaluating
the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene reminiscent of Agatha Christie, Rave assembles all
the characters in the library. When the user finds a suspect that
matches all three clues, the mystery is solved.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly liked the ability to create your own word list. A
parent or teacher could easily customize this program for practice.

MARK ROBBINS, ARTS ENDOWMENT'S POINT MAN IN DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (js) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years under congressional siege _ and a spring rally by
conservatives to annihilate it _ the National Endowment for the
Arts, whose budget was finally secured in September, may
understandably be looking for steady ground to tread. But under a
new chairman, William J. Ivey, who has said he believes the
endowment should be as important as the Department of Defense, the
NEA is marching, not slinking, to the front lines in its support of
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ivey announced the appointment of Mark Robbins, a
curator, teacher and artist, as the new design director, a post
that has been vacant for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, 42, is currently curator of architecture at the Wexner
Center for the Arts and an associate professor of architecture at
Ohio State University, both in Columbus. Born in New York, he
studied architecture in Florence and London and in 1981 received
his architecture degree from Syracuse University. He opened his own
architectural practice in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's visible, and that's what's needed,'' said Hugh Hardy, the
architect who is a former chairman of the endowment's Design Arts
Advisory Panel and who was consulted in the search for a design
director. ``It has been a long, difficult battle to find someone.
People who are creatively engaged think that Washington will put
them to sleep rather than offer them an opportunity to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Robbins, who was under consideration last year to become
dean at the Yale School of Architecture, is credited by many for
his indefatigable commitment to establishing the Wexner as a
laboratory for exploring new ideas in architecture and design.
``Mark Robbins will lead the arts endowment in strengthening the
presence of design in this country,'' Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-year tenure at the Wexner, Robbins'
interdisciplinary approach proved to be as provocative as the
deconstructed fortress that houses the center, a design by Peter
Eisenman. There, Robbins originated exhibitions ranging from
``House Rules,'' which matched architects with social critics to
design houses, to ``On the Table,'' opening on Jan. 30, a look at
how tables divulge a wealth of information about class, sex, race
and social rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Robbins was in Washington to familiarize himself with
a new bureaucracy and to pursue the task of finding a loft.
``There's never really been any industry here,'' Robbins said,
sounding exasperated at the prospect of leading the downtown life
in a Federal-style town house.
</P>
<P>
   As for his goals in his new post, which starts with overseeing
the distribution of grants in the design field, Robbins said, ``I'd
like to look at design in the widest possible scope and at the ways
the public realm can be enhanced by it.'' He added that he saw the
suburban no man's land _ the strip mall and the parking lot _ as
the public spaces most in need of attention. ``The only truly
public space we've invented is the mall and the parking lots where
you see so many kids parked in cars drinking beer. Perhaps we can
find a better focus for these interim spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   As an installation artist, Robbins has contributed to what are
known as gender studies, a loosely defined area of inquiry that's
been popular on campuses since the early 1990s. Ralph Lerner, the
dean of the School of Architecture at Princeton University,
described gender studies as ``a waning subject in architectural
discourse,'' which, he added, had ``helped us think about a lot of
things in fresh ways, including domesticity and the relationship
between architecture and the state of women and minorities in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' work in gender studies included a 1994 installation, at
the Museum of Modern Art in Saitama, Japan, that analyzed what he
described as ``the fetishization of the blond, blue-eyed woman.''
The installation included a brick wall with a small opening that
framed views of the museum's Meiji-period paintings of
``impressionistic, creamy-pink Caucasian nudes,'' he said. Robbins
hopes to bring the same spirit of inquiry to his new job. ``After
all,'' he said, ``education is the first step toward action.''

WINE THAT BURNS IN THE LAMP OF MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn.) (bl) 
By NEAL KARLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ As usual, I didn't start holiday shopping this
year until the mound of catalogs in my living room reached chair
height. Speed-leafing through these paeans to yuppie gewgaws, I
paused at a funky-looking wish book from Semplex of U.S.A., one of
the country's leading specialty houses, serving amateur winemakers
since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, I spied a $154.25 trilevel Steam Juice Extractor
imported from Finland and used to crush grapes painlessly and
efficiently. I also noticed the $389 Buon Vino Super Jet Filter, an
Italian import capable of pumping 80 gallons of wine an hour. But
no way was I buying any of it. My family has its own claptrap tin
wine press, which my uneducated country-boy grandfather
quixotically lugged across Europe and to the United States three
generations ago.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather fled Russia in 1911, leaving behind his wife and
two young daughters late one night. A half-step ahead of the czar's
draft board, he carried only one reminder of home. It might have
been smarter to choose something light and easy to conceal. Instead
he took that bulky wine press, which he carried on his back across
Europe and then transported over the Atlantic to America.
</P>
<P>
   The family wine press, you see, could travel free; his wife and
children would have to pay steerage. His plan was to earn passage
to America for them as quickly as possible. But it was seven years
before he could send for them, from someplace called Minnesota. In
the meantime, he began using his wine press in his new world, which
was overflowing with Scandinavians; for the uneducated country boy
who spoke no English, the wine press was home.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather made sweet peasant wine. In the old country, his
homemade wine was so righteously tasty, he had won the honor of
making it for religious sacraments in the village. His wine came
from a secret recipe, with all that entails. It was never written
down, of course. Only one family member in each generation was
taught the precise combination that yielded the wine, which was
sacramental enough to please the village's religious leaders, yet
carried the wallop of a Joe Louis uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather, an Orthodox Jew, arrived in a land populated by
Norwegians and Swedes and kept making the wine that had made him
famous back home. He had a small but appreciative audience among
the small number of fellow Jewish emigres, who, like the
grandfathers of Bob Dylan and Joel and Ethan Coen, had emigrated
from czarist Russia to the banks of the upper Mississippi. Because
of his wine, my grandfather was a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition? Not for him. He received a religious exemption for
his sacramental wine. And if the leftovers went to the neighbors,
so what? He never charged anybody.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, his Mason jars of wine were going out as Christmas
presents to neighbors named Olson, Swenson and Andersen. Always
willing to provide a free ecumenical snort to the good Lutherans,
my grandfather died in 1974, as Willie Loman would have had it,
``well liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before that, he revealed the recipe to my father. Upon
inheriting the wine press, my father moved it from my grandfather's
basement to our suburban garage, where every fall, to the
neighbors' dismay, a truck unloaded hundreds of pounds of
Michigan-grown grapes. And there in the garage it sat, a
century-old contraption that looked like the Tin Man's head in
``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   My American-born father, a physician, added a few improvements
to his father's packaging. He gave away the Christmas wine in
recycled Lacroix and Evian bottles, labeling it ``Karlen's Purple
Foot Special,'' after the grape-stamping scene in ``La Dolce
Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the recipe came to me. Personally, I thought it was
ridiculous to labor so hard to make something you could easily buy.
(That would be Manischewitz.) But traditions are traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The red Concord grapes came in mid-September, 400 pounds of
fruit divided into 20-pound lugs, or boxes. We worked like
stevedores. My father and I set the old press atop a 40-gallon
barrel; as he loaded the fruit into the hopper, I turned the crank.
</P>
<P>
   We poured in about 80 pounds of sugar, covered the whole thing
up and returned every five days to stir it with a stick. Somewhere
along the way, we funneled out the dregs and spread them on the
garden. A flock of sparrows descended on the muck, and in minutes
the yard was filled with drunken birds. The scene looked like a
cross between Hitchcock's ``Birds'' and Bukowski's ``Barfly.''
</P>
<P>
   All the sparrows eventually got home safely, and six weeks
later, on a crisp October day, the wine was ready for the
ecumenical folks of Minneapolis. Among the first tasters were two
friends of mine, musicians who considered themselves arbiters of
cool. They declared our wine better even than Jagermeister, nectar
of certain alternative bands of the '90s. They asked for more wine,
even after I warned them. Yet they, too, made it home safely.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could buy one of those Semplex specials, a machine to
mash and siphon and adjudge fermentation ratios automatically. But
that isn't the point. The press, I realize, is not just a way to
make way-cool wine. It is a way to remind myself of the illiterate
young man who carried a heavy wine press he had hammered together
himself across half a world. It is a way to remind myself of an old
man who had arthritis and no English, yet could woo the neighbors
with his potion.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after he died, I can see both him and where I
came from. I come from people who have a tradition. Like most
people who keep traditions, I will continue, no matter how much
backbreaking work and strenuous cranking our yearly winemaking
entails.
</P>
<P>
   As John Kennedy said about the space program, we Midwestern
sentimentalists do things not because they are easy; we do things
because they are hard. This evening, Karlen's Purple Foot Special,
vintage 1998, made the old-fashioned way, will be ready for
delivery.

MUSIC TO FEED NEW PLAYER: SOME FREE AND SOME LEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes the future works just the way it's supposed to. Soon
after I got a Rio PMP300, the portable player for MP3 music files,
I went to a Metallica concert. The band played songs by Diamond
Head, a band whose original lineup made albums between 1979 and
1983; as a critic, I wanted to double-check what it sounded like.
</P>
<P>
   Since I don't have any Diamond Head albums, I went on line to
the Ultimate Band List Web site (www.ubl.com), searched for Diamond
Head and found a site with a few Diamond Head songs as MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the songs that Metallica had played, but I couldn't
be picky. Downloading two of them with my home modem took about 10
minutes per 4-minute song; then I drag-and-dropped them into the
Rio's memory and listened on headphones.
</P>
<P>
   They sounded at least as full-bodied as a cassette on a Walkman
_ an improvement over the sound card that came with my computer,
which compares unfavorably with Dixie cups and string. Having
confirmed that Metallica owes Diamond Head plenty, I deleted the
songs from the Rio and, later, from my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I couldn't help looking at the teetering piles of CDs
in my office and imagining all that plastic gone, with the whole
library in cyberspace instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, the recording business says. No money changed hands
so I could listen to Diamond Head, and the major recording
companies consider my gleanings piracy, pure and simple. Nobody
paid Diamond Head or its label for the right to hurl their music
into cyberspace, where MP3 files can be not just downloaded but
copied, retransmitted or recorded onto CDs. Diamond Head didn't get
a nickel when I listened to the songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, the trade
organization for the major labels, has lately been busy searching
for MP3 sites and sending cease-and-desist letters to their
operators. Recording companies own the master recordings; they paid
to make them. Some Web page providers now forbid users putting MP3s
on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still hundreds and probably thousands of sites
where MP3s are available, whether it's a handful (as on the Diamond
Head site) or hundreds on categorized, alphabetized lists. Alta
Vista, the search engine (www.altavista.com), even suggests as a
sample search question, ``Where can I download MP3 files for
instrumental music?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoisting the Jolly Roger is easy enough. Plug ``MP3'' and a band
name into a search engine, and something downloadable will turn up,
although it probably won't be exactly what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 sites are unpredictable. One, Ripper, will hand over the
free songs only after you've stayed at certain hotels in
Czechoslovakia. A hip-hop site demanded that anyone who entered
vouch that they were not from the recording-industry association
and urged users to delete downloaded songs after 24 hours _ which
it couldn't, of course, enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking through sites, I found live Pearl Jam and Radiohead
songs (one apparently recorded from a television on a cassette),
house-music remixes of songs by Chinese pop stars, full albums by
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and obscurities from alternative-rock bands
like Slint.
</P>
<P>
   I also found plenty of dead ends and sites that had been shut
down or stripped of MP3s, including the one that promised rarities
from Joy Division and New Order and specifically refused to include
anything from commercially released albums.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sites shared an almost messianic enthusiasm for the
MP3 technology and an eagerness to trade music, not to profit from
it. One site demanded that users upload one song for every three
they downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   There are non-pirate MP3s around. Goodnoise (www.goodnoise.com)
sells songs for 99 cents and albums for $8.99 from various labels,
including the entire catalog of SpinArt Records; some songs are
available free as samples, while downloading the albums requires a
credit-card number.
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians use home-recorded MP3s to promote themselves
outside the realm of recording contracts and labels, at Web sites
like www.iuma.com and www.free-music.com. Even some established
bands _ to the disgruntlement of their recording companies _ can't
resist the idea of getting music to their fans instantaneously.
Soul Coughing offers an ``MP3 o' the Month'' of a live performance
or a song that doesn't appear on their albums, urging fans to
``Collect 'em All!'' (www.soulcoughing.com).
</P>
<P>
   Even with MP3 compression, music that sounds better than a
transistor radio occupies nearly a megabyte per minute, which
quickly clutters a hard drive; songs don't fit on 1.44 MB floppy
disks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio's 32 MB memory encourages an impermanent, constantly
changing playlist, downloading at whim and deleting when the mood
passes. The next time I wanted a song, I'd download it again. But
that's the ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Finding music on line is easy; finding a particular song is a
time-consuming, sometimes futile process, and it will be until the
major labels agree on a way to get their cut of the action. Until
that happens, I can only dream of empty shelves.

   CANBERRA, Australia _ Iraqi officials have said that United
Nations weapons inspectors will never set foot in their country
again, and the U.N. Security Council has just begun what is likely
to be a lengthy debate on the future of Unscom, its special
commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So when I left Iraq last week with the rest of the Unscom
inspectors, it may have been for the last time. Now seems an
appropriate moment to ask: Did the American air strikes last week
achieve what Unscom could not _ the disarming of Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the mission's objective was to reduce
Iraq's ability to make chemical and biological weapons. Officials
have reported that about 400 cruise missiles were fired at 100
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets were nine missile development factories, a
petrochemical plant and a biological research laboratory, as well
as military and intelligence establishments, the Republican Guard
headquarters and the building housing the Military Industrial
Commission, which oversees Iraq's special weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the list may appear impressive, the damage done to Iraq's
weapon-making ability was probably marginal. It is almost certain
that no missile hit hidden stockpiles of chemical or biological
bombs (not desirable anyway because of the contamination that would
result).
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors working for Unscom had searched for years for
such arsenals; if the inspectors had not found them, it is unlikely
that the United States, even with its impressive intelligence
resources, would know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the air strikes hit were ``dual purpose'' plants _
that is, sites that have nonmilitary functions but also have the
potential to contribute to the weapon programs. These would include
electronics plants that might be able to make missile guidance
components, steel works that could fabricate warheads and
refineries that could produce chemicals for nerve agents.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, such factories were used
for these very purposes. In uncovering Iraq's biological weapons
program in 1995, our Unscom team found a vaccine plant that Iraq
had converted to the production of biological warfare agents. More
than 5,000 liters of botulinum toxin, a horrific food poisoning
agent, had been produced there in less than two months. After the
war, the plant was converted back to vaccine production.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Unscom was monitoring these dual-purpose sites
closely. Until we evacuated just before last week's bombing, we
routinely inspected 63 factories that could contribute to a missile
program, 120 chemical-related plants and 93 biological plants. At
many of these sites, we had installed cameras, air samplers, heat
sensors and other devices to make sure no banned activity was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The Unscom inspection effort may have had its problems, but this
was one part of our work that was effective. If Iraq was rebuilding
its programs, it was not at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   So although the latest bombings surely destroyed some
dual-purpose operations, that was hardly a crippling blow. And even
those sites that were destroyed won't stay that way. Shortly after
the gulf war, I visited the vast Taji steel works on the outskirts
of Baghdad. Hardly a building remained standing; the devastation,
it seemed, was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I visited it last year, the plant had been completely
rebuilt, with some of the large machines, although pockmarked with
shrapnel, operating as before the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis had learned from their war with Iran to have plans
for the evacuation of vital equipment in times of crisis, and
certainly this was widely practiced in the gulf war. On one of my
early inspections in 1991, I found more than 100 pieces of
equipment for making chemical weapons hidden in a sugar factory at
Mosul, about 185 miles from the Al Muthanna weapons plant from
which they had originated. In short, buildings may have been
obliterated in last week's bombing, but not necessarily vital
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest blow Iraq suffered in the recent bombing
was to its missile development efforts. The cease-fire resolution
ending the gulf war required Iraq to eliminate missiles with a
range of greater than 150 kilometers, or 93 miles. Iraq was
permitted to develop shorter-range missiles, and since the war has
done so under Unscom monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that these shorter-range missiles could be
readily modified, by ``stretching'' the fuel tanks and improving
the guidance systems, into missiles with a range of 600 kilometers
_ sufficient to hit Tel Aviv or Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom has evidence that Iraq is still hiding missile fuel, an
issue that Iraqi officials have refused to discuss in the past
year. Because of this, many of last week's missiles were aimed at
missile manufacturing, launching and test sites. Since there
probably wasn't time to evacuate most of the heavy equipment from
these sites, the bombing has almost surely set back Iraqi missile
development, perhaps for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The news for Iraq's neighbors, and the world, is not so good
regarding Iraq's chemical and biological programs. It is clear,
even from the little information filtering out, that few of the
many plants capable of contributing to these programs have been
destroyed. I believe Iraq could be producing significant quantities
of biological agents within six months. For chemical agents like
nerve gas, the time range is one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver these agents continues to pose a problem for
Iraq, but Unscom has information that Iraq still has about a half
dozen Scud missiles hidden. And if Unscom inspectors or other
monitors are not permitted to return to Baghdad to keep an eye on
Iraq's dual-purpose factories, this threat will grow over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now for the Security Council and the world is how
to contain Iraq. President Clinton has not ruled out future
bombings, but this is no solution, and no one wants a permanent
state of war. The administration also wants to bring down the Iraqi
government, but Saddam Hussein seems remarkably resilient and the
opposition divided and weak. In any case, if Hussein is simply
replaced by his son Uday, the world may be no better off, and some
would argue it will be worse off.
</P>
<P>
   What is required is some creative thinking, but the Security
Council is polarized. Chances have to be taken with any solution,
and perhaps now is the time to consider the phased lifting of
sanctions _ say, over a period of seven years. This is not to
reward Iraq but to provide an incentive for it to accept strict
monitoring to ensure that its industries are not used to rebuild
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply would result in the freezing of sanctions at a
particular phase and restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could
sell. At the same time, tough import controls would be applied to
restrict what it could spend its vast oil wealth on. Through a
combination of carrot and stick, it is possible, just possible,
that Iraq could be brought back to the community of nations.

   CANBERRA, Australia _ Iraqi officials have said that United
Nations weapons inspectors will never set foot in their country
again, and the U.N. Security Council has just begun what is likely
to be a lengthy debate on the future of Unscom, its special
commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So when I left Iraq last week with the rest of the Unscom
inspectors, it may have been for the last time. Now seems an
appropriate moment to ask: Did the American air strikes last week
achieve what Unscom could not _ the disarming of Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the mission's objective was to reduce
Iraq's ability to make chemical and biological weapons. Officials
have reported that about 400 cruise missiles were fired at 100
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets were nine missile development factories, a
petrochemical plant and a biological research laboratory, as well
as military and intelligence establishments, the Republican Guard
headquarters and the building housing the Military Industrial
Commission, which oversees Iraq's special weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the list may appear impressive, the damage done to Iraq's
weapon-making ability was probably marginal. It is almost certain
that no missile hit hidden stockpiles of chemical or biological
bombs (not desirable anyway because of the contamination that would
result).
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors working for Unscom had searched for years for
such arsenals; if the inspectors had not found them, it is unlikely
that the United States, even with its impressive intelligence
resources, would know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the air strikes hit were ``dual purpose'' plants _
that is, sites that have nonmilitary functions but also have the
potential to contribute to the weapon programs. These would include
electronics plants that might be able to make missile guidance
components, steel works that could fabricate warheads and
refineries that could produce chemicals for nerve agents.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, such factories were used
for these very purposes. In uncovering Iraq's biological weapons
program in 1995, our Unscom team found a vaccine plant that Iraq
had converted to the production of biological warfare agents. More
than 5,000 liters of botulinum toxin, a horrific food poisoning
agent, had been produced there in less than two months. After the
war, the plant was converted back to vaccine production.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Unscom was monitoring these dual-purpose sites
closely. Until we evacuated just before last week's bombing, we
routinely inspected 63 factories that could contribute to a missile
program, 120 chemical-related plants and 93 biological plants. At
many of these sites, we had installed cameras, air samplers, heat
sensors and other devices to make sure no banned activity was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The Unscom inspection effort may have had its problems, but this
was one part of our work that was effective. If Iraq was rebuilding
its programs, it was not at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   So although the latest bombings surely destroyed some
dual-purpose operations, that was hardly a crippling blow. And even
those sites that were destroyed won't stay that way. Shortly after
the gulf war, I visited the vast Taji steel works on the outskirts
of Baghdad. Hardly a building remained standing; the devastation,
it seemed, was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I visited it last year, the plant had been completely
rebuilt, with some of the large machines, although pockmarked with
shrapnel, operating as before the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis had learned from their war with Iran to have plans
for the evacuation of vital equipment in times of crisis, and
certainly this was widely practiced in the gulf war. On one of my
early inspections in 1991, I found more than 100 pieces of
equipment for making chemical weapons hidden in a sugar factory at
Mosul, about 185 miles from the Al Muthanna weapons plant from
which they had originated. In short, buildings may have been
obliterated in last week's bombing, but not necessarily vital
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest blow Iraq suffered in the recent bombing
was to its missile development efforts. The cease-fire resolution
ending the gulf war required Iraq to eliminate missiles with a
range of greater than 150 kilometers, or 93 miles. Iraq was
permitted to develop shorter-range missiles, and since the war has
done so under Unscom monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that these shorter-range missiles could be
readily modified, by ``stretching'' the fuel tanks and improving
the guidance systems, into missiles with a range of 600 kilometers
_ sufficient to hit Tel Aviv or Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom has evidence that Iraq is still hiding missile fuel, an
issue that Iraqi officials have refused to discuss in the past
year. Because of this, many of last week's missiles were aimed at
missile manufacturing, launching and test sites. Since there
probably wasn't time to evacuate most of the heavy equipment from
these sites, the bombing has almost surely set back Iraqi missile
development, perhaps for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The news for Iraq's neighbors, and the world, is not so good
regarding Iraq's chemical and biological programs. It is clear,
even from the little information filtering out, that few of the
many plants capable of contributing to these programs have been
destroyed. I believe Iraq could be producing significant quantities
of biological agents within six months. For chemical agents like
nerve gas, the time range is one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver these agents continues to pose a problem for
Iraq, but Unscom has information that Iraq still has about a half
dozen Scud missiles hidden. And if Unscom inspectors or other
monitors are not permitted to return to Baghdad to keep an eye on
Iraq's dual-purpose factories, this threat will grow over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now for the Security Council and the world is how
to contain Iraq. President Clinton has not ruled out future
bombings, but this is no solution, and no one wants a permanent
state of war. The administration also wants to bring down the Iraqi
government, but Saddam Hussein seems remarkably resilient and the
opposition divided and weak. In any case, if Hussein is simply
replaced by his son Uday, the world may be no better off, and some
would argue it will be worse off.
</P>
<P>
   What is required is some creative thinking, but the Security
Council is polarized. Chances have to be taken with any solution,
and perhaps now is the time to consider the phased lifting of
sanctions _ say, over a period of seven years. This is not to
reward Iraq but to provide an incentive for it to accept strict
monitoring to ensure that its industries are not used to rebuild
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply would result in the freezing of sanctions at a
particular phase and restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could
sell. At the same time, tough import controls would be applied to
restrict what it could spend its vast oil wealth on. Through a
combination of carrot and stick, it is possible, just possible,
that Iraq could be brought back to the community of nations.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES FUNDING INCREASE FOR HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: California, New York, Texas, Washington)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking a break from impeachment woes, President
Clinton Wednesday unveiled $850 million in federal grants to help
the homeless find housing, job training, child care, and mental
health and substance abuse treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that his budget proposal for fiscal 2000
would include $1.1 billion in assistance to the homeless, a 15
percent increase from the current funding level. ``It will be the
largest effort to combat homelessness in the history of America,''
Clinton said in a speech in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $850 million, $700 million is for 1,420 homeless projects
in 300 communities nationwide. These grants will serve 330,000
homeless people and are the centerpiece of the Clinton
administration's six-year effort to combat homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Continuum of Care'' grants, they are aimed at helping
homeless people find permanent shelter while attempting to
alleviate some of the underlying causes of homelessness: A lack of
education and job skills, mental illness, and drug and alcohol
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded a total
of 307 grants out of 460 applications received, HUD Secretary
Andrew Cuomo said. HUD awards the grants on a competitive basis to
encourage local governments and agencies to address the homeless
problem. The prospect of future awards is intended as an incentive
to do a good job in serving this population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old carrot and stick approach,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $150 million is for Emergency Shelter Grants that
give immediate food and shelter to the homeless. These grants are
awarded through a formula that takes into account the size of a
city's homeless population, as well as its housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said HUD was being extra aggressive in monitoring how
funds are spent to guard against waste and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was asked whether Clinton's participation in the
announcement was calculated to give the appearance of normalcy at a
time when the president faces an impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is functioning normally and this is what he
would do,'' Cuomo said, pointing out that Clinton has participated
in these grant awards in previous years. ``The president is doing
his job, if anything with more vigor than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the cities receiving awards: Albany, N.Y., $1.1 million in
Continuum of Care grants and $159,000 for emergency shelter; San
Francisco, $12.9 million in Continuum of Care grants and $891,000
for emergency shelter; Seattle, $12.1 million in Continuum of Care
grants and $533,000 for emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, San Antonio received $713,000 for emergency shelter
and Beaumont received $82,000.

THIS BIG APE'S IN GREAT SHAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gus Van Sant's Psycho ``re-creation'' _ remember it? _ came
out a few weeks back, a common naysayer argument was that
filmmakers shouldn't remake good pictures when there are so many
bad and mediocre ones they can improve upon. A better, unaddressed
question is why so many remakes miss the spirit of their source
material. Disney, fond of plundering its past, is one of the worst
offenders; its latter-day ``Flubber'' and ``101 Dalmatians'' are
crass desecrations of the originals, and this summer's ``Parent
Trap'' lacked the initiative to be anything but a carbon copy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Disney should remake other studios' material, because
``Mighty Joe Young,'' a remake of a 1949 RKO picture, comes as a
pleasant surprise. Despite some dismissible flaws _ including a
hefty budget that's too big for such B-movie material _ it respects
the original without succumbing to reverence. It doesn't quite have
the pacing of the first ``Joe,'' which had a Saturday-matinee
panache that led to a new peril every two minutes, but it stands as
a satisfying update of a perfectly good movie.
</P>
<P>
   What marks the new ``Joe'' most _ and what will turn off some
people, even if they're unfamiliar with the original _ is a '90s
political correctness. Joe's best human friend, Jill, played by a
limpid-eyed Charlize Theron, is a feisty feminist who grew up with
the gargantuan gorilla after poachers killed both their mothers.
Hero Gregg (Fort Worth's Bill Paxton, ruddy and rediscovering his
restlessness) is no longer a sidekick to a show-biz hack, but a
zoologist working for a nature conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   To save Joe from poachers, Jill and Gregg take him to Los
Angeles, where he's not a freak-show attraction as in the original
but instead a fund-raising conduit for a struggling animal-rights
group. Cynics may be forgiven for thinking that the movie at times
looks like a co-production of the Humane Society and the Discovery
Channel, and for wondering why the fresh-scrubbed Jill models the
latest in J. Crew jungle wear despite having lived her life away
from civilization.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it's satisfied with being a remake of the 1949
``Joe,'' however, this new gorilla-size edition runs over its
problems with the speed of a cheetah. Director Ron Underwood, no
stranger to B movies (''Tremors'') or crowd-pleasers (''City
Slickers''), brings an easy mainstream appeal to the proceedings,
and Theron and Paxton work well as essentially supporting players
to Joe, the film's real star. The special effects and Rick Baker's
creature design are convincing enough to grab the attention of even
a jaded '90s filmgoer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mark Rosenthal-Lawrence Conner screenplay can't resist
going a little further than its source, also throwing in a ``Moby
Dick''-inspired subplot about a megapoacher (Rade Sherbedgia)
wanting revenge on Joe, who bit off a couple of his fingers a long
time ago. This strays from the original's simple charm, even as it
leads to scenes that echo the original's best set pieces without
simply reproducing them.
</P>
<P>
   These are the problems the nitpickers will focus on. Better to
concentrate on the film's qualities, the chief being that like the
original, it's a highly entertaining popcorn movie. Considering all
the bloated B pictures we've sat through this year _ ``Deep Impact,
Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon'' _ we should welcome one that,
although still a little bloated, remembers to have a heart as well.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Look sharp in a party scene for Terry Moore and Ray
Harryhausen, the original movie's star and the special-effects
meister who first brought Joe to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' is rated PG for violence and a couple of
moments that might be unsettling to young children.

 By JESSICA SIEGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Greenwich Village garden apartment, seven young
Japanese women conferred over a worktable. ``Is it too tall?''
Akiko Ogita asked. Pondering the possibilities for error, she stood
as still as a philosopher contemplating fate. ``I'm worried; I
don't have confidence,'' Ms. Ogita, 26, confessed. ``This is my
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she reached out with her scissors, snipped a blossom
from a potted begonia, and stuck the cut stem in a vase that was
slowly filling with pink amaryllis buds and scarlet berries. She
arranged the blossoms in a way that seemed nice. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese women coming to New York for lessons in flower
arranging seems as absurd as New Yorkers going to Tokyo for
rudeness seminars. Three centuries ago, when forest covered
Manhattan, the art of floral design called ikebana flourished in
Japan, where the intricate craft is still revered as a national
treasure, like the tea ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   First Coca-Cola, then Levis and sneakers. Now comes the ultimate
insult to Japanese tradition: American flower arranging. That might
explain the intensity of the secretaries and shop clerks who were
in Greenwich Village seeking floral freedom during a three-day
seminar. They were cultural rebels in New York to commune with the
Rolling Stones of floral expression, Tom Pritchard and Billy
Jarecki, who in the late 1980's and early 1990's pioneered an
American natural style with their Pure Madderlake shop and books.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the hush as the women hunched over the vases, Jarecki
cheered them on. ``This isn't brain surgery, and you're not carving
granite,'' he said, pausing for an interpreter to translate. ``If
it's not so beautiful, you're going to throw it out eventually
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words in Japan, where blossoms cost two to
three times what they do here, and ikebana, also known as the way
of the flower, involves hundreds of precise rules about cutting,
bending and placing stems, right down to angles of 10 degrees this
way or that. Though encouraged to follow their instincts, the women
constantly asked for reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on two-inch platform shoes, Ryoko Ahta adjusted and
readjusted two flowering eucalyptus stems in a cocktail shaker.
Like the other women, Ms. Ahta, a 23-year-old English major who
works part time at a Wendy's in Tokyo to support her flower habit,
seemed to meditate over her selections, moving as slowly as in a
tai chi exercise. ``Is it too big?'' she asked, gesturing at the
eucalyptus leaves sticking above her arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A classical ikebana master might measure the height of the main
stalk in comparison with side branches, the vase and sparse blooms.
The Madderlake style is built on casually airy arrangements,
antique accessories and woodsy flourishes. Pritchard scrutinized
her stems. ``Just right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Tomoko Shiihara prepared to take an even bigger
risk _ Pritchard was showing her how to wash the roots of three
lily of the valley sprigs, which she planned to combine with thick
pink heather. It would be a tricky combo, since two kinds of roots
would show through the clear glass container. A student of ikebana
for 10 years, she was all too aware of her creative daring with
this freewheeling below-the-water's-edge style, which is a
Madderlake hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to understand the natural way,'' she explained.
``I don't understand because I never studied it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, natural isn't always what it seems in America, either.
In the 1980's, when elaborate, overblown arrangements were
fashionable, Pritchard and Jarecki spread their revolutionary
style, first in Greenwich Village, then on Madison Avenue, then at
a SoHo shop called Pure Madderlake (after a dark shade of red).
Their carefully wild esthetic swept society circles from the White
House to the Hamptons. Soon, lavish was out, natural was in,
including pricey boxes of nothing but grass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two years before they closed their New York retail
shop, the partners opened a design studio in Tokyo. Drawn by
publicity in Japanese magazines, young women began studying with a
Madderlake disciple, Takaaki Nonen. The twice-a-year trips to New
York are a chance for students to learn from their idols, whose
relaxed manner is part of the draw. ``First, we tell them its OK to
laugh,'' Pritchard said. Occasionally, the women do.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, flower arranging has become a flash point for many
young women. Before World War II, ikebana certificates, earned
through weekly study, were considered a prerequisite for marriage.
Even today, well-bred women in conservative communities must study
the exacting rules of ikebana to make a good marriage. Like those
American career women today who studiously can't cook, some young
Japanese women simply refuse to dally with buds.
</P>
<P>
   In adopting the Madderlake style, the Japanese women throw out
the rules but keep the flowers. The classes in Tokyo with Ms. Nonen
are exercises in self-expression that culminate in the New York
tours, which cost the young women $3,000 to $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are reluctant to say their feelings,'' Ms. Nonen
explained. ``They ask, `Am I right to say it is beautiful?' They
need experience in trusting themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience included leisure time to see the musical
``Chicago,'' tour the Metropolitan Museum of Art and shop at stores
like Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping was serious business, though, when the women cruised
the 26th Street flea market for flower containers, ranging from
retro Fiestaware vases to a martini pitcher. ``The choice of
material is 90 percent of the battle,'' Pritchard told his
students, urging them to visualize the mood they want to express.
``Do you want to impress, overwhelm or coax?''
</P>
<P>
   In another excursion, they visited the wholesale flower
district. At Caribbean Cuts, the women marveled over miniature
oranges and pineapples. At Fischer &AMP; Page, they gaped at the color
riot: peonies from New Zealand, hydrangeas from the Netherlands,
roses from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The piles of blossoms in flagrant bloom amazed the women. In
Japan, flowers for sale are displayed with closed buds from behind
glass refrigerator cases. ``It's not right,'' said Junko Sone, 26,
who works at her family's computer company. ``The flower is a
flower. It should be seen in bloom,'' she added, opening her closed
hand to demonstrate a bud unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Transported by the touchable displays of open blooms, Ms. Sone
seemed to flush from the heady vision. Later, in the tranquillity
of the workshop, she ly positioned, then repositioned, first left,
then right, the last sprigs in a bouquet of lilies. ``This is such
a special time,'' she said through the translator. ``It's not
superficial. It's mental. It's spiritual for me. If you see these
beautiful things, you don't need words.''

MAXIMUM GATE APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When darkness comes to this city, you can hear the
clatter of security gates rolling down on rows of storefronts, the
sound of the streets fortifying themselves for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Unconsoled by recent drops in reported crime, store owners in
New York City continue to seal their investments each night behind
the riot-proof shields that first appeared in great numbers during
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence of this riot-proofing is a sign that retailers,
like old generals, are still stubbornly fighting the last war. But
a new type of gate that is now becoming more widespread is the
perfect addition to the streetscapes of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
safer but sterner New York.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently security gates came in two styles. The most
impenetrable are fabricated from solid steel or aluminum plates,
blank slates for graffiti that can intimidate after-hours
passers-by. The second common type, metal grilles, are preferred by
better business groups because they allow illuminated displays to
light the sidewalk and invite innocent nighttime use of the
streets, but these open gates risk raising merchants' fears of
broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   The new security shutters, marketed under names like Screenguard
and Steelvision, are made from the same materials as the strongest
solid shutters, but punched through with a tight offset grid of
circular holes that admit the window-shopper's gaze without
weakening a store's defenses. By combining lock-down security with
an accommodating veneer, these gates reflect the mood of a city
where crime has been reduced, but at a cost to public freedom; they
say ``welcome'' and ``beware'' with equal volume.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Raimondo, a manager at City-Gates Manufacturing Corp. in
Queens, New York City's largest security gate company, said their
Screenguard brand perforated gates are chosen primarily because
they offer increased security.
</P>
<P>
   ``With grille gates,'' he said, ``a car can pull up, throw a
chain around it and pull it off.'' The perforated metal gates offer
no purchase for such break-ins, and they also prevent vandalism,
litter and the free passage of vermin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ability to combat so many quality-of-life
bugaboos, Raimondo said the perforated gates remain ``extremely
rare.'' They represent ``much less than one percent'' of the
roughly 100 gates his company installs each day. ``That kind of
gate is an acquired taste,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One retailer who has acquired the taste is Debra Lachance of
Area I.D., a new mid-century modern furniture store on Elizabeth
Street in Little Italy. She says that design alone determined her
choice of a gate from Century Overhead Doors in Brooklyn. Lighted
from behind, the gate's close-set holes throw a moire screen over
her store. ``The concept was to make it look like an optical
illusion,'' she said. ``We wanted to create a certain mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Other storefronts with the new gates appear disproportionately
in design-conscious areas of Manhattan: an eyeglass store on
Seventh Avenue in Chelsea or a shoe store on Broadway in Soho, for
instance. But because the perforated metal shields suit the spirit
of the new New York, merging maximum protection with cold
politesse, they may also soon find homes elsewhere on less posh
shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Pisark, director of the Retail Improvement Department of the
34th Street and Grand Central Partnerships, is enthusiastic about
the possibilities for perforated gates in his district. Since 1996,
he has managed a program to promote open gates along shopping
streets in midtown Manhattan. The program offers to pay up to 50
percent of the cost of replacing a solid gate, but it has not
swayed many store owners: only five of the 28 solid gates along
34th Street have been replaced, Pisark said. ``Some retailers are
still of the opinion that as soon as the sun goes down, it is not
safe,'' he said, ``but that's just not true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by resistance on the street, the 34th Street
Partnership is promoting a top-down legislative solution. Tom
Duane, an outgoing New York City Council member, is among the
sponsors of a bill, currently pending, that would mandate 75
percent transparent gates along 34th and 42nd Streets, from river
to river.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not yet seen any of the perforated metal gates, he
is optimistic about their ability to make the streets more
welcoming after dark. ``As someone who is out and about at night,
having more opportunities for window shopping can only improve
street life,'' he said. ``It makes it safer. It's good for the
stores. It's good for the streets.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a new communications technology: It is not necessarily
secure, it requires people to leave their desks to use it and
delivery can take days. Oh, and large attachments cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is called a letter and, for the forerunner of the
United States Postal Service, it was the ``killer app'' of its
time.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 200 years ago. Today, in the face of technologies
like fax machines and electronic mail, the Post Office is fighting
for its piece of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   The service is in the midst of making a hard self-examination,
and establishing pilot programs across the country, that could
significantly change the face of postal delivery in this country
within the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   In August, when Postmaster General William J. Henderson
announced the formation of the new Postal Service Technology Group,
he said the goal was to ``enable us to accomplish our aggressive
vision of an information rich mailstream within the next five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is supposed to help wrest the wheel of the postal
stagecoach from the mud in which it has been mired? Among them are
Norm Lorentz, whom Henderson named as the service's first chief
technology officer, and Robert Reisner, the postal service's vice
president of strategic planning. ``What is a 21st century Postal
Service?'' is how Reisner puts the question he sees in front of him
and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Postal Service's vision of itself in the future is
not purely digital. It is more along the lines of a hybrid service,
straddling the worlds of physical and electronic communication. At
the outset, Reisner dismisses any notion that the world will be a
place where all reading takes place on screens. ``There is no way
in the next decade you won't need paper, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as part of a five-year plan begun in September 1997,
the Postal Service has undertaken a variety of pilot projects aimed
at realizing a post office for the future.
</P>
<P>
   PostOffice Online, for example, allows small businesses to
purchase products and coordinate shipping through the Internet 24
hours a day. Although similar services exist, the Post Office is
hoping to draw customers through what is, effectively, one of the
best known brand names in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The post office is also thinking about creating ``electronic
postmarks'' _ a postal time/date stamp that can be printed on
mailing labels and envelopes with a laser printer. This would serve
in place of a traditional postal meter for small businesses and
private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Service is also testing programs that function purely
electronically. Post ECS (Electronic Courier Service) is a system
that makes the transmission of attachment files over the Internet
more secure. Similarly, Certificate Authority verifies a sender and
receiver through private electronic ``keys'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is also discussion of the Post Office creating an Internet
domain for non-profit, educational, government and individual
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Creating this future presents formidable challenges. Customers _
especially businesses _ are already opting for digital delivery
systems. Electronic banking, alone, poses a substantial threat to
the Postal Service's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some 38 billion pieces of first class mail per year_
representing revenues of about $6 billion _ are directly threatened
by such banking, according to a recent Postal Service report. That
is about a third of the Postal Service's overall mail volume, and
about a fifth of its revenues. (Despite the rise of Spam _
unsolicited Internet mail _ the Postal Service reports that their
Class A advertising mail, better known as a junk mail, remains
stable).
</P>
<P>
   How successful is the Postal Service likely to be in its efforts
to catch up? No one can say. Undeniably, it is off to a late start.
``The Postal Service is a government agency,'' said B. Alexander
Henderson, a senior technology analyst for Prudential Securities.
``Of course they are going to be late.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Henderson said, the service ``should be
applauded'' for its moves to modernize. He predicted that some
steps, like electronic postmarks, could appeal to the 90 percent of
small businesses without their own postage meters and could create
a substantial market in support products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this is not the first time the Postal Service has
faced a monumental transition. Similar periods of technological
change have occurred since Benjamin Franklin was the first
Postmaster General.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from steamboats to balloons to ponies have been
employed to transport mail. In 1959, a Navy submarine even fired a
missile containing 3,000 letters in an effort to increase delivery
speed.
</P>
<P>
   But creating new services to compete these days is a huge
technological and organizational challenge, ``given the bureaucracy
that we are,'' said Lorentz. And, as a government organization, he
added, the Postal Service must get permission for any major changes
it wishes to makes. ``We have a lot of owners,'' he said.

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For baby-boomers who love the television shows of
their childhood, the scene on Tuesday evening at Restoration
Hardware, a home-furnishings store on lower Fifth Avenue, was pure
``Twilight Zone.'' Circling a tall Christmas tree and sofa, and
heaped high on a coffee table, were stacks and stacks of toys
introduced in the 1940s and '50s, like a holiday that had been kept
on ice: tin speedboats, gyroscopes, Shoot the Moon games, Slinkys
and yo-yos.
</P>
<P>
   William Watkins, a 42-year-old film producer, was piling a
basket fast with tin rockets, penguins, trains and robots. Another
customer had walked off with the last DC-3 airplane while Watkins
was taking a quick stroll through the store, a fact that he now
sorely regretted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who hesitates . . . ,'' Watkins said, as the woman next to
him picked out a kazoo. The gring, gring of handle-bar bicycle
bells went off steadily in the background. Who were the toys for?
``Friends,'' he said. ``In their 40s. They all have everything they
could possibly want.''
</P>
<P>
   John Badeer, a 28-year-old investment banker, walked by with
three Slinkys under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for my brothers and sisters,'' he said. And how young
were they? ``They're older, in their 30s. My oldest brother's a
trader. It will give him something to play with when he's stressing
out. I work at J.P. Morgan. It's pretty surprising how many Slinkys
I see.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Orenstein, a 37-year-old publisher, had four colored yo-yos
in tow. As gifts for children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are,'' he said. ``The blue one's for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Kane whispered ``Rosebud'' has the nation thought so
hard about the toys from its past. Baby-boomers, now parents and
grandparents, are hitting their second childhood. A generation
about to slip into senior-citizenship has created a growing market
for newly produced classic toys, from log building sets to electric
football fields to Dr. Seuss books, and it doesn't have to go to
toy stores to find them. Boomers can walk into home stores like
Pottery Barn, drugstores like CVS, clothing stores like Bergdorf
Goodman and J.C. Penney or order through catalogs like L.L. Bean,
Garnet Hill and Avon.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration Hardware's New York store sold more than 200 tin
trains, 150 sock monkeys and 200 gyroscopes last weekend. ``They're
not buying them for the kids, to be honest,'' said Jeffrey Whitney,
the store's assistant manager. Restoration, with 64 outlets
nationally, reported sales of 15,000 Slinkys and 15,000 yo-yos _
the 1955 wooden reissue from Duncan _ this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults are definitely playing a larger and larger part in toy
sales, buying toys for themselves,'' said Cliff Annicelli,
associate editor of Playthings, a monthly toy-industry trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo has become a craze this year for the second time since
its debut in 1928. Mike Burke, marketing manager of Duncan Toys,
said his company is shipping ``hundreds of thousands a week.''
Those sales are cross-generational, he added. Wham-O, the company
that launched the Hula Hoop, the Frisbee and the Super Ball, went
back into business in June, reincarnated by a 38-year-old former
Mattel executive.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brush, director of merchandise for Garnet Hill, speaking
of toys for adults, said, ``It's great stress relief.'' (The
caption beneath the tin robots in Garnet Hill's current catalog
states flatly, ``Not intended for children.'' )
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brush said of Garnet Hill's president: ``Every summer his
wife buys him 300 balsa airplanes, so he can sit on the back deck
and fly them. When he has people over for drinks, the cartons come
out and everyone gets a few.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to catalogs and so-called lifestyle department
stores, adults can also go to specialty toy stores that emphasize
traditional toys, from mom-and-pop operations like the Toy Box, in
Ligonier, Penn., outside Pittsburgh, to chains like Zany Brainy and
Noodle Kidoodle. Or they can go to online businesses, like Back to
Basics Toys or Etoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our offering is classic toys,'' said
Jane Saltzman, vice president of merchandising for Etoys. ``It's a
top-10 click, from over 100 categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers can also find the originals at antique shops or
collectors' shows; there are now more than 10,000 vintage toy
events each year.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big two'' of the $20 billion toy industry _ Mattel and
Hasbro _ are not letting the adults get away, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need them because they're losing children at an earlier
age, to computers, telephones, electronics and apparel,'' said
Richard Brady, president of Play Co. Toys and Entertainment Corp.,
a toy retailer that has expanded aggressively this year in the
category of traditional toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls _ they used to have them until 12 or 13, now they drop
out of toys at age 10,'' he said. ``The same with boys. They're
dropping out at 8 _ they used to have them until 12.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report published by the NPD Group, a retail
market-research company, 16.3 percent of toy recipients in 1997
were over 18.
</P>
<P>
   G.I. Joe, a 34-year-old character, is now ``mostly adult
sales,'' said a Hasbro representative. The company's Furby, an
electronic plush pet, became this season's ``it'' toy by crossing
the line between children and adults, according to David Niggli,
executive vice president of merchandising for FAO Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattel's Barbie, who turns 40 next year in a bouffant of
publicity, is the 400-pound canary in the toy market _ thanks to
several generations of paying admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbie dominates,'' said Ed Roth, of the NPD Group, ``with
over $1 billion in sales in the U.S. last year.'' Roth estimated
that more than 15 percent of sales were adults buying Barbie for
themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This has not escaped the notice of mass marketers like Avon, the
world's leading direct seller of beauty products, which has gone
into toy retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of Mattel's top-10 customers,'' said Joyce
Mullins-Jackson, director of marketing for Avon Toys, who
transformed the company's gift and decorations division into a toy
business in 1996. The first Avon Barbie, ``Spring Blossom,'' had
$14 million in sales. The second, ``Winter Velvet,'' doubled that.
Priced at $34.99, it was aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   Careful not to neglect any sales in the family, Avon also sold a
Hot Wheels Father and Son Then and Now Mustang toy car.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are all of us. In a weird cocktail of marketing that is
equal parts childhood and parenting _ think of the chocolate
martini _ the toy industry, both manufacturers and retailers, has
addressed the fact that it has an increasingly adult audience on
its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why,'' says the voice-over of a television
commercial from a new, nostalgic advertising campaign from the toy
giant, Toys ``R'' Us, ``50 years later, we still believe that life
_ at any age _ should be fun.'' Children are seen playing Twister,
a game from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want their kids to have the experiences they had when
they owned the toy,'' said Eric Garfinkel, a lawyer who started
Back to Basics Toys in 1988. ``Or if they didn't have the
experience, they want to give it to their kids. I looked at myself
as my prototypical customer. I had a 2-year-old son, and I couldn't
find the classics I grew up with.'' Garfinkel, 44, continues to be
a committed Nok Hockey player, a 57-year-old game featured in his
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Toy manufacturers like Dean Helfer, president of Channel Craft
and Distribution, which makes jacks, pick-up-sticks and wooden
toys, are aiming their business at men. Helfer's clients include J
.C. Penney, Bergdorf Goodman, L.L. Bean and Levinger.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lowe, president of Playing Mantis, which manufactures
classic die-cast toy cars and action figures like Dr. Evil, the
Lone Ranger and Tonto, said: ``Everything we've done is geared
toward males 25 to 45 _ 90 percent of our business. If you took the
adults away we wouldn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said his company sold 8 million cars and 80,000 dolls last
year. ``Guys like to hold them and look at them,'' he said. ``They
get warm, fuzzy feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But are adults playing with their new toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying trains to play with,'' Judy Hoffman, senior
vice president of sales and marketing for Lionel, the toy-train
manufacturer. ``The trend is away from collectors who sit them on a
shelf.'' Ms. Hoffman estimated that 65 percent of Lionel's buyers,
who are largely adults buying for themselves, buy them to play
with. The company now has a successful program with QVC, and Ms.
Hoffman added that ``stores like Sharper Image will play a big part
in our growth in the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   At Restoration Hardware on Tuesday, children walked by the
displays of toys and games briskly while parents sat down with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do anything,'' a young guard at the door explained
to a man picking up a tin flying saucer.
</P>
<P>
   But it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that people are regressing,'' said Gary Cross, a
professor of history at Pennsylvania State University and the
author of ``Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing Worlds of American
Childhood'' (Harvard University Press; 1997). ``The flow of time in
our century is the flow of goods. No one cares about the Cuban
missile crisis _ but you care about the Barbie that was out that
year. It's a way of placing yourself in time, reckoning with the
fact you're middle-aged. It lets you laugh at the fact that
childhood was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we there yet?
</P>
<P>
   Can we go home now?

   Harvesting Pine Nuts
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do pine nuts come from pine trees and, if so, what type of
pine tree? I love pine nuts, but they're so expensive _ can I grow
my own here in Klamath Falls, Ore.?
</P>
<P>
   A. You won't be able to grow pignolias, the most famous variety.
They come from the Italian stone pine, Pinus pinea, a handsome,
umbrella-shaped tree that is' native to the Mediterranean and too
tender for life in Klamath Falls, though it grows well in places
like mid-coastal California. Nurseries in your area are more likely
to offer assorted cultivars of the much hardier Swiss stone pine,
P. cembra. This species also yields nuts (as does any pine with
``stone'' in its name), but it is prized for its ornamental value
and is not usually grown with pesto in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Del Tredici, the director of living collections at
Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum, said your best bet is P.
koraiensis. It is the source of those ubiquitous Chinese pine nuts,
and it is a very tough character, able to withstand high winds and
temperatures of 20 and 30 below. But before you go rushing out to
plant a few, there are a few things to bear in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nut-bearing pine trees tend to be slow growers, and though
grafted plants might bring your wait for the first nuts down from
15 or 20 years to something more like 5 or 6, it's going to take a
good long time before you see much of a crop. That crop will be
encased in extremely hard shells, the shells tightly clasped in
cones that are themselves well fixed to the upper branches of the
trees. (You cannot wait for them to fall of their own accord; by
that time the blue jays and squirrels will have beaten you to the
nuts.)
</P>
<P>
   Has Dr. Del Tredici ever harvested nuts from the
well-established specimens at the arboretum? No, he said: ``The
cones are unbelievably sticky, for starters _ just to handle them
is a commitment.'' Planting the trees is a commitment, too, of
space as well as time. Our pinon-nut-bearing Southwestern native,
P. edulis, can take bush form under extreme conditions, and some P.
cembra cultivars are comparatively modest in size. But P. pinea is
a big tree, and P. koraiensis is, at least potentially, huge. Dr.
Del Tredici saw some in China that were more than 100 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Still game? Here are two mail-order sources: Porterhowse Farms,
41370 SE Thomas Road, Sandy, Ore. 97055, (503) 668-5834, offers P.
cembra and P. koraiensis; the price list of 850 conifers is free; a
descriptive manual costs $6. Edible Landscaping, PO Box 77, Afton
Va. 22920, (800) 524-4156, offers P. cembra and P. pinea; free
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   A Cachepot Gift
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have my eye on an antique china cachepot as a Christmas
present for my mom, whose favorite piggyback plant is in a plastic
pot. But the cachepot is about four inches wider than the pot it
would contain. Does that matter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Assuming the plant in question is large enough not to look
silly in its new home, there is no reason to worry about a bit of
extra width.
</P>
<P>
   Your mom can just fill in the unused space with sphagnum moss or
pretty pebbles. What does matter is the depth. If the top of the
actual pot is way below the edge of the cachepot, the air around
the plant may stay so damp that it causes fungus problems.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the tops of the pots even, just prop the inner one on a
couple of stones or a layer of pebbles. This is a good move with
any cached pot, since it will elevate the drainage hole. (That
which is unseen tends to remain uncleaned; cachepots almost always
end up with pools of water in the bottom. )
</P>
<P>
   Looking for New Suspects
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have a few proven winners for street containers
(whisky barrels)? The local garden club plants 20 to 30 barrels
with annuals each spring. They are the same from year to year, with
perhaps a change in the color of geraniums. The center is planted
with a dracaena, followed by petunias and geraniums, finishing up
with vinca. The care of these barrels is hit or miss. Some are in
full sun and some in partial shade. I would love to have a list of
annuals this fall so we can plan for some changes next year.
</P>
<P>
   A. The list of inexpensive plants that will perform under the
conditions you describe is not long, but there are a few directions
in which you could branch out: marigolds, for instance. The little
signet types, including Lemon Gem and Tangerine Gem, are just as
foolproof as their larger, more familiar cousins, but they have
prettier foliage and a more attractive fragrance _ especially Lemon
Gem, which deserves its name. Alyssum and lobelia are also
stalwart, carefree bloomers that put out a lot of color over a long
season. All of these flowers are small _ tiny, in the case of
alyssum _ but there are so many that the overall effect is bright.
</P>
<P>
   If you need something with bigger flowers, don't forget
nasturtiums, which are famous for thriving on neglect. Mixed-color
assortments can be hard to blend with other plants, but single
colors like the delicate primrose-yellow called Moonlight are easy
to work with. And what about dahlias? Though they take a bit longer
to bloom, they look good even when all green, and the flowers are
striking for a long time once they get going.
</P>
<P>
   If you used ivy geraniums instead of the vinca, you would have
trailing leaves and flowers to boot. Or, if small leaves are
important, the vinca might be replaced by Helichrysum petiolatum,
sometimes called the licorice plant. The silvery gray variety is
more reliable than the chartreuse one called Limelight, but the
Limelight is a very handsome plant that will look great with strong
blue lobelia or the equally blue, very low-growing Anagallis
monellii (blue pimpernel). Your center height might come from a
small canna like Tropical Rose, or you could be daring and plant a
clump of the multicolored Swiss chard called Bright Lights.
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to plant two kinds of barrels, consider
fuchsias and trailing begonias for the ones that get some shade.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds for most of these plants _ and the plants themselves _ are
widely available. For the less-common ones try Thompson and Morgan
Inc., PO Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527-0308; (800) 274 7333. The
company offers a free catalog. Dwarf cannas are cheaper by the
dozen from Wayside Gardens, 1 Garden Lane, Hodges, S.C. 29695-0001;
(800) 845-1124; free catalog. &QL;

<P>
   SAN LEANDRO, Calif. _ Dean Dierschow caressed his prized green
and yellow British Petroleum marble.
</P>
<P>
   It is the type of scene that plays out every day and night in
Silicon Valley, Silicon Prairie, Silicon Beach, Silicon Alley,
Silicon Forest and Silicon Glen. The Silicon rule: the weirder the
hobby, the more interesting the person. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dierschow, 39, knows of only two other people in the world who
collect British Petroleum memorabilia. He has two BP marbles, three
models of gas stations and numerous model cars and trucks, three
decks of cards, a ruler, a key chain, a flag, a tie clip, a soccer
ball, a credit card, a mug, a tape measure and the piece de
resistance, a commemorative plate from the Alaskan pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty cool, isn't it?'' said Dierschow, a game engineer at
Segasoft Networks who says he has absolutely no connection to
British Petroleum except that ``as a kid, my favorite color was
green.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traditional business environments stress conformity and
belonging to the local country club. Not so in geekdom, where
status symbols have been reversed. Giving people a ``core dump'' on
an esoteric topic like building a theremin (an obscure electronic
instrument) from scratch is the Silicon Valley equivalent of
playing 18 holes. Here it is perfectly acceptable, if not
encouraged, to out-strange the person in the next cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   But finding originality in nerd circles takes a heck of a lot of
work. Dressing up like Spock at your weekly Trekkie club meeting
just won't cut it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is why you will see Alexia Massalin, an engineer at Micro
Unity who is widely heralded as a technical genius, giving and
receiving piggyback rides and collecting stuffed koala bears.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Hirshon walks to his public-relations job in Santa
Clara's Tech Center twirling an ebony and silver 19th-century cane,
one of his collection of seven walking sticks. ``I rather enjoy
being known as the eccentric guy with the cool canes,'' he said.
Chris DiBona, a marketing director for VA Research, includes
in-depth descriptions of terrorist groups on his Web page. ``People
say: `Hey! You're that guy who's interested in terrorism.' It's a
nice conversation breaker.'' Ben Thornton, a programmer living in
the Silicon Hills of Austin, Texas, brags about being a nude ham
radio operator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gore, an assistant professor of psychology at Southern
Illinois University, said techies had a predilection for
prepubescent hobbies, in direct correlation to their creativity.
``Programmers have very strong artistic tendencies,'' said Gore,
who is a vocational psychologist. ``Studies show that an openness
to new experience correlates with overall intelligence. Some people
might say these hobbies are `juvenile,' but I see them as
unconventional and very original.'' Thus, in Silicon Valley,
midnight squirt-gun wars are not uncommon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But do not expect to fit in just because you take unicycle
lessons, said Lynn Taylor, a vice president at the recruiting firm
Robert Half International. ``Being gimmicky won't help you get a
job,'' she said, but it doesn't necessarily hurt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giving piggyback rides, for example, might not get you a job on
Wall Street, but high-tech's mores are a bit different. ``Piggyback
riding reflects that the person is approachable,'' Ms. Taylor said.
Finding techies with social skills is a particular challenge, she
added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to remember my name when they need someone in my
field,'' said Ms. Massalin, the piggybacker and koala lover. She
believes that exceptional technical people usually favor social
experimentation and nonconformity and have no need to adhere to
convention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to know good-working but not otherwise exceptionally
creative technical folks, and they seem not to have unusual
hobbies,'' said Ms. Massalin, who is known to begin and end her
conversations with the word ``qua,'' which she says is the sound a
koala makes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can be a Denver Broncos fan or even have knowledge of
Oriental rugs, but it is the rare adult bird who still collects Hot
Wheels. Dierschow, the British Petroleum collector, is also a proud
member of the Bay Area Matchbox Collectors Association. He displays
his cars on dusty spice racks nailed to his walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dierschow, a soft-spoken man with long hair who says he washes
his clothes ``quarterly,'' still has his first toy car: a 1962
Volkswagen Caravette, a camper in mint green. His parents gave it
to him when he was 7 years old. He has an MGTD Sports Car, a 1929
4.5-liter Bentley and an ERF 686 Ever Ready Platform truck _ more
than a thousand toy vehicles in all.
</P>
<P>
   While showing off his cars, Dierschow turns into a nerd version
of Vanna White, holding them up proudly and chatting about his best
piece: a 1953 Elizabeth II coronation coach. Dierschow calls the
beat-up coach his Holy Grail. When he decided to become a collector
of Matchbox toys in his late 20s, Dierschow found the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to go ahead and spend $165 for a lousy piece of
metal because when I was a kid, that's what I wanted the most,'' he
said, showing off the coach, tarnished and chipped and pulled by
eight horses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in his house, Dierschow has a collection of more than
1,000 cartridge video games. In another room, he also has what
looks to the untrained eye like a pile of junk. Look closely,
however, and you realize that it is a pile of old computers,
peripherals, game consoles, joysticks and various cords.
</P>
<P>
   He has a dream: to stack the 30 or so consoles and have them
running, as a sort of altar to video games. Michael Butler, a
contract programmer and self-proclaimed ``computer bum,'' was at
Dierschow's house and overheard his Dierschow's dream speech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you were collecting,'' Butler said. ``I got rid
of some fairly obscure peripheral devices, like, you remember the
Fairchild Channel F?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got one,'' Dierschow said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have the little control knobs?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They tended to break. I had a few spares that I threw away.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, wow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had this conversation, but one of the things that
I've always wanted to do was take my KIM-1 and load it up with
Microchess and leave it running! If you have a place for it here, I
would be honored.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is downstairs, at his temple to BP, where Dierschow
expressed the most glee. ``I get some of the strangest looks when
people look at this collection and say, `It's, er, BP?' '' He
spends about 40 minutes a day at the Ebay online auction service
searching for BP merchandise. ``I'd love to have BP come over and
take a look at my collection and photograph it or something,'' said
Dierschow, who also calls himself Oblivious. He added that he
occasionally took items from his BP collection to show off at
work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a little bit weird, but I used to have a boss who
was into windsurfing,'' he said. ``That is weird.'' &QL;

BANDWIDTH: MORE IS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is meant by the term bandwidth? I know it is a
measure of information-carrying capacity, but how is it measured or
calculated and in what units? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When used in relation to computers, the term bandwidth refers
to the amount of data that can flow over a network or between
computers and peripheral devices in a fixed amount of time. The
word has been used more frequently in recent years, as Internet
users, seeking faster connections for downloading files and viewing
Web pages, have been constantly on the lookout for more bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of capacity, not transmission speed. For digital
devices like an external hard drive, the bandwidth is commonly
calculated in bits per second (bps); in the case of networking, it
is measured in megabits per second (mbps).
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet, a computer-network system used widely in offices, can
support data speeds of up to 10 mbps. Fire Wire, a newer technology
developed by Apple Computer, is much faster; it is supposed to
support data speeds of up to 400 mbps.
</P>
<P>
   High bandwidths are faster than low bandwidths because they have
more room to move data. To visualize this, think of how many more
cars can get to where they are going faster if they are traveling
on a six-lane superhighway instead of a one-lane gravel road.

HOW TO HAVE A REALLY COOL, COLLECTIBLE YULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While you're home for the holidays, look carefully at the
Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Is the same old Santa figurine in his same location on top of
the piano? How about the stockings? Are they as old as you are? Is
the tree skirt from the same decade? If the answer is yes, you are
surrounded by collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Old Christmas decorations are hot. Terry Kovel, co-author of
``Kovels' Antiques &AMP; Collectibles Price List 1999,'' says Christmas
collectibles can be anything from Santa candy dishes to feather
trees _ especially feather trees. A 3-footer with musical stand
from Germany will fetch more than $600.
</P>
<P>
   A tree stand that plays three tunes and turns the tree with a
wind-up key is worth $450.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday jewelry _ those little rhinestone wreaths and trees,
seemingly worn by every schoolteacher in America _ is another
big-bucks collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Kovel and her husband, Ralph Kovel, supreme beings in the
antiques trade, gave holiday jewelry to their staff this year.
</P>
<P>
   Terry says the best holiday items to look for at garage sales
are aluminum trees with revolving colored lights. Papier-mache
figurines and Dresden cards made of paper and tinsel are highly
regarded. If you find them at yard sales, buy them. If you own
them, consider selling them at an auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, ornaments, with a few exceptions, don't hold their
value next to new ones. Exquisite antiques sell for about the same
price as new, elaborate ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   The one company that hit a homer with ornaments is Hallmark.
``They made a series that moved and made noise; they cost $45 new,
and they are selling at a good price now,'' says Terry Kovel, who
lists a 1981 Hallmark rocking horse at $500 in her book. A 1980
Cool Yule, Frosty Friends from Hallmark is valued at $400.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Beanie Babies Christmas ornaments, or Beanie
Babies of any stripe. They are not appreciating in value, Kovel
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks they will send a kid to college on the
proceeds of their Beanie Baby collection is wrong,'' she says,
adamantly. ``If past history holds true, only a very few will hold
any value. We've seen it with Avon bottles and Jim Beam bottles;
anything that is offered as a limited, collector's edition is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovel says the flotsam from the present that seems to have
captured the interest of collectors is anything that is used as a
substitute for money _ debit cards, credit cards and phone cards,
``even the early, ugly, metal charge cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember them? If you do, you're old enough to have Christmas
decorations worth some money. You might want to cash in the
Christmas collectibles when those credit-card bills come rolling in
next month. Then, retire the cards _ they may be worth something
someday.

DANGER-IMMIGRANTS (Phoenix) - A baby is shot in its mother's arms
by a robber at a poor household of recent immigrants. Two
immigrants at a drophouse were robbed and killed two months ago.
Not that the journey to the United States isn't hard enough, but
recent immigrants are facing increased danger once they are here.
By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - A few days before last Christmas, my
father and brother and I filled the days as best we could, waiting
_ as the nuns in Catholic school used to say _ for angels to come
and get my mother. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, it wasn't those angels I was most grateful to,
however.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ones I could see. The nurses and doctors and hospital
volunteers who were there every day. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will
move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - He will be on the road by the time you
read this, searching for his Christmas gift, gas pedal to the
floor, America streaming past. He is 33, my age exactly, and my
bosom friend. His name is Robert, but we call him ``Kooz.''
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, the gift Kooz covets was not under the
Christmas tree. It's the most hard-won present a man can receive,
the most precious gift of all.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of himself. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story will move in the
``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Radford, Va.) - As I write this, I am sitting
in the house in which I grew up, the house where I spent the first
22 Christmases of my life.
</P>
<P>
   And I am thinking about gifts. But this year, my perspective has
taken a nice little jaunt in the Way-Back Machine. That's because
this is the first Christmas I'll spend with my own child. She is
too young to remember anything that goes on here, of course, but
that hasn't made the holiday any less festive for me. Despite her
tiny status, we have put her through many of the holiday paces, and
it's been wonderful. Seeing the holiday through her eyes has made
me a kid again. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With technology you can surf the Web, route telephone
calls through satellites and send people to the moon and robots to
Mars. So what about losing weight? Is there no 500-megahertz
weight-reduction machine that translates fat into RAM, for
instance? The short answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, gadgets that are supposed to be able to tell
you how fat you are, and many of them are enhanced by
microprocessors. In this season of dietary excess, health clubs and
appliance stores alike are offering a new generation of inexpensive
devices that measure a person's percentage of body fat. Reducing
that percentage is up to you, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Can the technology measure the proportion of fat in the body?
Well, maybe. I found that a person with a well-placed pinch and a
carnival barker's gift for sizing up strangers could be just as
accurate as the high-technology items with high price tags used in
laboratories _ and a far cry more accurate than their mass-market
cousins, which have recently broken the $100 barrier in this
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The two home body-fat measurers I tried are the handheld Body
Logic Fat Analyzer (HBF-301) from Omron and the Body Fat
Monitor/Scale (TBF-611) from Tanita. The first works, the
manufacturer says, by sending a very low-voltage current of
electricity from one hand to the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Body Fat Monitor is a scale that also sends a low-voltage
current through the body, but the current travels from the front of
the foot and returns to the back. Each has a retail price under
$100.
</P>
<P>
   I was disturbed to learn that my body fat was somewhere between
a svelte 16 percent and a husky 27 percent. That was akin to being
told that I weighed somewhere between 100 pounds and 160 pounds. I
tested myself many times before deciding that I must be a flawed
subject. So I tested a friend, and her results were similarly
skewed. The next day, the makers of the two products told me that
these devices were designed to be used once a week as motivational
tools and that the timing of the tests _ morning or evening, before
or after a meal or drinks, or after working out _ would affect the
results.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that I should have used a fancier version of the
Tanita scale and fat monitor with an athlete mode, like the
TBF-612. Apparently my years as a high-school lacrosse player and
as a several-times-a-week runner since then qualified me as an
athlete. At least there was some good news in that 26 percent
reading.
</P>
<P>
   But why would such variables matter in measuring body fat? In
spite of their billing, the gadgets actually measure how much body
tissues impede the flow of electrical current _ their impedance.
The devices record the drop in the speed and strength of the
electrical current sent through the body. With fatty tissue, the
signal drops more quickly because it impedes the current more than
lean tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is determining just what that impedance number
means because other factors also affect impedance. Tall people
impede the signal more because the signal has farther to travel.
Women tend to carry more of their weight in their legs, so their
legs impede the signal more. Athletes can have more bone mass,
which increases impedance. So an impedance result for someone will
not accurately predict body-fat content unless it is compared with
the results of people who are similar in various ways _ like age,
weight, sex, height and athleticism _ and who have also been tested
with some more accurate measuring tool. So the gadgets rely on
results from hundreds of clinical studies to interpret impedance
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Omron's Body Logic compares its impedance results with results
from an underwater weighing method for computing body fat that had
been considered the most accurate approach until recently. Body
Logic told me that I was 16 percent fat. Tanita's Body Fat
Monitor/Scale is modeled on something called the Dexa method, which
I later tried and which is now considered one of the most accurate
methods. The Body Fat Monitor told me that I was 26 percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   The results were confusing, even a little maddening. They sent
me to the Body Composition Unit at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center in New York, where I tried some more sophisticated tests and
found a human being who could best them all. The lab's tests ranged
from dunking me in a tub to clawing me head-to-toe with a
pliers-like tool called calipers and sending an electrical current
from my hand to my foot.
</P>
<P>
   But the test the lab considers the most reliable for measuring
fat is known as Dexa, or Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; it does
not rely on assumptions about a person's body composition. It
produces a picture of each individual, using X-rays of such low
power that no one in the room with me wore any protective clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The patient lies still while a low-power X-ray machine scans
back and forth across the width of the body. With each new line
drawn, it moves a bit further south until it reaches the tip of the
toes. A digital picture of the body shows not just the percentage
of fat but also the percentage of muscle and bone.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the most sophisticated technology was matched
by Dr. Jack Wang, associate director of the Body Composition Unit,
who came up with an estimate of 20 percent with one pinch of my
waist between his fingers and a gaze at my build. A dead match with
Dexa, which had taken a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's talent is the product of 28 years and some 16,000 tests
conducted on people of all races and of a wide range of ages: 4 to
110.
</P>
<P>
   Had I read the research on fat testing before I started, I would
not have been surprised by any of this. In 1994, the National
Institutes of Health conducted a technology assessment conference
on devices like these. In its report, it concluded, ``Calculations
of an individual's body fat may vary by as much as 10 percent of
body weight because of differences in machines and methodologies
used.'' It went on to say, ``Digital readouts and computer software
calculations and interpretations may give a false sense of data
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Benson, who is in charge of research and product
development for Tanita, said that since 1994, Tanita had sought the
best and most accurate research and had made that research
available to the public as well as to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   After the conference, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, a federal agency, tested about 10 of the devices to see
how well they measured impedance, but not how well the impedance
number correlated with body fat content. The accuracy of the
devices ranged from within 1 percent to about 20 percent; accuracy
falls at the edges of the range of body sizes.
</P>
<P>
   A participant at the conference, Dr. Steven B. Heymsfield, a
doctor at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center who is the deputy
director of the Obesity Research Center there, said no standards
had yet been set for the devices as fat monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Wang said the home devices could be useful, since 50 percent
of Americans are overweight and 20 percent are obese, according to
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has an important impact, even if this isn't entirely
accurate,'' he said, pointing at the Body Fat Monitor. ``It wakes
people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy dieting.

AN ONLINE LOCATION FOR BROWSER CEREBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denis Dutton spotted a window of opportunity on the World Wide
Web, but instead of opening a portal for the masses, he installed a
porthole for intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton is the publisher of Arts &AMP; Letters Daily
(www.cybereditions.com/aldaily), a Web site intended to serve as an
online starting point for cerebral browsers. Launched in October,
the site is really just a single, regularly updated page with links
to about 75 carefully chosen articles, essays and book reviews
residing elsewhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Current selections, culled from the online editions of academic
journals, foreign magazines and dozens of other publications,
include a British critic's witty dismissal of the best-selling
novel ``The God of Small Things'' and political commentary by the
author Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is emphatically not that much good writing available for
free on the Web,'' Dutton said. ``But what little is there can be a
source of pleasure for readers who like the arts, ideas and
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton, a philosophy professor at the University of Canterbury
in Christchurch, New Zealand, asserted that Arts &AMP; Letters Daily is
a ``portal,'' a hot concept in Web commerce these days. The term
describes sites like Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and Walt Disney Co.'s
new Go Network (go.com) that strive to provide well-organized
access to the Web's jumble of information. They do so with a
collection of features like search engines and customized content
like local sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Dutton, 54, and his three-person staff have
equipped Arts &AMP; Letters Daily with links to news sites, online
reference works and educationally inclined Web guides like
Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.'s eBLAST (www.eblast.com).
</P>
<P>
   Arts &AMP; Letters Daily, Dutton argued, ``is fundamentally a portal
site. It is a place for the literate Web surfer to begin the day.
Disney can have its teenagers. We are targeting educated adults,
the people who make a difference to the intellectual, economic and
political life of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arts &AMP; Letters Daily and SciTech Daily Review
(www.scitechdaily.com), a newly launched companion site
concentrating on science and technology, function more like
portholes than portals. Although the sites offer views of the same
expansive sea of online information that the portals do, they do it
through narrower windows.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hake, founder and chairman of GII in Santa Monica, Calif.,
which bestows the annual Global Information Infrastructure Awards
to Web sites it deems noteworthy, believes the emergence of
portholes will be one of the major Internet trends of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people become more savvy users of the Net,'' Hake said,
``they want things which are better focused on meeting their
specific needs. We're going to see a whole lot more of this, and
it's going to potentially erode the user base of some of the big
portals.''
</P>

   At eBLAST, which bills itself as ``the thinking person's guide
to the Web,'' 25 editors and 200 contributors categorize and rate
more than 1,000 diverse sites each week. The online resource, a
free supplement to a subscription-only version of the encyclopaedia
(www.eb.com), already contains about 160,000 sites. ``We're putting

restaurants in alphabetical order, Hoffman said, ``People are used
to looking a certain way at information on the Web now. If you
depart too extremely from that, it takes your users too long to

   Dutton, a U.S. native who has lived in New Zealand since 1984,
is certain there is a sizable audience for brainy online

are genuinely interested in the life of the mind.''

   And even if the market turns out to be limited, there are limits
to how wide Dutton is willing to expand his porthole. ``We will
never have horoscopes,'' he said flatly. ``If people want
horoscopes, they will have to go elsewhere.''

United States. Many birth records were altered and many
intentionally misplaced. Church and state acknowledge they
conspired to keep the secrets. ``You have to understand that to
have a child out of wedlock in Catholic Ireland back in the '50s
was the most heinous thing you could do,'' says Bill Neylon. ``It
was considered shameful and despicable. It was a mortal sin in the
eyes of the government as well as the church.'' Neylon, a

`ELEGY FOR IRIS': DRAWING CLOSER AS SHE SLIPS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (editors: publication notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of John Bayley's ``Elegy for Iris'' is a little
misleading since the Iris of the title _ Iris Murdoch, the novelist
and philosopher, to whom Bayley is married _ is still quite alive,
both in the pages of this memoir and in reality.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Murdoch suffers from Alzheimer's disease, as Bayley,
himself a literary critic and novelist (``The Red Hat''), reveals
in the second chapter of his touching book. He writes: ``The power
of concentration has gone, along with the ability to form coherent
sentences and to remember where she is, or has been. She does not
know she has written 26 remarkable novels, as well as her books on
philosophy; received honorary doctorates from the major
universities; become a Dame of the British Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   So presumably by using the word elegy in his title Bayley meant
to write of an Iris who has gone away, who has done what he was
always afraid she would do in the fantasy he has had of their
relationship as ``a fairy story _ the kind with sinister overtones
and not always a happy ending _ in which a young man loves a
beautiful maiden who returns his love but is always disappearing
into some unknown and mysterious world, about which she will reveal
nothing.'' He concludes, ``Eventually, he makes some dire mistake,
and she disappears for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Bayley tries to draw some distinction between the old
Iris and the new, between the well and the ill. Three-fourths of
the book is called ``Then,'' the last 50 pages ``Now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Then'' section he describes how he met and fell in love
with Iris in 1954, when she was teaching philosophy at St. Anne's
College, Oxford, and he was just completing his English studies and
was about to become a teacher at St. Antony's College. In the
``Now'' section he reproduces entries in a 1997 diary detailing
daily life with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Then'' section he describes an Iris whose mind was so
complex and mysterious that he could never hope to understand it.
In the ``Now'' section she is an anxious child who keeps saying
``When?'' and ``I want.'' Before, their marriage was a joining of
solitudes, a moving ``closer and closer apart,'' in the words of
A.D. Hope, an Australian poet. Now, ``we move closer and closer
together,'' Bayley writes, ``and Iris' little `mouse cry,' as I
think of it, signifying loneliness in the next room, the wish to be
back beside me, seems less and less forlorn, more simple, more
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that Bayley tries to separate the two Irises, they
keep blending in both sections. In the ``Now'' section he
encounters the ghost-parts of the former Iris, her gentleness, her
love of company, her goodness. In the ``Then'' section, a woman
whose husband also has Alzheimer's says to him, ``Like being
chained to a corpse, isn't it?'' Bayley is repelled. ``How could
our cases be compared?'' he asks the reader. ``Iris was Iris.''
Very much alive to him still, despite his title.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her alive in these pages is her husband's love, which
is so absolute and mysterious that it pervades every word he
writes. It is not a particularly sexual love; ``Certainly our
bedroom habits (the deep, deep peace of the double bed after the
hurly-burly on the chaise longue, as Mrs. Pat Campbell noted) were
always peaceful and unbothered by considerations of better, or
more.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought them together was more the discovery of the
children in each other. Of the night they first ``fell into each
other's arms,'' Bayley writes, ``With arms around each other,
kissing and rubbing noses (I said how much I loved her snub nose),
we rambled on and on, seeming to invent on the spot, as we talked,
a whole infantile language of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Looked at objectively, some of what Bayley describes is
desperate. Whenever Iris, made anxious by time's loss of
conventional shape and progression, asks, ``When are we leaving?''
he thinks of the blinded airman in Faulkner's novel ``Soldiers'
Pay'' who keeps saying to his friend, ``When are they going to let
me out?''
</P>
<P>
   Iris' compulsive behavior _ collecting trash from the street,
overwatering the houseplants, following the author around the house
for reassurance _ often drives him to angry outbursts: ``You're
mad. You're dotty. You don't know anything, remember anything, care
about anything,'' he reports himself shouting at her.
</P>
<P>
   The use of diary form in the ``Now'' section suggests that he is
resorting to the advice of the Rev. Sydney Smith, whom he describes
as ``a benevolent clergyman of Jane Austen's time,'' who ``used to
urge parishioners in the grip of depression who appealed to him for
help to `take short views of human life _ never further than dinner
or tea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bayley continues: ``I used to quote this to Iris when troubles
began, as if I were recommending a real policy which could
intelligibly be followed. Now I repeat it sometimes as an
incantation or joke, which can raise a laugh if it is accompanied
by some horsing around, a live pantomime of `short views' being
taken. It is not now intended to be rationally received, but it
gets a smile anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book's final entry, dated Dec. 25, 1997, Bayley concludes
his account of the day: ``A snooze then. Iris will sleep deeply.
Later we listen to carols and Christmas music. And I have the
illusion, which fortunate Alzheimer's partners must feel at such
times, that life is just the same, has never changed. I cannot
imagine Iris any different. Her loss of memory becomes, in a sense,
my own. In a muzzy way _ the Bulgarian wine, no doubt _ I find
myself thinking of the Christian birth, and also of Wittgenstein's
comment that death is not a human experience. We are born to live
only from day to day. . . . The Rev. Sydney Smith's advice is most
easily taken during these ritualized days. The ancient saving
routine of Christmas, which for us today has been twice blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   So in ``Elegy for Iris,'' Bayley celebrates his beloved
partner's survival.

SAFE WAYS OF TAKING LUMBER HOME 
</HEADLINE>

(mk) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week this column focused on buying dimensional lumber.
Buying lumber is one thing; getting it home is another. You can, of
course, have the lumberyard deliver the goods. This is certainly a
good idea if you are buying in quantity: 25 sheets of wallboard, or
50 2-by-4s.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, two drawbacks to this. First, you may have
to wait a few days for it to arrive. This can be awkward if the
delivery date doesn't fit into your work schedule. Second, when you
have lumber delivered you cannot select the pieces you want; the
lumberyard does that for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to do the hauling yourself, there are several
issues to consider. You really cannot place long boards inside your
car unless you have a hatchback. Your best option then is to load
the boards on the car roof. First purchase a pair of roof racks.
These will make it easier to tie the load securely and protect the
roof of your car. Home centers, auto supply stores and sporting
good stores carry roof racks. They range in price from $30 to more
than $150.
</P>
<P>
   Before purchasing the racks, look at the specifications on the
box to see if the racks will attach to your car. Some racks clip to
the rain gutters on either side of the car roof, but not all cars
have these. Other models lock to the ledges situated just behind
the tops of the car doors.
</P>
<P>
   Also check to see if the racks have a weight limitation. Better
racks have a carrying capacity of 150 to 200 pounds. In addition to
sturdy construction, these models have broad feet that distribute
the weight over a wider area, so they are less likely to put dents
in the car roof.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the roof racks, you will have to tie all the lumber
securely so the boards do not slip loose while you're moving.
Remember that a flying piece of construction lumber can be lethal
even at slow speeds.
</P>
<P>
   To insure a firm tie-down, work systematically. First make sure
the roof racks are secure by giving each rack a strong tug in each
direction before loading. Then place the widest boards at the
bottom, centering them on the racks so the weight is evenly
distributed across the roof. Next place the narrower pieces on top
of these. Avoid piling on too many boards _ too much weight can
dent the roof.
</P>
<P>
   When all the lumber is in place, tie it down. You can use
flexible rubber cables with hooks at each end, flat nylon straps
with self-clinching buckles and rope to tie the load in place.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber tie-downs are useful for pulling the whole load together
and making it manageable, but don't rely on them exclusively. They
have a tendency to stretch when the load shifts. When that happens,
individual boards, particularly those in the center, can easily
work loose.
</P>
<P>
   The best flexible rubber cable tie-downs are made of heavy-duty
black rubber with hooks at each end. These grip the wood better
than those lighter rubber tie-downs with multicolored, fabric
covering. In addition to wrapping the tie- downs around the load,
thread a few straps through the center. This will secure internal
boards and prevent slide-outs as you move.
</P>
<P>
   Tie the load to the roof racks with nylon straps that have
self-clinching buckles. Wrap the strap around the load and under
and around each rack. Thread the strap end through the buckle and
pull it taut. The gripper tab in the buckle will hold the strap and
keep it from pulling loose.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to attach a red flag on any boards that extend more than
a foot beyond the rear bumper. Some lumber yards provide free flags
of plastic or cloth, but it's best to bring your own just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Loading panels, like plywood or wallboard, requires a slightly
different loading technique. Because of their size, it's difficult
to tie the panels directly to the racks. So start by placing two
9-foot 2-by-4s across the racks. Position them so they are
parallel, then tie them to the racks with rubber tie-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Place the panel on top of the 2-by-4s and run ropes across the
face of the panel to the 2-by-4s. Probably the best kind of rope
for this is a good- quality 1/4-inch diameter hemp rope. The coarse
texture of the hemp keeps knots from slipping yet allows easy
untying.
</P>
<P>
   When the lumber is loaded and securely tied down, you are ready
to roll. Drive slowly, and avoid sudden stops or sharp turns. If
possible, take a slow-moving route home. Remember, speed is not a
consideration; safety is. After the first few minutes of driving,
pull over and check to make sure that the load is still secure and
none of the tie-downs have worked loose.

`PATCH ADAMS': PHYSICIAN, SQUEAL THYSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams plays a medical maverick who
finds no situation too grim for a guffaw. He develops the theory
that the best way to treat a dying patient who wants one last
safari is to shock the man out of a sound sleep with balloon
animals, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the establishment is slow to appreciate Patch, to the
point where he winds up making a heartfelt courtroom-style speech
in defense of his methods. Here's a film for anyone who'd like to
hear Williams declaim, ``If we're going to fight a disease, let's
fight one of the most terrible diseases of all: indifference!''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing another of the soggier roles he has lately favored,
Williams spends a lot of time here smiling gratefully at the
compliments heaped on him (``God, Patch, it's amazing what you've
done with this place, you know?'') and looking significantly older
than the medical student he initially plays.
</P>
<P>
   To save the material from utter oblivion, he also does his share
of clowning, though it bears the stamp of the creative team (the
director, Tom Shadyac, and the writer, Steve Oedekerk) behind some
Jim Carrey films. The whiff of ``Ace Ventura'' extends to
proctologist jokes, gynecologist jokes (including a big, bawdy
sight gag) and masturbation jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Low humor might count for more here if it weren't constantly
overshadowed by the film's maudlin streak. Williams, in a film
based on a true story, plays a man whose own period of mental
illness helps him empathize with patients and makes him vow to
bring more laughs to their hospital experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to the point of wearing a bedpan on his head and an
enema bulb on his nose, he keeps the nurses collapsing in grateful
laughter and the patients charmed, while also courting a beautiful
fellow student (Monica Potter) with a dark-eyed, nostrilly
resemblance to Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are good?'' he rails when life turns brutally tough.
``Trust people? Hah!'' But you can bet that the film's Patch will
not let his kindness waver for long.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he founds the Gesundheit Institute, billed here as
``the first fun hospital in the world'' and presumably the reason
why playing Patch struck Williams as a good idea. But the role,
like Marc Shaiman's noxious soundtrack, is too full of
prefabricated sentiments to let an actor breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams,'' which begins in 1969 and has a notably
perfunctory period look, also features Philip Seymour Hoffman as
the roommate too starchy to appreciate Patch, and Peter Coyote as
one of the many desperately ill people who succumb to Patch's
charms. (Williams arrives at his bedside amusingly dressed as an
angel, calling this a ``preview of coming attractions.'')
</P>
<P>
   Also here is the year's least welcome technological advance, the
computer-generated butterfly meant to provide a touch of magic for
a film that has none of its own.
</P>
<P>

   Nearly 50 years later, in 1992, when I arrived in eastern
Kentucky to help bury my grandmother, there were still no strangers
in town. Something about my face was instantly familiar; the local
funeral director greeted me by announcing, ``When I was a boy, I
once saw your granny's brother, Red Mynhier, wrestle a full-grown
hog to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently my long-dead relative had the biggest hands anybody
could remember seeing in Floyd County, a story my own daughters
hear often. This is part of my campaign to instill in them, three
generations later, a similar sense of small-town security. Despite
the absence of hog wrestling in the Long Island suburb where we
live, for years I was smug enough to think I could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day, my daughters shattered my illusions. It
started innocently at brunch at the home of a friend whose
9-year-old daughter has a computer and a modem _ in her bedroom. My
two older daughters went to investigate. Soon they experienced
e-mail: they watched in awe as their friend Maddy exchanged instant
messages on America Online with a . . . boy! He was from her old
school, they later reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be on America Online,'' Zoe, 9, said later.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Ella, 7, to invoke subsection 11(d) of the Me Too
clause in her Little Sister Contract: ``If Zoe gets one, I get
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Together: ``Pleeeeease?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 20,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I would have preferred that they take up hog wrestling. This was
one of those unpleasant moments when two contradictory parental
impulses collide. On one hand, I wanted them to test the limits of
their world as freely as my mother had explored hers. On the other
hand, I did not want them roaming around in a community with 14
million neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is this: on America Online, I feel assaulted by
unsavory strangers. On the Internet at large, I have never
accidentally stumbled across pornographic sites. But in the three
months since I opened an AOL account, I have received dozens of
unpleasant, unsolicited e-mail messages, creating the impression
that there is a kook behind every corner.
</P>
<P>
   Although my AOL address is one of four I use, it receives almost
all of my spam. On Nov. 25, for instance, someone sent e-mail
exhorting me to ``Come See My Dirty Pics!!'' No less annoying was a
missive on Dec. 3 (subject: Ear Cleaning Procedure!'') or another
on Dec. 12 (``Red Hot Fun'').
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that so much spam pollutes America Online, considering
that the service has taken great pains to promote its
family-oriented atmosphere with such features as a newly redesigned
Kids' Only Channel. Certainly, other aspects of the service, like
the easy-to-use interface that enables even a child to navigate
smoothly, have attracted millions of family users; 43 percent of
AOL's customers have children.
</P>
<P>
   When I brought this up to AOL's officials last week, Tricia
Primrose, a company spokeswoman, reminded me that AOL aggressively
tracked spammers, suing them and blocking their e-mail addresses.
To protect children, AOL has parental control features that allow
account holders to set up customized log-ins that block access to
things like e-mail, instant messages, the Internet and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the parental controls remind me of another quandary. I want
to protect my children. But I worry that instead of instilling a
sense of the majestic sweep of information available on line, these
sorts of accounts limit the sense of possibility, blocking children
from the very things that make online communication so exciting.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned America Online's vice president for programming,
Katherine Borsecnik, for advice. ``There's nothing wrong with
limiting their behavior, either on line or off line,'' she said.
``Just as you want to learn the names of all their friends off
line, just as you want to know who is sending them real mail, you
want the same kind of information when they go on line. So you
start by limiting them to exchanging e-mail with people you know.
Kids earn your trust over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, I created screen names for the girls,
stringently limiting my 7-year-old's access. For my older daughter,
I customized the log-in so she could exchange instant messages with
her friend Maddy.
</P>
<P>
   It took Zoe about 10 seconds to figure out how to click on the
AOL icon to log in using her screen name. It took her 5 more
seconds to figure out how to click on the Write icon to compose
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It took about five minutes to hunt and peck the following: ``Hi
Dad this is Zoe school was fine. Will you be late? Love, Zoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively, she clicked on the Send Now icon.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to see that she was bored and wanted to log off. For
now, she viewed AOL merely as a substitute for licking a stamp and
addressing an envelope, not as the sort of full-fledged community
where champion hog wrestlers were revered.

MAKING A CASE FOR `CIVIL ACTION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Liz Smilor) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Jonathan Harr's best-selling book, ``A Civil
Action,'' personal injury attorney Jan Schlichtmann outlines his
personal mission in clear, concise terms. ``To become rich and
famous by doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann repeats it again and again, and the mantra comes to
define him as he takes on two large corporations that, he believes,
poisoned a Massachusetts town's drinking water, leading to the
leukemia deaths of eight children. The case consumes him to the
point where he mortgages his firm's future _ not to mention every
possession he owns _ upon its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to transform the book into a movie, Steven
Zaillian (who turned ``Schindler's List'' into Oscar gold for
Steven Spielberg) read Harr's work and decided that Schlichtmann
was a liar. Or at least in a deep state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who says something like that has a problem,''
says Zaillian, who also directed the film adaptation, which stars
John Travolta as Schlichtmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either do good or you make money. But you don't try to
combine them. And to get famous, too? It's too many things to go
for at the same time, so one of them you can't be that passionate
about.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zaillian is convinced it's the ``doing good'' part. So, fans
of the book (and there are a lot of them _ ``A Civil Action'' has
been an enduring best seller since it was published more than three
years ago) instantly will realize that Zaillian has made
Schlichtmann into more of a mercenary ambulance chaser than a man
trying to juggle too many conflicting motivations.
</P>
<P>
   It's an obvious change, but not a jarring one. In fact,
Zaillian's 110-minute movie is a rather faithful adaptation of
Harr's complex 500-page work, not the easiest of tasks when you
consider Harr's estimate that it takes most people 30 hours to read
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he had to compress a lot of things,'' Harr says.
(Zaillian's first draft was 225 pages. He shot 150 and kept 100 in
the final, finished version.) ``But _ and this kind of surprised me
_ the essence of the book is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be known, Zaillian is a bit surprised, too. Take away its
best-seller status and ``A Civil Action'' isn't exactly natural
movie material. The trial itself was boring, the details of the
case were mind-numbing and the ending was ambiguous at best,
downbeat at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many Hollywood courtroom moments, are there?''
Travolta asks. ``There's nothing along the lines of,'' and here he
adds a little heat to his voice, ``You're out of order! No, YOU'RE
OUT OF ORDER!!! Or: I want the truth! You can't handle the
truth!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta pauses, composing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We're a little more low-key here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fitting, since Zaillian, 45, is a quiet, decidedly
hype-free individual. ``A Civil Action'' is his second film,
following his critically acclaimed, but little-seen 1993 debut
``Searching for Bobby Fischer.'' The five-year gap between movies
certainly can be explained by Zaillian's screenwriting duties.
Although ``Clear and Present Danger'' is his last screenplay
credit, he has doctored several films since then, including
``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Amistad'' and ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Zaillian is a perfectionist, a stickler for
details, however minute they might seem to others. William Macy,
cast as the law firm's despairing financial partner, says Zaillian
will keep shooting ``until someone cries `uncle'.'' Robert Duvall,
who plays Schlichtmann's opposing counsel, recalls seeing Zaillian
so consumed that ``we'd watch him bump into walls four or five
times _ and that was before lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds kind of cute, in an almost absent-minded professor
sort of way, until you hear rumblings from the set that the shoot
was too grueling, that Zaillian filmed different takes just for the
sole purpose of moving an ashtray or push pins on a map and that
Travolta was complaining that Zaillian never bothered to share the
film's overall vision with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Travolta, putting on his best face for an interview,
offers, ``The film took a toll on me. Was it too much? It was
definitely in the ballpark. I couldn't do two `Civil Actions' back
to back. But just like Jan Schlichtmann was asked at the end of the
movie, `If you had to do it all over again, would you?' I would.''
Pause. ``Just not two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zaillian pleads guilty _ with extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes an actor doesn't know the line or understand the
line and I'm going to keep shooting until they do,'' Zaillian says.
``If that's meticulous, that's what it is. But I'm going to keep
shooting until everybody does their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Travolta looks nothing like the tall, rail-thin
Schlichtmann, a man who became even more gaunt as the long trial
wore on. (``Initially, everyone thought of Jeff Goldblum,'' Harr
says.) Tom Hanks also was considered, much to Harr's dismay.
(``That would have been `Bonfire of the Vanities','' he says.
``Hanks is a good actor, but he cannot play slick, oily
characters.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Zaillian tabbed Travolta because he believed he was
an actor who could tap into the dark side of movie-star charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``John loves himself, he's rather vain _ not in a bad way _ and
he has a magnetic personality, just as Jan Schlichtmann does in the
early part of the film,'' Zaillian says. ``After that, it's not a
real showy part. In fact, it's probably the most understated
performance John has given in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to the tricky part. You have a muted Travolta, a
complex, morally ambiguous legal case totally devoid of courtroom
theatrics and an unsentimental, less-than-dramatic ending where
everyone loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of remarkable any studio wanted to make this
film,'' Duvall says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, the studio that did make the film, has its marketing
team doing its darndest to lure audiences to theaters, stressing
the movie's courtroom setting (a Hollywood staple) and Travolta's
star power. Zaillian, ever the perfectionist, doesn't approve,
bemoaning the way the studio is presenting ``A Civil Action'' to
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer doesn't make it look like a smart movie,''
Zaillian complains. ``You know what it looks like _ a Grisham
movie. But they say you need to make it accessible to bring people
in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they say. And with a real-life legal case that comes
loaded with a series of messy endings, Disney _ and the filmmakers
_ would like to put a different stamp on the fate of this project.
</P>
<P>
   Happy. &QL;

THERE ARE SOME CATCHES IN THIS `VOICE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much will be written about Jane Horrocks' spot-on impersonations
of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe and others in
``Little Voice.'' But it's not Horrocks' gift for mimicry that
gives the movie a lift. It's something in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The key comes in a scene in which Horrocks is belting out ``Get
Happy.'' Showboating, rump-shaking, working the crowd, Horrocks
looks for all the world like the diva she's pretending to be. But
when you look closely, her eyes still say that a scared, intensely
shy woman isn't far beneath the surface. Actors love to slip into
roles in which they can mask themselves; rarely do they do what
Horrocks does, which is let the essence of her character show
through.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the essence of ``Little Voice'' shows through as
well; it wears a mask of originality, but you don't need to look
too closely to see that its story _ repressed person works toward
breakthrough _ is older than some of the show tunes Horrocks sings.
Her character, LV, is introverted to the point of near-autism. She
rarely speaks and spends most of her time in her room, listening to
her father's record collection. She stacks the records around the
turntable, as if they were part of a shrine and the turntable an
altar. When she sings along, she hasn't just absorbed the music;
she has let it possess her.
</P>
<P>
   You'd sequester yourself, too, if you had a mother like LV's.
Mum is a vulgar, man-chasing shrew played by ``Secrets and Lies' ''
Brenda Blethyn at such a pitch that you're not sure if you're
getting irked by the character or the performance (hint: probably
both). One of the guys she brings home is a talent scout played by
Michael Caine (who seems rejuvenated _ maybe too rejuvenated _ by
the role). When he overhears LV singing, he figures there's gold in
them thar trills, and he tries to start her on a singing career.
</P>
<P>
   That's not so easy. If a diva like Barbra Streisand suffers from
stage fright, imagine what it's like for someone who borders on the
agoraphobic. (It's probably no coincidence that two of LV's three
idols died early, unhappy deaths.) The only person who has LV's
best interests at heart is a shy telephone repairman (Ewan
McGregor, turning down his sex appeal to give a winningly modest
performance). His pigeon-racing hobby, however, figures into a
closing metaphor that's just too ham-handed to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Herman, who directed last year's terrific ``Brassed Off!,''
adapted ``Little Voice'' from a play and does his level best to
obscure its stage origins. The movie is full of lighting tricks and
swooping crane shots, and it climaxes in a spectacularly edited
sequence that reveals new levels of ugliness in Blethyn and Caine's
characters. But the movie's first half feels underdramatized, and
it's not until Horrocks begins singing that it begins to ignite.
She gives us a reason to see the movie, but what surrounds her
isn't so absolutely fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' is rated R for sexuality and strong language.

A `STEP' IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a number of interviews, ``Stepmom'' stars Julia Roberts and
Susan Sarandon have voiced their unhappiness with the movie's
title, which is the least of its problems. Sarandon is the ex,
missed dearly by the children she doted on. Roberts is more attuned
to her career as a fashion photographer than to her new life as a
stepmother to Ed Harris' kids. His adolescent daughter doesn't like
Roberts. ``Stepmom'' has the kind of undercurrents we've all seen,
either up close or when an argument within one of these grafted
nuclear families breaks out at the supermarket. It's also the kind
of movie they do all the time on Lifetime. Just because ``Stepmom''
has bigger stars doesn't make it any better. It's merely more
expensively staged.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn: young, hip and desperate to break
through vs. older, not-so-cool and attuned to her kids' needs.
(Given the kind of animosity that can crop up in these
relationships, you wonder why this movie wasn't called
``Stepmonster.'' It certainly can't be called ``Dad,'' because the
father, played by a harried, put-upon Ed Harris, disappears for at
least an hour.) Sarandon has the upper hand here. She gets to be
the angrier of the two women _ the loving mama lion _ because she's
sacrificed her career to her cubs, and they love her. The fact is,
though, there are no tensions between her and her kids. She's so
much the perfect mother that she's not very interesting. Sarandon
flashes her wide, insolent eyes and delicate sneers, doing her best
to give this underwritten role any authority.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has a little more to work with. She's not really suited
for instant motherhood, which the movie illustrates through a
sitcom-ish opening scene. ``Stepmom'' lurches from comedy to
melodrama, trying to plant its feet directly where ``Terms of
Endearment'' has been before, with two powerhouse actresses _ well,
one anyway _ bonding through laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   But director Chris Columbus lacks the audience-pleasing
shrewdness of ``Endearment'' (and ``As Good As It Gets)'' director
James L. Brooks. Columbus falls back on the mortifying spectacle
that ``The Big Chill'' introduced 15 years ago: white people
lip-synching Motown songs into hairbrushes, a sequence that has now
calcified into a standard piece of business. ``Stepmom'' is full of
'em, as we get to watch Sarandon and her kids bop to ``Ain't No
Mountain High Enough'' by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. (A more
appropriate Gaye and Terrell duet for this movie would have been
``If I Could Build My Whole World Around You,'' because Sarandon's
kids are the center of her life. Considering Sarandon's daughter's
anger and fear of abandonment, Columbus should have gone all the
way and had her mouth Nine Inch Nails' ``Hurt).''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus returns to the scene of a crime _ holiday season
mawkishness _ that has been berry, berry good to him. He banged a
dinger with the first ``Home Alone.'' Unfortunately, it's been big
swings and misses ever since, the worst being ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' _
which writer Larry Gelbart dismissed as ``Tootsie Vs. Kramer.''
There may still be people with a taste for being manipulated this
relentlessly. If so, this is just the glass of room-temperature
Diet Coke you were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' is rated PG-13 for adult language.

   NEW YORK _ ``The Nutcracker'' can take many surprising forms.
But the best of them remain tributes to good cheer. An especially
pleasant reinterpretation is ``The Harlem Nutcracker,'' in which
Donald Byrd choreographically transplants the action from
19th-century Germany to 20th-century New York. Tchaikovsky's music
undergoes its own metamorphosis, for the production is set to the
jazz arrangements Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn made of some
of the familiar tunes and to additional music composed and arranged
by David Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harlem Nutcracker'' returned to New York when Donald
Byrd/The Group opened a two-week run of it Tuesday night at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Byrd's company has been augmented by
guest dancers and singers, including members of the New York
Ellington Gospel Choir and the Creative Outlet Performing Arts
Program. The Club Sweets Jazz Orchestra, conducted by Berger,
provided rousing accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most productions in which Clara, the heroine, is a little
girl, Byrd's Clara is a widow and a grandmother who at a family
party has a vision of her deceased husband and travels back in
memory with him. The longest stop on their journey is a Harlem
nightclub of the 1930s, and its floor show allows Byrd to poke
affectionate fun at cabaret acts.
</P>
<P>
   While chorus-lines strutted, a brassy gum-chewing Cigarette Girl
(amusingly played by Theresa Howard) occasionally wandered among
the customers. Leonora Stapleton was a torrid Sugar Rum Cherry
(this version's equivalent of the Sugar Plum Fairy). Stephanie
Guiland and Brian Brooks showed fine comic timing as they portrayed
colossally vain dance partners. And there was boisterous
jitterbugging.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a good traditional ``Nutcracker'' is more than a
diversion, so ``The Harlem Nutcracker'' is not merely a spoof. The
key to the ballet's significance lies in the way its first-act
party pays tribute to the warmth of family and friends. The more
imposing celebrations in the second act thereby become
glorifications of the spirit of conviviality. Eduardo Sicangco's
sets and Gabriel Berry's costumes for the Harlem version made the
party in the parlor cozy and the club appear bright. Both parlor
and club became fun places to be.
</P>
<P>
   The party was attended by children and grownups who, in
characterization, ranged from nice to naughty. But no one grew too
naughty and everyone looked like someone interesting to know. The
gentlest of these people were Clara and the Ghost of Her Husband,
as played by two guest dancers: Eleanor McCoy, a former member of
Dance Theater of Harlem, and Gus Solomons Jr., a notable
choreographer in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd has been dramatically daring in his scenes for them for, in
addition to remembering a nightclub, they relive turbulent moments
from black history. Not every image is equally powerful.
Nevertheless, the sequences indicate that ``The Harlem Nutcracker''
has serious implications.
</P>
<P>
   This may also be the only ``Nutcracker'' in which Clara suffers
what looks like a heart attack and which is at least a case of
severe heart palpitations. And an allegorical figure of Death keeps
reappearing. Usually, Ms. Howard is cast in the role. But, at the
conclusion, Death proved to be Solomons, this theatrical surprise
suggesting that the love of Clara and her husband is eternal. By
having love ultimately prevail, the choreography proclaims joy to
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome production has been made possible, in large part,
by the sponsorship of Aetna Inc., and Byrd thanked Aetna in a
curtain speech. His ``Harlem Nutcracker'' continues through Jan. 3
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Ave., Fort Greene.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, she could be a shining example of a modern
California girl. She studies in honors classes as a senior at the
public high school in Encinitas, Calif., and she's applying to
top-tier colleges like Brown University and the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks five languages and takes classical piano lessons. She
has written for the school newspaper, acted in school plays and
become a community representative in her high school's feminist
club. She goes out dancing to techno and trance music and listens
to R&AMP;B, British pop and a little heavy metal. She fights with her
mother over curfews. And she's addicted, she says, to exchanging
e-mail with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at her left hand _ and the thick, purple-striped
calluses on her fingers _ reveals that she has another life.
Anoushka Shankar, the 17-year-old daughter of the renowned sitar
master Ravi Shankar, is also her father's student and disciple, and
sometimes she has to miss school to perform with him at concert
halls around the world.
</P>
<P>
   She may be a Metallica fan, but she is also mastering Indian
classical music: the raga compositions and rhythmic cycles that
have been passed down through centuries of oral tradition. Her
debut album, ``Anoushka'' (Angel/EMI), was released in October;
it's a recital of compositions by her father and pieces that he has
popularized.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours a day on weekdays, and three or four hours a day on
weekends, Ms. Shankar practices the sitar, learning the repertory
and picking up improvisational ideas from her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything changes when I walk into the music room,'' she said
in her hotel suite on her last visit to New York, when she
performed alongside her father at Carnegie Hall. ``I could be lying
with my feet in my father's lap watching a movie, but the second we
walk into the music room, I am a disciple. In general, it's a
situation of utter surrender on the disciple's part, and utter
respect. It may not be as much with me as with his other students,
because I'm his daughter and I'm a little spoiled. But it is a
beautiful relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankar found out she was Ravi Shankar's daughter when she
was 7 years old, and he was 68. ``He was always a kind of father
figure in my life,'' she said. Anoushka lived with her mother in
London and when Shankar came through on tour, they would visit him
in his hotel; Anoushka called him Baba (father) as a term of
respect. When Ravi Shankar married her mother in 1988, a blood test
showed that Anoushka was his daughter, and she changed her last
name to Shankar from her mother's name. Two years later, at her
mother's urging, she began studying the sitar with her father in
New Delhi, where she still spends summers, and then in California.
</P>
<P>
   She got started in Indian music reluctantly. ``I had always
enjoyed listening,'' Ms. Shankar said. ``I could sit happily and
listen to my dad teaching the other students. But then it would be
so frustrating to go back and have to do all the beginning skills.
The better I got, the more I started to enjoy playing. And at about
12, my dad said to me: `Look, you've got to get serious about it.
If you don't want to play, that's fine, but if I'm going to teach
you it should be something deeper.' By then, I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of Ravi Shankar's students come to him when they are
already skilled musicians, his daughter started with him as a
beginner. In a way, that makes Ms. Shankar the purest of her
father's disciples, musically formed entirely in his image. ``It is
better to have soft wax than a hard stone,'' Ravi Shankar said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankar began sharing the stage with her father when she was
13, and her performances with him have drawn glowing reviews.
``She's special,'' Peter Watrous wrote in The New York Times in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bond that comes up only onstage,'' Ms. Shankar said.
``It's spiritual, and then it's my father, and then it's my guru,
and it's the beautiful music and the excitement, and then it's my
own excitement in being onstage and if I play well. It's just
amazing. Even when it's really dark and you can't see the people,
you're just aware of that many people being there, and it adds an
energy, especially when it's a really great audience that's
enjoying the music. You feel this energy _ I know it pumps my dad
up, and it pumps me up. And when they applaud after you play the
music, I love that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Shankar still considers herself a relative novice.
Indian classical music is an improviser's medium, with a performer
creating up to 90 percent of a piece. And Ms. Shankar does little
improvising in public; onstage and on her album, her bursts of
exuberant virtuosity are largely composed. The album is, she says,
``a baby step'' that acknowledges her father's pervasive role in
her music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I really have much of a musical personality of
my own yet,'' she added. ``I'm still really self-conscious about
improvising in front of people. I always have this fear that it's
going to be wrong. But it's slowly been getting better, so it will
go away _ it kind of has to. I'm improvising a little bit more as
time goes on, but it's hard for me to say what's going to happen
when I go off on my own, because I'm sure it's going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankar intends to keep her traditional and modern worlds
separate. ``A lot of my friends want me to add a techno beat to the
sitar and stuff like that,'' she said. ``But that's not the kind of
thing I want to do. Coming from my father and learning in such a
serious way from him, I'd feel almost that I was doing something
bad. I have such a spiritual respect for the sitar that I want to
keep that the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravi Shankar has taught generations of students, and his legacy
in Indian music will not rest entirely with his daughter. He is
philosophical about how the family tradition will evolve in his
daughter's hands. ``She would excel at anything she put her mind
to,'' he said. ``What happens to her music will depend on her
talent. And on her karma.''

IN WAR OF THE SEXES, THE WALKING WOUNDED
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) (DW) By STEPHEN
HOLDEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So what kind of friendship is this?'' pleads Eddie (Sean Penn)
to his suave housemate, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), in David Rabe's
pitch-black comedy ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adequate,'' Mickey replies with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's hardly any nurture in the friendships shown in the
teeth-grinding Hollywood shark tank of ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   In evoking the casual cruelty of contemporary life in a certain
time and place, this screen adaptation of David Rabe's play is a
misanthropic triumph. The film, which takes place ``a little while
ago,'' is set in a movie-industry milieu that feels like the 1980s,
when the play was first produced and when cocaine was still
conspicuously fashionable in Hollywood. In this toxic social
climate, friendships are duplicitous power games and male-female
encounters ugly skirmishes in a never-ending series of battles.
</P>
<P>
   The main characters in this bilious study of macho camaraderie,
sexual exploitation and substance abuse are Eddie, a casting
director coming apart from drugs and alcohol, and his cool,
sarcastic business partner and roommate, Mickey. These two party
animals share a sleek mirror-and-glass-filled condominium in the
Hollywood Hills. As the movie begins on a morning of runny noses
and hacking coughs, the only breakfast food in the refrigerator
turns out to be a package of moldy Snowballs.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's Eddie is a whiny, hysterical motor-mouth, a sort of
improvisatory philosopher of doom whose unstrung rants are inspired
by television images gleaned from his compulsive channel-surfing.
Blond and reptilian, Spacey's Mickey gazes at the world through
hooded eyes, his mouth curled in a supercilious sneer.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of friendship do they have? On this particular
morning, the atmosphere is sharpened by Eddie's certainty that his
sometime girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), has just slept
with Mickey. As the friends argue by car phone, Mickey calmly
reminds Eddie that he gave him tacit permission to sleep with
Darlene when he announced that ``everybody's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping by the house to snort cocaine, smoke dope and swap
nasty sexual war stories are Artie (Garry Shandling), a beady-eyed
Hollywood bigwig, and Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a thuggish would-be
actor with ``three kids in Toledo I haven't seen since I went to
prison.'' One afternoon Artie brings his buddies a sexual ``care
package'' in the person of Donna (Anna Paquin), a brash, itinerant
teen-ager he met in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Phil, a human pit bull who idolizes Eddie, is desperate to save
his unraveling marriage to a wife he has been beating up. Should he
stop taking pills to reduce his sperm count and give her the baby
she craves? In the movie's chilliest moment, after that child has
arrived, Artie picks up the baby girl and marvels at the fact that
``this sweet little thing, this innocent little thing, guys, this
is a broad of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That tender moment arrives long after Eddie has fixed up Phil on
a disastrous blind date with Bonnie (Meg Ryan), a stripper, single
mother and self-described ``drug person'' who in another of the
movie's nastier moments is recalled having had sex in the back seat
of a car while her traumatized 6-year-old daughter looked on.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Anthony Drazen, ``Hurlyburly'' has been opened up
somewhat. (A crucial act of violence not shown in the play is
portrayed in the movie.) The film nevertheless still captures the
play's claustrophobic sense of being trapped in a smoke-filled room
with people who might explode at any second.
</P>
<P>
   The film's close-up photography magnifies every reddened eyelid
and plume of cigarette smoke. After a while the images of
dissipated faces and the rhythm of the characters' aimless, ugly,
hard-boiled banter settles into a woozy, sodden tango of word and
image. These are people most of us would rather not be in the same
room with, but the movie shoves them in our faces.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble acting surpasses that of any other film this year.
Penn, his face swollen and crumpling, his voice rising in childish
hysteria, burrows so deeply into Eddie that he almost vomits his
character onto the screen. Spacey's cobralike Mickey is as slippery
and cool as Penn's Eddie is volatile, while Shandling's Artie is
the loathsome distillation of a particularly repulsive kind of
sleaze: think Larry Sanders without charm or scruples.
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri, in a heaving, tragic performance that matches Harvey
Keitel's stage original, finds the vestige of a soul under the
leathery skin of a stupid, compulsively violent thug with delusions
of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' has been called sexist because of its female
characters' slatternly eagerness to gratify these misogynists. Yet
each of the film's three women is capable of standing up for
herself. Ms. Wright brings a defensive sang-froid to Darlene, whose
dispassionate attitude toward sex drives Eddie into a frenzy. (In a
ghastly comic set piece, her refusal to choose between a French and
a Chinese restaurant sets him off.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan, muting her customary perkiness, finds a core of
pugnacious resilience under Bonnie's bleary-eyed dishevelment. Ms.
Paquin's Donna (the least credible of the three women) also has a
prickly edge of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   As it traces Eddie's downward spiral, ``Hurlyburly'' touches on
many themes. But above all, it is a contemplation of male
friendship and power that proposes the existence of an immutable
pecking order. As Mickey is to Eddie (superior, condescending, and
betraying), so Eddie is to Phil. Or as Mickey coldly assures Eddie,
``Phil is very safe, because no matter how far you manage to fall,
Phil will be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   In this bleak vision of male bonding, the quest for dominance
(or if not dominance, approval from above) is so all-consuming that
women are little more than trophies and bargaining chips. The war
between men and women, the movie proposes, is only an offshoot of a
larger and more deadly war: the one waged by men against
themselves.

FARMLAND INDUSTRIES SELECTS NEW HEADQUARTERS SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In one of the biggest economic development
deals of the year, Farmland Industries Inc. announced Tuesday that
it plans to consolidate area offices near Kansas City International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland, which has about 1,800 area employees, plans to sign a
contract to buy a 122-acre site near the junction of Interstate 29
and Interstate 435 from interests controlled by Floridian William
Parma.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for construction of a 250,000-square-foot building at
the site to house about 900 employees; those employees now work in
seven buildings north of the Missouri River. The company also plans
to build a new headquarters building and move from the current
location at 3315 N. Oak Trafficway.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said no dollar estimate of the multiple phase project
was available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Cleberg, Farmland's president and chief executive officer,
announced that the consolidation would reduce Farmland's operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is convenient to the majority of our employees who
live north of the river and, with excellent highway access, easily
accessible to those who do not,'' Cleberg said. ``It also is
convenient to the airport and to our world headquarters building.
The parcel of land is large enough to give us the flexibility we
need as we plan for the future, and it was fairly priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland and Kansas City attorney Mike Burke, representing
Parma, declined to comment on terms of the land sale.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland noted that the land sale is not final and depends on
several factors, including ``negotiating a satisfactory economic
development package with local and state governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farmland project has been one of the area's most hotly
pursued development plums in recent months. Despite uncertainties
about the final form of the project, and related financial
incentives, city officials expressed pleasure with the news.

   Farmland spokeswoman Sherlyn Manson said Kansas City, Platte
County and the state of Missouri had told Farmland to pick a site
and then enter talks about economic development incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been courted by other municipalities,'' Manson said.
``We want to know that the city of Kansas City, Missouri, wants us
to stay here. We just want them to think about retaining business
in the same way they approach attracting new business.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland, one of only a handful of Fortune 500 companies based
in the Kansas City area, is a cooperative owned by about 600,000
North American farmers. It had $8.8 billion in sales in 1998, plus
$3 billion in sales from Farmland's share of business in affiliated
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said it had selected Chicago-based Walsh, Higgins &AMP; Co.
to develop the property. The developer will own the facilities, and
Farmland will lease them. Farmland expects to move about 900
employees into the building in the fall of 2000 and will retain
ownership of the undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said it was negotiating to sell its current
headquarters building to a real estate firm and to lease it back
for an undetermined period. Farmland declined to identify the real
estate firm it is talking to.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said that within three to five years construction would
likely begin on headquarters at the new site. Walsh, Higgins would
also develop the new headquarters and lease that to Farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland processes and markets pork, beef and grain products. It
produces and markets fertilizer and petroleum products. Some of its
wares in supermarket meat cases include Farmland bacon and Farmland
Black Angus beef. It also owns meat brands such as OhSe.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation will involve only administrative offices and
will not affect production and processing facilities in the area.

`STEPMOM': STEPMOMMY DEAREST? NOT AT ALL
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) (DW) By JANET MASLIN
  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Stepmom,'' Julia Roberts plays the nicest person ever to
wear black at a downtown photo shoot. She's a talented photographer
so nice that she seems more interested in her boyfriend's children
than in the man himself (Ed Harris). She's definitely too nice to
have broken up his marriage to the suburban mama lion played by
Susan Sarandon, in a story with enough suds to take care of your
1999 laundry needs. What could be worse for this woman than
learning she has terminal cancer? You know what: getting used to
the prospect of Julia Roberts taking her place.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes at the ready, you can expect to loathe all this for
very good reasons, from the platitudes coughed up by five
screenwriters to the same sunny unreality Chris Columbus brought to
``Home Alone.'' (Everyone lives in a shelter magazine, be it a
downtown loft or a suburban monument to home and hearth.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also this past year's favorite Hollywood preoccupation,
the death thing, which is handled quite differently from the way it
was in the other dying mother story, ``One True Thing.'' In that
film, death was a domestic tragedy; here it's more of a learning
experience. Ms. Sarandon's Jackie is together enough to bop with
the children to a Motown song just after they've heard the really
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Stepmom'' has a couple of secret weapons. These two
actresses are so galvanized and team up so well that the women's
relationship soon upstages anything having to do with the man. (The
chemistry between Ms. Roberts' Isabel and Harris' Luke is
negligible enough to make rumors that they have been showering
together sound highly exaggerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Roberts and especially Ms. Sarandon, who has the much
more believable role, go through their motions with unexpected
conviction and make the film a lot more watchable than it has any
right to be.
</P>
<P>
   The howlers here are almost a form of inadvertent fun. (Isabel
has no problem dropping everything in SoHo and easily dashing up
the Hudson whenever the children need help.) For every terrible
contrivance in the script _ like the inevitable sequence where a
little boy gets lost in Central Park, then winds up holding court
at the police station _ there is a glimmer of substance here, too.
To its credit, the film doesn't sugarcoat its women too
monstrously, and it lets real conflicts and opinions occasionally
creep in.
</P>
<P>
   Both actresses are executive producers of the rare Hollywood
film to incorporate Woody Guthrie's ``This Land Is Your Land'' and
letting Ms. Sarandon warn a dishonest child about looking like . .
. ``Well, he's not President anymore, so why be petty?''
</P>
<P>
   The story begins on a note of glossy animosity, with Ms. Roberts
running afoul of both children, 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone) and
7-year-old Ben (Liam Aiken) every time she tries to be sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' would like you to believe that even a smiling, ever
patient Julia Roberts presenting the gift of a new puppy is not
enough to cut the mustard here. ``I'll handle it from here,
Isabel,'' snaps Jackie when Isabel hands over the children,
prompting a refreshingly catty, ``I'm sure you will, Jackie'' in
reply. But Isabel tries so hard that she makes little inroads all
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Jackie is sharpening her zingers about Isabel and
campaigning mightily for the title Mother of the Year. On the level
of crafts projects alone, ``Stepmom'' is enough to make real life
pale, yet Ms. Sarandon somehow manages to keep all that quilting
from overshadowing the woman she plays. Her Jackie is tart and
fiery, in a snappishly good performance that would be affecting
even without the multi-hanky dialogue. (``You know how a
caterpillar becomes something else? Just think of me flying off
somewhere.'') She tries her best to keep this story human even when
it heads toward a happily-ever-after ending in which somebody still
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus gives the film a lavish look and a thick skin about
storytelling cliches, directing the most contrived encounters as if
they were utterly new. Motown music is tacked on as heavily as
possible, working overtime to make feeling bad another way of
feeling good.
</P>

THIS BARD'S FOR YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not long before ``Shakespeare in Love'' lets you know that
it's not your English Lit professor's Shakespeare. We see the Bard
plugged by writer's block, struggling to come up with words for
something called ``Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter,'' tossing
a crumpled sheet of paper into a souvenir coffee mug from
Stratford-on-Avon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheerful anachronism that winks at the audience and
razzes the purists, an invitation to join in the fun. And what fun
it is. John Madden's bawdy and boisterous direction gets spirited
performances out of an energetic cast, and the screenplay by Marc
Norman and Tom Stoppard is overflowing with wit and romance.
</P>
<P>
   The script portrays Shakespeare as something of a hack-for-hire,
willing to steal lines he has overheard on the street and to borrow
from his superior rival, Christopher Marlowe (a briefly seen Rupert
Everett). Joseph Fiennes, much more memorable here than in
``Elizabeth,'' plays the Bard with restless passion; even when he's
standing still, he appears to be ready to jump out of his skin.
Shakespeare's muse is eluding him _ actually, she's turning up in
the wrong beds _ and his writer's block remains until he meets
Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). She's a noblewoman so enchanted
by Shakespeare's words that she disguises herself as a man to play
the part of Romeo, at a time when women weren't allowed on stage.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a leap of faith to accept Paltrow's getting away with
the ruse, but the movie's exuberance makes us willing to make that
leap. Shakespeare and Viola quickly fall for each other, but the
course of true love never did run smooth, and she's been promised
in marriage to the strutting, cash-strapped Lord Wessex (Colin
Firth), who sees her as more of a business deal. There's comedy and
tragedy in this, and it informs Shakespeare's writing of ``Romeo,''
which begins to take on a different form.
</P>
<P>
   If Fiennes and Paltrow sometimes let themselves go a little too
much, staring at each other like lovestruck collies, they make up
for it with the passion of their scenes together. They define
chemistry, because together they're more than the sum of their
parts. Paltrow is still developing as an actress, but she shows
something beyond movie-star potential when she has the right
leading man _ and Fiennes is her best match yet.
</P>
<P>
   They're boosted by a terrific supporting cast, all of whom tear
into their parts, especially Geoffrey Rush, breaking away from
recent dourness to play the befuddled theater owner Philip
Henslowe; and Judi Dench, as imperious as ever as Queen Elizabeth
I, full of wisdom and withering one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the co-credited screenplay, the movie appears to be
mostly Stoppard's work. When he's at the top of the game, he's
peerless in wordplay, as he showed in the Shakespeare-oriented play
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' But ``Rosencrantz''
couldn't survive the transition to screen; despite good
performances from Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, it had a sluggishness
that defeated the script. Madden has no such problem here; his
camera is as restless as Fiennes' body, and the movie moves with
nearly hyperactive zest. Now and then, Madden overindulges himself,
but why begrudge him a little fun when he's offering us such a good
time?
</P>
<P>
   As everything unfolds, the movie comes together as an astute
commentary on theater and on moviegoing itself. The result is a
sublime convergence of director, script and actors. It couldn't
make a better commentary than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is rated R for nudity, sexual situations
and some violence.

`HURLYBURLY': IN WAR OF THE SEXES, THE WALKING WOUNDED
</HEADLINE>
  
(EDS: Resending to add film title to hed. No other changes.)  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) (DW) By STEPHEN
HOLDEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So what kind of friendship is this?'' pleads Eddie (Sean Penn)
to his suave housemate, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), in David Rabe's
pitch-black comedy ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adequate,'' Mickey replies with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's hardly any nurture in the friendships shown in the
teeth-grinding Hollywood shark tank of ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   In evoking the casual cruelty of contemporary life in a certain
time and place, this screen adaptation of David Rabe's play is a
misanthropic triumph. The film, which takes place ``a little while
ago,'' is set in a movie-industry milieu that feels like the 1980s,
when the play was first produced and when cocaine was still
conspicuously fashionable in Hollywood. In this toxic social
climate, friendships are duplicitous power games and male-female
encounters ugly skirmishes in a never-ending series of battles.
</P>
<P>
   The main characters in this bilious study of macho camaraderie,
sexual exploitation and substance abuse are Eddie, a casting
director coming apart from drugs and alcohol, and his cool,
sarcastic business partner and roommate, Mickey. These two party
animals share a sleek mirror-and-glass-filled condominium in the
Hollywood Hills. As the movie begins on a morning of runny noses
and hacking coughs, the only breakfast food in the refrigerator
turns out to be a package of moldy Snowballs.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's Eddie is a whiny, hysterical motor-mouth, a sort of
improvisatory philosopher of doom whose unstrung rants are inspired
by television images gleaned from his compulsive channel-surfing.
Blond and reptilian, Spacey's Mickey gazes at the world through
hooded eyes, his mouth curled in a supercilious sneer.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of friendship do they have? On this particular
morning, the atmosphere is sharpened by Eddie's certainty that his
sometime girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), has just slept
with Mickey. As the friends argue by car phone, Mickey calmly
reminds Eddie that he gave him tacit permission to sleep with
Darlene when he announced that ``everybody's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping by the house to snort cocaine, smoke dope and swap
nasty sexual war stories are Artie (Garry Shandling), a beady-eyed
Hollywood bigwig, and Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a thuggish would-be
actor with ``three kids in Toledo I haven't seen since I went to
prison.'' One afternoon Artie brings his buddies a sexual ``care
package'' in the person of Donna (Anna Paquin), a brash, itinerant
teen-ager he met in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Phil, a human pit bull who idolizes Eddie, is desperate to save
his unraveling marriage to a wife he has been beating up. Should he
stop taking pills to reduce his sperm count and give her the baby
she craves? In the movie's chilliest moment, after that child has
arrived, Artie picks up the baby girl and marvels at the fact that
``this sweet little thing, this innocent little thing, guys, this
is a broad of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That tender moment arrives long after Eddie has fixed up Phil on
a disastrous blind date with Bonnie (Meg Ryan), a stripper, single
mother and self-described ``drug person'' who in another of the
movie's nastier moments is recalled having had sex in the back seat
of a car while her traumatized 6-year-old daughter looked on.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Anthony Drazen, ``Hurlyburly'' has been opened up
somewhat. (A crucial act of violence not shown in the play is
portrayed in the movie.) The film nevertheless still captures the
play's claustrophobic sense of being trapped in a smoke-filled room
with people who might explode at any second.
</P>
<P>
   The film's close-up photography magnifies every reddened eyelid
and plume of cigarette smoke. After a while the images of
dissipated faces and the rhythm of the characters' aimless, ugly,
hard-boiled banter settles into a woozy, sodden tango of word and
image. These are people most of us would rather not be in the same
room with, but the movie shoves them in our faces.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble acting surpasses that of any other film this year.
Penn, his face swollen and crumpling, his voice rising in childish
hysteria, burrows so deeply into Eddie that he almost vomits his
character onto the screen. Spacey's cobralike Mickey is as slippery
and cool as Penn's Eddie is volatile, while Shandling's Artie is
the loathsome distillation of a particularly repulsive kind of
sleaze: think Larry Sanders without charm or scruples.
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri, in a heaving, tragic performance that matches Harvey
Keitel's stage original, finds the vestige of a soul under the
leathery skin of a stupid, compulsively violent thug with delusions
of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' has been called sexist because of its female
characters' slatternly eagerness to gratify these misogynists. Yet
each of the film's three women is capable of standing up for
herself. Ms. Wright brings a defensive sang-froid to Darlene, whose
dispassionate attitude toward sex drives Eddie into a frenzy. (In a
ghastly comic set piece, her refusal to choose between a French and
a Chinese restaurant sets him off.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan, muting her customary perkiness, finds a core of
pugnacious resilience under Bonnie's bleary-eyed dishevelment. Ms.
Paquin's Donna (the least credible of the three women) also has a
prickly edge of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   As it traces Eddie's downward spiral, ``Hurlyburly'' touches on
many themes. But above all, it is a contemplation of male
friendship and power that proposes the existence of an immutable
pecking order. As Mickey is to Eddie (superior, condescending, and
betraying), so Eddie is to Phil. Or as Mickey coldly assures Eddie,
``Phil is very safe, because no matter how far you manage to fall,
Phil will be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   In this bleak vision of male bonding, the quest for dominance
(or if not dominance, approval from above) is so all-consuming that
women are little more than trophies and bargaining chips. The war
between men and women, the movie proposes, is only an offshoot of a
larger and more deadly war: the one waged by men against
themselves.
</P>

COMMENTARY: ASSAD'S ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not since the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran has U.S. territory been so egregiously invaded as last week
_ and nobody in the distracted Clinton administration seems to
care.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, where the Syrian dictator Hafez Assad rigidly
controls the populace, tens of thousands massed in protest,
ostensibly about our bombing of Iraq. A selected part of the mob _
about 1,000 drawn from the ruling Baath Party _ was permitted to
march at night where demonstrators are never allowed to go: through
the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood, where the U.S. Embassy and the
ambassador's residence are located.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's mobsters, chanting ``down with America'' and bringing
large stones for the occasion, shattered windows and breached the
outer defenses of the embassy. The U.S. Marine guards fired tear
gas vainly as Syrian intruders scaled the walls and tore down the
U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   Unhindered by Assad's police, the mob then smashed the windows
of the residence of U.S. Ambassador Ryan Croker. The dictator's
supporters destroyed the ambassador's car, broke into the residence
and rampaged through the ground floor smashing everything in sight
and terrorizing his wife, Christine, who fled upstairs to take
refuge in a locked ``safe haven'' room that shielded her from
flying glass and intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mob withdrew, having expertly carried out its
assignment, and stoned the British Embassy on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital,'' wrote
the AP stringer, ``which is under tight security control, and
today's marches throughout downtown could not have occurred without
government approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's proof of Assad's complicity: Film crews accompanied the
invaders of our territory and Syria's official television proudly
showed the rapacious triumph.
</P>
<P>
   What was the response of the U.S. government to this outrage
against our diplomats and their families, our territorial
sovereignty and our embassy flag?
</P>
<P>
   ``Demarche-mallow,'' as one State Department hand privately
mocked our feeble reaction. Croker lodged a formal protest;
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering summoned Syria's
representative to listen to a stern lecture; and Syria's foreign
minister, pretending the demonstration was spontaneous, offered his
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   After getting $1.4 billion to harden embassies against
terrorists, doesn't anybody at Foggy Bottom want to secure
embassies against mobs sent by dictators? Is a striped-pants
complaint the most we can do in the face of such provocation?
Doesn't Madeleine Albright understand that State's pusillanimous
response broadcasts the weakness of American will?
</P>
<P>
   ``I all but called the Syrian ambassador a liar to his face,''
Pickering told me. ``We did get a public expression of
pseudo-apology. We demand and expect full compensation, which may
amount to a half-million dollars. The Syrian police, in our view,
joined the mob. This is not a trivial or a passing matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But State's response has been trivial; not even a recall of
ambassador or suspension of relations in the face of
state-sponsored terrorism. The rest of the Arab world fully
understands what signal Assad was sending them: he, and not Saddam
Hussein or Yasser Arafat, is the central actor in the region, and
is unafraid of twisting the U.S. paper tiger's tail.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's message to the White House is also unmistakable: Pay
attention to me.
</P>
<P>
   He despises Arafat and cannot abide the nine days of attention
given him at Wye, plus the presidential visit to Gaza. He hates
Saddam, too, and the new prestige conferred on him by Clinton's
pinprick-plus air strikes. Because he considers himself snubbed and
his Golan Heights claim marginalized, Assad escalates Hezbollah
attacks on Israelis in Syrian-occupied Lebanon and trashes the U.S.
Embassy in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Raleigh, N.C., an indignant Senate Foreign Relations
Chairman Jesse Helms said: ``This is where Clinton has brought us.
There's no respect for this country anymore. But the Senate won't
sit on its hands about this.'' He plans hearings on the Damascus
break-ins, perhaps in conjunction with Armed Services, when
Congress convenes.

   When Maya Bogdanow, 9, moved into a new bedroom, she wanted
exotic beaded curtains that glittered like rubies and sapphires in
front of her bed. ``My friend, she has them at her house,'' Maya
said. ``And I liked the idea. They're pretty. I can tie them back
any way I want. And they're noisy. You can hear them whenever
people come in.''
</P>
<P>
   So her parents, Larry Bogdanow, an architect, and Deborah
Shaffer, a filmmaker, scoured the city and finally found the
curtains at Little Rickie, a shop on the Lower East Side
specializing in vintage wares (three rows of beads, $11.95 each).
The beads' veiled mystery and privacy made their young daughter
feel like Scheherezade.
</P>
<P>
   When Rebecca Barrett, 16, wanted to summon blue skies and clouds
into her bedroom, her parents, Ron Barrett, an artist, and Barbara
Schubeck, a graphic designer, bought her two cans of paint _ one
blue, one white _ for $30, and left her alone to realize her
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   To a child, one of the sweetest and most enduring gifts is a
room of one's own. And as every parent knows, children are
sometimes their own best interior designers. When they ask for a
wall to draw on, a place to put their toys, a ladder to climb to a
loft, they are trying to become masters of their small universes _
usually a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a statement that a child wants to be autonomous and wants
to have control over the environment,'' said Dr. Barbara Scales,
who retired this year as the head teacher at the Child Studies
Center at the University of California at Berkeley and is an author
of ``Play at the Center of the Curriculum,'' a textbook
(Prentice-Hall, 1998). ``What the adult has to do is make it
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   By helping to design the room, Dr. Scales said, ``a child will
not only feel independent but will grow strong and be
independent.'' Parents still need to hover, of course. ``But you
want unobtrusive supervision,'' she said, ``because the moment the
adult comes in, the fantasy play will collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   A parent who designs a theme room for a child _ cowboys and
Indians, or Curious George _ risks stifling the child's
imagination. ``It's a fixed environment that kids tire of,'' said
Ro Logrippo, author of ``In My World: Designing Living and Learning
Environments for the Young'' (John Wylie &AMP; Sons, 1995). ``All too
soon it becomes the baby room.''
</P>
<P>
   But a child's needs change. The same girl who wanted her Beanie
Babies at her fingertips one year may want them on a high shelf the
next. A 4-year-old's loft bed is a secret hideaway for him and his
friends. Later, he may use it as a corner for solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that make children happy don't require extravagant
spending. No Biedermeier bureaus or Arts and Crafts rocking chairs.
No $5,000 trompe l'oeil murals. Here are nine innovative rooms,
many of them inexpensive and child-approved, whose design elements
were often as simple as a very large bulletin board or a few cans
of paint in a child's favorite colors. What was essential was
listening to the child's articulated (or somewhat inarticulated)
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   WALL OF STEEL
</P>
<P>
   How can a child go merrily through life without having a place
to put the spelling quiz with the perfect score or the shiny satin
ribbons awarded for track? Unlike cork boards, which require pins
that make holes, magnetic boards need only magnets, preserving
treasures for a child's notion of forever.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Callaway, 8, who lives in San Francisco, has a practical
mother. Barbara Callaway, a landscape architect, who bought a
3-by-5-foot piece of galvanized sheet metal that fit a door,
drilled four holes, inserted four screws and in a scant 30 minutes
made her son happy.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $30. Source: Goss Heating and Ventilation in San
Francisco; (415) 751-0393.
</P>
<P>
   SOPHISTICATED PINK
</P>
<P>
   Girls may love pink but not necessarily in a fluffy, ruffly way.
When Roberto Reichard, a petroleum engineer, and his wife, Jennifer
Kenny, a management consultant, bought a 1920s Spanish-style house
in San Francisco, they asked David Weingarten and Lucia Howard, of
Ace Architects in Oakland, to paint the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose motifs found in Spanish Colonial architecture _
squares related to the cross, the four-pointed star _ blown way
up,'' Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   But when their daughter, Julia Reichard, 4, looks up at the pink
and reddish-pink squares on her ceiling, she simply sees her
favorite colors done the way she likes them. ``Not froufrou,'' Ms.
Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $600 to paint the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   EVERY BEAR IN ITS PLACE
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad tried counting them, but he lost track,'' Elizabeth
Foster, 9, said of her stuffed animals. Her father, Jonathan
Foster, a New York architect, stopped counting at 106, of which
roughly half are Beanie Babies. They were sloppy little squatters
in a room belonging to a child who said, ``I like having it neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is. Her father designed a home for the animals _ a
30-foot shelf that's 6{ inches deep, wraps around three walls, and
has a molding edge so the animals don't fall off. To reach them,
Elizabeth uses a metal grabber.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $250 to build the shelf; $7.99 for the grabber at a
hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   DRAW ON THE WALL? OF COURSE
</P>
<P>
   When 4-year-old Alexander Roche's mother, Isabel Marcal, who
works at the United Nations, is cooking, he can hang out in the
kitchen and draw on a wall _ with washable markers. The wall and a
sliding pocket door are covered in Greensteel white marker board,
which is steel with a porcelain coating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double whammy,'' said Robin Osler, the Manhattan
architect who suggested the specially treated steel, which doubles
as a magnetic board. ``Isabel can write notes to herself, and
Alexander can draw on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost: about $440 to cover wall and pocket door. Greensteel:
(800) 766-4204.

   The new version of the 1949 kiddie favorite gives the
giant-ape-on-the-loose-in-L.A. story line an eco-conscious gloss.
This time, the 15-foot gorilla isn't shipped over from his African
homeland to headline a cheap vaudeville show; he's shipped over to
be the star attraction at a nature conservancy park. It's not
irresponsible drunks but evil poachers (Rade Sherbedgia _ who used
to call himself Serbedzija _ and Peter Firth) who get Big Joe all
riled-up and loose on Hollywood Boulevard this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is the compassionate white hunter/zoologist and
Charlize Theron is the beautiful white jungle girl who are Joe's
best friends. She and Joe both lost their mothers when they were
little primates _ courtesy of those same evil poachers, in a
sequence that owes a lot to Spielberg's ``The Lost World'' _ and
their bond, as fundamentally hokey as it may be, is genuinely
touching.
</P>
<P>
   Joe himself is a pretty cuddly creation. Slicker than the
stop-motion puppet created in 1949 by Willis O'Brien and Ray
Harryhausen (the latter, along with original ``Joe'' heroine Terry
Moore, makes a nice little cameo appearance in the new movie), the
new 2,000-pound gorilla is a state-of-the-art creation. Designed by
five-time Oscar winner Rick Baker, who has excelled at the hairy
thing in the likes of ``Greystoke'' and ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
the new Joe is a seamlessly expressive blend of animatronics,
computer graphics and guys in monkey suits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in the first film, it's impossible to believe that
this lovable lumberer actually frightens the citizens of Los
Angeles while he avoids a small army of cops. Unlike O'Brien's more
indelible creation King Kong, Joe has never generated the tragedy
and terror that his big brother unleashed. He still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Ron Underwood, who made ``City Slickers.'' He
does his best to prevent this thoroughly Disneyfied remake from
seeming more silly than it is. Of course, it wouldn't be ``Mighty
Joe Young'' if it wasn't goofy, so it's just as well that Underwood

   BRINGING THE OUTDOORS IN
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she's preparing for a life of homelessness,'' Ron
Barrett mused, when asked why his older daughter, Becky, 16,
painted drifting clouds on the wall of her Manhattan bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. ``I like being outdoors,'' Becky said.
</P>
<P>
   If she couldn't do it literally, she was able to do it
figuratively. Last year, she painted the wall in less than half a
day, subtly fading the blue as it descends from the ceiling to the
floor. This summer, she went to a sailing camp in the British
Virgin Islands, where every night, she slept on the bow of a
51-foot boat under a canopy of stars. ``The next step,'' she said,
``is putting glow in the dark stars on the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $30 for two half-gallon cans of paint, blue and white.
</P>
<P>
   VEILED SLEEP
</P>
<P>
   When Maya Bogdanow asked for a sleeping alcove painted pale
lilac in the rear and pale blue in the front, with a beaded
curtain, her parents obliged. Bogdanow gave her paint samples to
choose from, and Ms. Shaffer bought three curtains with glinting
plastic bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the sound of it,'' Maya said. ``When I move my
blankets, the beads move.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $46 for two gallons of paint, and about $36 for three
boxes of beaded curtains, each with a 36-inch track. Little Rickie,
49{ First Ave. (Third Street); (212) 505-6467.
</P>
<P>
   MURPHY NURSERY
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot was a bit of a surprise,'' Richard Fernau said of his
youngest son, who will be 2 in a week. In 1996, when Fernau, an
architect in Berkeley, Calif., and his wife, Sarah Cunniff, a
lawyer, discovered that she was pregnant, they improvised a nursery
from what would have been a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-by-8-foot room, Fernau designed what he calls ``the
Murphy nursery,'' a room where each wall is a niche. One holds a
pullout drawer that doubles as a crib, another has a bunk bed and a
third has a sink. (The fourth wall is the door.)
</P>
<P>
   The crib, plywood with a perforated metal side, slides in and
out. The shelf above the crib was designed to flip up, fastening
onto hinges, so that Eliot could stand up in the crib without
bumping his head. The shelf is also a changing table, with shallow
shelves above.
</P>
<P>
   The bed is 5 feet long and 30 inches wide. When Eliot was a year
old, he moved from the crib to the bed. To make sure he wouldn't
fall out of the bed, yet also be able to stand up in it, Fernau
designed a sliding pocket panel 30 inches high; it's hidden in the
wall. There is storage above the crib, under the bed and in the
crib itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $1,500 to build the wall with the crib; $5,000 for the two
niches with the crib, bed and storage space; $8,000 for the entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   TEEN-AGE MEMORIES
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Feigenbaum, 16, transformed the fireplace in her bedroom
into an altar, a floor-to-ceiling architectural shrine to
teen-age-hood, New York City style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the things I like to remember,'' she said. First,
there's romance: red roses, carefully preserved and darkening at
the edges _ gifts from her boyfriend. Then there's Manhattan,
revealed in antique metal signs: Hires Root Beer, Nectar Tea. ``I
collect them because I love the city,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   A bleached animal skull is a memento of a trip to Arizona, a
ceramic elephant a gift from her grandfather ``just before he
died.'' Then, next to a glass jar of quarters, there are three
chrysanthemums _ one white, one yellow, one burgundy _ floating in
a silver bowl.
</P>
<P>
   TO READ OR DANGLE
</P>
<P>
   At age 6, Molly Solomon became what educators call ``a reluctant
reader,'' said her mother, Kathy Solomon, the owner of Tootsie's, a
children's bookstore in Manhattan. ``She loved being read to,''
Mrs. Solomon said, ``and was so attached to me that she thought if
she read on her own, I wouldn't read to her anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly, now 9, solved her own problem. If she had a special place
to read, she said, it might inspire her. What Molly wanted was a
treehouse but settled for its urban substitute: a walk-in closet
transformed into a reading alcove.
</P>
<P>
   The closet is 5 feet wide, 7 feet deep and 10 feet high, and has
a louvered door. A carpenter built a platform 4{ feet above the
floor, and since Molly likes to imagine herself a mermaid, Concetta
Pereira, an artist, painted the closet to resemble an underwater
grotto.
</P>
<P>
   The alcove worked. ``Within six months, Molly was reading past
her grade level,'' Mrs. Solomon said. (She still reads to her
daughter every night.) But when Molly gets restless, she can hang
upside down like a bat, dangling from the clothes rack that the
carpenter forgot to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $100 for the platform; $500 for the artist's painting.
</P>
<P>
   LOFT LADDER
</P>
<P>
   With the ceiling at 11 feet 7 inches, there was no place to go
but up when Valerie Boom, a Manhattan architect, designed bedrooms
for her children, Maxine, 8, and Henry, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Each child now has a play loft that starts 7 feet 6 inches from
the floor. The lofts are carpeted, and each is furnished with a
single mattress for sleepovers. To reach the lofts, Maxine and
Henry use wooden library ladders attached to steel poles, which
they roll to the edge of the loft, then grab a steel bar on the
edge of the loft and toss themselves over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever fallen down,'' Ms. Boom said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost to construct the bedrooms and lofts: $11,000. Oak library
(or loft) ladders start at $450, and tracks at $5 a running foot.

DELAY URGES SENATE TO HOLD CLINTON TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay urged the Senate on
Wednesday not to short circuit the impeachment process without
holding a trial that examines all the evidence in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any review of the evidence, it is premature to be
talking about a deal or short circuiting the process,'' the Texas
Republican said in a statement aimed at slowing talks of a
compromise that would let President Clinton serve out his term.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was released after five of DeLay's House
colleagues _ Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New
York, Mike Castle of Delaware and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania _
who voted for impeachment last week announced they now favor
censure as an alternative to the Senate removing Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay fought last week to block any censure resolution from
being offered on the House floor, claiming that impeachment was the
only remedy permitted by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, DeLay said the reason the House adopted
articles of impeachment charging the president with perjury and
obstruction of justice ``was due to overwhelming evidence'' in the
case. He claimed that much of that evidence is locked up in the
House office building and has never been publicly aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before people look to cut a deal with the White House or with
their surrogates who will seek to influence the process, it is my
hope that (senators) will spend plenty of time in the evidence
room,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   If senators take the time to reflect on that evidence, he added,
then the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton might just ``appear out
of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to comment publicly on DeLay's
statement. But privately, some aides expressed anger over his
suggestion _ which was also made during the House hearings on
impeachment _ that there may be evidence of other wrongdoing beyond
what the president has been charged with in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they've got another charge to make against the president,
then they ought to say so rather than trying to claim that there's
some secret information of some sort that's really damning to the
president,'' said one close Clinton aide. ``That's really a cheap
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's unclear how many senators are willing to sign off
on censure as an alternative to a Senate trial, a number of
Democrats and Republicans have suggested over the last few days
that any attempt to convict him of the charges leveled by the House
would fall short of the required two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have been polling their own caucuses.
Aides for Daschle have indicated that most of the Democrats and a
fair number of Republicans don't support the idea of removing
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott aides say he is also putting together an advisory group to
help guide senators as they begin their historic proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still uncertain as to whether the senators will be
able to reach a bipartisan compromise involving censure or some
other punishment that would allow the president to finish out his
term.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate ends up taking the House's charges against Clinton
to trial, it would be only the second time in history that a
president has faced impeachment proceedings. The first was in 1868
when President Andrew Johnson was impeached. He was acquitted in
his Senate trial by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said on MSNBC Wednesday that the
Senate should at least start the trial process before senators make
up their minds about the case.
</P>
<P>
   He said members at any time during the process could decide with
a simple majority of 51 votes to dismiss the case or approve
censure or some other alternative punishment short of removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., also said Wednesday that he believes
it would be a mistake not to start the trial. Smith is among
several GOP senators trying to hold off any move toward censure.
But he acknowledged that censure is one of several options that
could emerge as a trial proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay and other Republican conservatives are hoping
Clinton will resign before the Senate begins it proceedings, Vice
President Al Gore reiterated Tuesday that resignation is not even a
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) will definitely not resign. ... He is more likely
to get hit by a meteor than he is to make a decision to resign,''
Gore said in an interview with Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Polls over the past few days have continued to indicate that
most Americans remain solidly behind Clinton and against
resignation. They also show that support for Republican lawmakers
at an all-time low because most Americans believe that they are out
to get Clinton for purely partisan reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveys have alarmed some Republican leaders outside
Washington. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson said he doubted Clinton would be impeached and
called on Republicans to put it behind them and get back to their
legislative agenda.

HOLIDAY FOR STRINGS: AN ANNUAL CHRISTMAS SEMINAR FOR YOUNG
MUSICIANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Calif., Md., Ill.)  (nk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last 30 years concertgoers in New York,
particularly those with an abiding interest in the future of
musical performance, have observed a tradition that has become
nearly as intrinsic to the holiday season as tree lighting, window
displays and sidewalk Santas. On Christmas Eve a few thousand
listeners make their way to Carnegie Hall to hear the young
participants in the New York String Orchestra Seminar perform the
works they have been studying during a 10-day series of classes,
coaching sessions and rehearsals at the New School. Many
concertgoers return a few days later to hear a second program.
(This year's is on Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that someone on the stage will be heard from
again is high: Violinists Cho-Liang Lin, Gil Shaham, Nadia
Salerno-Sonnenberg, Pamela Frank and Maria Bachmann; violist Paul
Neubauer, and cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Matt Haimovitz attended the
seminar in their student days. So did three of the four players in
each of the Muir, Orion, St. Lawrence and Ying Quartets, and
hundreds of musicians who now play in orchestras and chamber
ensembles in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the defining moments for me as a teen-ager,''
said Ma, who attended the seminar in 1971, when he was 16. ``The
passion of people your own age is very important. It puts you in
touch with a larger world, beyond schooling and everything else you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lure of these concerts for their first 25 years was
Alexander Schneider, the violinist who directed the seminar and
conducted the orchestra from the time the project was started in
1968 until his death in 1993. Schneider, who had been a member of
the Budapest String Quartet, the legendary ensemble that flourished
between the 1930s and the late 1960s, imparted to his students the
expressive style that prevailed when he was young but that had
largely died out as interpretive tastes came to favor literalism
over subjectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Under Schneider's baton, musicians from 15 to 22 were able to
recapture the charm of that style, and the violinist and conductor
Jaime Laredo, who took over the program after Schneider's death,
has preserved that approach to a great degree. This year's concerts
are dedicated to the memory of Schneider, who was known as Sasha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but bring something from him to these
performances,'' said Laredo, ``although there are ways we differ a
lot. Beauty of sound wasn't that important to him, and if something
wasn't precise, it was all right. But in terms of the dynamics and
articulation and his way of making music come alive, that's where I
got so much from him. He had an extraordinary love of music
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Laredo's programming, like Schneider's, centers on the Classical
and Romantic repertory, although he has included a few
comparatively easygoing contemporary works, among them pieces by
Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and George Walker. He points out, however,
that although the repertory is mostly standard, most of the young
musicians in the orchestra have never performed it before.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's program is devoted entirely to Mozart and
includes the ``Marriage of Figaro'' Overture, Symphony No. 35 and
Piano Concerto No. 24, with Peter Serkin as the soloist. Monday's
concert includes Prokofiev's ``Classical'' Symphony, Elgar's
Introduction and Allegro for Strings (for which the Guarneri
Quartet joins the orchestra) and a Vivaldi Concerto for Four
Violins. The soloists, all seminar alumni, are the concertmasters
of four American orchestras: Martin Chalifour, from the Los Angeles
Philharmonic; Herbert Greenberg, from the Baltimore Symphony;
Malcolm Lowe, from the Boston Symphony, and William Preucil, from
the Cleveland Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar, which is sponsored by Carnegie Hall and the New
School, is like the music world in general, and music schools in
particular, in its balance of competitiveness and collegiality. It
is open to players living or studying in the United States,
although they need not be Americans: this year's class includes
students from Helsinki, Beijing, Jerusalem and Sapporo, Japan.
Every year more than 250 players audition for 60 full scholarships,
which cover the course, food and housing. After the seminar,
participants receive photographs from the sessions, a list of one
another's addresses and a periodic newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Auditions are held each fall in New York, Boston, Chicago,
Cleveland, Rochester and San Francisco. Juries in each city listen
to the applicants, but the only one to hear them all is Isidore
Cohen, a violinist who played in the Juilliard String Quartet and
the Beaux-Arts Trio and has coached at the seminar for the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sasha used to do the traveling,'' Cohen said, ``and I think
Jaime did some, but he was too busy, and he needed someone to do it
who knew how Sasha worked, so I agreed. At the auditions, we have
the musicians play the music that we are going to perform at the
two concerts. We want to see how motivated they are, whether
they're interested enough to work out the difficult spots. And we
ask them to play two solo works of a contrasting nature.''
</P>
<P>
   When the musicians arrive in New York (this year's seminar began
on Saturday) they are given a schedule that runs virtually around
the clock. A typical day begins with an early breakfast, followed
by a three-hour orchestra rehearsal. Three more hours of orchestral
work follow lunch, and after dinner the players regroup as chamber
ensembles for three hours of formal coaching with Laredo; Cohen;
Isaac Stern; Felix Galimir; members of the Guarneri, Juilliard and
Orion String Quartets, and several soloists and orchestra
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the day ends after the chamber music class, but most
of the musicians continue playing music into the night. They also
have to find time to practice their orchestral music, not to
mention the music they were working on with their own teachers at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 days we practically didn't get any sleep,'' said Lin,
the violinist, who participated in the seminar in 1977 and 1978 and
has returned in recent years as a member of the coaching faculty.
``We stayed up playing chamber music and having jam sessions until
2 or 3 in the morning. When you're 17 or 18, you don't think about
fatigue. You just have a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   The seminar was started in 1968, the year after the Budapest
Quartet disbanded. Frank Salomon, Schneider's manager, had heard
about a seminar that the quartet offered in Buffalo in which the
ensemble members coached young quartets during the day and led
Vivaldi concertos at night. Schneider had also recently done a
coaching seminar on Long Island, and it occurred to Salomon that
Schneider's pedagogical leanings might be harnessed for 10 days of
coaching around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Salomon and Schneider already had an association with the
New School, where they directed a concert series that has recently
been renamed the Schneider Concerts. And when they told Isaac Stern
about the idea, Carnegie Hall became a co-sponsor of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers established an age limit of 15 to 22 for that
first seminar, until they heard a 13-year-old girl play the violin.
``I got very upset about it and said that I didn't want to take
responsibility for having a 13-year-old girl in a hotel in New York
for 10 days,'' said Salomon, who still runs the seminar. ``But
everyone insisted, and she was so talented. So I wrote to her
parents, and in the end she did participate. And that was Laurie
Carney, who is now in the American String Quartet.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The program costs $180,000 a year (up from $70,000 the first
year), or about $3,000 for each student, a third of which is
covered by grants from a foundation that Schneider set up to
support various causes, mostly related to education and Israel.
Private and corporate donations and foundation grants cover part of
the budget as well. And Salomon noted that the coaches work for
what he described as ``honorariums, not fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salomon, who is also the seminar's principal fund-raiser,
said those grants had shrunk considerably over the last 15 years.
Government support, too, has all but vanished. The National
Endowment for the Arts, which in past years gave the seminar
$30,000 a year, has reduced its grant to $3,000. Salomon is trying
to raise $270,000, enough to cover 30 scholarships for 3 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it isn't easy,'' he said. ``Less and less money is being
given to classical music, unless you're the Metropolitan Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the seminar has not changed much since 1969,
but the transition from Schneider to Laredo has brought a change of
atmosphere. At rehearsals, Schneider had an explosive temperament,
which few seem to have taken personally. Ma, when enumerating the
most valuable aspects of the program, included ``being coached and
yelled at by Sasha Schneider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he definitely yelled a lot,'' said Ms. Bachmann, the
violinist, who attended in 1981. ``He wanted it louder all the
time. But I think what he was asking for was intensity of feeling
rather than volume of sound. He struck me as someone who had an
aura that inspired people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin found himself more directly in the line of fire. He was a
16-year-old student at the Juilliard School when he auditioned for
the seminar, and to his surprise, Schneider made him concertmaster
of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a concert with the Juilliard Orchestra the day of the
first session,'' Lin said. ``So when I showed up for the first
rehearsal with Sasha, I was two hours late. They were working on
Stravinsky's `Apollo,' which has a huge violin solo. When I
arrived, he growled, `Sit down,' in that gravelly voice of his, and
within a few seconds, the orchestra reached the violin solo. He
coached me in that solo for half an hour, in front of the
orchestra. That was a baptism by fire, and I figured that if I
could survive Sasha Schneider, I could do well in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider was not the only coach who could be temperamental, or
whose anger had a transformative effect on his students. Another
was Schneider's brother Mischa, who had been the cellist in the
Budapest Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mischa Schneider was an important influence on me,'' Ma said.
``And our relationship started in a funny way. I was a rowdy kid,
and I was fooling around when he was coaching us. And he actually
left the room. He was hurt, not because we weren't paying respect
to him, but because he felt we were taking music that he cared
about too lightly. That was a revelation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the calmer atmosphere had a negative effect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Lin said. ``Jaime tends to get his results
through encouragement, persuasion and cajoling, whereas Sasha's
style was basically volcanic. Both ways work.''

 &HT;    Atlanta loses Super Show to Las Vegas for 3 years
 &HT;    By Susan Harte and Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Super Show, a sporting goods trade show that
annually brings 100,000 people and bestows a $70 million economic
impact on Atlanta, is leaving town for at least three years. After
its late-January stint here in 1999 and 2000, it will be held in
Las Vegas in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Graveline, executive director of the Georgia World Congress
Center, was not surprised that Atlanta will lose its largest
convention. ``They have been trying to find a place to go. They
have been excellent. They have worked with us (to overcome
Atlanta's space problems) for several years. If there is a surprise
for me, it is Las Vegas. It is hard to take a show this size and
find a place to put it. I understand that Las Vegas is stringing
together several facilities to accommodate the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The news follows at least a year's worth of conflicting reports
about how long the convention _ which has been in Atlanta since it
began in 1985 _ would stay here. Earlier reports indicated the show
might go to Orlando in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show made the decision to leave Atlanta despite the
anticipated approval of an expansion of the Georgia World Congress
Center. The proposed $225 million expansion of the GWCC _ where big
conventions such as the Super Show are housed _ would add 450,000
square feet of space, giving the convention center 1.4 million
square feet of meeting space.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion would put the GWCC on a par with similar
facilities in Orlando and Las Vegas, both major competitors for
lucrative trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest trade shows are pushing the limits of space
at the GWCC.
</P>
<P>
   Comdex, the nation's largest computer trade show, held its last
meeting here in June 1997. The show, which attracted about 100,000
to its spring meeting here, moved permanently to Chicago. Comdex
holds its larger winter show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Graveline said Wednesday the convention bureau feels fairly
optimistic about winning approval for the GWCC expansion, ``but we
still have to receive legislative approval this upcoming session.''
If approved this session of the Legislature, the expansion would be
completed by mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the earliest the Super Show could return to Atlanta would be
2004, according to John Riddle, president of the North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association wants to alternate locations between eastern and
western parts of the country, Riddle said Wednesday. The SGMA will
solicit letters of interest from several cities east and west of
the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, Orlando and New Orleans will be invited to submit
proposals for the third week of January in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Riddle said a decision will be made by June.
</P>
<P>
   Although the winner will be determined primarily by convention
and exhibition space, amenities such as hotel-rate breaks, low
airfares, transportation and available entertainment will influence
the decision, said Jo Ann Worthington, a member of Meeting
Professionals International, a Dallas-based trade group of
convention planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space is the critical thing. You also have to have the ability
to house conventioneers. And things to do in the vicinity of the
trade show are very important,'' said Worthington, who is also
associate vice president of the Los Angeles Convention Bureau.

 &HT;    Too much rides on the merger wave
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Exxon and Mobil, $86 billion. Travelers Group and
Citicorp, $73 billion. NationsBank and BankAmerica, $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the megamergers announced or completed
in 1998, a record year for such deals. To understand why it's
happened, Fortune (Jan. 11) says, ``Just follow the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has more financial capital than it knows what to do
with,'' says the magazine. ``This extraordinary abundance of money
available for investment has fueled this greatest-ever merger wave.
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this money, there is too much of everything: steel,
paper, chemicals, cloth, airline seats, cars, gold, silver and
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overcapacity leads to brutal price competition, which leads to
consolidation,'' Fortune explains.
</P>
<P>
   Still more forecasts
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Dec. 28/Jan. 4) bases its double edition on the
theme of ``shifting to a lower gear.'' With profits under
increasing pressure, investors will have to pick their spots in an
economy marked by ``weaker growth'' and a market without ``lofty
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (January) says the worst thing about the year-end
rally was probably the realization for many investors that they
missed a ``spectacular buying opportunity'' in the 1998 correction.
The magazine lists its stock picks and cautions investors about
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Money (January) says economic growth and profits will slow in
1999, but low interest rates will prevent a serious recession and
help send stocks still higher _ including 10,000 for the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be an ostrich
</P>
<P>
   In its year-end double issue, The Economist (Jan. 1) asks, ``Can
anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are still some important issues we continue
to take for granted, which may be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We question whether it is really right to assume, as many do,
that nuclear weapons will never be used by (nation) states, that
democracy will continue to spread . . . that shares (of stock) are
always the best long-term investment.''
</P>
<P>
   On nickels and dimes
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered what it's like to live on the minimum
wage, journalist Barbara Ehrenreich tells you in Harper's Magazine
(January).
</P>
<P>
   As a waitress, she learns some of the worst experiences are not
the loss of what money can buy, but how much workers can abuse each
other when they cross over from employee to manager status.
</P>
<P>
   The most redeeming feature of low-wage work, she says, is ``the
camaraderie of people who are, in almost all cases, far too smart
and funny and caring for the work they do and the wages they're
paid.

AMBITIOUS MAYOR PUTS STAMP ON MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Christmas came early to Moscow's storefronts and
display windows this year, and Vyacheslav Mironov's tiny computer
goods store was no exception, thanks to Moscow's Santa police.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Russia celebrates Christmas according to the
Orthodox Christian tradition on Jan. 7, Yury M. Luzhkov, Moscow's
powerful and ambitious mayor, ordered businesses to put up their
decorations early, lest the capital seem lacking in holiday cheer.
</P>
<P>
   A huge, roly-poly Santa grins next to the frowning statue of the
poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. Crinkly-nosed Kris Kringles smile down
from posters and store shelves. Someone from the city government
even appeared in Mironov's shop to ensure his Western-style Santa
Claus and cheery reindeer were in place.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's ambitious municipal projects have earned Moscow the
reputation as an island of prosperity in turmoil-stricken Russia
and transformed its mayor into a favorite to succeed Boris N.
Yeltsin as president.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Luzhkov stand out is his interest in the little
things, such as where businessmen put their Santas.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has reshaped the Russian capital by combining elements
of the free market and the Soviet-style command economy. His city
government has a hand in much of Moscow's business activity, then
uses the proceeds to finance grand architectural projects and stage
attention-grabbing events, such as the city's gala 850th birthday
party in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the ailing Yeltsin's power wanes, Luzhkov has stepped up
efforts to attract national attention to his can-do leadership, his
Czar-like demeanor and engineer's grasp of microscopic detail. He
promotes a public persona that exudes competence, confidence, and
the-buck-stops-here decisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   These are the qualities, Luzhkov says, that Russians crave after
years of crisis and Yeltsin's absentee leadership. Luzhkov has yet
to declare himself a candidate for the Kremlin. But Saturday, at
the founding congress of ``Fatherland,'' his new political party,
the mayor promised to do for the country what he has done for
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will drag Russia out of the morass,'' he said, his round
face etched in its trademark Edward G. Robinson scowl. ``Gentlemen,
the experiment is over.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when euphoria over the defeat of Communism and
Russia's opening up to the West has faded into disillusionment,
humiliation, and despair, Luzhkov talks about restoring national
pride.
</P>
<P>
   He is a noncommunist nationalist who has spoken out against
racism and anti-Semitism. He is a teetotaling sports enthusiast and
an Orthodox Christian who displays his tolerance for other faiths
by inviting religious leaders to all of his political functions.
With his weekly trips to construction sites and mall openings,
Luzhkov portrays himself as a concerned city manager who has given
something back to the people who elected him.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow voters thanked him in 1996 by electing him to a second
four-year term with more than 90 percent of the vote. His
generosity beyond Moscow is vast. Luzhkov has played the role of a
concerned head of state, bailing out bankrupt Russian hockey teams
and crisis-struck Russian regions, even providing garbage trucks
for the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   It is a resume that none of his likely competitors _ Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky or
Alexander Lebed, the retired general and recently elected Siberian
governor _ can match. Polls indicate that Luzhkov would beat any of
the three in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Luzhkov) is definitely the person to beat,'' said Michael
McFaul, a Stanford professor and a leading expert on Russian
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But first, McFaul and other analysts say, Luzhkov must overcome
several obstacles. Chief among these is the resentment in a poor
land toward the rich capital, and he is the ultimate Muscovite.
When Luzhkov campaigned for Lebed's opponent in Krasnoyarsk
gubernatorial elections in April, Lebed won the most votes in
districts where the Moscow mayor gave speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more serious problem is that Luzhkov's can-do
reputation is based on the boom his city enjoyed until this summer.
But then came the August collapse of Russia's financial system.
Hundreds of thousands of Muscovites suddenly found themselves out
of work as businesses went bust and foreign investors fled.
Moscow's prosperous image began to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The city has had difficulty paying its debts, and some critics
think that Luzhkov is in a race against time. Elections are
scheduled for June of 2000, but Yeltsin could die before that,
forcing an early vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any candidate, Luzhkov needs early elections,
because he realizes that the Moscow miracle is ending,'' says
Andrei Piontkowski, a Moscow political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the city remains a showcase for the brand of capitalism
Luzhkov has been building since 1992, when Yeltsin appointed him
mayor and he began transforming Moscow from a drab, gray Soviet
population center to a gleaming capital with world-class ambitions
and Western-style amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Under Luzhkov's direction, buildings have been scrubbed and
painted, roads have been paved, and dozens of sweeping
architectural projects have been completed. Among these are the
$300 million reconstruction of the Church of Christ the Savior,
which was demolished by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, and a
cavernous $100 million underground shopping mall next to the
Kremlin, under the square where Soviet tanks once paraded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Luzhkov has rejected the anti-Soviet
principles proposed by Yeltsin's reformist governments during the
past six years. Instead of restructuring Moscow's Communist-era
industry and encouraging the independence of private business,
Luzhkov's government has heavily intervened to prop up the city's
industry. But his showcase projects, bailouts of automakers AZLK
and ZiL, have cost the city dearly while failing to yield
definitive results.
</P>
<P>
   While Luzhkov preaches respect for ethnic diversity, Moscow
police enforce draconian Soviet-era residence restrictions on
migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia. Although these rules
go against Russia's 1993 constitution, police routinely arrest,
beat, and extort money from dark-skinned people, according to New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's hard-line foreign policy posture also contrasts with
the generally lenient line of Yeltsin's presidency. Luzhkov demands
that the Ukrainian naval port of Sevastopol should be returned to
Russia. He proposes a political union with Serbia. He condemns
citizenship laws in Latvia limiting rights for Russian speakers as
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   And Luzhkov has lashed out at the Yeltsin policies that resulted
in shady insider privatization deals. These allowed the creation of
a corrupt class of ``oligarchs'' whose murky business empires
thrived while the country suffered.
</P>
<P>
   But Luzhkov's critics charge that his system is not much better.
Early in his six-year rule as mayor, Luzhkov won exemption for his
city from a federal program to sell off state-owned industrial
holdings. Moscow kept ownership over public property.
</P>
<P>
   Using this control as leverage, Luzhkov has changed the city
government into a multibillion dollar real estate and industrial
empire, with its own television and cable stations, newspapers, an
oil refinery, and a controlling share in more than 180 other
enterprises. And what the city does not own in Moscow, it controls,
thanks to its firm grip on all municipal land and its cozy
relationship with the holding company AFK Sistema, which the weekly
newspaper Novaya Gazeta recently called ``one of the biggest
empires in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had money and power in the hands of thieves for
years,'' says Yury Schekochikhin, a liberal lawmaker who has
investigated corruption in Luzhkov's administration. ``Luzhkov's
administration means money and power in the hands of bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the city's dual role as chief regulator and
leading entrepreneur has fostered cronyism, discouraged
competition, and helped make Moscow the world's third most
expensive place to do business after Tokyo and Hong Kong. Business
executives tell dark tales of harassment by tax police and fire
safety inspectors for those who buck the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moscow economy is terribly bureacratic and regimented, and
the result of that is massive corruption,'' Yegor Gaidar, a leading
liberal economist and a former acting prime minister, said in a
recent article. ``Everyone who has had anything to do with the
Moscow municipal structures knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   But few people dare to come out and say it. Luzhkov takes anyone
who does to court. City hall says he has won 42 defamation
lawsuits, one of them against Gaidar for writing that article.
Local reporters take note and give Luzhkov a wide birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishing something negative about Luzhkov is impossible in
the Russian press,'' says Piontkowski. ``The next day they'll shut
off your plumbing.''

US ORDERS THREE CUBAN DIPLOMATS TO UN TO LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States has ordered the expulsion of three
Cuban diplomats after accusing them of participating in a Cuban spy
ring that infiltrated the US military and plotted the bombing of a
Florida airfield, according to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Wednesday the three Cuban envoys, stationed at
the Cuban mission to the United Nations, have until Monday to leave
the country. They said two other New York-based Cuban diplomats
linked to the Miami operation have already left the country.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats were expelled for ``activities incompatible with
their status as members of the United Nations,'' said State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. ``This came to light as a
result of evidence the FBI collected on a Miami-based ring of Cuban
spies in September,'' added another State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban spy network, led by a Cuban military captain named
Manuel Viramontes, produced detailed reports for Havana on US
combat readiness, air and naval maneuvers, and other activities by
the US Southern Command, which is responsible for managing US
military operations in Latin America. In the largest intelligence
crackdown since the 1959 Cuban revolution, federal agents arrested
10 Cubans on Sept. 13. Seized in the raid were three laptop
computers, radio communication equipment, and a computer disk with
a coded reference to Fidel Castro and plans to sabotage an
unidentified aircraft hangar.
</P>
<P>
   White House and State Department officials declined to provide
details on the role of the Cuban diplomats _ identified as Eduardo
Martinez Borbonez, Roberto Arzana Paez, and Gonzalo Fernandez
Garay. Unconfirmed wire service reports identified them as
``paymasters,'' ``couriers'' or ``case officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States decided to act after the Cuban mission ignored
a written request on Monday from Washington to explain the Cubans'
role in the affair. The United States sent another letter to the
Cuban mission Wednesday demanding that the diplomats leave by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban mission to the UN has long had a troubled relationship
with the United States. Since 1982, 12 Cubans have been expelled
from the mission, Cuba's only diplomatic post in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three Cuban diplomats were thrown out of the United
States after one of them punched a New York City police officer
during a fight with anti-Castro protesters outside the Cuban
mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The others, including a Cuban diplomat filmed by a Miami
television station while meeting an FBI double agent at a New York
restaurant in 1992, were expelled for ``activities inconsistent
with their diplomatic duties.'' They were accused of spying.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans' chief targets were the Boca Chica Naval Air Station
in Key West; MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa; and the US Southern
Command. One of the suspects, Antonio Guerrero, was a mechanic at
the Key West Naval base.
</P>
<P>
   The group had also successfully infiltrated Miami anti-Castro
exile community. Rene Gonzalez, a Cuban exile who defected from
Cuba in 1990, was embraced by two prominent anti-Castro Cuban exile
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at the Boca Chica Naval Air Station in a 1940s
crop duster, Gonzalez has worked as a pilot for Brothers to the
Rescue, an anti-Castro group that searches for Cuban boat people en
route to Miami, and the Cuban Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban mission had no comment.

BAD TIMES NOW, BETTER TIMES AHEAD FOR FEMALE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days before Christmas is an inappropriate time time for a
lesson in basic Darwinism.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine being a player, coach, or other employee of the
American Basketball League, because from everything I've been
hearing Tuesday's demise of the women's professional league was not
exactly something everyone concerned saw coming. I cannot imagine
going to bed one night with a job and awakening to discover that
your world had just fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   My heart goes out to the players, particularly, because there is
more to being a female professional basketball player in this
country than simply being an accomplished athlete. These women are
crusaders and standard-bearers for female athletes of all
description. You can call it an athletic version of Ya-Ya
Sisterhood, if you like. These woman have been playing to satisfy
themselves, to put food on the table, and to prove a point.
</P>
<P>
   That point is that women can play basketball very well and that
theirs is a game with its own essence and own specific
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the beginning that the harsh dictates of
modern sports economics had doomed this league to a quixotic
status. Experts in the field said, almost without exception, that
the ABL had more quality players than the rival WNBA, whose last
three letters speak to an unbeatable corporate might. It didn't
matter. The ABL had a paltry TV contract, and thus has became the
Little Engine That Couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Just examine the facts. The WNBA, with a 30-game summertime
schedule, has lucrative contracts with NBC, ESPN, and Lifetime. The
ABL, playing a 44-game traditional wintertime schedule, was going
to be seen only 14 times on Fox. CBS was going to do two playoff
games. Better players or not, that was the ABL's lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so may we step back a minute? As sad as this day is for the
principals, is it not possible that something good can come from
all this? Please, now. Doesn't simple common sense tell us that
having two leagues competing for talent in a marginal sports
setting was lunacy? Having two women's leagues in the same sport in
this country _ even if their seasons did not overlap _ was madness.
</P>
<P>
   You may not feel that way if you adopt the view that the feisty
ABL, which started a year earlier than the WNBA, was somehow more
virtuous. This is now a clear triumph for the bully with superior
resources, and we in America traditionally love the underdog. To
make an au courant analogy from ``You've Got Mail,'' the WNBA is
the aggressive conglomerate Fox &AMP; Sons Book Store and the ABL is
Meg Ryan's adorable Shop Around The Corner. The Big Guy won in the
movie, and the Big Guy wins here. The Big Guy almost always wins.
</P>
<P>
   But the end result of all this will be a strengthened women's
game. Or is it possible I'm missing something here? One powerful
league, with lots of financial resources and every great female
player we can produce under one umbrella, sure sounds a lot better
to me than two female leagues competing in a country where full
acceptance of female basketball players is surely a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball is a growth stock, to be sure. I maintain
that there is no sport in this country that has demonstrated more
technical improvement during the past quarter-century than women's
basketball. Only the very best All-Americans of the early and
mid-'70s would hope to secure a starting spot on a good women's
college team today, and the average star player of the time would
be fortunate to draw a uniform on teams such as Connecticut,
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, or Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The women's game is not the aerial act the men's game has
become, and so what? When you see a good women's game today you are
looking at the men's game of the '60s or early '70s, and, believe
me, that's a good thing if it means there is less emphasis on
flying through the air and on endless stretches of my-turn,
your-turn one-on-one play than on passing and teamwork. The women
can play. Let me assure you that there isn't a man in the NBA I
would rather see in the middle of a 3-on-2 fast break (itself a
dying concept among the men) than the mercurial Dawn Staley, all
5-feet-whatever of her.
</P>
<P>
   But most men don't want to hear about it, and until a women's
league can rise to a consistent level of play that will attact the
attention of good, solid basketball fans that happen to be male,
the sport can never be the complete success it deserves to be. The
fastest way for that to happen is for all the best players to be
gathered under one corporate roof. Diluting the product with two
leagues was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the more ``deserving'' league has perished while the
arrogant bully has survived, but the brutal reality is that the
greater good of The Cause will be served by a strengthened WNBA,
which, I may be premature in assuming, will now do the proper thing
and switch to a winter schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be a Merry Christmas for those directly involved.
But there may now be many Merry Christmases in the future when
there is one completely stocked women's league playing the
absolutely best women's basketball anyone has ever seen.
</P>

CONVICTED MURDERER'S COMMUTATION ALLOWED TO STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joseph Yandle, the convicted felony murderer who won
his freedom three years ago but landed back in jail last summer for
fabricating a record of Vietnam War heroism, Wednesday kept his
gubernatorial commutation, although he could still face some long
prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Council rejected 5 to 2 Governor Paul Cellucci's
request that it revoke the commutation from Yandle, who had served
23 years in prison. The council approved his commutation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle's future now depends on the gubernatorially appointed
Parole Board, which had revoked his parole in August after reports
surfaced that he had lied about his war record.
</P>
<P>
   The board is set to take up Yandle's case on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that they keep him in jail,'' Cellucci said after
the the Governor Council rebuff. ``I would hope that he is not
released soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Shapiro, Yandle's lawyer, questioned the wisdom of
keeping his client incarcerated, particularly since the Governor's
Council has never taken action on about a dozen other commutations
given to inmates who later commited serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only issue now is whether the punishment fits the crime,''
Shapiro said after the vote. ``What sense is there to keep a person
in prison . . . for essentially telling a lie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the members of the parole board show the same
integrity shown by members of the Governor's Council, then they
will not punish Mr. Yandle any more than he has been punished,''
Shapiro added.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci had argued that former Governor William F. Weld had
recommended the commutation to the council based in part on
Yandle's false claim to have had a distinguished combat record.
However, Weld's letter to the Governor's Council recommending
Yandle for commutation never mentioned his supposed war heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle had stated in a commutation request in the 1980s _ which
was denied _ that he had become addicted to drugs in Vietnam and
that the addiction helped push him into a life of crime when he
returned. He won strong support from Vietnam War veterans groups in
his bid for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle was the driver in a 1972 hold-up of a liquor store in
which a clerk was shot to death. After his 1995 commutation, Yandle
moved to Vermont where he worked as a teacher and youth counselor.
</P>
<P>
   At a Governor's Council hearing last week, Yandle, who was
praised by his supporters as a savior of troubled youth, apologized
for fabricating a combat record. He also pleaded to be allowed a
chance to return to his Vermont home. If the council had revoked
the commutation, he would have had to serve the rest of his life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those councilors who voted against revoking the
commutation argued that there was no evidence that Weld and
then-Lieutenant Governor Cellucci had backed Yandle's bid for
freedom based on his false military documents.
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Christopher Iannella Jr., a Democrat from Jamaica
Plain, said the record shows that the board of pardons had approved
Yandle's commutation because of his record of rehabilitation in
prison, and not his Vietnam War record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was released from prison because of his institutional
record, not because of his military record,'' Iannella said. ``He
was a model prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rapucci, one of two sons of the murdered store clerk,
Joseph Rapucci, and his wife, Ann, sat grim-faced through the
meeting. Afterward, both declined comment, but attorney Bob Launie,
Ann's cousin, denounced the council's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are disappointed with the vote,'' said Launie,
who said it showed that Yandle's ``lies and deception . . . have
served him very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Launie, like Cellucci, said he thought that Yandle's supposed
Vietnam War heroism had played an important role in the commutation
of his life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yandle got to the Governor's Council in 1995 through the fraud
he committed,'' Launie said. ``We have an advisory opinion . . .
which clearly stated that they considered it. The governor has
stated he considered it at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hudner, state commissioner of Veterans Services, who had
supported Yandle in his 1995 bid for a commutation, also decried
the council's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did commit an abhorrent crime'' in using forged military
records to support bogus claims of war heroism, Hudner said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the council's decision is a signal that lying and
commiting fraud will be tolerated in these kinds of cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It attacks the integrity of the entire system if you can
obtain a commutation or pardon by fraud,'' Cellucci told reporters
after the council vote.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected any interpretation of the vote as a political
defeat for him. ``I think it is a defeat for right and wrong,'' he
said.

BLAIR ASSOCIATE QUITS OVER QUESTIONABLE LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's closest confidant, the
architect of the Labor Party's 1997 election victory, resigned
Wednesday over his failure to disclose that he had received a loan
from someone who came under investigation by his own department.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry minister
in Blair's Cabinet, said he was stepping down to spare the
government embarrassment and to redeem its pledge to be ``whiter
than white, squeaky clean.''
</P>
<P>
   A principal thrust of Blair's successful campaign had been
repeated pledges to run a government free of the kinds of scandals
that plagued his Conservative predecessor, John Major. Mandelson, a
prime persecutor of the Tories, told the prime minister, ``We can't
be like the last lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he had erred in not making the necessary
declaration of a $625,000 low-interest home loan he accepted in
1996 from Geoffrey Robinson, a millionaire colleague in the
government whose outside business interests have come under
scrutiny by his office. Robinson, the paymaster general, also
resigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange of correspondence that captured the sadness both
Blair and he were experiencing, Mandelson said, ``Dear Tony, I can
scarcely believe I am writing this letter to you,'' and Blair
responded, ``Dear Peter, You will know better than anyone the
feelings with which I write to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, a member of Parliament from a district in Northeast
England and formerly the Labor Party's director of communications,
was credited with recasting the party's fusty image to make it
electable after 18 years in opposition. ``It is no exaggeration to
say that without your support and advice we would never have built
New Labor,'' Blair wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson changed the party's red-flag symbol to a red rose and
shaped its agenda to suit the tastes and desires of an electorate
that the party researched through his office's focus group
techniques. He also encouraged leaders of the party to redirect
their political approach to make it more alluring to middle-class
voters and business.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he became a suspect figure to members of the
party's left wing and trade union movement and to people who
resented the secrecy of his methods and his close friendship with
Blair. The prime minister often quipped that Mandelson was the man
that New Labor had to learn to love.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson also became the principal target of Conservatives
looking for a Labor figure with more public vulnerability than
Blair, who continues to enjoy record approval ratings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was largely responsible for recasting Labor, and, by
extension, Britain, as fast-paced and up to date.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing 45-year-old Mandelson became the government's most
cosmopolitan member, appearing at society and cultural events and
mixing with royalty. He successfully resisted blunt efforts by the
press to make him formally declare his homosexuality. He was the
only member of the government with this social season's most
coveted ticket: an invitation to the 50th birthday party for
Charles, the Prince of Wales, at his Highgrove estate.
</P>
<P>
   His success in that world and his growing comfort with its
tastes may have contributed to an overreach that produced
Wednesday's downfall. In 1996 Mandelson decided he would like to
move from his modest home in Clerkenwell to a much larger one in
the more fashionable Notting Hill area of west London. His salary
as a back-bench member of Parliament was $72,000. The house cost
$790,000.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, his colleague on the back benches, extended the loan,
and Mandelson bought the house. He said at the time that he
expected that money from a coming family inheritance would enable
him to pay it back promptly.
</P>
<P>
   He did not record the transaction with record keepers in
Parliament, did not acknowledge it in his formal mortgage
application and did not mention it to Blair or other government
colleagues when questions about Robinson's financial interests
ended up being investigated by the department of which he had
become the head.
</P>
<P>
   When a report appeared in The Guardian on Tuesday, Mandelson
went on radio and television to say that he had done nothing wrong
and that he had ``insulated'' himself from any involvement in the
Robinson inquiry. By Tuesday night he had become persuaded that the
lapse constituted an ``impression of wrongdoing,'' and he called
the prime minister to offer his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the loan Wednesday, he said: ``I should have been
more open about it. I should have informed my colleagues. I should
have informed my permanent secretary, and in so doing I would have
protected myself against the appearance of a conflict of interest
that has subsequently arisen.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some suggestion in the comments and exchange of
letters Wednesday that while Mandelson may be leaving his coveted
Cabinet seat, he will not be far away from the government. Blair
ended his brief letter with the sentence, ``But I also want you to
know that you have my profound thanks for all you have done and my
belief that, in the future, you will achieve much, much more with
us.''

IN NOVEMBER'S RATE CUT, FED WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve's decision Nov. 17 to cut
interest rates was driven by concern that problems in the financial
markets might again intensify and drag down the economy, according
to a summary of the meeting released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point
at the meeting despite the possibility that a reduction might push
stock prices unsustainably higher, and in the face of evidence that
the economy was not slowing as much as most analysts had expected,
minutes of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee
also voted at the Nov. 17 meeting to remove its formal bias toward
further rate cuts and to adopt a neutral outlook _ one that did not
lean either toward monetary easing or tightening. At its subsequent
meeting, on Tuesday, the Fed held rates steady. The minutes of
Tuesday's meeting will be released in February.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank committee concluded at the November meeting
that ``further easing was not likely to be needed over the months
ahead unless ongoing developments pointed to a more substantial
decline in the growth of economic activity or further ebbing of
inflation than was currently anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors interpreted the account of the November meeting
to mean that the Fed might be more hesitant to reduce interest
rates next year than economists had assumed, especially because
economic indicators in the last month have suggested that growth
remains robust despite the continuing global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices, which had been up sharply, dipped after the
minutes were released Wednesday afternoon but then rebounded
sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 157.57 points, to
9,202.03.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed minutes said the decision to cut rates in November ``was
viewed as a close call by several members,'' and that while the
economy was expected to slow heading into next year, ``the
expansion currently displayed only modest signs of moderating from
what seemed to be an unsustainable pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee was particularly concerned about the stock market,
which after plunging over the summer had rebounded substantially
and by November was again at levels that some analysts thought was
unsustainable, particularly if corporate profits did not keep pace
with investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the committee's members, the minutes said, ``saw some
risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong
further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified
on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to
a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the committee decided that it should cut
rates one more time to help calm the markets and in particular to
help ease a persistent credit squeeze. The almost total absence of
inflation gave the Fed considerable leeway to lower rates, the
minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A further easing move would complete the policy adjustment to
the changed economic and financial climate that had emerged since
midsummer,'' the Fed continued, ``and would provide some insurance
against any unexpectedly severe weakening of the expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reduce the federal funds target rate on
overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, was
approved by a 10-to-1 vote at the meeting, the minutes said. The
dissenter was Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who is perhaps the most single-minded inflation fighter
in the Fed, said that two previous quarter-point rate reductions
during the fall had been sufficient to deal with the problems in
the financial markets and that an additional rate cut risked
reigniting inflation.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHO'S WATCHING WHOM ON TV?
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, Dec. 27
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON We spent the last half of this century watching TV.
In the century to come, television will watch us.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we're already there. In 1999, cable companies, using
digital set-top boxes, will be able to selectively target both
programs and ads not only to individual households but also
uniquely to each TV set in that household. The fare will be based
on viewers' watching and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials we see depend on which programs we select. In
the future, software can insert customized commercials in ways that
are cloaked to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   A cable outlet could then cull lists of high net worth retirees
and match those names to its subscriber base. Only those people
would then see ads for, say, a financial product. Or only the
dog-owners, similarly identified by their credit card purchases,
would see dog food commercials.
</P>
<P>
   A monograph posted on the web by the ``Addressable Advertising
Coalition'' explains what's about to happen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Technological advancements in cable systems, direct broadcast
satellites and the coming telephone company video operations offer
the promise of even further micro-targeting of ad messages. Digital
telecasting offers message targeting to the individual residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is an issue. As the coalition's paper notes, cable
operators have regarded ad revenues ``to be peripheral rather than
a core business, because advertising revenue per home, per year is
$25.97 vs. $428.05 per home, per year in subscriber revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy is also an issue _ one that the industry paper
skirts, noting merely that ``addressability ... can be transparent
to the consumer unless the consumer wants to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators permit the cable industry to gather data
on customers. Operators can collect and aggregate information on
individuals if they have ``prior written or electronic consent of
the subscriber,'' as the Federal Communications Commission puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's rules, that data can then be disclosed to
outsiders ``if such disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a
legitimate business activity related to cable television or other
service(s) provided to the subscriber.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable lawyers argue their legal road is already paved. Web
publishers, using ``cookies,'' keep abreast of what users do on
their sites and where they go when they leave. Local telephone
companies mine data from call records. They then use those records
in their direct marketing campaigns and make them available to
cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taking it up another level,'' Cynthia Brumfeld, a
senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates Inc., told the trade
publication Interactive Week. ``(American Express) already knows
everything you buy and Amazon knows what you read. It's just having
all of these things funneling through one centralized place.''
</P>
<P>
   In small towns, where newspapers often print lists of most local
happenings, privacy has long been a relative matter. Now the same
criteria are about to be extended to the global village. Before
that occurs, it would be wise to be sure we're standing on sound
legal and ethical feet.

SUSPECT IN ARKANSAS KILLING CAUGHT IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ An American wanted for murder in Arkansas
and who evaded authorities in three states was captured among
Christmas shoppers by the Mexican police Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Edward Tillis, 30, briefly fought with two bicycle
policemen who spotted him walking a few blocks from the Rio Grande
in a shopping district popular with tourists visiting from nearby
Laredo, Texas, police chief Pedro Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. authorities negotiated for his return, a tattered and
remorseful Tillis remained in the custody of the Mexican federal
police on charges he illegally entered this country.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Mexican police officers had been searching for Tillis,
who does not speak Spanish, and had last been seen soaking wet in
near-freezing temperatures after jumping in the Rio Grande Tuesday
to escape U.S. Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Personal problems triggered a Sunday incident when, Tillis said,
he attacked two people, including his ex-girlfriend's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin King, 44, of West Helena, Ark., was killed. Brenda Green's
throat was slashed, but she was released from a hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my temper and was caught in a whirlpool of sin,'' a
handcuffed Tillis said as he sat in the federal police headquarters
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, anything can happen,'' he said. ``I want to
apologize to the families _ mine and theirs _ for their
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillis' alleged crime wave rolled into Texas Monday when a state
trooper near Austin stopped him when he saw the man using a coat
hanger to get into a vehicle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle turned out to be stolen, and Tillis escaped into
nearby woods, the police said. He said he later tied up a man and
stole clothes and a truck before heading to Mexico to start a new
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis, who wore a ragged Dallas Cowboys jacket and green
trousers, said he had spent the night with a family in Nuevo Laredo
who saw that he was wet, desperate and needed a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of poor people here,'' said Tillis, who is
from Mississippi. ``We're all poor, and they'll help you out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was here, Tillis said, that he thought he could catch a
breather from a manhunt that included authorities in Tennessee,
Arkansas and Texas. He said he planned to go to the coastal resort
of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican federal prosecutor, who declined to give his name,
said Tillis would be held on immigration charges and could serve up
to two years in prison before being deported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he'd get caught, we just didn't know when,'' Capt.
Bill Williams of the West Helena Police Department said by phone
from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alcorta Flores, one of the policemen who arrested Tillis,
said there was a brief struggle, but he and the other officer
managed to handcuff the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can handle ourselves here,'' Alcorta said.

<P>
   Drug companies, trying a new approach in treating children, are
selling over-the-counter remedies that are as tasty and chewy as
soft candy and bubble gum or could be mistaken for ordinary
lollipops. These products, though, are not meant to treat a sweet
tooth but instead are for ailments like colds, sore throats and
even asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Children's Tylenol now makes a chewy version of its
widely used pain reliever in bubble gum, fruit and grape flavors.
Another company is introducing Kids-eeze bubble gum (yes, it
actually makes bubbles) next month for relief of cold symptoms. A
unit of American Home Products is selling Get Better Bear lollipops
for sore throats. There is even a product called Lolliasthma for
sucking during an asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
   More of these products are showing up on drugstore and
supermarket shelves next to the cough medicine and baby aspirin.
Manufacturers say they are the next generation of easy-to-take
remedies for the young. And the child-friendly formulas,
manufacturers and some doctors say, enable parents to medicate more
easily a toddler with a fever or a hacking cough. ``It's kind of
like the Mary Poppins thing _ a spoonful of sugar does help the
medicine go down,'' said Sid Good, president of Good Marketing
Inc., which specializes in marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of these products take a far more skeptical view,
contending that while some, like the chewy Tylenol, have clear
medicinal value, others offer no more therapeutic benefit than,
say, chicken noodle soup. Among them are Kids-eeze bubble gum,
which promises in some promotional material to cut the severity of
a common cold, and Get Better Bear, which the manufacturer says
soothes sore throats.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and child-health specialists say that treating any
medicine as if it were candy is confusing and potentially dangerous
for children. Teaching youngsters that medicine tastes good, they
fear, could lead them to reach for the valium or codeine in the
bathroom cabinet just as they would the lollipops or jelly beans in
the kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dangerous trend and precedent,'' said Dr. Sara
O'Heron, a child-health specialist at Emory University in Atlanta.
``The problem is, on one hand we are trying to make kids
distinguish between medicine and candy or food, and now we're
blurring that distinction. I think it's a good marketing ploy but
it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other critics also say some of the medicines contain
potent ingredients that can be harmful to children who mistake them
for candy and take too much.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, companies have been adding cherry flavor to cough
syrup and aspirin for years, but the new products go further,
making medicines so fun and flavorful that youngsters look forward
to taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Take Greyson Goodwin, a 3-year-old who once had to be force-fed
medicine. The last time he had a cold his mother gave him Get
Better Bear, lollipops for sore throats that taste so much like
candy that the toddler later faked a coughing fit to get more, his
mother, Carolyn Goodwin, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like having to weigh the lesser of two evils,''
said Mrs. Goodwin, who is an executive at the CBS television
affiliate in Tucson, Ariz. ``Do you get medicine he absolutely
won't take or stuff that he just loves?''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is one that many parents will find themselves making
more often as a growing number of candy-like children's remedies
come to market. Parents may wonder if they are confusing their
children on the differences between medicine and candy or whether
such products are the most effective among over-the-counter
treatments. The problem, critics say, is that the marketing muscle
behind these remedies may cloud the issues in the minds of many
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers ``are exploiting the market and consumer
reasoning,'' said Dr. Sumner Yaffe of the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of children's remedies are growing slightly faster than
the $17 billion over-the-counter drug market in general. While the
overall market is growing at a sluggish 2 percent a year, according
to David Buck, an analyst with Sands Brothers &AMP; Co., an investment
firm, the children's category, fueled by product innovation, is
growing at 3 to 4 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Like all over-the-counter drugs, the children's remedies are
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which requires that
the packages list active ingredients, recommended doses and
cautionary warnings. Beyond that, manufacturers are for the most
part free to promote products for proven relief of specific
symptoms, no matter how minimal the medicinal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the remedies, like Kids-eeze and Coughco Inc.'s
Cough Pops for colds, are classified as herbal or natural dietary
supplements because they include natural ingredients such as zinc
or compounds derived from plants. All dietary supplements are
regulated by a looser set of standards than nonprescription
medication because the passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement
Health and Education Act stripped the FDA of most of its authority
to regulate this class of products.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, manufacturers were prohibited from making claims
about the potential benefits of their products. But the revised
guidelines now allow companies to advertise the health effects of
the products _ without having to prove their effectiveness _ so
long as the wording does not suggest that the products cure or
prevent a disease. As a result, companies have a wide latitude in
what they can promote.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Lolliasthma, Energique Inc. in Woodbine, Iowa,
promotes that product as a homeopathic medical treatment for young
asthma sufferers that is ``for the temporary relief of constriction
of the chest or asthma.'' And Whitehall-Robins Healthcare, a unit
of American Home Products that makes Get Better Bear, uses the name
recognition of its cough medicine to remind parents that the
lollipop is ``from the makers of Dimetapp.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which
recently introduced Tylenol Soft-Chews, says in promotions to
customers that they ``taste so great and dissolve so fast that kids
won't mind taking this medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   And Quigley Corp., the company behind Kids-eeze, the zinc-based
cold gum, contends that the product reduces the duration and
severity of the common cold. The gum is being manufactured for
Quigley by Amurol Confections _ a candy company and unit of Wm.
Wrigley Jr. Co.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, which are promoting the products in commercials
and magazine and newspaper ads as well as on their Web sites, say
the remedies are serious medicine that should be taken only with
adult supervision. ``We truly wanted to create a more palatable
delivery system for kids and adolescents,'' said Guy Quigley, chief
executive of Quigley. ``But it will definitely be on the cough and
cold cure aisle because it is not candy.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, parents should treat the products like any others that
should be kept out of the reach of children, manufacturers and
health care professionals caution. Indeed, while an overdose of
products like Coughco's Tummypops, essentially an antacid on a
stick, may do little more than cause further stomach upset,
Energique's Lollicough pop contains belladonna, a plant derivative
that can be toxic in large quantities, said Dr. Robert Ward,
chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously some of these products should be thought of as
remedies is another matter, however. Yaffe of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development criticized Get
Better Bear, saying that promoting it as a Dimetapp product falsely
suggests to parents that it offered the same medicinal value as
cough medicine. ``It's like saying, `Buy this car, it's from the
maker of Cadillac,'''Yaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dimetapp contains ingredients that are clinically proven to
suppress coughs, he said, while Get Better Bear, whose package
boasts ``Soothing Relief for your Child's Sore Throat,'' is simply
sugar and pectin _ the same ingredients in jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehall-Robins contends that unlike Dimetapp, Get Better Bear
is not marketed for coughs, but that advertising reminds parents it
is from a company they know and trust. The pectin in the lollipop,
the company adds, coats the throat; therefore, ``we are positioning
it for soothing the throat, not positioning it for giving to
children as candy,'' said Carol Dornbush, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of zinc-based children's cold medicine, a recent
study concluded that zinc was ``not effective in treating cold
symptoms in children and adolescents.'' The study, conducted by the
Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pittsburgh Medical School,
used lozenges provided by Quigley _ the same company that markets
Kids-eeze.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley and the distributor of Cough Pops, which also contain
zinc, say the lozenges used in the study contained too little zinc
and that the study was riddled with procedural errors. One of the
doctors who worked on the research, Dr. Michael Macknin, chairman
of the department of general pediatrics at the Cleveland Clinic,
said the lozenges did contain a lower dose of zinc than is in
Kids-eeze, but said the study was not flawed and that he stood by
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Despite questions over their benefits, products like child zinc
gum or pectin lollipops are generally harmless, according to the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   What is troubling, the academy and the NIH's child health unit
say, are products that promise relief of symptoms of serious
medical conditions, in particular, Lolliasthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single one of those ingredients are active ingredients
used to treat asthma,'' Ward of the American Academy of Pediatrics
said of the herbal compounds in the lollipop. ``I would be very
concerned that they are making a claim of treating a medical
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer stands by its various medicinal lollipops,
saying they are safe and contain effective homeopathic ingredients.
``They are quite powerful,'' said Joyce Beach, a co-owner of
Energique. ``They should be treated as medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA does not take a position on these remedies, as long as
they adhere to labeling requirements. But agency officials
acknowledge that consumers often have a false sense of security
about them, wrongly assuming that if the products are on the market
they are guaranteed to be safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we advise consumers to do is to talk to a health care
professional, whether it's a doctor, pharmacist or nurse,'' said
Tom McGinnis, deputy associate commissioner of health affairs at
the FDA and also a pharmacist. ``A health care professional will be
able to see what's in there.''

   SEEKING MODELS WHO CAN SING
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One night, David Foster had a dream. It was more
of a realization, actually, but he calls it a dream. He was
thinking about niches, and what kind of gaps there are in popular
music that need to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   One was for soul singers on the order of Teddy Pendergrass and
Marvin Gaye. Since Foster, whose recent experience is as a producer
for musicians like Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Natalie Cole,
Michael Bolton, Barbra Streisand and Toni Braxton, has been
plunging deeper into country music, he didn't feel immediately
compelled to fill that gap.
</P>
<P>
   Then he began to think about the Spice Girls. They make great
records, he thought, but they aren't as strong vocally as they
could be. What if he _ David Foster, 14-time Grammy winner _ put
together a Spice Girls equivalent in country music, but with better
singers, and built them to last?
</P>
<P>
   After all, with Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks topping the
charts, the line between country singer and professional model is
beginning to blur.
</P>
<P>
   And so Foster began his search for Lace _ a conceptual
combination of the Spice Girls, Ms. Twain and the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of Lace, don't feel bad. They don't exactly
exist yet. But try to remember the name and see if, by the end of
next year, his dream has become a pop music reality.
</P>
<P>
   Lace has already recorded an album for Foster's label, 143
Records, with Chris Farren (who also worked with Deana Carter)
helping with production. But the trio's lineup isn't complete. One
singer, Annalee Fery (the real-life girlfriend of Jonathan
Silverman of NBC's ``Single Guy''), still needs to be replaced
because she didn't fit the mix. And Foster doesn't want to release
the record until he has the faces to match the music. The album,
led by the single ``I Want a Man,'' is likely to be in stores in
March or April.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought the prospects were for a country-pop
crossover group like Lace, Kerry Wolfe, the operations manager at
the Milwaukee country-music radio station WMIL, noted that people
have called the female trio the Dixie Chicks the Spice Girls of
country, although the tag is not exactly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to the music,'' he said of Foster's Lace.
``If he is putting together a package that's visually attractive
and they can sing and sell a song, then by all means, bring it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster discovered two members of Lace in Canada. It began with
Beverley Mahood, an acclaimed Canadian country singer whose
independent-label video, ``Girl Out of the Ordinary,'' he spotted
on television in his hotel room one night. Eventually, he tracked
her down and put the first piece of Lace in place. She was a
perfect candidate _ Ms. Mahood had been singing since she was 6
(first performing on a bill with Anne Murray), and grew up not just
on Patsy Cline but also on pop singers like Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   The second singer is Giselle Brohman, who has a different look
and a higher voice than Ms. Mahood. But Foster is having trouble
finding a third member. Everyone who fits the bill, he said, wants
a solo career and he is hoping Lace will have a ``five- to ten-year
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The new band is ``going to turn heads,'' said the 24-year-old
Ms. Mahood. She has also signed a deal for a solo record with
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Spice Girls concept, Ms. Mahood said she
didn't mind the comparison. ``Who wouldn't want to be the Spice
Girls right now?'' she asked. ``I want to be the Spice Girls, but I
want to be the Spice Girls with a lot of talent and I want to be
around for a couple of years at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Lace's manager, Tom Cross, said: ``The trick is this third
singer. It's easy to find a deadly looking girl. It's really hard
to find a deadly looking girl who's deadly talented. If this isn't
real, it won't work. We argue about the third girl every day.
David's looking, we're looking.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is Foster looking for in a Lace member? ``Beauty
and talent and youth,'' he said, quickly adding, ``Does that sound
like a sexist remark?''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about his question for a second and then added, half
apologetically, ``It's my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   A LENNON RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the record Julian Lennon released in May in Britain is
coming to the United States. It is scheduled to be in on stores on
Feb. 23 the Fuel 2000/Universal Records label. It is ``Photograph
Smile,'' the first record that Lennon (son of John) has put out
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The album is so admired it makes one wonder why it took so long
for an American record label to release it. Unlike the record by
his half-brother Sean, ``Into the Sun'' (which was released in
Britain the same day as Julian Lennon's album), ``Photograph
Smile'' is pure Beatles-esque pop.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Julian Lennon wasn't the son of a Beatle,
``Photograph Smile'' (originally released on Julian's label, Music
From Another Room) would be hailed as a retro-pop classic and
Julian a more mainstream contemporary of underground pop savants
like Apples in Stereo, the Wondermints and the High Llamas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the legacy of Julian's father hangs all over
``Photograph Smile.'' Lennon's voice is eerily similar to his
father's solo work, and his lyrics begging for world peace and
offering love as the answer to all problems follow in Dad's
footsteps. At times, Julian seems to be quoting songs like ``Lucy
in the Sky with Diamonds'' and ``Nobody Told Me.'' But his more
traditional pop instincts seem to be as derived from Paul McCartney
as they are from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Lennon has said that this feels like his first real album
because it is the only time he has had complete artistic freedom.
The record is filled with swelling strings, lush melodies and
lyrics that vacillate between apology and devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sean's record, when ``Photograph Smile'' errs it is
toward the middle of the road instead of the fringes. The album
begins with Julian declaring, ``I have walked through the fire as
an ordinary man,'' perhaps referring to his musical time off _ five
of those years spent waiting for an old record contract to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Then he declares, cannily, that ``Daddy's work is never done.''
</P>
<P>
   CHARTING SALES
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for last-minute musical Christmas presents,
here is what the rest of the country is buying.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Wednesday by Soundscan, a company
in Hartsdale, N.Y., that monitors music sales, the No. 1 selling
album for the fifth consecutive week was Garth Brooks' ``Double
Live'' two-CD concert set. It sold 548,000 copies last week, nearly
100,000 more than it did the week before.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 2, Celine Dion's disk of holiday cheer, ``These Are
Special Times,'' holds its place for a third week with 535,000
copies sold.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 3 is 'N Sync's self-titled album, followed by albums by
Jewel, Mystikal, the Backstreet Boys, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain,
the Offspring and 'N Sync again with its Christmas record. In the
meantime, Whitney Houston's album ``My Love Is Your Love''
continues to disappoint, sliding down the charts this week to No.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in a period when the record business generally
stops releasing music by big-name acts because most labels are on
vacation and have already put out their major albums around
Thanksgiving time, new music by three artists emerged in the Top
40: Mystikal (at No. 5), Busta Rhymes (at 13) and DJ Clue? (at 26).
</P>
<P>
   All are rap acts, a genre that continues to mystify the
established record business by breaking all the rules and getting
away with it.

<P>
   THE CHUNNEL, England-France _ Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular
phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, was juggling business
calls halfway between London and Paris. When his phone went dead as
the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into the underwater tunnel
that links England to the Continent, the London-based French banker
loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely describe myself as a European,'' he said in the
fluent English he perfected working at an Australian bank. ``I may
get sentimental when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the
practical things, I see myself as a citizen of Europe. I like the
lifestyle in France, but I don't make my living there.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 1999 is the official start-up date of the euro, the
common European currency that will unite 11 countries monetarily.
But throughout Europe, a different kind of integration has already
taken root.
</P>
<P>
   Routiers, who was spending a day in Paris to meet with his
bank's French clients, is at the vanguard of a new generation of
Europeans who do not have to brace themselves for a shock in the
new year. Mobile, fluent in several languages and aggressively
non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of borderless,
cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency is
supposed to advance.
</P>
<P>
   They do not share their parents' memories of World War II or
their parents' sense of national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People worry when they hear talk of a common European defense
policy because it suggests that at the end of the day, we have one
government,'' said Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in
London. ``Countries are afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I
don't see it as a bad thing. If a government is good, stable and
efficient, who cares if it is based in Berlin or Athens?''
</P>
<P>
   Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business in the United States and
Britain, could serve as a model for the new Europeans. He works for
a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English and French, and in
the past year has traveled, among other places, to Belgium, the
United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of thousands of other Europeans, he chose London _
and its busy financial markets _ as the best place to work.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not feel as if he lives in England. He lives in
London, the clubhouse of financial Europe. And membership has its
privileges. Papadopoulos lives in the fashionable Knightsbridge
area, drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels, and works out at the
fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only
other `foreigners' I met were from the Middle East,'' he says.
``Now friends and co-workers are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish,
German, even Russian. You feel it everywhere. The streets are
jammed with foreigners. Not tourists _ people who live and work
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby-boomers in Europe often describe themselves as the 1968
generation, weaned on the protest and social turmoil that convulsed
European societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic but equally
significant was a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement within
what were then the six countries of the Common Market. A Frenchman
could work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations,
particularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries
to the more prosperous north. Actually, as huge industries like
steel shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunities
for working-class Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 countries within what is now the European Union,
but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to other
countries, according to estimates prepared by Eurostat. Those who
do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids or
garbage collectors. There are still legal barriers preventing most
doctors, lawyers and academics from finding work in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   So far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by
white-collar business executives who eagerly followed career
opportunities across national borders, time zones and language
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago that kind of mobility was the preserve of
a far smaller elite, the top executives of major companies or
multinational corporations. Technology, from high-speed trains to
the ever-evolving apparatus of business _ lap-top computers, cell
phones, fax machines _ has made European mobility accessible to
mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs and even students. Cable
television, which allows Germans to watch Italian game shows or
Swedes to watch French news programs, has spread the Zeitgeist to
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   This year Superga, an Italian brand of sports clothes and shoes,
opened a major advertising campaign with a series of magazine ads
that show fashionable young people saucily cavorting with European
leaders _ a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle up the steps of
the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, a young man
playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane of the
former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of ad would not have been possible five or 10 years
ago,'' said Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director of the Milan
office of Pirella Gottsche Lowe, an international advertising
agency. ``Now European unification is on the TV all the time; it
has seeped into people's unconscious. Even people who do not care
about politics recognize the faces of a Tony Blair or Jacques
Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the European Union, Britain has twice as many EU
citizens as France, but it is not the country with the highest
concentration of residents from other European countries. According
to estimates based on surveys prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third
of the residents of tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and
a high standard of living, are from other European countries.
Belgium, which has the European Commission and NATO headquarters,
is second, with 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation
that has held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the
nerve center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New
Europeans _ bankers and business executives drawn by London's
financial district, a more flexible bureaucracy and the
universality of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as surprisingly, London also serves as an example
of another less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism _ the
breakdown of certain social barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved to the sons and
daughters of Europe's elite. Now the European Union has a
12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this
year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent of
the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries
within the Union for up to a year, free.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, business schools in Europe have
multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA programs that teach an
American approach to business. This too has allowed a measure of
meritocracy to creep into European business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juergen Schrempp, the head of Daimler, started as a car
mechanic,'' noted Stephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at
the Johns Hopkins University School for International Studies in
Washington. ``That would have been unthinkable in Germany 20 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Social mobility, moreover, is fueled by movement. When people
transfer to another country, they find it easier to shed the
psychological or cultural trappings of home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed in
Paris,'' Routier explained. ``France is still very hierarchical.
Bosses want to know where you went to school, what your father
does. In London, none of that matters as long as you make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy
class distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese
magazines in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14
years ago, and never looked back. He has lived all over Europe, and
is fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and
Serbo-Croatian. His father, a car mechanic, had not traveled out of
Britain until 1992. Smith said he could never have succeeded as
well had he stayed home. ``I didn't go to public schools or
Oxbridge,'' he explained. ``I'm not saying its impossible, but it
would have been much more difficult in England.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves
bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where
birth and breeding do not matter as much.
</P>
<P>
   Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work in London to escape the sexism
she encountered on the Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who is Hungarian,
speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and met her
Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both were attending the
University of Bocconi business school in Milan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived and
traveled all over the world. She works on the Eastern European desk
of a British bank; he works for a major international consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe said
the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it
impossible for her to find as good a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to job interviews at Italian banks and they only asked
me about my husband's job,'' she said with a grimace. ``And they
made it clear that they were afraid I would get pregnant and ask
for maternity leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, a professor at Insead, the prestigious
international business school in Fontainebleau, outside Paris,
called Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking _ choosing the best
deal for herself. As he put it, ``If they cannot find what they
want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the
same thing. A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he lives and
teaches in France and does consulting work all over Europe, from
Sweden to the Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone is in
three languages _ French, Flemish and English. His students, a
generation behind him, see nothing exceptional in his
transnationalism.
</P>
<P>
   These Europeans form an advance guard that is still relatively
small in numbers, but experts say they carry a disproportionate
influence on their societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany, for example, it is the business people who are
pushing ahead with change and pulling politicians along behind them
kicking and screaming,'' Szabo said. ``They are looking at a larger
market and feel the competitive pressures of globalization.
Politicians are responding to a domestic constituency. They are
answering to an international one.''

BIOGEN CHIEF QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James R. Tobin abruptly resigned Wednesday as president and
chief executive of Biogen Inc. for undisclosed personal reasons,
surprising both Wall Street analysts and the local biotechnology
community.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden departure comes exactly five years to the day that he
left Baxter International Inc., the Deerfield, Ill., medical
products company at which he was president, to join Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's resignation and the lack of a definitive explanation why
caused Biogen shares to drop 7 1/16, or 8 percent, to 79 15/16
Wednesday, after hitting a 52-week high Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, 54, will be succeeded by James L. Vincent, Biogen's
chairman, who said he will serve as president and chief executive
of the Cambridge company for one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about Tobin's decision to leave, Vincent repeatedly
stressed the reasons were unrelated to the biotech company's
performance or his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided to tender his resignation,'' said Vincent. ``This
was not a discharge or a gentle pushing or a whisper in the ear,
nothing to do with the board or the company suggesting that we
wanted to him to leave. This event is not connected with any other
happening at the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Biogen in January 1994, Tobin has been
instrumental in getting Avonex, the company's injectable medication
to treat multiple sclerosis, on the market. Its strong sales have
made it the biggest-selling drug in the field. He also helped
expand Biogen's pipeline of promising new drugs and forge several
drug development alliances with leading pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leaving came a bit suddenly, but we have a good management
team and the company is doing great,'' said Phillip A. Sharp, a
Biogen director and head of the biology department at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who earned $973,000 in salary and bonus last year, was
unavailabe for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Vincent stressed
there will be no ``lurching changes,'' and that the company will
stick with its corporate strategy. He said there were no
disagreements over the direction of the company, adding he does not
expect any other departures of senior Biogen executives stemming
from Tobin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Tobin's personal reasons for exiting the company
were related to alcohol or drug abuse, Vincent said he would not
comment beyond saying they were personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be lots of scenarios that people will think about,
but there really are no other issues involved with this event,''
said Vincent, adding he did not know of Tobin's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Biogen, Tobin had a 21-year career at Baxter,
where he rose from financial analyst to president.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Globe in 1994 he joined Biogen, ``looking for a new
challenge.''

 &HT;    Clouds loom over Lockheed Martin production, purchases
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Lockheed Martin Corp.'s aircraft plant falls silent
today for an annual weeklong holiday shutdown, workers and
executives can look back on favorable events during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of new C-130J cargo planes finally began after
several delays, and the F-22 fighter has just won an initial
production contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yet clouds keep popping up on the horizon for the plant and its
9,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the acting secretary of the Air Force said in
Washington there are no plans _ yet, anyway _ to accelerate
long-term C-130J purchases to help fill a looming order gap between
2001 and 2004. Unless the Air Force pushes up some orders, the
Marietta, Ga., production line could face at least a temporary
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lockheed Martin warned for the second time that
fourth-quarter corporate earnings would be hurt by various factors,
including the lag in C-130J deliveries. At least two Wall Street
analysts cut their rating on the aerospace giant's stock, which
plummeted 14 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the latest news is conventional wisdom that the
Marietta plant's clout with the Pentagon and Congress soon will
wane. The exit of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose
district includes the plant, leaves it with no highly placed
political patron for the first time in decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lockheed Martin's corporate growth has made
the Marietta plant a smaller piece of a bigger pie than it was only
a few years ago, before Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine rattled nerves by suggesting in its last issue
that Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin and its cost-cutting
executives could get rid of an outdated ``albatross'' by closing
the Marietta plant and moving its programs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The article questioned whether a planned $350 million
write-down, disclosed in recent Lockheed Martin financial filings,
is really an early installment on plant closing and severance
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer quite simply is no,'' said Terry Graham, executive
vice president and chief operating officer for Lockheed Martin
Aeronautical Systems, the division headquartered at the Marietta
plant.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Graham acknowledged the plant, built
by the Air Force during World War II and leased by Lockheed Martin
since, faces challenges and uncertainty. But he expressed
confidence it will be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the level of business we have, with a backlog of C-130J
orders through 2001 and the F-22 program moving forward, anyone's
assertion (that the plant should be closed) is just unfounded,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be too costly to move its work to other plants
even if Lockheed Martin's top brass wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, the plant completed a $35 million overhaul of
the tooling and assembly line for the C-130J, with a goal of
cutting production time and costs. Also, tens of millions have been
invested in the F-22 final assembly line and special testing
facilities for the state-of-the-art fighter, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and his boss, Aeronautical Systems President William
Bullock, both were installed within the past two years with a
mandate to update the plant's processes and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   That came in the wake of the troubled C-130J development
project, whose costs rose to $900 million and which ran about two
years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most military programs, Lockheed developed the plane at
its own expense, gambling it could then generate a profitable mix
of U.S. and foreign orders.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chairman and Chief Executive Vance Coffman, Lockheed
Martin has closed about 16 million square feet of factory space
elsewhere. But James Fetig, a spokesman at the Bethesda
headquarters, backed up Marietta management, saying ``there's no
chance Marietta will be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a shutdown ordered from Bethesda is an extreme
scenario they doubt will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be a little surprised. In fact, I would be a lot
surprised,'' said Paul Nisbet, of JSA Research. He said C-130J
program delays and costs have been troubling but do not tarnish its
long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about twice the price of earlier models and that has
undoubtedly slowed sales, but it's very likely to be in production
for the next 20 years,'' Nisbet said. ``They may not make more than
20 or 25 a year, but that's enough, and it has no real
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling the gap
</P>
<P>
   The order gap looms large nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The Marietta plant has built 33 C-130Js so far _ deliveries were
held up until the plane gained certification last summer _ and has
orders for another 57. That's enough to keep the production line
open into 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five of those orders are from the U.S. government, the
rest from foreign buyers such as the British Royal Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force wants to eventually buy 150 more C-130Js to
replace aging older models, but it doesn't want them until 2004.
Hence the possible production gap.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Gingrich, the Air Force last month sent a team to
Marietta to explore ways to prevent a break, since the costs of a
shutdown and restart could inflate the price of planes built later.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Aeronautical Systems proposed that the Air Force
push some purchases forward and buy an average 12 planes a year.
``We've shown we can save them big money doing it that way,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Air Force Secretary Whitten Peters on Wednesday told
reporters in Washington there is no plan to accelerate the
purchases, although he added there would be more discussions.
Whether his comments simply restated the situation or suggest the
Air Force is digging in its heels remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no change in their position,'' Graham said. ``We're
still optimistic we're going to work this problem and get it
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   If an accelerated Air Force order doesn't materialize, Graham
said, Aeronautical Systems will try to fill the gap by generating
separate orders for Air National Guard or Reserve planes, or from
the Marine Corps. It also continues to seek more foreign orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any debate about a role for the
C-130J,'' said Steve Kosiak, an analyst at the Defense Budget
Project in Washington. ``The question is whether we need them
sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Air Force might well save money in the long run by
accelerating purchases but added: ``The problem is you can make
that case with any weapons program, and you can't accelerate them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes whether you end up delaying one program
to accelerate another, which negates the benefits,'' Kosiak said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling influence?
</P>
<P>
   An unknown is the impact of Gingrich's departure, which follows
by two years the retirement of Democratic U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a
heavyweight on defense matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich made a major suggestion to the Air Force that it
consider buying C-130Js in the first place, when Lockheed needed an
initial order,'' Kosiak noted. ``The Air Force had been reluctant
but seemed to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kosiak said it is simplistic to assume
Gingrich's departure leaves the Marietta plant friendless. He noted
the C-130, in both old and new models, has long enjoyed broad
support in Congress because of its use by Guard and Reserve units
in districts across the nation. Congress routinely buys more than
the Pentagon seeks for Guard and Reserve modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been a single-party, single-state, or single-man
program,'' Graham said. ``To think that one person could drive
purchases is just naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from keeping the C-130J and F-22, Marietta plant
executives hope to land contracts for modification work on older
C-130s, C-5 airlifters and P-3 naval patrol planes, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-range, they are eyeing a contract for a new carrier-based
utility aircraft for the Navy, but that's still a decade or so
away.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the Marietta plant is unused, which also has
prompted speculation Lockheed Martin may seek a partnership in
which it would make parts for a civilian aircraft company. Graham
acknowledged that potential but added it remains speculative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exploring a number of possibilities,'' he said.

 &HT;    Recalled meats sold in Georgia
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hot dogs, deli meats and other meat products thought
to be involved in a nationwide outbreak of a serious food-borne
illness, listeriosis, are included in a nationwide recall.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has caused 40 severe illnesses in 10 states,
including one possible case in Georgia, and the deaths of a fetus
and three elderly adults in Ohio and New York, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee Corp. has voluntarily recalled certain products
manufactured at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich. The
products are identifiable by the codes EST P261 and EST 6911 on the
packaging. The company could not say how much product was recalled
or how much was distributed in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs included in the recall are labeled Ball Park, Bil Mar,
Bryan Bunsize and Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack. Other brands are
Grillmaster, Hygrade, Mr. Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee
Home Roast.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis, caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, is
relatively rare, and most healthy people don't become severely ill.
But the disease poses a serious threat to pregnant women and
fetuses, the elderly or those with weakened immune systems.
Symptoms range from fever and diarrhea to meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is found in soil and water. The bacteria have been
found in raw meats and vegetables, processed foods such as cold
cuts and soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk or foods made from it.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis causes 1,850 serious illnesses a year and kills 425,
or 23 percent of those seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak began in early August, but the low number of cases
made it difficult for health officials to recognize the outbreak
and then pinpoint its source. Listeria has a three-week incubation
period, which forced investigators to ask people to recall what
they had eaten the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 of the 40 infected people had consumed cooked hot
dogs during the month before they became ill. Investigators aren't
sure how well the hot dogs were cooked, and caution people using
microwaves to make sure their food is cooked throughout.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, the strain of Listeria involved was isolated from an
open package of hot dogs, some of which was eaten by an infected
person four weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the recalled food products have a long shelf
life and may have been distributed throughout the nation, health
officials advise people to check their refrigerators and freezers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can return products, opened or not, to the place of
purchase for a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, which is investigating, recommends thoroughly cooking
meat and washing raw vegetables. People especially at risk may want
to consider reheating deli meats before consumption and avoiding
soft cheeses such as brie or feta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's the holidays, don't let your guard down,''
warned Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the CDC's associate director for
epidemiologic science. ``People tend to get a little sloppy in how
they prepare and handle foods. But it's no less risky because it's
December instead of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee's has a consumer hotline for questions: 1-800-247-8339.

has been a big reason why Cincinnati is 10-0 and ranked No. 4. The
Bearcats have plenty of perimeter scorers, but for the team to be
successful, it needs a dependable scoring threat in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Martin is averaging a modest 11.2 points per game,
third-best on the Cincinnati roster. He also averages 6.9 rebounds
and 2.8 blocked shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyon's the kind of guy that does a lot of things that aren't
going to show up on the box score,'' Huggins said. ``He makes the
pressure defense so much better, and what he doesn't block, he
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tremendously improved offensively, he's just not very
assertive. He's very happy if somebody else scores and we win. It's
very admirable in a lot of ways. But for us to continue to be
successful, he needs to be more offensive minded than what he's
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has victories over Duke (when it was ranked No. 1)
and at Minnesota (which was ranked No. 17). The Bearcats, who,
under coach Bob Huggins' command, play some of the toughest defense
in the country, could be a team to reckon with come March.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has had his moments. He had 16 points and 16 rebounds in
the season opener at Rhode Island. And he had 22 points against
Nicholls State, breaking a string of five consecutive games scoring
in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My numbers aren't real good, but teams still notice I'm out
there,'' said Martin, who twice has been named Conference USA's
player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholls State noticed when Martin blocked a shot by catching
the ball, then turned and dribbled the length of the court before
throwing a perfect lob pass for a dunk. Nevada-Las Vegas noticed
when Martin made 11 of 12 shots for a season-high 23 points, and,
by the way, had 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Martin was content to rebound and block shots while
allowing Bobby Brannen to do most of the front-court scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened to Ken is that a year ago he was the
`other' guy, and now he's `the' guy,'' Huggins said. ``It was Bob a
year ago, and that's shifted to Kenyon. He's so unselfish he's not
going to try to make a lot of things happen on his own.''
GOTTFRIED'S ADVISERS
</P>
<P>
   First-year Alabama coach Mark Gottfried figures that he has
learned his coaching moves from some of the best. He played for the
Crimson Tide under Wimp Sanderson. And as an assistant at UCLA he
spent time asking questions of the Wizard of Westwood, John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity while I was at UCLA as a young coach to
go over to Coach Wooden's house on a number of occasions,''
Gottfried said. ``I'd sit for hour after hour and we'd talk very
little about basketball, but mostly about life situations. I'd ask
him, `As a coach, how would you handle this situation?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Sanderson is one of the people who's always there for me
to go to for advice and wisdom. I enjoyed playing for coach
Sanderson. He's a great coach, and I don't think that nationally he
ever got the recognition he deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Gottfried, who was 68-24 in three seasons at
Murray State, is becoming recognized as one of the nation's top
young coaches. The Crimson Tide was 10-2 going into last night's
championship game of the Pearl Harbor Classic against Michigan
State.
CURRYING FAVOR
</P>
<P>
   Before their game at Kansas State's Bramlage Coliseum on
Saturday, Missouri-Kansas City players tried to elicit some
sympathetic support from the home crowd. During pregame warmups,
they wore T-shirts that said ``Congratulations K-State Football
11-1'' on the front and ``No BCS'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the only \Rpolitical\S statement we make all year,''
Kangaroos coach Bob Sundvold said. ``\RBill\S Snyder's group has
done a great job. It's a tribute to what they've done in football.
We just thought we'd have a little fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats proceeded to have a little fun with the Kangaroos,
winning 67-39.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, UMKC's T-shirt idea isn't original. In January 1995,
Missouri played at Nebraska and wore T-shirts congratulating the
Huskers on their 1994 national championship in football. And
Sundvold is a former Missouri assistant coach. No longer missing
Person Auburn's sizzling 11-0 start _ the school's best in 40 years
_ got a boost when Adrian Person became eligible after transferring
from Southern Union junior college in Alabama . The 6-7, 240-pound
Person is the nephew of former Auburn stars Chuck and Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got better range than Chuck,'' Southern Union coach Ron
Radford told the ``Birmingham Post-Herald''. ``He's better in the
post than Chuck or Wesley. He's the total package. He can play from
small forward or power forward.''
BRIEFLY
Drake's 83-80 victory over Creighton on Dec. 12 ended the Bulldogs'
39-game Missouri Valley Conference losing streak. ``For the new
guys, they hadn't experienced it, but for us who knew, it's
something I'd never wish upon my worst enemy,'' third-year coach
Kurt Kanaskie said of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin is keeping pace with John Wooden. In his
67th game, Lavin won his 50th game as Bruins coach. Wooden also got
win No. 50 in game No. 67. Now all Lavin needs is to win 10
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Duke's 71-60 victory over No. 3 Kentucky should not have
been a surprise. The game was held in East Rutherford, N.J., and
the Blue Devils are now 5-0 there. In 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990
they won East Regional finals at the Meadowlands (it's now
Continental Airlines Arena) to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA forward Rico Hines on the young Bruins' inconsistent play:
``We're like a quarter-horse. We're good for a half. Sometimes, we
look like All-Americans for stretches. It's a mental thing. We have
to learn to put people away.''
</P>
<P>
   Creighton has its best team since Tony Barone was a sideline
jumping bean there earlier this decade. The Bluejays are 8-2, and
their two losses were on the road at Nebraska and Drake. Creighton
has given Iowa its only loss, and Sunday defeated No. 19 Oklahoma
State, coached by former Creighton coach Eddie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl Harbor Classic, a three-day tournament that concluded
last night, had an interesting twist. Seven of the eight teams were
from states that had ships docked at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
Players from the teams participated in a special ceremony at the
Arizona Memorial to honor the veterans of that historic event.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, Arkansas' season tickets have sold out before the
season. But the Razorbacks aren't drawing the crowds in Bud Walton
Arena. Attendance for the Dec. 7 game against Western Carolina was
12,646, the smallest in the arena's six years. Through six home
games, Arkansas was averaging 15,789; seating capacity is 19,200.
</P>
<P>
   Update: Last week, we reported how Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun
was unhappy with the facilities and fan control at Pittsburgh. The
Big East Conference investigated and found no basis for UConn's
charges that its players were pelted with soft-drink bottles and
racial slurs during the Dec. 12 game. However, Pitt officials
acknowledge that renovations to Fitzgerald Fieldhouse have made
locker-room facilities inadequate.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Muslim guerrillas in Lebanon fired Katyusha rockets
into Israel Wednesday, wounding 13 people. The attack was
retaliation for the killing of a Lebanese woman and six of her
children in an Israeli bombing raid on suspected guerrilla targets
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that Israel would
respond to the rocket attack, which the Iranian-backed Party of
God, or Hezbollah, said it had carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pass over this in silence,'' Netanyahu told
reporters at Qiryat Shemona, which was struck by rockets. ``We will
react according to our considerations at a time we see fit, and we
will respond. Israel will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20 to 30 rockets hit Qiryat Shemona and other
communities in two salvos that began at 7:30 a.m., the army and
residents said. A worker in a carpentry shop suffered moderate
wounds, and 12 people were lightly wounded, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings took direct hits. But serious casualties were
avoided, because residents had been ordered to bomb shelters
overnight in anticipation of an attack. The rockets landed at an
hour when people usually head for work and drive children to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a few tremendous booms,'' Mali Nizri, whose house was
hit, told Israel Radio. ``Glass flew. I was wounded in the hand. I
lay on my son. I threw him to the floor so he wouldn't get hurt,
because he was nearly killed by Katyushas last time. I lay on my
son until the explosions stopped, and when I got up I saw the
horror. My whole house was smashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it had attacked to avenge what it called the
deliberate killing of the mother, Nadwa Othman, and her children.
Her husband and a son were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again the resistance has fulfilled its promise to protect
our territory and our civilians,'' the group said in a statement.
``Violence must be answered with violence. Their blood must be
spilled for ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were buried in an eastern town, Baalbek, in a funeral
that became an emotional protest against Israel and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no God but Allah,'' mourners chanted. ``Israel and
America are the enemies of Allah!''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai expressed regret,
saying the deaths were accidental. An army spokesman said the
family's house had been hit by mistake in an air strike aimed at a
Hezbollah training base and communications station near Janta in
the Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said in a
television interview that a pilot's ``incorrect target
identification'' had caused the bombing error.
</P>
<P>
   A senior air force officer, identified only as Brig. Gen. Yossi,
said at a news conference that two bombs had landed 300 to 400
yards from the base, hitting the house. The air force was
investigating, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The air force has raided suspected guerrilla targets in Lebanon
more than 100 times this year in a war of attrition with Hezbollah.
The group is fighting to oust Israeli soldiers from a
nine-mile-wide strip in southern Lebanon that Israel has held since
1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks across its border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has killed 20 Israeli soldiers this year and lost 37
men. Twenty-eight Lebanese civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S.-brokered understanding reached in April 1996 after
a 17-day Israeli air and artillery offensive against Hezbollah in
southern Lebanon, neither side may aim at civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah has fired Katyusha rockets at Israel several times
in response to the killing or wounding of Lebanese civilians by
Israeli forces or by their local militia ally, the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting sites hit Wednesday by the rockets, Mordechai accused
Hezbollah of ``blatantly violating'' the 1996 understanding by
deliberately aiming at civilians in response to accidental killings
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing the same distinction, Netanyahu said, ``In contrast to
the accident we had, in which civilians were tragically killed by
mistake, there was malicious intent here to kill civilians and
children on their way to school.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Qiryat Shemona attack reignited a debate here over the
military presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who was army chief of staff
in the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, said Israeli forces should
widen the buffer zone to prevent rocket attacks from reaching
border communities. The attack Wednesday was reportedly from areas
north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Party legislator who wants a withdrawal from Lebanon,
Yossi Beilin, said it was precisely the army's presence in the zone
that was causing conflict harmful to Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today in Qiryat Shemona is proof that the
security zone cannot insure normal life on the northern border,''
Beilin said in a radio interview. ``Staying there is a deathtrap.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it is prepared to withdraw if the
Lebanese guarantee security along the frontier. But Lebanon and the
main power broker in the country, Syria, have refused to provide
such assurances, saying Israel has to withdraw without conditions.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Ice-storm warnings were issued Wednesday for parts of the Gulf
States as freezing rain and freezing drizzle coated trees and power
lines from Texas eastward. The stage was set for icing once an
Arctic front stalled across the South this week, insuring only a
thin layer of cold air next to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ice will again glaze parts of the South Thursday as a thin layer
of Arctic air holds steady and relatively warm, moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico flows inland and rises over the thin Arctic wedge.
The greatest risk of icing will extend from the Tennessee Valley to
the southern and central Appalachians and then east to North
Carolina and southern Virginia, where lifting of Gulf air is
augmented by a pocket of strong jet stream winds.
</P>
<P>
   North of this icing zone, a stripe of light to moderate snow
will fall across northern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, southern
New Jersey and southeast Pennsylvania. A dusting to two inches of
snow are likely, with accumulations of three or four inches in the
mountains and along the coast, where Atlantic moisture is drawn
into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Storminess will resume in the Pacific Northwest as a jet stream
disturbance races inland near Vancouver Island. Increasing onshore
winds from the Pacific will import ocean moisture into western
Washington and Oregon, paving the way for rain. Heavy snow will
fall in the Cascades. Snow will also fall across eastern Washington
and Oregon, with freezing rain or sleet affecting areas where a
deep layer of cold air retreats in the face of advancing Pacific
air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Shallow Chill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freezing rain glazed Birmingham, Alabama, Thursday, as air
temperatures near the ground hovered at 31 degrees. Yet, 5,000 feet
aloft, temperatures were close to 50 degrees. Such a vertical
variance indicates the shallowness of the Arctic air mass that
invaded the Deep South this week. The caricature of the Arctic air
mass resembles a wedge of cheese, with the thinnest part of the
wedge directly behind the front that marked the leading edge of
Arctic air. But the front stalled across the South, keeping cities
such as Birmingham in shallow chill, which set the stage for
freezing rain.  &QL;

ANGELOU USES A LIGHT HAND IN DIRECTING DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever heard Maya Angelou read her poetry, you know of
her lilting voice and authoritative rhythms. She sounds so perfect,
it's as if no one else should read her works, yet they speak for an
experience shared by millions.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou doesn't bring that authority to ``Down in the Delta,''
her directorial debut; although it's directed by a poet, it
restricts its poetry to a few lyrical frames. The prosaic touch may
be a good thing. Too many first-time directors, especially those
from nonfilm disciplines, inflict a distracting self-consciousness
on their material, as if they needed to prove to themselves and the
audience that they're directing. Angelou, however, uses a light
hand for this simple story about unconditional love and not being a
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta, played by Alfre Woodard in a delicately modulated
performance, is a single Chicago mother _ and not a very good one,
at first. She's trying to put her life back together, but every
minor setback sends her back to the liquor store or the crack
house. Her family is becoming frayed; son Thomas (Mpho Koaho) is a
sharp preteen who hustles tourists by charging them for photographs
and is already taking on a fatalistic attitude. Young daughter
Tracy (Kulani Hassen) is autistic; she still stays in a playpen at
a time when most kids are pitter-pattering through the house.
Loretta's mom finally has enough of Loretta's antics and sends
Loretta and her family down to Biloxi, Miss., to learn a few life
lessons on Uncle Earl's farm.
</P>
<P>
   Life's not easy for Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), either; his wife
(Esther Rolle) is suffering from Alzheimer's, his lawyer son
(Wesley Snipes, not beating anyone up, for once) is distant, and
his all-chicken restaurant is dependent on a nearby
chicken-processing plant that may be closing. Freeman plays Earl
with saintly patience and world-weariness, as if he had aged to a
point where he decided that raising his voice was a waste of time.
He puts Loretta to work, and predictably enough, she starts coming
around.
</P>
<P>
   If all that sounds like the stuff of a TV movie, well, it is.
``Delta'' was destined for cable's Showtime before Miramax decided
to give it a theatrical release, and despite its summertime
setting, it's as Christmasy as a Waltons special. Angelou uses
restraint instead of manipulation; she's not out to jerk tears out
of you. She's also smart enough to let her experienced actors,
including Rolle in her last performance, do most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   She is hamstrung, though, by the movie's budget and Myron E.
Goble's TV-level script (its PG-13 rating seems harsh, considering
that it's for scenes of substance abuse that are hardly pro-drug).
Filming in and near Toronto, Angelou is unable to give the Delta
scenes a sense of place. You hear cicadas, but you don't feel the
sticky Mississippi summer (or see the river, or the Gulf _ or the
Delta, for that matter). Angelou's directorial debut is a modest,
qualified success, but it's mostly because of Woodard and Freeman,
as well as Koaho's fresh performance. It's sure to play well when
it returns to TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' is rated PG-13 for scenes of drug and
alcohol use.

CALDERON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Herminio Blanco, Mexico's secretary of Commerce and Industry,
says he would have laughed 10 years ago had someone told him that
his country would even approach Japan to become the United States'
second-largest trade partner behind Canada. Blanco, his country's
former chief NAFTA negotiator, would have laughed harder still at
the notion that Mexico would become the world's second-largest
recipient of foreign direct investment dollars among emerging
markets behind China. These days, Blanco and other Mexicans can
credit the five-year old trilateral pact for their trade success.
 &HT;    In 1997, Mexico was the United States' third-largest trading
partner, trailing Japan by less than US$20 billion. And since the
beginning of NAFTA in 1994, Mexico has averaged $11 billion per
year in foreign direct investment, according to the Mexican
government.
 &HT;    Between the 1997 Asian crisis and the economic uncertainty that
has since prevailed throughout the world, NAFTA has proven to be a
valuable trade agreement for all three countries, but especially
the United States, says Blanco. In 1998, every U.S. state
experienced negative growth in exports to Japan and Asia in 1998.
That was not the case with Mexico, he says.
 &HT;    U.S. exports to Asia dropped $14 billion during the first six
months of 1998 as compared to the previous year. U.S. exports to
Mexico and Canada, however, increased $11 billion during the same
period, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 &HT;    ``The exports to Canada and Mexico helped us preserve jobs and
growth,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told a
group of business leaders gathered in New York in October to
discuss foreign trade trends.
 &HT;    Sas Mexico's Blanco: ``Mexico was a safety net for all U.S.
exporters.''
 &HT;    U.S. exports to Mexico were expected to show double-digit growth
in 1998. During the first eight months, exports reached $51.3
billion, an increase of 14.2 percent over the same period in 1997,
according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Imports grew by 11.2
percent to $61.4 billion.
 &HT;    In 1997, total U.S.-Mexico trade stood at $158.5 billion, a 21.1
percent increase over 1996 and nearly twice the levels of 1993 _
the last year before NAFTA _ according to the International
Monetary Fund, which included trade from Mexico's maquiladoras. All
in all, U.S. trade with Mexico grew an average of nearly 18 percent
in the 1994-97 period.
 &HT;    The trade balance changed significantly before and after NAFTA.
Whereas the United States experienced two relatively minor deficits
and two surpluses in the 1990-93 period, it posted only one
relatively small surplus and three major deficits in the 1994-97
period. In 1997, the deficit had grown to a whopping $15.7 billion.
The deficit came despite strong export performance from the United
States. In the 1990-93 period, U.S. exports grew 46.7 percent,
while imports from Mexico grew 32.3 percent. In the 1994-97 period,
though, imports from Mexico _ growing 73.1 percent _ far outpaced
U.S. exports, which grew 40.4 percent.
 &HT;    The deficit was partly spurred by the 1994 Mexican peso crash.
It boosted Mexican exports but decreased Mexican imports. In 1996
and 1997, Mexico's economy turned around with exports continuing
growth, spurred by restructuring among many Mexican companies.
 &HT;    In 1997, U.S. exports to Mexico reached $71.4 billion, a 25.7
percent increase over 1996. Imports from Mexico grew by 17.6
percent, reaching $87.2 billion.
 &HT;    Canada's trade with Mexico also has grown at impressive levels,
both before and after NAFTA. Total bilateral trade went from $617
million in 1990 to $2.7 billion in 1993, an increase of 338
percent, according to IMF data. Average annual growth during that
four-year period was 59.7 percent. Between 1994 and 1997 trade went
from $3 billion to $4.1 billion, an increase of 34.3 percent.
Average annual growth during that period was 12.7 percent.
 &HT;    Unlike the U.S.-Mexican trade balance, Canada's trade with
Mexico has followed a consistent ``zig-zag'' pattern since 1990.
Starting with a Canadian surplus that year, the balance has given
each country a surplus or deficit every other year. In 1997, Mexico
boasted a surplus, with its exports to Canada of $2.1 billion
higher than imports of $1.9 billion.
 &HT;    Mexico's Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development
(known by its Spanish acronym SECOFI) projects that total trade
among Canada, Mexico and the United States could reach more than
$520 billion in 1998, up some $20 billion from 1997.
 &HT;    Two researchers at the University of Miami's North-South Center
argue in a recent book that NAFTA only reaffirmed an ongoing trend:
the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico are becoming
one. ``This process did not begin with NAFTA or the Canada-U.S.
Free Trade Agreement,'' the researchers, Stephen Blank and Jerry
Haar, writes in Making NAFTA Work. ``This profound change in
patterns, structures and strategies of business around the world,
and especially in North America, is being driven by the interlinked
forces of global competition, regulatory liberalization and
technology.''
 &HT;    Much of the success of NAFTA is attributed to the massive
reduction of tariffs on a wide range of goods and services. Before
NAFTA was signed, the Mexican tariff on U.S. goods, for example,
averaged 10 percent. Since NAFTA was signed, Mexico has reduced its
average applied tariffs on U.S. imports to an average of less than
3 percent. On the other side of the border, U.S. tariffs on Mexican
imports averaged just over 2 percent, but they have been cut in
half. And more than half of U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods do not
pay any duty at all.
 &HT;    A look at specific sectors shows how the increased trade has
translated into a boom for certain industries. A 1997 study by the
U.S. Trade Representative's Office found that the reduction in
tariff and non-tariff barriers helped to increase overall U.S.
exports of motor vehicles, electronic components, textiles and
apparel, computers, chemicals and a variety of agricultural
products. The study also noted that NAFTA increased U.S. imports of
Mexican textiles and apparel, and light trucks. The report reviewed
12 sectors, ranging from automotive vehicles and parts to
telecommunications equipment.
 &HT;    ``It is Mexico that has seen the most impressive trade benefits
by far, with its new unprecedented levels of access to the U.S. and
Canadian markets,'' says Carol Wise, a Johns Hopkins University
political science professor and a NAFTA expert who edited a book on
the impact of NAFTA on Mexico, ``The Post-NAFTA Political
Economy.''
 &HT;    Isaac Cohen, former director of the Washington office of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean, agrees. ``NAFTA is more important for Mexico and Canada
than for the United States,'' says Cohen, currently an economic
advisor for U.S.-based McConnell Vald es Consulting. ``NAFTA is
providing a set of rules under which investment and trade links
have intensified, reaching levels of interdependence that were
inconceivable without the (pact).''

<P>
   The three-man crew of the ICO Global Challenge became the first
balloonists to cross the Asian continent from one end to the other
on Wednesday, and the first to fly over the towering Himalayan
range.
</P>
<P>
   During the sixth day of their attempt to circle the world
nonstop, Richard Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett
completed their worrisome crossing of China and expected to reach
Japan before midnight EST Wednesday night, and thence the Pacific
Ocean. As their balloon left the Asian mainland at about 29,000
feet it entered a wind system bearing the craft eastward over the
Yellow Sea at nearly 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The crew relaxed after confronting a series of crises.
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment Tuesday, when it was too late to alter
course, China barred the balloon from entering Chinese airspace,
but in the succeeding hours, during which the crew feared that
Chinese fighters might shoot them down, diplomatic efforts on
behalf of the aeronauts prevailed. Wednesday morning the balloon
crossed the Chinese coast at a leisurely 47 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kendrick, the balloon's operations director in Uxbridge,
England, said in a telephone interview that the balloon's
acceleration to nearly 90 mph shortly after it left China was
especially welcome in view of various delays the balloon had
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by their meteorologists and ground team, Branson's crew
had to deal with Libya's initial refusal to grant overflight
permission, dodge dangerous thunderstorms over Turkey and thread a
complicated course avoiding Iraq, Iran and Russia. Completing a
safe trip over Afghanistan, India and Nepal, the balloonists found
themselves over China, where new problems awaited them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission team has calculated that we've had an average of
2.6 crises per day since the launch last Friday from Marrakesh,
Morocco,'' Kendrick said, ``and now we deserve some good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite detours imposed by diplomatic, military and weather
complications and despite a greater than expected consumption of
propane fuel for the balloon's hot-air burners, the successful
completion of a global circumnavigation ``has not been ruled out,''
Kendrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward only one segment at a time,'' he said.
``Now that we're past China, we're looking toward the 5,000-mile
flight across the Pacific _the most dangerous segment of the
round-the-world journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast jet-stream winds over the ocean could carry the balloon to
North America's west coast by Christmas Day, he said, ``but bad
weather east of Japan is kicking up 15-foot waves _ terrible
conditions if the balloon should be forced down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett, the American member of the British crew, has made four
previous solo attempts to circle the world, during the most recent
of which, starting from Mendoza, Argentina, he flew about 15,200
miles _ a record. That attempt ended on Aug. 16 when a violent
storm hit without warning, ripping his balloon and plunging his
unpressurized capsule into the Coral Sea about 500 miles east of
Australia. The crash was the closest shave ever for Fossett, a
wealthy 54-year-old commodities broker, yacht racer, long-distance
swimmer, Iditarod dog racer, mountain climber and balloonist.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash and his rescue by a passing yacht, he said he
was not sure he would ever attempt a transglobal balloon flight
again. But when Branson, his former main competitor, offered him a
berth on the ICO Global Challenge a few months later, Fossett
quickly accepted.

LORD SOPER, WHOSE PULPIT WAS HYDE PARK, DIES AT 95 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Rev. Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and Labor
peer who was the most famous and longest-running soapbox orator at
Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, died on Tuesday in London. He was
95.
</P>
<P>
   A strikingly handsome silver-haired man dressed in a black
cassock and white collar, he was always the one with the biggest
crowds at the paved northern end of the park that on every Sunday
since 1855 has been a gathering spot for robust debate, slashing
give and take and display of British eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of Speakers' Corner, he warmed to hecklers and
bested them with humor, charming them by addressing them as
``fatheads'' and ``rascals.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man who asked if after all God wasn't dead, he replied,
``Funny, I hadn't heard that He was unwell.'' To a very short man
who ridiculed his pacifism, saying, ``If I'm attacked, shouldn't I
defend myself?'' he looked down and said, ``In your case, I would
advise against it.''
</P>
<P>
   With stirring fluency of language, a prodigious vocabulary and a
sonorous gravely voice, he inveighed passionately against disparate
enemies including war, poverty, drinking, smoking, McCarthyism,
gambling, apartheid, blood sports, abortion, euthanasia,
exploitative employers, slave labor, capital punishment and profit.
Decades before they became fashionable, he campaigned for the
ordination of women, homosexual rights and vegetarian eating habits
to spare animals.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Socialist, he said that Christianity and capitalism
were incompatible. A republican, he chastised the Queen for going
to the races because he said it encouraged betting, Prince Philip
for playing polo on Sundays and the other members of the royal
family for hunting deer and foxes.
</P>
<P>
   He objected to the growing mention of sex, saying, ``It doubles
the crowd, but it halves the argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted on dwelling on sin. ``Talking about Christianity
without saying anything about sin is like discussing gardening
without saying anything about weeds,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   He was unshakable in his convictions, sticking to his absolute
pacifism even during World War II when German planes were bombing
the homes and work places of the people he was speaking to. Asked
in later years what he would do if the Russians invaded Britain, he
said, ``Welcome them with a cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   He had taken his crusade for radical causes outdoors for the
first time in 1926, speaking to dockers and other workers at Tower
Hill in East London, and he continued speaking there every
Wednesday even after he began his Sunday afternoon sermons in Hyde
Park in the early 1940s. No amount of London weather could cause
him to cancel, and he regularly harangued crowds in lashing rain
and blustery gales.
</P>
<P>
   He said his motto was ``Hit 'em as hard as you can as long as
it's above the belt,'' and he told The Times of London in 1991 that
he thrived on the twice weekly events because there were not many
opportunities for personal confrontation anymore. ``They have all
been swallowed up by public relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Oliver Soper was born in London on Jan. 31, 1903, to
deeply religious Methodist parents. He decided to become a minister
when he was 13, encouraged by his father, an insurance salesman and
temperance campaigner. His Methodist convictions deepened at
Cambridge where he was an undergraduate and the London School of
Economics, where he obtained a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   He had developed his ability to attract attention in school,
where he excelled as an athlete and an academic. In an incident,
though, that he said scarred him for life, a cricket ball he had
bowled bounced up errantly and struck an 18-year-old classmate in
the chest, killing him instantly. The young man had a defective
heart, it emerged.
</P>
<P>
   He began his inner city brand of ministry at the South London
Mission in 1926 and 10 years later became head of the West London
Mission, one of the city's great pulpits, where for the next 42
years he preached to throngs in the large Kingsway Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In his years there it became the biggest single social service
entity of any church in Britain, devoting its attentions
particularly to prisoners, homeless girls, unmarried mothers and
juvenile offenders. After his retirement in 1978, he continued with
his Sunday morning sermons at another Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Harold Wilson made him a life peer in 1965, and
he took the title Baron Soper of Kingsway. He spoke out frequently
on his favorite subjects in the House of Lords, campaigning for
higher taxes on liquor and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he founded an evangelical crusade for young people
called the Order of Christian Witness, and in 1988 he became the
chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, which campaigns
against hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he had suffered from arthritis, and he
increasingly used a wheelchair and had to be lifted in place to
deliver his weekly outdoor sermons. His wife, Marie, died in 1994,
and he is survived by four daughters, nine grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On his 90th birthday, he explained why he never retired from his
vigorous pastoral work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Methodist preacher, and I suppose in some respects I'm
peculiar in that I never wanted to do anything else,'' he said. ``I
never had any doubts that I was going to offer myself to the church
as a preacher, therefore you can say I'm an addict. Or you can say
I have a calling. But I'm committed. And that's not a credit to me.
It's just a condition.''
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished pianist, he loved the playing of Jelly Roll
Morton and collected jazz recordings. He could not, he said,
``contemplate heaven without the music of Bach and Fats Waller.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Herminio Blanco Mendoza, secretario de Comercio e Industria de
Mexico, dice que hace 10 anos se habria reido si alguien le hubiera
dicho que su pais se acercaria a Japon para convertirse en el
segundo socio comercial de Estados Unidos despues de Canada.
Blanco, que dirigio el equipo negociador mexicano del TLC, se
habria reido todavia mas ante la idea de que Mexico se convirtiera
en el segundo receptor a nivel mundial de inversion extranjera
directa entre los mercados emergentes, despues de China. Hoy,
Blanco y otros mexicanos pueden atribuir su exito comercial al
pacto trilateral firmado hace cinco anos.
 &HT;    En 1997, Mexico era el tercer socio comercial de Estados Unidos,
superado por Japon por menos de US$20.000 millones. Y desde que el
TLC entro en vigor en 1994, Mexico ha promediado US$11.000 millones
al ano en inversion extranjera directa, segun el gobierno mexicano.
 &HT;    Entre la crisis asiatica de 1997 y la incertidumbre economica
que desde entonces prevalece en el mundo, el TLC ha probado ser un
valioso acuerdo para sus tres paises integrantes, pero sobre todo
para Estados Unidos, dice Blanco. En 1998, todos los estados de
Estados Unidos tuvieron un crecimiento negativo de sus
exportaciones a Japon y a otros paises asiaticos. Pero no fue asi
con Mexico, senala.
 &HT;    Las exportaciones estadounidenses a Asia se redujeron en
US$14.000 millones en el primer semestre de 1998 con respecto al
ano anterior. Pero las exportaciones estadounidenses a Mexico y
Canada aumentaron US$11.000 millones en el mismo periodo, segun el
Departamento de Comercio de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``Las exportaciones a Canada y Mexico nos ayudaron a conservar
empleos y crecimiento,'' dijo Charlene Barshefsky, representante
comercial de Estados Unidos, a un grupo de lideres empresariales
reunidos en octubre en Nueva York para examinar las tendencias del
comercio exterior.
 &HT;    Blanco senala: ``Mexico fue una malla de seguridad para todos
los exportadores estadounidenses.''
 &HT;    Se esperaba que las exportaciones de Estados Unidos a Mexico
mostraran un crecimiento superior al 10 por ciento en 1998. En los
ocho primeros meses, las exportaciones llegaron a US$51.300
millones, 14,2 por ciento mas que en el mismo periodo de 1997,
segun el Departamento de Comercio de Estados Unidos. Las
importaciones crecieron el 11,2 por ciento a US$61.400 millones.
 &HT;    En 1997, el volumen total del comercio entre Estados Unidos y
Mexico fue de US$158,500 millones, 21,1 por ciento mas que en 1996
y casi dos veces el nivel de 1993, el ano anterior al TLC, segun el
Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), que incluyo el comercio de las
maquiladoras de Mexico. En total, el comercio estadounidense con
Mexico crecio un promedio de casi el 18 por ciento en el periodo de
1994 a 1997.
 &HT;    La balanza comercial cambio notablemente antes y despues del
TLC. Mientras Estados Unidos experimento dos superavit y dos
deficit relativamente menores en el lapso de 1990 a 1993, solo tuvo
un superavit relativamente pequeno y dos grandes deficit en el
periodo de 1994 a 1997. En 1997, el deficit habia crecido hasta la
abrumadora cifra de US$15.700 millones. El deficit se produjo a
pesar del fuerte desempeno de las exportaciones de Estados Unidos.
En el periodo de 1990 a 1993, las exportaciones estadounidenses
crecieron el 46,7 por ciento, mientras las importaciones de Mexico
aumentaron el 32,3 por ciento. Sin embargo, en el lapso de 1994 a
1997, las importaciones de Mexico (que crecieron el 73,1 por
ciento) superaron con creces las exportaciones de Estados Unidos,
que crecieron el 40,4 por ciento.
 &HT;    El deficit se debio en parte a la crisis del peso mexicano de
1994, que catapulto las exportaciones mexicanas pero hizo bajar las
importaciones. En 1996 y 1997, la economia mexicana se reactivo y
el ritmo de las exportaciones mantuvo su crecimiento vigoroso,
alentado por la reestructuracion de muchas empresas.
 &HT;    En 1997, las exportaciones estadounidenses a Mexico llegaron a
US$71.400 millones, 25,7 por ciento mas que en 1996. Las
importaciones de Mexico crecieron el 17,6 por ciento y llegaron a
US$87.200 millones.
 &HT;    El comercio de Canada con Mexico tambien ha crecido a un nivel
impresionante, tanto antes como despues del TLC. El volumen total
del comercio bilateral paso de US$617 millones en 1990 a US$2.700
millones en 1993, un incremento del 338 por ciento, segun datos del
FMI. El crecimiento promedio anual en ese periodo de cuatro anos
fue del 59,7 por ciento. Entre 1994 y 1997 el comercio paso de
US$3.000 millones a US$4.100 millones, un incremento del 34,3 por
ciento. El crecimiento promedio anual en ese periodo fue del 12,7
por ciento.
 &HT;    A diferencia de la balanza comercial entre Estados Unidos y
Mexico, el comercio de Canada con la nacion latinoamericana ha
seguido un uniforme rumbo en zigzag desde 1990. Comenzando con el
superavit canadiense ese ano, la balanza ha dado a cada pais un
superavit o un deficit un ano si y otro no. En 1997, Mexico tuvo un
superavit: sus exportaciones a Canada fueron de US$2.100 millones,
y sus importaciones de US$1.900 millones.
 &HT;    La Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial de Mexico
(SECOFI) calcula que el volumen comercial total entre Canada,
Mexico y Estados Unidos podria llegar a mas de US$520.000 millones
en 1998, unos US$20.000 millones mas que en 1997.
 &HT;    Dos investigadores del Recinto Norte-Sur de la Universidad de
Miami afirman en un libro reciente que el TLC no hizo mas que
reafirmar una tendencia en marcha: las economias de Estados Unidos,
Canada y Mexico se convierten en una sola. ``Este proceso no
comenzo con el TLC ni con el acuerdo de libre comercio entre Canada
y Estados Unidos,'' escriben los investigadores, Stephen Blank y
Jerry Haar, en Making NAFTA Work. ``Este cambio profundo en
modelos, estructuras y estrategias de negocios en todo el mundo, y
especialmente en Norteamerica, es impulsado por las fuerzas
entrelazadas de la competencia global, la liberalizacion de las
regulaciones y la tecnologia.''
 &HT;    Gran parte del exito del TLC se atribuye a la vasta reduccion de
los aranceles a una gran variedad de productos y servicios. Antes
de la firma del TLC, los aranceles mexicanos a los productos
estadounidenses, por ejemplo, promediaban el 10 por ciento. Desde
que se sello el acuerdo, Mexico ha reducido los aranceles a las
importaciones de Estados Unidos a un promedio de menos del 3 por
ciento. Al otro lado de la frontera, los aranceles a las
importaciones mexicanas promediaban poco mas del 2 por ciento, pero
se han reducido a la mitad. Y mas de la mitad de los productos
mexicanos que entran en Estados Unidos no pagan ningun arancel.
 &HT;    Un vistazo a sectores especificos muestra como el incremento del
comercio ha dado lugar a un auge de ciertas industrias.
 &HT;    Un estudio realizado en 1997 por el Representante Comercial de
Estados Unidos hallo que la reduccion de las barreras arancelarias
y no arancelarias contribuyo a incrementar las exportaciones
estadounidenses de vehiculos de motor, componentes electronicos,
productos textiles y ropa, computadoras, productos quimicos y una
variedad de productos agricolas.
 &HT;    El estudio tambien senalo que el TLC incremento las
importaciones mexicanas de ropa y textiles mexicanos, asi como de
camiones ligeros. El informe reviso 12 sectores, entre ellos el
automotriz y las telecomunicaciones.
 &HT;    ``Es Mexico el que ha recibido con creces las ventajas
comerciales mas impresionantes, con sus nuevos niveles sin
precedentes de acceso a los mercados de Estados Unidos y Canada``,
dice Carol Wise, profesora de ciencias politicas de la Universidad
Johns Hopkins y especialista en el TLC, que edito un libro sobre el
impacto del pacto comercial en Mexico, The Post-NAFTA Political
Economy.
 &HT;    Isaac Cohen, ex director de la oficina en Washington de la
Comision Economica de Naciones Unidas para America Latina y el
Caribe (CEPAL), coincide. ``El TLC es mas importante para Mexico y
Canada que para Estados Unidos,'' dice Cohen, que actualmente es
asesor economico de la firma estadounidense McConnell Valdes
Consulting. ``El TLC proporciona una serie de regulaciones bajo las
cuales se han intensificado la inversion y los vinculos
comerciales, que han llegado a niveles de interdependencia
inconcebibles sin el tratado.''

COMMENTARY: UNDER THE VOLCANO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan ambassador, Francisco Aguirre Facasa, still
seemed stunned by the magnitude of the catastrophe. He noted that
the deluge _ 30 to 60 inches of rain in just three or four days _
came at the tail end of the monsoon season. The country was already
saturated when the storm, unimaginably violent, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst natural disaster ever to hit the Western
Hemisphere,'' said Aguirre Facasa.
</P>
<P>
   Roads, bridges, homes, businesses, crops, livestock and
thousands of people were destroyed when Hurricane Mitch tore
through Central America in late October. Honduras and Nicaragua
were hit the worst. The story would have gotten much more coverage
in the United States if Monica and Bill had not had such a
stranglehold on the news.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen villages in northwestern Nicaragua were buried
when the walls of a volcano gave way after its crater filled with
water. Two thousand or more people were killed. The mayor of a
nearby town said at the time, ``It is like a desert littered with
buried bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre Facasa talked about the ``killer landslides'' and
rampaging rivers in a telephone conversation Wednesday.
``Altogether they cost us 4,000 lives,'' he said. ``At one point,
we had 900,000 people homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The waters are receding but the emotional, physical and economic
devastation remains. Doctors who returned to New York this week
from a humanitarian mission to Nicaragua spoke of the sense of
depression and despondency they found in large segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have lost relatives, their jobs, their homes, all of
their possessions,'' said Dr. Paula Rackoff, who was one of three
physicians from Beth Israel Medical Center in New York who
volunteered to go to Nicaragua. The trip was jointly sponsored by
the hospital and a humanitarian group, the American Jewish World
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people seen by Dr. Rackoff and her colleagues, Dr.
Lauren Shaiova and Dr. Michelle Torres, were women and children
living in wretched circumstances. Families were crammed into
schools, churches, outdoor encampments and other emergency
shelters. They did not have enough food. Sanitation was poor,
medical supplies were scarce and there was widespread suffering
from dehydration, infections and other ailments that are easily
treatable under ordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The problems wrought by the hurricane were compounded by the
fact that Nicaragua was desperately poor to begin with. Many
families were struggling to meet their most basic needs before the
hurricane hit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rackoff said she was surprised by the absence of men and the
plight of the women in the villages. ``We all had this gnawing
question of where the men were,'' she said. ``We were told over and
over that the women were really in charge of the household and the
men had very little responsibility. The women often have many
children. The average number is six, with a few different
fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors visited clinics in five villages, including a
women's health center in Tipitapa, offering what Dr. Rackoff
described as ``the very basics'' of primary care. Much of what they
encountered had nothing to do with the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of venereal disease, which we weren't prepared
for,'' said Dr. Rackoff. ``The women running the health center told
us they really needed medication for pelvic inflammatory disease,
which we didn't have, and that there is a lot of stage one cervical
cancer, which is curable. It's an outpatient procedure here. They
don't even have speculums in the women's center.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rackoff said there were many requests for birth control
pills and condoms. She said, ``The women seem like they really want
to take care of themselves, but they don't know which way to
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans remain homeless and short of
food and medical help. Christoph Gorder, the project director for
the humanitarian group AmeriCares, said that during a recent visit
to Nicaragua relief workers pleaded with him ``to get meals for the
people for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCares is about to send a 63,000-pound shipment of medicine
and hospital supplies to Nicaragua, but the level of need there and
in other parts of Central America is staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a very difficult Christmas,'' he said.

MUSCOVITES COME UP WITH CASH FOR CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Their buying power battered, their savings lost in
failed banks, Muscovites are putting a tough year behind them and
plunking down their devalued rubles for holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   With full shelves, cheery staff and decked halls, Stockmann, a
sparkling new Finnish-owned department store, is happy to oblige
them. At first glance, the scene does not look it belongs in a city
struggling through its worst economic crisis in years. But the
buyers tell another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard this year, because my expenses have not decreased,
but my income has,'' said Valery Shalamov, a 35-year-old
entrepreneur shopping in the interior design department. Shalamov
says he did not lose all of his money, and he will probably give
friends and loved ones gold jewelry, like he did last year. ``But
there is not the same holiday feel as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the August economic meltdown, Moscow was what some
described as a boomtown, where shining office buildings and
post-modern malls went up at an astonishing rate. Now the boom is
over, evident by the empty spaces outside Stockmann's and
throughout the rest of the unfinished Smolensky Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The panic buying and long lines of the first days of the crisis
are a long gone, but for many people, life has not returned to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the crisis has affected my life, since my salary was
in rubles,'' Alfia Safuanova, 25, who works at an oil company, as
she looked over Stockmann's collection of crystal dishes. Like many
upscale stores, Stockman sets its prices in dollars. The Russian
currency has lost 70 percent of its value since August, putting
many once-affordable items out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Muscovites continue to buy. One possible reason is the
estimated $20 billion in US dollars Russians have hidden under
their matresses. Not everyone kept their cash in banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis hurt my company, but although it affected my mood,
it did not affect my personal financial situation that much,'' said
a Stockmann shopper who gave only his first name, Ave. ``It takes
more than that to get to me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BABYLON, Iraq _ Here beside the ruins of one of history's
greatest cities, the frustrations of modern Iraqis seem especially
poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Little remains of Babylon's legendary glory. Desert sands long
ago swallowed up the hanging gardens that were among the wonders of
the ancient world. Archaeologists who uncovered the splendid Ishtar
Gate at the beginning of this century shipped it off to Berlin.
Most of the other treasures found here are now at museums in
Germany, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Great emperors like Darius, Xerxes, Alexander and Nebuchadnezzar
fought for and ruled this region, and today, together with the rest
of Iraq, it is once again a battleground. President Saddam Hussein
is determined to maintain his rule, but the United States and
Britain want to drive him from power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled from 605 to 562 B.C., brought
his empire to a peak of wealth and power, it is perhaps inevitable
that Saddam would seek to bask in his glory. A billboard that
greets visitors to Babylon is dominated by portraits of both men.
</P>
<P>
   At the site where the royal complex once stood, a poster
proclaims, ``From Nebuchadnezzar to Saddam Hussein, Babylon Invokes
Its Glories on the Path of Jihad and Glorious Development.''
</P>
<P>
   But in nearby villages there is little to evoke past triumphs.
Eight years of economic sanctions have left the region around
Babylon severely deprived.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. They were intended to force him to limit his
rearmament program, compensate Kuwaitis for the damage he wreaked
on their country, account for those missing, and respect human
rights within his own country.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, which ban nearly all foreign trade, have produced
little progress toward those goals. They have, however, reduced
many Iraqis to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Iraq's defeat in Kuwait, the United Nations approved
a plan under which the Iraqi government could sell limited amounts
of oil and use the profits to buy food. At first Saddam refused to
accept the plan, fearing that it would be used as an excuse to
maintain the sanctions indefinitely. In 1996, he changed his mind,
and from that moment the lives of ordinary Iraqis improved from
wretched to simply bad.
</P>
<P>
   Oil sales now pay for more than $5 billion worth of food each
year, the largest aid effort in the history of the United Nations.
More than 250 U.N. aid workers who monitor the program left Iraq
before last week's allied bombing raids but began returning Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program has been the major change in life here since the
bad times began eight years ago,'' said a European diplomat based
in Baghdad. ``It's of really major importance to the Iraqi people,
because it provides a basic ration to millions of people who might
otherwise starve.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the aid program, each Iraqi is entitled to a basic monthly
ration of flour, cooking oil, tea, salt, sugar, rice, dried beans
and soap. Families with small children also receive powdered infant
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for that ration,'' said Nima Mutar, 71, a father of
10 who manages his household on a monthly budget of about $20.
``Before it started we were really suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutar, whose small home is a mile from the ruins of Babylon, can
now feed his family, but just barely. His adult sons, one a factory
worker and the other a roadside vegetable vendor, earn only a
fraction of what they earned a decade ago. In those days the family
ate meat and vegetables every night; now they are luxuries reserved
for once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear rumors that the U.N. is going to start giving us eggs
and milk,'' Mutar said. ``That would be great, because we don't
want our little girls to get sick.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the Mutar family and others around Babylon who drink impure
water, live on an inadequate diet and have no access to
vaccinations, the specter of illness is ever-present and
terrifying. They know that patients who enter the clinic in nearby
Mahawil are likely to die there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no tools for diagnosis, no ultrasound equipment, no
supply of fresh syringes, hardly any basic medicine, and an X-ray
machine that only works when the power is on,'' lamented Buthayna
Shibil, 26, a doctor who sees a dozen infants and small children
die each month. ``If there were no sanctions, almost everyone who
comes here would be home healthy in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington say that they are prepared to consider a
widening of the oil-for-food program but insist that sanctions
remain in place until Saddam is deposed or drastically changes his
policies. Ms. Shibil said she could not comprehend that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents come in here crying for mercy and beg me to save their
children,'' she said as she looked helplessly down on a
malnourished infant afflicted with a blood infection that she said
was likely to kill him within a few days. ``When they die, the
parents ask me, `Why couldn't you do anything?' I tell them it is
because of the war, because America is making war on the Iraqi
people. Americans want sickness and disease and death in Iraq. They
want Iraqi people to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Prakash Shah, chief U.N. representative in Iraq, said money that
came into Iraq under the oil-for-food program ``is not by any
measure enough to meet the needs here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still see a lot of malnutrition and terrible health
problems,'' Shah said in an interview. ``If you compare conditions
here to what they were before this all started, you have to admit
that they are really quite miserable.''

CONNECTICUT ACTS TO PLUG FLEET CONSUMER LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut authorities have subpoenaed documents from
Fleet Financial Group Inc. and other institutions as part of an
investigation into whether bank customers are getting the financial
privacy they expect.
</P>
<P>
   The action, by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal,
marks the first time the state has named a specific bank as part of
its inquiry into an underground trade in bank-account information.
</P>
<P>
   With other New England officials, Blumenthal is examining
whether a group of small private investigative firms used false
pretexts to learn the specifics of dozens of consumer bank
accounts. Such data isn't supposed to be released without customer
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is not a target of the investigation, Blumenthal said in
an interview Wednesday. The bank said it is cooperating with the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   But the subpoenas, sent out last month and disclosed Wednesday,
suggest Fleet and other banks may come under scrutiny themselves
for their dealings with the asset-search firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Blumenthal's office filed a civil complaint against
one such firm, Norwalk-based NRS Information Services Inc. and its
owner, Frederick Acker.
</P>
<P>
   The state alleges NRS employees routinely tricked
telephone-service employees at financial institutions into
disclosing data by impersonating bank customers. As a result,
according to the complaint, ``Numerous persons have had their
private financial information unlawfully purloined and sold to
third parties'' such as collections agents.
</P>
<P>
   The state also alleges in its complaint that NRS practices
included ``contacting employees at financial institutions and
paying those employees to provide private financial information on
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint doesn't name any institutions where activities
took place, and Blumenthal declined Wednesday to discuss whether
Fleet employees were among those who received payments. But he said
the inquiry is continuing and that such behavior could open a bank
to civil suits by the state or by individuals whose records were
improperly accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Acker's attorney, Frederick Ury, said his client denies the
state's allegations, inlcuding the notion that NRS paid bank
insiders for information, and said he plans to defend against them
``vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether NRS ever did work directly on Fleet's
behalf. In 1996, the bank hired another firm in Connecticut, Summer
Associates, to research the assets of a developer who had defaulted
on some loans. He later complained about the tactics used to check
up on him. That firm, which like NRS has been closed, remains under
investigation by the state.
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints, Fleet ceased doing business with
Summer in 1996 and, earlier this year, stopped using outside
asset-search firms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fleet spokesman Jim Mahoney said the bank is trying
to make its own employees more guarded with telephone callers who
may seek information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been more attention to these issues in recent
months, and procedures have been tightened'' as a result, said
Mahoney said. For example, the bank now often requires callers to
provide specific information such as account numbers and maiden
names.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the records from Fleet, Blumenthal's office also
has subpoenaed records from a Connecticut law firm and from a
credit-reporting agency, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to identify either organization, but the complaint
against NRS states the company ``unlawfully'' obtained consumer
credit reporters from one of two leading credit-reporting agencies,
Equifax Inc. in Atlanta and the former credit-reporting units of
TRW which are now part of Experian Corp. in Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday, spokesmen for both companies said they
couldn't immediately comment.

   HURLYBURLY-FILM (New York) _ David Rabe's scathing 1984 play
``Hurlyburly'' about the volatile lives of a group of Hollywood
bottom-feeders, will open Friday in New York and Los Angeles for a
weeklong run to quality for the Oscar race, before a nationwidfe
release in January. Made a year ago on a puny budget of $4 million,
a sum that no doubt would have had the movie's jaded industry types
in stitches, ``Hurlyburly'' features a powerhouse ensemble that
includes Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Anna Paquin, Chazz
Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn and Garry Shandling, playing an
assortment of shallow, self-absorbed, cocaine-snorting,
hair-trigger-tempered opportunists alternately indulging in and
resisting their basest impulses. By Peter Marks. (Moved).

   DANCE-YEAREND (subslug) (Undatee) _ Among the titans, Jerome
Robbins was arguably the most original of choreographers. He
regarded the New York City Ballet as a continuing experiment and
his death in July robs the company of a major creative voice that
influenced its profile for 50 years. Along with Michel Fokine,
George Balanchine, Antony Tudor and Frederick Ashton, Robbins was
one of the 20th century's greatest ballet choreographers. By Anna

   DESMOND-RICHARDSON-DANCE (Undated) _ In an advertisement now
running for ``Fosse: A Celebration in Dance,'' the ballet and
modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in profile, his hands on
his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle on his head. One leg
is straight and the other bent. He wears ballet slippers. Sheathed
only in tights and a vest, his remarkably muscular body looks
sculptured. In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater
in New York City, where it opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in
``Mr. Bojangles,'' a tender tribute to dancers past their prime. By

   KIRCHSCHLAGER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Ms. Angelika Kirchschlager, at

at a time when opera houses are flush with excellent mezzos. Yet
thanks in large part to her rapport with audiences, Ms.
Kirchschlager stands out. On Thursday evening, she will make her

   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ Executives from the major
classical-music recording companies often speak about their work
with a sense of mission. But it is hard to discern much mission at
this time of market glut, as the major labels seem to flail about,
desperately trying to figure out what will sell. The glut comes not
just from further reduplications of the standard repertory by
heavily promoted new performers but also from countless reissues of
almost anything, and gimmicky collections like ``The Best of
Tchaikovsky'' or ``Ten Tenors in Prayer.'' By Anthony Tommasini.

   TV-MEGA-MOVIES (Hollywood) _ ``Big'' (if not, strictly speaking,
different) is the rallying cry in the made-for-television-movie
world these days. Staggeringly expensive epics are prime cannon
fodder during sweeps periods, the thrice-yearly ratings matchups
that determine advertising rates for the entire year. These
mega-mini-series or mega-movies _ NBC calls them Big Events _
contain exotic locations, stellar international casts and/or lavish
special effects. A majority contain all three. A typical two-hour
network television movie costs $3 million; these cost approximately
$12 to $35 million each. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).

<P>
   KENTE-CLOTH-ART (Undated) _ Kente cloth's iconic powers are both
considerable and quite possibly singular. For centuries, Asante and
Ewe royalty in Ghana have worn gloriously colored kente of fine
silk on state occasions. The garments have lent a grandeur to the
festivities, and more important, they have been a means for
chieftains to proclaim their authority and wealth. Small wonder
that kente has become an almost universal totem of black identity.
``Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente and African-American Identity,''
an exhaustive exhibition at the Newark Museum organized by Doran H.
Ross, the director of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the
University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Anne
Spencer, the curator of Africa, the Americas and the Pacific at the
Newark Museum. For the uninitiated and aficionados alike, its 185
examples of traditional and modern kente offer insight into the
fabric's history, evolution and cultural significance. The exhibit
remains on view in Newark through Jan. 3 and then travels to the
Fowler Museum, the National Museum of African Art in Washington and
the Detroit Museum of African-American History. By Fletcher
Roberts. (Moved).

   Georgia O'Keeffe's ``Skunk Cabbage'' has taken root at the
Montclair Art Museum. The 1922 painting has been donated to the
museum by Henry H. Ploch of Clifton, N.J., a longtime supporter.
The painting is the first O'Keeffe in the collection of the museum,
which specializes in 19th-and 20th-century works by artists like
Alexander Calder, Maurice Prendergast, Max Weber, Marsden Hartley,
John Marin, Charles Burchfield and Arthur Dove. ``Skunk Cabbage''
will hang in the museum's lobby from February to May and will
become a part of a permanent collection installation that is to
open in 2002.

   A tentative contract agreement with the New York Pops was
announced Wednesday by Local 802 of the American Federation of
Musicians. The orchestra canceled its holiday concerts a week ago
when its freelance musicians struck after negotiations over wages
broke down. The union did not disclose terms of the agreement,
pending a ratification vote that will not take place until after
the orchestra returns in mid-January from a tour of Japan.
Musicians of 11 New York freelance orchestras have been working
without contracts since September, and the New York Pops agreement
prompted hope that it would provide a pattern for other
settlements. The musicians are continuing to strike the Little
Orchestra Society.

   FINE ROMANCE
</P>
<P>
   With Susan Jaffe leading off in the title role, American Ballet
Theater will bring its production of ``The Merry Widow'' to the New
Jersey Performing Arts Center's Prudential Hall in Newark for five
performances beginning on Monday and ending on Jan. 3. Derived from
Franz Lehar's 1905 comic operetta, set to his music and
choreographed by Ronald Hynd for the Australian Ballet in 1975, the
American Ballet Theater version of the internationally popular tale
of romance and social intrigue will be danced by such stars as
Ashley Tuttle, Julie Kent, Christine Dunham, Jose Manuel Carreno
and Angel Corella.

<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The artists' community Yaddo, which will observe its 100th
anniversary in 2000, has received $1 million for its Centennial
Gift Campaign. The contribution _ $500,000 from the private equity
firm Spencer Trask &AMP; Co. and $500,000 from its founder and
chairman, Kevin Kimberlin, and his wife, Joni _ is the largest
single gift to Yaddo since April.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the novelist Patricia Highsmith bequeathed her
entire estate, valued at $3 million, to the 400-acre community in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Yaddo was founded by Spencer and Katrina
Trask, husband and wife, to provide artists with a supportive
environment where they would find uninterrupted time to think,
create and work. Kimberlin named his company for Trask (1844-1909),
an early backer of Thomas Edison.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ With the brief distant fury of battle passed, the
American troops at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia gathered
in the early morning hours Wednesday for a post-Desert Fox,
pre-Christmas celebration, anticipating praise from the defense
secretary and music by Carole King, Mary Chapin Carpenter and David
Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Only there was no concert, no raucous USO roadshow to cheer the
troops as they prepared to spend yet another holiday in the desert,
trying to keep down President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute the American Embassy pulled the plug, fearing
that a show could offend the sensibilities of the Saudi hosts
during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen still managed to rouse lusty
cheers when he reannounced the Pentagon plan to increase military
pay and pensions. And Ms. King sang an a cappella version of
``You've Got a Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to hide the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a shame to bring all this equipment all this way and
not play,'' a member of the traveling party grumbled as Cohen and
the United Services Organization entourage boarded a C-17 jet bound
for its next stop on a whirlwind holiday tour with the troops.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a paradox that captured the complexities of
the American military presence in the Persian Gulf, it is that the
United States could continue bombing after the dawn-to-dusk fasts
of Ramadan began on Friday night but feel uncomfortable allowing a
Christmas concert to thank the troops in Saudi Arabia, one of its
closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like bringing the circus to Jerusalem during Yom
Kippur,'' a Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said by way of
explaining the unease that Saudi rulers feel not only toward
perceived insensitivity to Ramadan, but also to overt displays of
Christianity, like Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has portrayed the four nights of
strikes against Iraq as a success that has badly weakened Saddam's
military. But the attack, by far the largest campaign that
President Clinton has ordered, has done little to change the
prospect that American forces will have to remain in Saudi Arabia
and in other gulf outposts for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the strikes' sounding the apparent end to the
United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq, the United States will
have to rely more than ever on the threat of force to check Saddam,
even as the ambivalence about the American presence deepens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should have fixed permanent bases out here,''
said Marines Corp Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of American forces
in the region, who led the Iraq strikes. ``I think that sends the
wrong message. Our presence here is temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, ``I think for a long time we'll have forces
here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With each passing year the amenities for the troops improve. The
4,000 Americans at Prince Sultan are slowly moving from tents to
permanent housing put up by the Saudis. All the bases now have
American fast-food restaurants, cable television and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Airman Chiffon Goss, 18, who oversees the local workers in the
mess hall at Prince Sultan, said she first heard that the air and
missile strikes had begun Thursday morning, Saudi time, when an
e-mail arrived from her mother, who was watching CNN in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the holiday season many bend the strict prohibitions that the
Saudis impose. Deep in the communications tent, a furtive four-foot
Christmas tree twinkled on a table. ``We try our best,'' Staff Sgt.
Ricardo Aponte said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rolling waves of deployments _ where one squadron or
brigade or ship replaces other, over and over _ have strained
morale, training and readiness. Many troops interviewed here were
on their second, third or fourth tours since the Gulf War ended in
1991. Zinni said the record was 10.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the troops, the attack on Iraq proved a short-lived,
though eminently satisfying distraction from the day-to-day routine
of launching aircraft to patrol the ``no flight'' zone that was
established over southern Iraq in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't your everyday
get-up-and-launch-the-planes-for-no-reason kind of day,'' Chief
Petty Officer Russ Celia, 37, of Whitbey Island, Wash., said in an
interview Wednesday aboard his ship, the aircraft carrier
Enterprise. It was, he said, was his fourth tour in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise, the nation's first nuclear carrier, played a
large role in the attack, with its F-18's, F-14's and EA-6B's
conducting about half of the 250 combat missions flown by American
or British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Michael Shoemaker, a pilot of an F-18 who flew into
Iraq each of the four nights, did not believe at first that they
were actually going into battle, recalling the last-minute order to
abort an attack in November. ``I kept thinking they'd call it
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, 38, who has flown for the Navy for 16 years but never
before in combat, said the attacks by his squadron, the
Gunslingers, had been successful, despite antiaircraft fire that
intensified as they neared Baghdad, but he said it would take time
to assess the long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spool it up each time Saddam acts up,'' he said. ``Most of
the guys around here say enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cohen, Zinni and the USO, the spirit of the tour picked up
considerably aboard the Enterprise _ ``four and a half acres of
sovereign U.S. territory,'' the Navy likes to say _ and even more
so Wednesday night at a visit to Army and Marine troops at Camp
Doha, near the Kuwaiti capital, where there was no qualms about
allowing the concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise is leaving the gulf, as soon as Christmas Eve,
replaced by the Carl Vinson, which arrived in time to take part in
the fourth day of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, finally unbound, included the improbable scenes of
the secretary of defense ``doing the Locomotion'' and Ms. King
leading the battled-tested crew assembled on the Enterprise's deck
in a sing-a-long of one of her best-known songs, ``(You Make Me
Feel Like) A Natural Woman.''

   HOUSTON _ Freezing rain coated highways with a thin, sometimes
invisible cape of ice Wednesday in an expanse several hundred miles
wide that stretched from Central Texas to the Carolinas, as
unseasonably frigid winds swept out of the northwest and pushed
their way toward the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of wrecks and fatalities were reported in a half-dozen
states. In the most freakish incident, a pair of apparently
unrelated accidents that occurred just a few minutes apart on
opposite sides of the same Interstate 35 overpass in Austin just
after 1 a.m. Wednesday resulted in a 58-car pileup that left two
people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted more sleety, slushy, icy messes Wednesday
night as the front slides gradually to the east and north. Traffic
officials throughout much of the Southeast warned travelers to go
slow or stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   Highs on Wednesday were in the single digits in the Upper
Plains, in the teens and 20s from the Central Plains into South
Texas and in the 30s and 40s in northern portions of the other Gulf
Coast states and into the West. It fell to 26 degrees in Las Vegas,
21 degrees near San Diego. Officials in California's San Joaquin
Valley worried that freezing temperatures would severely damage the
region's fruit crops.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, significant accumulations of snow had fallen
across the northern Great Lakes states, upstate New York and the
mountains of New England _ leading to good news, at least, for some
of the regions' snow-starved ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   Snow was also in the forecast for Philadelphia and other parts
of the Northeast, just in time for Christmas. But the areas of the
country hardest hit Wednesday, particularly Texas and Tennessee,
had only a bleak Christmas in the forecast, with predictions of
more freezing rain and sleet.
</P>
<P>
   The two accidents that began the Austin pileup were relatively
minor, but approaching cars were unable to stop and began plowing
into one another in both the north and south bound lanes of the
interstate at the Highway 290 overpass on the city's north side,
said Kevin Buchman, an Austin police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Two people involved in those secondary collisions, a 19-year-old
woman who was in one of the northbound cars and a 30-year-old man
who was in a southbound car, both of them from Austin, were killed
in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Root, who managed to drive through the mess without
crashing, described the scene. ``I noticed my windshield was
freezing over,'' he told The Associated Press. ``I started to slow
down. As I hit the brakes, I started sliding. I looked to my left,
a car was sliding. I looked to my right, a car was sliding. A
somehow threaded the needle between the two cars. There were wrecks
to the left of me, there were wrecks to the right of me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Central and South Texas, which rarely sees such conditions
and had been enjoying temperatures in the middle 70s just a few
days ago, officials frantically tried to warn motorists how to
drive on ice and what to do if their heat goes out. Houston police
issued a two-page primer on ``Driving in Inclement Weather,''
including warnings to ``make all your maneuvers smooth'' and
``avoid changing direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin police responded to 350 accident reports between midnight
and 11 a.m., Buchman said. Other departments around the state were
reporting similar figures, far above what they would normally have
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Four other deaths were reported on Texas roads; a
seven-month-old baby and another man were killed in separate
accidents on I-10 near San Antonio, a Fort Worth man was killed
when his car slid into a fence, and a 33-year-old man from
Duncanville was killed when his car slid into a highway sign on
I-20 near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The San Angelo State School was without heat Monday night in
19-degree temperatures when a water line broke, forcing officials
to keep the 317 mentally disabled residents warm with blankets and
space heaters. Heat was restored Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and other Texas
cities were also reporting a huge influx of cold, homeless people
and some said they were running out of coats and blankets. ``We are
at full capacity, but we're not going to turn anyone away,'' said
Gary Brown, director of the Star of Hope Men's Shelter in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous flights were delayed or canceled early Wednesday at
Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport as efforts to de-ice the
planes and clear runways bogged down. Many offices and businesses
through the state were hastily closed Wednesday as the extent of
the weather emergency became evident, and classes were canceled at
many of the colleges and trade schools still in session.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma police reported 14 traffic fatalities during the storm
that blanked much of the state with sleet and ice, and there was a
five-mile backup at the Texas border on I-35 on Wednesday morning.
A Tulsa man was found dead in his home from carbon monoxide
poisoning, apparently caused by a portable heater.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy ice felled power lines and tree branches in Jackson, Miss.
Other traffic deaths were reported this week in Kansas, Missouri,
Arkansas and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials warned of the effects of such a sudden drop in
temperatures and asked people to take special precautions to guard
against the frigid winds. A 76-year-old woman was found dead in her
nursing home parking lot in Brighton, Colo., where temperatures
fell below zero. And a 73-year-old man fell through the ice while
fishing Tuesday in Cherry Creek State Park in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The same weather system also brought much of central Tennessee
to a standstill. Brian Jones, a dispatcher for the Tennessee
Highway Patrol, said the number of accident on area highways was
``uncountable,'' as most roads were ``ice-covered and very
hazardous'' and there were several multi-car pileups.
</P>
<P>
   South of Nashville, several miles of I-24 were closed for four
hours Wednesday morning due to the weather, and even three hours
after one lane was reopened the traffic was ``barely moving out
there,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely, we're going to have several more closures in
the next day or so,'' he said, and the stretch of I-24 over
Monteagle Mountain, north of Chattanooga, would be ``probably the
first to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleet was falling throughout the day in Tennessee, but
forecasters said it would turn to freezing rain overnight. Alarmed
residents were reminded of a ruinous 1994 ice storm that hit
central Tennessee particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who lived for five or six days without power a few
years ago are dreading it,'' said Robert Hicks, a music executive
who lives in a rural area of Williamson County, southwest of
Nashville.

WHEN AN UPSETTING CHANGE ENCROACHES, LET IT BE, LET IT BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Pleasantville,'' a fantasy now playing at cinemas, two
teenagers are sucked into a TV show from the 1950s where everything
is black and white, mom always cooks meatloaf and nothing ever
changes.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a description of the real 1950s so much as a certain
mind-set. The two '90s kids explode that mind-set by introducing
change. At the end of the movie, the couple who reminded us of Ward
and June Cleaver are sitting on a bench. One asks the other,
``What'll happen next?''
</P>
<P>
   The other says, ``I don't know.'' The picture ends _ and life
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The future we don't know is the issue explored in Virginia
Postrel's book, ``The Future and Its Enemies'' (Free Press, $25).
It attempts to plant the subversive idea among Internet
entrepreneurs, biotechnologists, architects, builders, video
artists and other agents of social change that they have a common
claim to elbowroom.
</P>
<P>
   This is a political book. Postrel, a columnist for Forbes
magazine, argues that an increasing number of public issues revolve
around how to deal with new ways of doing things. Whether it's a
fight over trade, genetic patents, breast implants, mobile phones,
bovine growth hormone, video games, high-definition TV, Wal-Mart,
encryption or human cloning, the issue is: What do we do about
this?
</P>
<P>
   One group says: Stop it. These, says Postrel, are the
reactionaries, who want to preserve the past.
</P>
<P>
   Another group says: Control it. These are the technocrats, the
believers in the One Best Way.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups, Postrel says, envision a static, engineered future.
Her argument is for the people who create a dynamic, uncertain
future. It's not always clear how their projects will work out, but
that's OK. Let them experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Their projects should always be open to criticism. That's part
of the scientific method. Some projects cannot be tolerated at all,
but leave lots of room for ones that can. Don't insist that each
experimenter promise in advance that nothing will change. You can't
live in Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that interference is democratic. Referring
everything to a public meeting, she says, is merely to give
``self-appointed activists the power to veto other people's
experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   When the car was invented, should our ancestors have decided its
fate in a public meeting? How about TV? The birth control pill?
(They did try to control the Pill. TV, too.)
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic society, Postrel argues, should set the limits of
experimentation with ``broadly applicable and rarely changed
principles'' of common law rather than detailed rules.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Howard's ``The Death of Common Sense'' was a brilliant
assault on detailed rules. But he argued that the answer was to
give discretionary power to public officials. Postrel argues that
the power belongs to citizens. In her view, the best order is
spontaneous. The future arrives like coffee bars, home schooling or
mother-in-law apartments _ unplanned.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-20th century, people envisioned an engineered,
obedient future _ something like Isaac Asimov's ``Foundation.''
Everything would be one great machine, and it would all work.
Instead, we got the personal computer and the Internet. In their
current form, these are largely the product of unplanned private
experiments _ sometimes people pursuing money, and sometimes people
horsing around.
</P>
<P>
   As much as possible, Postrel argues, such people should be left
alone. As John Perry Barlow said in his Declaration of the
Independence of Cyberspace: ``You do not know us, nor do you know
our world.'' If a problem arises, like kids' access to pornography,
let the people dealing with the problem directly tackle it first.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give politicians and policy wonks control over new things,
because they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will be loading up with objections. ``Yes, but, what
about this?'' What if people could buy drugs for uses unapproved by
the Food and Drug Administration? (They can now. It's is only
``off-label'' drugs and the Internet that make the FDA tolerable.)
What would happen without zoning? (Neighborhoods like Seattle's
Capitol Hill and Queen Anne Hill happened without zoning.)
</P>
<P>
   What about human cloning? Our society has absorbed heart
transplants, sex-change operations and surrogate motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Writes Postrel: ``We draw even the most extraordinary
technologies into a broader cultural context that is far more
resilient than reactionary wise men like to think.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of this book is not that you never have to pass a
law. But stand back for a while. There may be a One Best Way, but
you won't find it by by taking a public vote. Innovation comes from
individuals. Let them try things. See what works.

3 CUBAN DIPLOMATS ORDERED OUT OF U.S. FOR SPYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three Cuban diplomats at the United Nations who are
suspected of spying were ordered Wednesday to leave the country,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The three men were linked to espionage after an investigation by
the FBI that led to the arrest and indictment of 10 suspected Cuban
agents in Miami three months ago. The three men in New York have
diplomatic passports, which give them immunity from prosecution as
spies.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Wednesday that
the three diplomats _ identified by other U.S. officials as Eduardo
Martinez Borbonet, a first secretary; Roberto Azanza Paez, a third
secretary, and Gonzalo Fernandez Garay, an attache _ were being
expelled ``for activities incompatible with their diplomatic
status.'' The phrase is Cold War code for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The three have been ordered to leave the United States by Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested in Miami were charged with trying to infiltrate
military bases and Cuban exile organizations in the United States.
They face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of spies from Cuba's spy service, the Direccion General
de Inteligencia, or DGI, live and work in the United States,
according to former members of the service who have defected. A
sizable fraction of the Cuban delegation at the United Nations has
always been made up of intelligence officers, according to U.S.
intelligence and law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Many nations _ including the United States _ have used the
United Nations as a base for intelligence work since it was founded
more than 50 years ago, according to former officials of the CIA.
During the Cold War at least a third of the diplomats at the Soviet
Mission to the United Nations were suspected by the FBI of working
for Soviet intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban intelligence officers do not operate under cover only as
diplomats. They have posed as taxi drivers, real-estate brokers and
weapons dealers in New Jersey and Florida. They have also posed as
members of the Cuban immigrant communities in Miami who actively
oppose the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. Many of those groups have
been infiltrated for years; the chief of operations of one of the
most militant anti-Castro organizations secretly reported to Havana
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has openly defended his right to conduct intelligence
operations in the United States. He justifies them as a legitimate
response to American attempts to overthrow or undermine him over
nearly four decades, and to the many groups of Cuban exiles who
seek a swift end to his rule.

AGENCY FINDS RACIAL BIAS IN BALTIMORE'S POLICE FORCE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY  
  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a highly unusual racial discrimination case, the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has determined that
black officers in the Baltimore Police Department have been
disciplined more harshly in recent years than white officers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding grew out of a complaint by Louis H. Hopson Jr., a
black police sergeant with 18 years on the force who was discharged
this year after a police disciplinary board ruled that he had made
a false statement in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Hopson, 47, said he was dismissed because he testified two
years ago before a City Council committee that racial slurs and
harassment against black officers were common within the
department.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated, and,
in a finding that was signed last week by Gerald S. Kiel, the
commission's acting district director for Baltimore, said that not
only were Hopson's civil rights violated, but also those of other
black officers in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credible testimonial and documentary evidence revealed that
African-American officers, as a class, were treated disparately
with respect to discipline,'' Kiel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record showed,'' he added, ``that African-American
officers who protest racial discrimination or file complaints of
racial discrimination are subjected to retaliatory actions
including, but not limited to, being targeted for Internal
Investigation Division investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Kiel were unsuccessful. Reginald Welch, a
commission spokesman, said officials of the agency were prohibited
by law from discussing any case.
</P>
<P>
   The report, called a determination, was hailed by black
officers, who say they have been complaining for years about racial
practices within the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the federal government to step in with a strong statement
like this, it validates what we've been saying,'' said Richard A.
Hite Jr., president of the Vanguard Justice Society, an
organization of 700 officers that campaigns for the rights of black
officers on the Baltimore Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department has denied Hopson's charges and any accusation
that black police officers who complain about discrimination suffer
any form of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Officer Robert Weinhold, a department spokesman, conceded
that ``the issue of racial disparity has been present in the
department for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black officers have filed discrimination suits against
the city, including one by Robert Richards, a sergeant who is
seeking $13.5 million on accusations that his transfer from a
helicopter division to street patrol was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinhold said Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier, who was
appointed in 1994, had recognized these problems and had taken
strong measures over the last 18 months to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   Weinhold said that since Frazier was hired, the proportion of
black officers on the 3,200-member force had doubled to 36 percent
and that many had been promoted to senior command positions,
including those that oversee discipline, hiring and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department views this as a journey, not a destination,''
Weinhold said. ``The commissioner is committed to implementing
substantial measures to address this very serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hopson has the right to use the commission report as part
of a lawsuit against the city, the next step for the commission is
to work with both sides to mediate a settlement. If that fails, the
commission would turn the case over to the Justice Department for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, the commission spokesman, said most of the complaints
that that the commission heard involved private employers. Only a
``relatively small number'' of the 80,000 complaints that have been
filed on average each year since 1990 have resulted in charges of
wrongdoing against a state or local government agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch also said that few complaints filed each year, less than 5
percent on average, have led federal investigators to find
reasonable cause of discrimination. In about 60 percent of the
cases, the charges are too weak to pursue, he said.

U.N. STRUGGLES WITH POLICY TOWARD SADDAM
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: See also IRAQ-BABYLON, IRAQ-U.S., IRAQ-COHEN) 
(jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council, struggling to rebuild the
fragile unity among members that was shattered by the American and
British bombing raids in Iraq last week, met Wednesday to thrash
out a statement broadly outlining a policy toward President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of closed-door talks, the council agreed to
defer further formal discussion until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a sincere wish from all delegations to agree
on a text,'' Hans Dahlgren, the Swedish representative, said after
the meeting. ``But it won't be today.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is expected to produce another version of its proposed
draft of the policy statement on Thursday, after the introduction
of new ideas by the United States. President Clinton's
administration wants to tone down the role Russia would propose for
the secretary general, among other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these amendments are helpful; some of these amendments
are going contrary to the initial goal of this presidential
statement,'' said Yury Fedotov, Russia's deputy representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia wants a very clear statement, which would express the
view of the majority of the Security Council,'' he said, ``and
which would say basically three important things, which are: the
Security Council is in charge and the Security Council is in favor
of a political settlement of international crises; two, that the
secretary general must continue to play his important and
meaningful role in this crisis, and three, we have to determine
what has to be done in order to resume the implementation of the
Security Council resolutions on Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appear ready to call a high-level meeting of the U.N.
Special Commission. The commission, known as UNSCOM, was originally
a panel of experts sent by various nations to work out a
disarmament plan for Iraq in 1991, after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   When the process went on much longer than expected, the
part-time commission had to hire a permanent staff _ the weapons
inspectors under Richard Butler who have been working full time on
Iraq. The commissioners now meet only periodically as an expert
board, with Butler as executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   By calling a meeting of the higher-level commission, the
Security Council hopes to defuse to some degree the tension over
Butler and his day-to-day inspection and monitoring teams, which
have now been barred from Iraq by Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
   The move could also save the commission. The United States wants
it and the International Atomic Energy Agency recognized as the
sole judges of Iraqi compliance with a 1991 council resolution on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution, Iraq must be declared free of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons as well as certain missile systems
to qualify for a lifting of sanctions. Iraq says it meets the test.
Butler says it does not.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, China joined Russia in calling publicly for
Butler's dismissal. Shen Guofang, China's deputy representative,
told reporters this morning that Butler ``should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, apparently unchastened by last week's air strikes, on
Wednesday made the U.N.'s work a little more difficult by barring
all of its flights into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis turned back a plane carrying military observers based
along the Kuwaiti border. They also refused to allow Secretary
General Kofi Annan's special envoy, Prakash Shah, to fly out of
Iraq. He had to make a 12-hour trip by road to Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis told Annan that it was unsafe to fly because British
and American air maneuvers continued over the country.

LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT: AN ARMY DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Today's Army National Guard can handle everything from
earthquakes and floods to forest fires and other emergencies, but
some of their military cohorts apparently don't always know their
left foot from their right.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Washington Army National Guard First Sgt. Cecil B.
Osborne Jr. of Kirkland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   An Army surgeon at Madigan Army Medical Center had trouble
locating and removing damaged joint tissue in Osborne's knee.
</P>
<P>
   He operated on the wrong knee. The right knee was the right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   An incredulous Osborne said the surgeon operated on his left
knee less than an hour after confirming with him that the right
knee needed the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's assistant and the attending nurse and the
anesthesiologist ... they all came up to me while I was on the
gurney and they confirmed my name and that I was to have surgery on
the right knee,'' Osborne recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the surgeon did the same thing ... confirmed my name and
that he was going to operate on my right knee. He even manipulated
the right knee as I was lying there on the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was some sort of commotion, some trauma case coming
in, and I thought they might have to reschedule me because of all
the activity, but they said there was no problem, that my surgery
would be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I was coming out of anesthesia that I realized
something was terribly wrong,'' said Osborne, who is a building
maintenance contractor in civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor came out of the operating room and said everything
went fine, but there was `a little problem: We did the wrong
knee.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well sir, they just don't do things like that in Osborne's
Company C, 3rd Battalion, 161st Mechanized Infantry unit in
Redmond, Wash. Never since he was drafted in 1971 and in all his
time in Korea and in Army National Guard in Oregon and Washington
has Sgt. Osborne seen a snafu like this one.
</P>
<P>
   His mechanized infantry unit has seen a lot of duty in recent
years, including fighting forest and brush fires in Eastern
Washington and seasonal flooding on this side of the mountains. The
unit also was activated during recent hoopla about the Makah Indian
whale hunt preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we meet one weekend a month and train two weeks every
summer. And because of my rank, I'm also usually at meetings one or
two weekends every month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, while on his regular two-week training stint near
Yakima, Osborne fell from the tailgate of a truck and injured his
right knee while helping his supply sergeant set up the unit's
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid sort of accident,'' he says. ``The leg hurt,
but not enough to go off duty. I later had it checked out by the
appropriate medical officer and we filled out all the required
paperwork because he said it looked like the kind of injury that
could cause me trouble in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it did, but Osborne limped along. In the
meantime, he had surgery for an unrelated condition, which went off
without a hitch at Evergreen Hospital Medical Center in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles didn't really start until that injured right knee
began hurting real bad, and his regular civilian family doctor
advised him it probably would need surgery. ``And since it was a
service-related injury, we knew that my regular hospitalization
insurance wouldn't pay for it,'' Osborne said. ``Besides, the Army
paperwork had already been filled out.''
</P>
<P>
   So the surgery was approved and scheduled for Madigan, first for
last spring and, eventually, for last August, which is where and
when everything went wrong. And Osborne has been stewing about it
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until an inquiry from this column earlier this month
that the hospital officially admitted a mistake and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that a surgical procedure was performed on the
opposite knee of Sergeant Osborne at Madigan Hospital,'' the
hospital's officially terse statement began. Noting that the
wrong-side surgery was ``a mistake greatly regretted by all,'' the
hospital said it launched an immediate investigation, which led to
new presurgical procedures ``to assure a similar incident will
never be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Madigan spokesman Mike Meines, all surgery patients
will now meet with the attending anesthesiologist or anesthetist to
identify the surgery site, and that site will be marked with
indelible ink before anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we offer a most sincere apology to
Sergeant Osborne and his family,'' the hospital's statement
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a warm fuzzy. More of a precise, militarily correct
statement that failed to note _ nor would they respond to direct
questions about _ the name of the Army surgeon or the attending
personnel or the cause of the mistake or, for that matter, any
particulars of the official investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said last week: ``There's been no information (from the
Army) to me about their investigation, nor an apology, nor copies
of my medical records, as requested by me, my civilian doctor and
my lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, Osborne conceded wryly: ``The surgeon
personally apologized to me and then said they were going to
correct the error by getting me back in to do the correct leg,''
Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said: `I don't think so, Doctor, Sir ... not me! Never
again!' He said that as my superior officer, he could order me back
in. That's when I contacted the administration and basically told
them: `I'm not coming back into your hospital. You botched it, and
I'm going to have it done by a civilian doctor.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was leaving the hospital, a nurse told me: `Don't let
them sweep this under the carpet.' The entire (surgical) floor knew
about it. I told my wife: `Get me outta here!' I got home and I
began throwing up. I couldn't believe it! Even as my stomach
started calming, I became more and more outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said the Army ``went through a week or so of hemming and
hawing and finally authorized payment for a civilian doctor to do
the surgery on the right knee.'' And Osborne was paid the
equivalent of 21 days of military pay for time lost due to the
surgery and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   And although he remains active in his National Guard unit, he
has not received any compensation for time lost from his civilian
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday I'm going to have to go back into that hospital, or
send in a soldier I'm responsible for, and I want to feel confident
that they'll do the right thing for me or for one of my men,''
Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told there's no legal recourse, that you can't sue
the military. But that's an issue I will pursue, because I think
soldiers should have recourse if something goes awry in surgery,
elective or not. If a civilian doctor made this mistake, he'd be in
big trouble.''

THE YEAR IN TEXAS ARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
 &HT;    c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a year in which Texas art news often made national
and international news, underscoring the state's increasingly
important role in the art world. But, that bit of bragging aside,
our first big art story could not have been less auspicious ...
</P>
<P>
   JANUARY/Houston: Still grieving for founder Dominique de Menil
(who died on the last day of 1997), the Menil Collection opens the
giant Robert Rauschenberg retrospective it is sharing with
Houston's two other art museums.
</P>
<P>
   But, on its first public day, Harris County constables
confiscate several artworks from the Menil _ not for controversial
content, but because Rauschenberg is being sued by an unhappy,
Austin-based art dealer named Alfred Kren. The show goes on; the
suit eventually is settled.
</P>
<P>
   JANUARY/Fort Worth: Kimbell Art Museum Director Ted Pillsbury
shocks the art world by announcing his retirement after nearly 18
years of brilliant service. Girding itself to find a new director,
the Kimbell becomes one of an unprecedented number of major U.S.
museums with an opening at the top. The Whitney Museum of American
Art, the Phillips Collection and some 20 other institutions are
searching. Then the Phillips announces its hiring of Dallas Museum
of Art Director Jay Gates, and another museum joins the game of
musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   FEBRUARY/Washington, D.C.: The American Institute of Architects
gives the Kimbell its 25-year award _ celebrating the 25th
anniversary of its Louis Kahn-designed building. This is historic;
it's the first time any architect has received the award two years
in a row. The year before, Kahn was recognized for his library at
Phillips Exeter Academy.
</P>
<P>
   FEBRUARY/Fort Worth: ``Renoir's Portraits,'' which the Kimbell
helped organize, opens in Fort Worth, after drawing record crowds
in Chicago. It's the closest thing to a North Texas blockbuster
this year.
</P>
<P>
   MARCH/Austin: The stodgy Huntington Art Gallery at the
University of Texas is renamed the Blanton Museum of Art. With
that, the institution launches a year of changes that take it from
the visual arts basement to the penthouse. In rapid succession, the
Blanton presents a major historic survey of lithographs, acquires
one of the world's most important private collections of baroque
artworks (the Suida-Manning Collection) and, in December, announces
that its new building will be designed by museum-architecture
hotshots Herzog &AMP; de Meuron of Basel, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by its local academic museum, two other visual
art venues in Austin ratchet up their own prestige with sexy
building projects. The Austin Museum of Art chooses Richard
Gluckman to design its downtown facility, and the Texas Fine Arts
Association opens its new home _ an adaptive reuse designed by Gary
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST/Fort Worth: The Kimbell's director search ends jubilantly
with the appointment of Timothy Potts, 40-year-old director of
Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria, Australia's oldest and
largest art museum. An archaeologist, art historian, critic and
financier, Potts arrives in Fort Worth with his family in early
November.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST/Austin, etc.: UT's Ransom Humanities Resource Center
scores big, acquiring the David Douglas Duncan photographic
archive.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums will acquire art en masse this year: The
International Museum of Folk Art in Santa Fe lands the Neutrogena
Collection; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art pulls in big
chunks (including a stunning group of early Rauschenbergs); the
Indianapolis Museum of Art acquires the acclaimed Josefowitz
Collection of paintings and prints by Paul Gauguin and his Brittany
followers. Also, the San Antonio Museum of Art opens a new wing
named for Nelson Rockefeller, whose daughter gave San Antonio her
father's superb collection of Latin American folk art.
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER/Fort Worth: Two exhibitions open at the Modern at
Sundance Square and the Contemporary Art Center of Fort Worth, both
devoted to works by Ed Blackburn and Linda Blackburn (and their a k
a Ray Madison). If ever a pair of local shows deserve to go
national, these two do.
</P>
<P>
   The two exhibits take their place among several significant
exhibitions originating in North Texas this year. These included:
``The Painted Sketch'' at the Dallas Museum of Art; ``Agnes
Martin/Richard Tuttle'' at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth;
Jaume Plensa's ``Dallas ... Caracas'' installation at the McKinney
Avenue Contemporary in Dallas; and the Kimbell's presentation of
four masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich. Other local
exhibitions of note _ just passing through, thank you _ include
presentations of Thracian gold, Lalique jewelry and Mughal
manuscripts at the Kimbell, the DMA and the Kimbell, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER/All over: Fall blockbusters get under way with a
presentation of late Delacroix paintings at the Philadelphia Museum
of Art. The spate of brilliant shows continues with van Gogh in
Washington, D.C., Jackson Pollock at the Museum of Modern Art and
Mary Cassatt in Boston. But not all the hits focus on single
artists: The Met's display of early Flemish paintings and the
Guggenheim's joint effort with the Pompidou Center are popular
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   OCTOBER/Las Vegas: We learn what Ted Pillsbury has been up to
since leaving the Kimbell in midsummer: He's been helping casino
magnate Steve Wynn launch his new Bellagio resort. Packed with
major works of art by Manet, Picasso, Willem de Kooning and Andy
Warhol, among others, Bellagio is an art world anomaly that
attracts international attention. Wynn's ticket for the collection?
About $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER/Dallas: The Trammell and Margaret Crow Collection of
Asian Art opens next door to the DMA, promising to be a popular
success with the potential to score scholarly points, as well.
Meantime, there's no word on Ray Nasher's sculpture garden (another
immediate neighbor), but Duke University announces that Nasher has
given the university $7.5 million for a new art museum in his name.
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER/Fort Worth: Finally, the Amon Carter Museum announces a
Philip Johnson expansion plan _ one that involves demolishing all
but his original 1961 building and constructing a spacious new
museum that will be clad in handsome brown granite.
</P>
<P>
   DECEMBER/Dallas: The Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist
University breaks ground for its new Meadows Museum, in a style
described as ``collegiate Georgian,'' designed by Hammond Beeby and
Babka. And the Dallas Museum of Art ends its director search when
DMA trustees announce that they have hired Jack Lane to succeed
Gates.

REVIEWS OF CHRISTIAN BOOKS AND MUSIC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CD REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Gold''
</P>
<P>
   Gold Records
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Gold,'' a bestseller in England brought to the United
States by Integrity Music, is a unique, thoughtful, welcome
addition to the Christian music field.
</P>
<P>
   Intertwining the prose of John Bunyan and British author Adrian
Plass with songs by Phil Baggaley, Dave Clifton and Ian Blythe, it
traces the ``pilgrim's progress'' toward the gates of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The songs, performed by Mal Pope and Julie Costello, range from
contemporary praise cuts to those with Celtic and world-music
influences. The album begins with upbeat tunes that gradually give
way to those with more of a contemplative feel.
</P>
<P>
   But what sets ``City of Gold'' apart are the spoken words,
sometimes reverent, sometimes whimsical. ``Heavenly Playground''
takes its title literally, as Plass imagines a giant playground
where even big boys can frolic. ``Cricket'' expresses the hope that
that game will be played in the afterlife, in clever words that an
American audience can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   Plass' vision is a tad limited. He seems to see paradise as
merely an extension of the good things on Earth, like games and
flowery meadows, but he explains himself while talking to God on
Heaven: ``I love this world you made. It's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   The album also lacks an explanation of how to get to heaven.
Still, it's a worthwhile project with much more substance than the
run-of-the-mill release.

 &HT;    Recalled meats sold in Georgia
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hot dogs, deli meats and other meat products thought
to be involved in a nationwide outbreak of a serious food-borne
illness, listeriosis, are included in a nationwide recall.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has caused 40 severe illnesses in 10 states,
including one possible case in Georgia, and the deaths of a fetus
and three elderly adults in Ohio and New York, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee Corp. has voluntarily recalled certain products
manufactured at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich. The
products are identifiable by the codes EST P261 and EST 6911 on the
packaging. The company could not say how much product was recalled
or how much was distributed in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs included in the recall are labeled Ball Park, Bil Mar,
Bryan Bunsize and Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack. Other brands are
Grillmaster, Hygrade, Mr. Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee
Home Roast.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis, caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, is
relatively rare, and most healthy people don't become severely ill.
But the disease poses a serious threat to pregnant women and
fetuses, the elderly or those with weakened immune systems.
Symptoms range from fever and diarrhea to meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is found in soil and water. The bacteria have been
found in raw meats and vegetables, processed foods such as cold
cuts and soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk or foods made from it.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis causes 1,850 serious illnesses a year and kills 425,
or 23 percent of those seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak began in early August, but the low number of cases
made it difficult for health officials to recognize the outbreak
and then pinpoint its source. Listeria has a three-week incubation
period, which forced investigators to ask people to recall what
they had eaten the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 of the 40 infected people had consumed cooked hot
dogs during the month before they became ill. Investigators aren't
sure how well the hot dogs were cooked, and caution people using
microwaves to make sure their food is cooked throughout.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, the strain of Listeria involved was isolated from an
open package of hot dogs, some of which was eaten by an infected
person four weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the recalled food products have a long shelf
life and may have been distributed throughout the nation, health
officials advise people to check their refrigerators and freezers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can return products, opened or not, to the place of
purchase for a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, which is investigating, recommends thoroughly cooking
meat and washing raw vegetables. People especially at risk may want
to consider reheating deli meats before consumption and avoiding
soft cheeses such as brie or feta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's the holidays, don't let your guard down,''
warned Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the CDC's associate director for
epidemiologic science. ``People tend to get a little sloppy in how
they prepare and handle foods. But it's no less risky because it's
December instead of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee's has a consumer hotline for questions: 1-800-247-8339.

FROM STREET DANCE TO CLASSICAL BALLET TO BROADWAY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Valerie Gladstone is a contributing editor at Dance magazine. 
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an advertisement now running for ``Fosse: A Celebration in
Dance,'' the ballet and modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in
profile, his hands on his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle
on his head. One leg is straight and the other bent. He wears
ballet slippers. Sheathed only in tights and a vest, his remarkably
muscular body looks sculptured.
</P>
<P>
   In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, where it
opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in ``Mr. Bojangles,'' a tender
tribute to dancers past their prime.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the production's 30 numbers, culled from Robert Fosse's
prodigious choreographic output and featuring excerpts from
``Pajama Game'' and ``All That Jazz,'' require a hard-edged
sensuality. Rising to the occasion in six pieces, Richardson lets
go his full intensity in a solo, ``Percussion 4,'' and in ``Cool
Hand Luke'' he gyrates in vintage Fosse style, looking as
experienced as the rest of the 35-member cast, all seasoned show
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   After opening in Toronto in July, ``Fosse,'' directed by Richard
Malby Jr. with assistance from the singer-dancer greats Ann
Reinking and Gwen Verdon, had limited engagements in Boston and Los
Angeles. Reviews have been favorable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question is how did a classically trained dancer become an
emblem of such a quintessentially Broadway style in his first
Broadway appearance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences are stunned by Desmond,'' said Ms. Verdon. ``He's
totally different from any performer I've ever seen. Besides his
amazing musicality, he moves like a panther.'' In fact, Fosse's
moves felt natural to Richardson. ``Jazz is in my body,'' he said.
``I was a street dancer before I was anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, several superb male dancers have come to
the fore in classical and modern dance, among them Vladimir
Malakhov and Jose Manuel Carreno at American Ballet Theater,
Matthew Rushing at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and
Albert Evans at New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   But, even in such impressive company, Richardson's technique and
expressiveness stand out. ``When we danced together in Nacho
Duato's `Remanso' at ABT,'' said Malakhov, ``Desmond made
everything look so easy. I wished I could be like him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 30, Richardson has already been a principal dancer with the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Frankfurt Ballet and
American Ballet Theater. Moreover, his talent has attracted
choreographers as diverse as George Faison, Ulysses Dove, Garth
Fagan, John Butler, William Forsythe and Lar Lubovitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinctively, Desmond conveys poetry in movement,'' said
Lubovitch, who choreographed the lead in Ballet Theater's
``Othello'' for him. ``Then there's his superb technique. As a
dance linguist, he speaks eloquently in all styles. Nothing he
performs is flat or uninflected.'' Faison went further: ``He is the
most magnificent dancer America has produced in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson blossomed early. As a child, he started dancing at
home, in New York City. ``My family likes to party,'' he said.
``They're from the South and the Caribbean. Everybody dances in my
house _ salsa, reggae, soul. We watch to see who can do the newest
step. My mother acts as catalyst. She knows how to bring the party
up. When we dance, the feeling comes from inside. No pretense. No
facade. It infiltrates you.''
</P>
<P>
   But until he discovered ``Great Performances'' on Channel 13,
Richardson didn't have any concept of professional dance. ``Then I
fell in love with every aspect of dance _ the theater, the music,
the costumes, the sets,'' he said. ``They became a part of me.''
Since his parents couldn't afford dance classes, he auditioned for
the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. He won a place as
a freshman and within a year had a scholarship to continue his
studies at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. In 1986, Ailey
asked him to join his company.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Richardson maintained a professional life
outside established dance. In 1988, Michael Jackson asked him to be
in his video ``Bad'' and since then he has performed in other
videos and toured with En Vogue, Aretha Franklin, Prince and
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he established his own modern troupe, Complexions, with
the choreographer Dwight Rhoden, in order to support and explore
new dance movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fill myself up with as many things as possible,'' he
explained. ``I like works that are completely out of the ordinary.
Alvin taught me the importance of versatility. He said: `If you can
sing, you have to sing; if you can act, act. You'll bring all that
to the stage, and it's so very relevant.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one company has given Richardson a chance to exhibit
the full extent of his abilities. ``Such an incredible talent
should be catered to,'' said Keith Lee, who choreographed for
Richardson at the Ailey company. ``Desmond shouldn't have to go all
over the place to find interesting opportunities. An artistic
director should bring them to him. Bob Joffrey did that at the
Joffrey Ballet for his principal dancers and so did Lucia Chase at
ABT.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After seven years with the Ailey company, he left for the
Frankfurt Ballet to try something new. He joined Ballet Theater in
1997, largely because Lubovitch wanted him for the lead in his
full-evening work ``Othello,'' a co-production of Ballet Theater
and the San Francisco Ballet. He expected Ballet Theater to offer
him other opportunities. However, his only other role of
significance was in ``Remanso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went there,'' he said, ``many people with the company
seemed surprised that I had been trained in ballet. It's so
ridiculous. I'd like to think my color didn't have anything to do
with my not being asked to play big classical roles. But given my
technical abilities, I don't know what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   One role that Richardson wanted badly was Romeo in Sir Kenneth
MacMillan's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' a role that has not been danced
in the full-length version by an African-American in a major
company in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of Ballet Theater,
considers Richardson a great dancer, he did not think he was ready
for Romeo. Instead, he was given Tybalt in that ballet and had the
mimed role of Carabosse, the evil fairy, in ``The Sleeping
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared with Ballet Theater in Jerome Robbins's ``Fancy
Free'' and as the partner of the Russian ballerina Nina
Ananiashvili in Clark Tippet's ``Some Assembly Required,'' both
modern ballets based in the classical vocabulary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Nureyev traveled constantly to find places to exercise
his talents. Consequently, he appeared with numerous ballet and
modern dance companies over the course of his lengthy career, even
doing a stint in the Broadway show ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's pace and his need for variety aren't unlike
Nureyev's. Take, for example, the last 13 months: His marathon
began in November 1997 when he joined Ballet Theater for its season
at City Center in New York. Meanwhile, he had heard about ``Fosse''
from his friend Elizabeth Parkinson, a former Joffrey dancer who
was already in the show. In December, he auditioned for Chet
Walker, a co-choreographer with Ms. Reinking of ``Fosse,'' and was
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Richardson went to Toronto to start workshops for
``Fosse.'' Two months later, he took a leave to dance ``Othello,''
with the San Francisco Ballet. In early June, he returned to New
York to appear in ``Othello'' with Ballet Theater at the
Metropolitan Opera House. A couple of weeks later found him in a
SoHo loft performing Rhoden's works with Complexions.
</P>
<P>
   The tempo didn't let up. By July, he was back in Toronto with
``Fosse.'' (Given his importance to the show, the producers had
only regretfully agreed to his missing the last week in Toronto and
the first week in Boston.) In August, he hopped on a plane for
Milan, Italy, where Forsythe, artistic director of the Frankfurt
Ballet, choreographed a piece for him to perform at La Scala with
Alessandra Ferri, a principal dancer with Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   His only break from the production since then was in October
when Complexions performed at the Hostos Center for Arts and
Culture in the Bronx. Between engagements, he kept up with acting
and voice lessons, for in the future he hopes to do films.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his unforgiving schedule, Richardson thrives on
varied assignments. The choreography of ``Fosse'' demands from him
special attention to detail. From Forsythe, he grew to understand
improvisational technique. ``Billy made me see how I make
decisions,'' he said, ``and how and where movements originate in my
body and mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, he also discovered that artists use their skills
quite differently from the way they do in the United States.
``There, a performance is all about the work,'' he said. ``It's not
about the performers. The dancers invite you into what they're
doing; it's not in your face. Unfortunately, here everything has to
be pow! Right now!
</P>
<P>
   ``Technique should only be an accouterment,'' he added. ``A
dancer must breathe life into every gesture. Then, his spirit and
individuality color it. It's what I work for. It's what I do in
`Fosse.' ''

DEBATE RAGES OVER LIVINGSTON DECISION

   WASHINGTON _ Who got Bob Livingston?
</P>
<P>
   It has become a hot question since the speaker-designate shocked
the House on Saturday with his decision to decline the leadership
post and resign from Congress after confessing that more than once
he had been unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton suggested it was the Republican Party's
pervasive, misguided, and mean-spirited ``politics of personal
destruction'' that ruined the career of a good public servant.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Christian right insist it was Larry Flynt, the
publisher of Hustler magazine, who despicably ``outed'' Livingston
for his affairs, undermining the moral authority of the incoming
speaker. Some even said Flynt might be acting in concert with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal groups assert Livingston did not step aside voluntarily
but was driven out by a small, zealous band of GOP social
conservatives who threatened to withhold their votes and deny the
Louisiana Republican the speakership when the election was held in
January.
</P>
<P>
   As in almost everything connected to the impeachment of Clinton,
Livingston's demise is tinged with rancor and partisanship, as
Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, squabble
over the sexual morality of public officials and find ways to blame
each other for a decision that Livingston has said was his own.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa Republican who met privately
with Livingston as he pondered his future last Friday, said he is
so troubled by the latest buzz, and sure that Livingston's decision
was ``his and his alone, made for the good of his family, the
party, and the country,'' that he circulated a letter to his House
colleagues Wednesday, calling for an end to the ``pernicious
story'' that he was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That somebody would put the country ahead of their own
political gain is something that the cynical press and the
president's defenders either can't understand or just can't
tolerate, as a comparison to a president who has no shame,'' Ganske
wrote. ``So they are trying to denigrate Bob's motives by
insinuating that he really didn't have any choice, that he wouldn't
have been elected speaker anyway because of `sexual McCarthyism' of
our party. Let us end that pernicious story right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Welton Gaddy, executive director of the Interfaith
Alliance, a nonpartisan clergy group formed to counter the
Christian Coalition, said it's not cynical to see Livingston could
not pass the ``dangerous, dangerous litmus test'' of the religious
right: That an act of moral wrongdoing disqualifies you from high
political office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly at least suspicious, if not confident, that the
Livingston scenario developed with an eye on the influence of the
religious right, which holds the Republican Party captive,'' Gaddy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Christian right and their allies in Congress
vehemently deny they put pressure on Livingston to resign after he
disclosed acts of adultery to the House Republicans last Thursday.
Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican and often a
spokesman for young Christian conservatives in the House, discussed
members' ``concerns'' with Livingston early Saturday, but he did
not tell him his support had seriously eroded, a Wamp aide said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Phyllis Schlafly, founder of the Eagle Forum, and the
Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, had
let fellow conservatives on Capitol Hill know by then that electing
Livingston speaker ``wasn't going to work,'' Sheldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no loss,'' said Schlafly, adding that Livingston's
behavior was ``not acceptable'' for a House speaker. ``He was part
of the old guard, and this has had a very good effect in shaking
the old leadership, pushing it to the sidelines to make room for a
younger generation of conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon said questions about Livingston's morality became
relevant only when he tried to step up into a top leadership role.
He noted that several GOP lawmakers, including Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde, have admitted adultery and have not faced
recriminations from the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When have we ever exposed a single homosexual? When did we
ever out a Henry Hyde?'' Sheldon asked. ``Larry Flynt is the person
who indirectly is establshing an era of sexual McCarthyism because
he is going around outing these people and making lot of money in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet people on the left aren't charging him with the politics
of personal destruction,'' Sheldon said. ``They are trying to make
us into Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Flynt bought a full-page ad in the Washington Post
and offered as much as $1 million to women who would disclose their
affairs with public officials. Livingston learned Flynt was
prepared to publish a report on his infidelities and chose to
reveal it himself first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Larry Flynt thing got to me, and I made the decision (to
give up the speakership),'' Livingston told the Washington Times
this week. Flynt claims he was scooped on the story by the Capitol
Hill newspaper Roll Call, which disclosed the allegations on its
Website.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt's threats of more disclosures are putting a chill in the
air on Capitol Hill and causing gossip about who is, and who is
not, ``Flynt-proof.'' The conservative grapevine is also spreading
stories about the White House either encouraging the Flynt
enterprise or at least not condemning it loudly enough, aides to
some members say.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said
President Clinton ``despises the politics of personal destruction
that Larry Flynt and others practice. He believes it should stop.''
Lockhart noted, however, the White House doesn't have ``any control
over what a newspaper publisher does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interfaith Alliance is going to address the politics of
personal destruction in a series of as many as 10 regional summit
meetings of religious leaders next year. The purpose, said Gaddy,
is to reaffirm broad moral principles in public and private life
but try to get politics and partisanship out of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a danger that when you engage in a campaign of
ritual purification, you will be held to the same hypocritically
high standards that you hold your enemies to,'' said Chip Berlet, a
senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a private group in
Somerville that monitors the conservative agenda. ``Of course, the
religious right is reaping what is has sown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we engage in a television-era equivalent of a public
stoning, and when Larry Flynt becomes an icon of the Democratic
Party, things have gotten really absurd.'' Berlet said.

   Quick-hit bios are an entertaining read
</P>
<P>
   By Don O' Briant
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The problem with most biographies is their sheer heft. Drop one
of these tomes on your toe and you'll suffer for days. Sometimes
you'll suffer even if you don't drop it. Laundry-list biographies
can be as tedious as reading a list of begats in the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will have no such difficulty with the Penguin Lives
series of biographies published jointly with Lipper &AMP; Co. The
small-format books range from 128 to 256 pages and are written by
authors who are both entertaining and succinct.
</P>
<P>
   The first two books in the series (Viking plans six per year)
are Larry McMurtry's ``Crazy Horse'' (Viking, $19.95) and Edmund
White's ``Marcel Proust'' (Viking, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry is a natural fit for Crazy Horse. The author of
``Lonesome Dove'' wrote the book, he says, ``because I have some
notions about what he meant to his people in his lifetime, and also
what he has come to mean to a generation of Sioux in our century
and even in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing simply but eloquently, McMurtry goes to the heart of the
man whose betrayal by the U.S. government became a tragic chapter
in the history of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   White, the author of ``A Boy's Own Story,'' was drawn to Proust
because of his longtime fascination with the writer. ``I first read
Proust when I was in high school, and even wrote a term paper on
him; I read Proust the second time when I was 30 and had hepatitis,
then again when I moved to Paris in 1983. Like me, he was
interested in love, friendship, art and society, which have become
themes in my novels as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is more of a literary appreciation than a straight
biography, but White also illuminates some of the darker corners of
Proust's life and reveals the writer to be more than an eccentric
recluse. According to White, Proust was a dazzling wit in Paris
salons and an unhappy homosexual who desperately sought fame and
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The biographies of Proust and Crazy Horse are being shipped to
stores this week. Other works scheduled next year include Jane
Smiley on Charles Dickens, Carol Shields on Jane Austen and Mary
Gordon on Joan of Arc.
</P>
<P>
   PRIZE PROSE: After all the publicity, one would think Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' was the only novel published in 1998.
Well, it was the literary event of the year, but several other
authors walked away with major prizes. Here's a recap of the year's
big winners: Alice McDermott's ``Charming Billy'' edged out Wolfe
for the National Book Award; Philip Roth's ``American Pastoral''
won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction; and Ian McEwan's ``Amsterdam''
was awarded Britain's Booker Prize. Other winners this year include
Charles Wright's ``Black Zodiac'' (Pulitzer Prize for poetry);
Jared Diamond's ``Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human
Societies'' (Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction); Rafi Zabor's ``The
Bear Comes Home'' (PEN/Faulkner Award); Edward Ball's ``Slaves in
the Family'' (National Book Award for nonfiction and Southern Book
Critics Circle Award for nonfiction); Gerald Stern's ``This Time:
New and Selected Poems'' (National Book Award for poetry); James
Lee Burke's ``Cimarron Rose'' (Edgar Allan Poe Award for
mysteries); Paul O. Zelinsky's ``Rapunzel'' (Caldecott Medal for
children's literature); Karen Hesse's ``Out of the Dust'' (Newbery
Medal for children's literature); and Joe Haldeman's ``Forever
Peace'' (Hugo Award for science fiction). The prizeless Wolfe,
meanwhile, can console himself with the fact that he topped Tom
Clancy as Amazon.com's best-selling author of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A COUP FOR BRIGHTLEAF: The winter issue of Brightleaf ($6.95), a
literary magazine published in North Carolina, features an
uncollected short story by Eudora Welty. First published in The
Atlantic in 1940, ``Hello and Goodbye'' was never included in any
of Welty's short story collections. Brightleaf editor David Perkins
describes the story as ``a light piece, but one that reflects the
sophisticated irony of this great writer already in flower.''
Brightleaf also includes a 14-page section on Welty with a tribute
by Atlanta writer Anthony Grooms, a profile by Boston writer Sally
Jacobs, and reviews of Welty's recently released ``Collected
Works.'' The Mississippi writer will celebrate her 90th birthday in
April.

 &HT;    _ WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    All about bubbly
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poised to pop the obligatory New Year's Eve champagne, you catch
the snide remark: ``Who's ever heard of that brand?'' That comment
_ uttered sotto voce by a somewhat ungracious guest _ might just
ring in your ears for years to come if the sparkling wine you
purchased was indeed a dud.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you go about selecting a sparkling wine that will
please your guests without busting your budget?
</P>
<P>
   The decision can be complicated, but with some basic facts about
how sparkling wine is made, a few tips to determine quality and
some taste-testing of your own, you'll be primed for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of sparkling wines are influenced by many factors _ among
them the way in which it was created (the more time-consuming
French method, for example, will cost more than a bulk process) and
whether the wine carries an import tax. So, no, you don't have to
choose the most expensive brand to ring in the new year with style.
It is possible to find enjoyable sparkling wines in various price
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne vs. sparkling wine
</P>
<P>
   First, some basics: Every champagne is a sparkling wine (wine
with carbonation), but every sparkling wine is not a champagne. The
term champagne is protected by French law and is only supposed to
be applied if two requirements are met: The grapes must be
cultivated in the Champagne region of France, about 90 miles
northeast of Paris, and the methode champenoise must be used to
prepare the wine, explains Jim Sanders, owner of Sanders Wines of
Atlanta and a wine shop proprietor for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the requirements, however, some makers in other areas do
label their product champagne, but with a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government before Prohibition gave up the right to
use the term cognac, and we call it brandy. But we would not give
up the right to champagne, as long as the origin appeared before
it,'' said Gary Heck, president and chairman of Korbel California
Champagne Cellars, a 120-year-old company that produces champagne
in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   It can take more than five years to create a bottle of champagne
using the official French method. Although the method is
complicated, the most important distinction is that the
sugar-eating yeast creates the carbon dioxide inside the bottle it
will eventually be served in, says Sanders. After the yeast has
eaten all the sugar, it dies in the bottle and must be removed. A
delicate process of rotating and tilting the bottles by hand forces
the yeast residue into the neck. The winemaker then uses the
carbonation inside the bottle to shoot the dead yeast out.
</P>
<P>
   Two faster methods
</P>
<P>
   Two other methods of making sparkling wines are the charmat and
the transfer methods, explains Heck. Using the charmat _ or bulk _
process, the wine is fermented in a large tank. It usually takes 30
to 60 days to create the final product. The transfer method, which
takes three to four months, ferments the sparkling wine in the
bottle; the wine is then removed to filter out the yeast and
rebottled.
</P>
<P>
   Read the label closely to determine the method used: a label
reading ``Fermented in This Bottle'' signals methode champenoise,
but ``Fermented in the Bottle'' refers to the transfer method.
</P>
<P>
   Dry or sweet?
</P>
<P>
   How sweet the sparkling wine is depends on the dosage _ or how
much wine and sugar syrup mix has been added to balance the acidity
of the grapes to achieve whatever style the winemaker wants to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Hans van der Reijden, director of food and beverage at the
Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, says those who want a dry wine should look
for the word ``brut'' on the label.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't feel bad if you prefer a sweet sparkling wine.
Heck says that some people really like ``that heavy, yeasty-style''
champagne of France, while others do not.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the best way to find a sparkling wine you'll enjoy?
Experiment, and don't be afraid of brands you've never heard of.
Find a wine shop proprietor you trust, and try different styles to
figure out what suits your palate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton practiced charity and pleaded for
mercy Wednesday in his first foray out of Washington since the
House impeached him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced $850 million in federal grants for
programs for the homeless at a gymnasium in a public housing
project here Wednesday. He received long standing ovations from an
audience of Democratic officeholders, welfare officials and
African-American clergy members when he entered the room and when
he rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing political lessons from Scripture, Clinton urged both his
allies and his adversaries to remember that the Bible teaches that
charity is not a virtue but an obligation. And, ruminating on the
true spirit of Christmas at a particularly trying time, the
president said that charity ``doesn't really mean go out and give a
bunch of money to poor people so you can feel righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means,'' Clinton continued, ``what it really means, is
whether you're tall or short, whether you're fat or thin, whether
you're black, brown or white, whether you look like a movie star or
a person who had one boxing match too many, whatever the different
circumstances of your life are, inside each of us there is a core
that is the same and not one person is better than another.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wearing a red tie with Christmas designs, asked that he
be judged as ``no better than, but, thank God, no worse than''
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's aides and lawyers begin discussions that they
hope will lead the Senate to censure him rather than eject him from
office, Clinton has spent the past several days reflecting on the
quality of mercy, which seems in scant supply in the capital
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Since his impeachment, Clinton has served lasagna in a
Washington soup kitchen, led a prayer service on the 10th
anniversary of the downing of Pan Am 103 and read ``A Visit from
Saint Nick'' in a slow sing-song to a group of schoolchildren in
the garlanded East Room of the White House. He belatedly began his
Christmas shopping Wednesday with a stop at a Peace Corps boutique
in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His evenings have been filled with the obligatory holiday
parties at the White House, several of which the first lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, sat out because of a pulled back muscle,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   In words and pictures, Clinton is trying to convey an image of a
humble and a contrite soul resigned to his fate. At a holiday party
Sunday evening, he told Los Angeles Times reporter Elizabeth
Shogren that he was working to purge the anger from his heart and
trying to follow South African President Nelson Mandela's example
of turning the other cheek to his tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told friends that he believes the House impeachment
process was deeply unfair and blindly partisan. He freely expresses
both his anger and his remorse, often in the same breath, one close
friend said. He is confident that he will prevail in Senate trial
if no censure deal is reached in advance, this friend said.
</P>
<P>
   And he will not resign, everyone around him asserts without
qualification.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From Saturday's display of party unity on the White House South
Lawn after the impeachment vote to Wednesday's announcement of new
financing for the homeless, Clinton has surrounded himself with
Democrats and children, who provide a shield of sorts against the
harsh winds of political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., was among the party leaders who
shared the dais with Clinton at Wednesday's event at Pleasantview
Gardens, a Baltimore public housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not forgotten that in the midst of your personal
difficulties,'' Cummings said, looking at the president, ``you
continue to work hard every day. Please remember our faith in
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, joined Cummings in
bemoaning the bitter partisanship that he said had seized
Washington. ``The divisiveness we have seen the past few weeks is
unhealthy for our country and our democracy,'' Glendening said.
``We need you at the helm.''

 &HT;    Woodard watchers keep their eyes on hers
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some actors are known for their voices, their hair, their comic
timing or their muscled bodies. Alfre Woodard should be known for
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While talking and emoting are obvious components of acting, the
strongest dramatic moments can happen in silence. Woodard knows
that. She's a watcher, a listener. Nominated for a supporting
actress Oscar for the 1983 drama ``Cross Creek,'' the actress, 45,
has also starred in ``Passion Fish,'' ``Grand Canyon'' and ``How to
Make an American Quilt.'' She played Winnie Mandela in the TV movie
``Mandela.'' She mingled with the crew of the starship Enterprise
in ``Star Trek: First Contact.'' And she won an Emmy for her role
as a nurse facing complex moral issues in ``Miss Evers' Boys,''
partly shot in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Down in the Delta,'' opening Christmas Day, the Tulsa,
Okla., native plays Loretta, a single mother headed for
self-destruction _ until her own mom (Mary Alice) sends her down
South to stay a summer with Uncle Earl (Al Freeman Jr.) and come to
terms with herself and her family heritage. It's the first feature
directed by poet Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard talked to us recently about the new movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what did you connect with in ``Down in the Delta''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I connected with Loretta. I found her very real, and I
recognized her. She was a human being that I would care to know.
She's funny and she's fun, and she would be honest with me in a way
that my other friends, who are more well-bred, couldn't be that
honest with me. I wanted to play somebody like that, knowing you've
got a very delicate piece of music to play, in terms of her arc.
She starts out in such turbulence, and then you've got another hour
and a half to sustain her music to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you worry about working with Maya Angelou, since this was
her first time directing a film?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, people ask me about first-time directors. That's
like saying, ``You know, Picasso, this is your first painting. In
10 years, I'll buy one of them.'' You can't really think that way
with an artist. There are people who have made hundreds of millions
of dollars on their pictures, but I still consider them
first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So this movie is supposed to be in the Mississippi Delta, but
it was shot outside Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A: That was easy. Well, I shouldn't say that. I remember
thinking, ``Toronto?!'' But it's a very interesting locale. And I
am a stickler for one thing, because I've shot in Canada before.
You can tell an African-Canadian from an African-American if
they're trying to act Southern. So I said, ``All the Canadians have
to pass my Southern test. Don't be actin' like no Canadians.'' But
they did very well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yeah, when Hollywood makes a film set in the South, they seem
to think there's just one single Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   A: I know. I've been in pictures where they will say, ``She's
Southern.'' And I'll say, ``What state? Louisiana? What part of
Louisiana?'' Is she from New Orleans, or the bayou, because there's
a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is your own family anything like the family in ``Down in the
Delta''?
</P>
<P>
   A: My father is an Uncle Earl (the Al Freeman Jr. role) times
100. He's a tough taskmaster. But he's also all that a human being
could be, in terms of understanding his connectedness, his heart,
his openness. Maya and I have really good family, and my family is
so big we run the gamut, honey. I have a sister and brother and
they have four kids, and I've got two kids (Mavis, 7, and Duncan,
5). My father's from a family of 12, my mother from a family of 23.
I am related to just about anybody you meet, once you get to
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you have fun when you were shooting ``Miss Evers Boys''
in Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never had any time off, I never did. I went to the Fish
Market every once in a while, but sometimes it was takeout because
I had to be up at 5 a.m. I wouldn't call it fun. You know what my
father calls me? Because every few months he has three new phone
numbers for me. My father says, ``You filled up my address book.
You need to get me another address book.'' He says, ``You know what
you are? You're a high-class migrant worker.''

 &HT;    Winter weather blasts through the nation
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sudden blasts of harsh winter weather across the nation are
being blamed for dozens of deaths and injuries on treacherous icy
roads, including a 64 car wreck in Texas. The cold rush also sent
thermometer readings plummeting in much of the South.
</P>
<P>
   In some central states, such as Ohio, predictions of a white
Christmas were premature and cries of joy were heard throughout
Colorado's ski areas this week as the last fall snowstorm Sunday
left badly needed powder on the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and dozens were injured in more than 300
traffic wrecks Wednesday morning in Austin, Texas, including two
chain-reaction accidents on Interstate 35 involving 64 vehicles, as
freezing rain and temperatures caused slick conditions across
Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Light precipitation was expected to continue throughout the
evening Wednesday as temperatures hovered near 30 degrees. More
surface roads were freezing Wednesday afternoon, creating new
problems for highway crews trying to keep bridges and overpasses
clear for holiday travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police recorded 337 auto accidents on city streets
between midnight and noon Wednesday, more than four times the 75
collisions police typically see on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists were cautioned to avoid I-35 Wednesday as emergency
management officials continued tracking reports of icy patches.
</P>
<P>
   Icy weather also has caused flights to be cancelled or delayed
until late this morning at airports throughout Alabama, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, says Delta Air Lines spokesman
Clay McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   However, the system is expected to return to normal by noon. Air
travelers were stranded overnight in Shreveport and Monroe, La.;
Little Rock, Ark.; Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Durham, N.C.;
and Huntsville, Ala., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No weather impact is expected in Atlanta today, except for
people flying into the above-mentioned cities,'' said McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   The chain-reaction Texas wrecks happened three minutes apart on
either side
</P>
<P>
   of the concrete barriers separating northbound and southbound
lanes on I-35. Police said ice was the cause in both accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The first collision, at 1:10 a.m., involved at least 24 cars and
killed a 19-year-old Austin woman and injured 20 other motorists
and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The second chain-reaction wreck happened at 1:13 a.m. when at
least 40 vehicles collided on the southbound lanes. Three or four
cars skidded into retaining walls along the highway, and at least
three dozen vehicles behind them slammed into each other as they
tried to avoid collisions.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old man died in the southbound wreck. Police said the
man, a former wrecker driver, was towing a Toyota sedan when he
slammed into the back of a large truck that had stopped to avoid
the pile-up.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the number of vehicles involved in both accidents is
a conservative estimate because many motorists drove away before
police were able to get witness statements from them.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, another woman, 38, was killed when her car
struck a semi-trailer on U.S. 183 near Austin. Her car exploded
upon impact, police said. Two others were critically injured. The
highway remained closed until just after 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Across the South temperatures plummeted from record-breaking
highs.
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures in North Carolina tumbled 40 degrees from the
low 70s Tuesday to 33-34 in the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Asheville, N.C., the temperature topped out at 54 degrees at
sunrise. By lunchtime, it had fallen to 35 degrees. Wilmington,
N.C., hit a high of 80 degrees Tuesday afternoon, but the low was
expected to plummet to the 30s overnight.
</P>
<P>
   There's little chance of a white Christmas in North Carolina on
Thursday, but a 50 percent chance of a wet one, according to the
National Weather Service office in Newport, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather will likely include sleet and freezing rain in
the western two-thirds of the state, with rain east of Interstate
95. Throughout Wednesday afternoon, North Carolina highways had
remained quiet and free of holiday accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the snow was preceded by a blast of frigid air that
drove high temperatures from the 60s down to near zero, shocking
bicyclists and hikers who had enjoyed a mild, dry fall across most
of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The coldest temperature early Wednesday was 25 degrees below
zero at Craig, in northwest Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   By Christmas Day, most of Colorado is expected to be dry, with
lows from 10 degrees to 15 below zero and highs up to the teens and
20s.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a foot of snow, combined with winds of 40 mph, forced
transportation officials over the weekend to close several highways
in north-central Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   When the skies cleared Monday night, temperatures plunged well
below zero. Winds at the higher elevations in southern Colorado
blew at 30 to 40 mph. The sun helped people there feel warmer. No
new snow is forecast for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   None of Colorado's ski areas reported new snow Wednesday, and
before the weekend storm, most of them sorely needed it. Few of the
ski areas would have been open without the snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service forecasters Wednesday cautioned people
to expect another very cold night across southern Colorado. With
temperatures likely to drop between zero and 15 below zero over
southeast Colorado and 10 below to 5 above zero in the high
valleys, they advised people to protect themselves and their pets.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Dayton, Ohio, local TV meteorologists are under
pressure to deliver the snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people love it when it snows on Christmas,'' says
Priscilla Parham, a meteorologist at WKEF-TV (Channel 22).
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, Parham; Fred Barnhill, a meteorologist
at WHIO-TV (Channel 7); and WDTN-TV (Channel 2) meteorologist Kathy
Ellis have been fielding a flurry of questions from Dayton-area
residents who insist that the best Christmas is a white one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people stop me on the street and demand that I
deliver snow,'' Barnhill says with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Some won't take no for an answer, according to Ellis. ``When you
tell them it probably won't be a white Christmas, they look
disappointed, then they say, 'Can't you do something to make it
snow?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Even people who hate snow like to have a little bit around
during the holidays, Parham says. ``The only difference is that
those people want it to disappear the day after Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was chilled out this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like South Florida is going to be the
warmest place in the country,'' said Bernard Esposito,
forecaster-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Miami. Palm
Beach County and the Treasure Coast can expect temperatures in low
80s through at least Saturday, with nights in the upper 60s. The
sudden cold front that is wreaking havoc up north will stop short
of St. Augustine to Cedar Key until at least late Saturday or early
Sunday.

 Just Click and Give  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Looking for a way to spread a little last-minute holiday cheer?
Look no further than your PC: Charitable groups have gone online.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of charitable organizations are harnessing the
enormous popularity of the Web to make donating money as simple as
any other electronic transaction _ enter your credit card number,
click the mouse and you're done.
</P>
<P>
   United Way, the American Cancer Society, the Red Cross and
UNICEF are just a few of the nonprofit groups that have gone
high-tech in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very busy, and donating online is quick,'' said
Dave Sandretto, executive director of Second Harvest Food Bank of
Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. The group, which helps feed the
hungry, has had a Web site for several years and began accepting
online donations just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The site,  &LR; www.donatefood.org &LR; , currently only takes financial
contributions, but it will soon allow donors to purchase groceries
for Second Harvest though online grocer Peapod.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a natural for here. People in Silicon Valley are
on the Web, so it's very easy to click over to Second Harvest and
make your donation,'' said Sandretto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that ease, he said, response has been slow _ only a
tiny &LR;   &LR; percentage of total holiday giving has come via the
Internet. Sandretto hopes the site will eventually provide a way
for people to give year-round, not just at holidays or when they're
solicited by Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides smoothing the way for financial contributions, several
Web sites are dedicated to making it easy to help in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it easy, more people are going to do it,'' said Jay
Backstrand, president of ImpactOnline, a Palo Alto group that
operates a Web site matching volunteers to nonprofit groups across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Using the site,  &LR; www.volunteermatch.org &LR; , would-be volunteers in
a hurry can punch in their ZIP code and certain other
specifications _ when they'd like to volunteer, how far they're
willing to travel and if they're seeking an continuing or one-time
volunteer opportunity _ and pull up a list of volunteer
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site was launched in earnest in April, ImpactOnline
has hooked up some 13,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Bay Area, these volunteers have helped with such
projects as delivering meals to people with AIDS (Project Open
Hand), teaching reading (Project READ), sorting food at local food
banks and feeding animals in a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonprofit organizations need people, and they need to be able
to get them without having to spend a lot of money,'' said
Backstrand.
</P>
<P>
   Listing with ImpactOnline is free for both volunteers and
nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   The group is supported by the Packard Foundation, along with
several individual philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site caters to those who want to do good in a
relatively painless way _ by shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   At  &LR; www.iGive.com &LR; , the enlightened shopper can buy goods from
21 merchants including software retailer beyond.com, eToys, Music
Boulevard, cosmetics direct-marketer Avon and online video retailer
Reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   A percentage of each sale goes to the charity of the shoppers'
choice _ as little as 2.5 percent at apparel retailer J. Crew and
up to 12.5 percent from eToys. In exchange for directing shoppers
to e-merchants, iGive collects a transaction fee on each purchase
equal to the amount donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site began operating a year ago, 40,000 people have
used it to give a total of $180,000 to 43 different causes, said
Robert Grosshandler, chief executive of iGive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way people can do good in their daily lives,''
said Grosshandler. ``There's a whole new Internet economy
developing, and nonprofits need to participate in that.''

 (Editors: note that `AT SIGN' should be replaced with the symbol)   Downloading Forms From the IRS 
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; QUESTION &LR; : When I download forms from the IRS, I receive the
information in a format that my computer can't decipher. How can I
get the forms in normal text? I have Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  The IRS lets you download forms and publications in
several formats, none of which is straight text. Generally, the
most convenient format is PDF, which was developed by Adobe
Systems. PDF (portable document format) makes documents look
exactly the same on the computer as they do in print.
</P>
<P>
   To use PDF files, you'll need the Acrobat Reader software, which
is free. You can download it from Adobe  &LR; (www.adobe.com), &LR;  or from
almost any shareware library. Once you install the Acrobat Reader,
you'll be able to print any PDF files that you download from the
IRS or other Web sites (many companies make documents such as
annual reports and product manuals available in PDF).

Bangkok) and the e-mail address I was given ends in &LR;  (AT &LR; 
 &LR; SIGN)ksc.th.com.  &LR; I tried to e-mail him today and my ISP returned
the message. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: I think you've got the address in the wrong order. The
country code _ in this case ``th'' _ should be the last thing in
the domain name. Try  &LR; (AT SIGN)ksc.com.th  &LR; and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   A Word About Overstrike
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I work in Microsoft Word 97, the program occasionally
shifts into ``overtype'' mode. While this can be turned off by
deselecting it in the ``Edit'' part of the Options menu, it's a
pain to have to stop work in order to do this. Is there any way to
prevent Word from turning on the overtype mode, or can I
permanently turn it off?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You don't have to go into the Edit menu to turn off the
overtype mode. Just hit the Insert key on your keyboard. It lets
you toggle between the overtype and insert mode (which is the
default setting).
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the reason your system is switching to overtype
probably is because you're inadvertently hitting the Insert key.
You can't permanently disable overtype, but you can be more careful
where you put your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Finding the Right Type
</P>
<P>
   Q: This has bugged me for the longest time and a search of
online help, Web sites and even newsgroups has failed me. When I
bring up a Web page in Internet Explorer 4.0, I get ``medium'' as
the font size. If I change the size to ``smaller'' (using the Fonts
option in the View menu), it only works during the current online
session. How can I set the smaller font as the default for all my
surfing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what you do: Instead of going to Fonts in the View
menu, choose Internet Options. In the General options, click on
Fonts at the bottom of the window. Then choose the font size you
want and click Set as Default.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. The font size will remain the same until the next
time you change it.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided About a Mac
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a children's author, turned author-publisher, and I'm
considering making the switch from PCs to Macs, because of the many
graphics tasks that I'm facing. Is it still true that Macs are
significantly easier to use for people who, like myself, are far
from naturals with a computer?
</P>
<P>
   The other reason I'm considering the switch is that most
graphics designers and art departments in the print media seem to
favor the Mac format over PCs. If I send a book jacket scan and
news brief to print publishers over the Internet, are they more
likely to be able to handle such digital files without hassle if
they're created on a Mac?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Early in its history, Apple became the computer of choice
for publishing, thanks to the Macintosh's ease of use, and
PageMaker software from Adobe, which was developed initially for
the Mac. Today, Macs still command tremendous loyalty from graphic
artists and others in the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows PCs have caught up with Macs in many ways when
it comes to graphic design. And companies like Adobe now make
nearly identical versions of their products for PCs and Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The one advantage Macs still have is that some print shops still
are better able to deal with Mac documents.
</P>
<P>
   My advice would be to ask people with whom you'll be dealing
which system they use, and go with the consensus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tip of the Week &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You need to copy a page or two occasionally. You want to fax a
letter to a business associate. And you'd like to put some old
family documents in your computer. Instead of spending $400 or $500
on an all-purpose printer-scanner-fax machine, just buy a nice
flat-bed scanner for less than $200. Once you scan a document or
photo, you can save it as a graphics file, fax it or print it,
making as many copies as you like.

 SOME SEE PACIFICARE FACING HARDER TIMES  (jw) 
 By REED ABELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pacificare Health Systems seems insulated from the problems of
the rest of the managed-care industry. While the majority of HMOs
are losing money covering the elderly under Medicare, Pacificare,
the nation's largest Medicare HMO, is solidly profitable. The
company is even telling Wall Street analysts that it should be able
to increase its earnings by about 25 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And while managed-care stocks are down by an average of 7
percent so far this year, Pacificare's nonvoting class B shares are
up an impressive 49 percent. The shares closed Wednesday at
$77.9375 each, down 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and investors are not convinced that
Pacificare is quite as exceptional as it may appear. Some say that
the company's impressive performance is a result in part of how it
is accounting for its future medical costs, which has resulted in
higher earnings. Others believe that it is only a matter of time
before the harsh economics facing HMOs that serve the Medicare
population _ whose medical costs are rising faster than premiums _
catch up with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Holt, an analyst with the Strong Opportunity and Common
Stock funds, has been avoiding Medicare HMOs and has been trying to
find HMOs with less exposure to the market. While Pacificare has
been able to control its costs better than many competitors, the
overall environment ``makes me pretty nervous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have similar worries. ``Pacificare is likely to
disappoint investors severely in 1999,'' warned Anne Anderson, an
analyst with the Atlantis Investment Company in Parsippany, N.J.,
who is widely credited with predicting the downfall of another HMO,
Oxford Health Plans. She is shorting the stock, or betting that the
shares will fall in price.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare is not without its defenders, of course. The company
has recovered nicely from the trouble it had in digesting its
acquisition of FHP International, when it found itself with some
unprofitable business. Its stock has also bounced back from its
lows of early 1997, although it is still trading below its July
high of $93.25.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare, based in Santa Ana, Calif., also enjoys some
important advantages. The bulk of its members are in California,
where doctors are used to operating under managed care, as the
state has been a pioneer in the field. The company's contracts
largely protect it from rising costs because many of its doctors
have agreed to provide whatever care is necessary for a fixed sum.
The company says that about 80 percent of its Medicare costs are
controlled through these so-called capitated arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare has ``off-loaded the risk to multispecialty groups
and other types of providers,'' said Joseph Martingale, a
consultant with Towers Perrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some of Pacificare's recent success seems to be a
result of changes in the way the company is accounting for future
medical costs. Its reserves _ the money it puts aside to cover
medical claims and benefits _ have not kept up with the growth of
its premiums, according to a report by the Center for Financial
Research and Analysis Inc., a Rockville, Md., group that
scrutinizes accounting for investors. As a percentage of its
quarterly premium revenue, Pacificare's medical reserves had
declined to 27.9 percent at the end of September from 30.5 percent
at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lower reserves may have resulted in ``an artificial boost to
reported earnings,'' according to the center. Had Pacificare kept
the amount of its reserves constant as a percentage of its
premiums, medical costs would have increased by about $62 million
for the first nine months of the year, the center calculated, and
its net income over that period would have been reduced by about
$32 million. Earnings would have been $2.41 a share, compared with
the $3.12 a share that Pacificare reported.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Pacificare's competitors, including Humana, Wellpoint
Health Networks and Foundation Health Systems, are reserving a much
higher portion of their premium dollar, according to the center.
Foundation Health, for example, has 38.6 percent of its premium
revenue in reserves, and Humana has 60.6 percent. Pacificare's
relatively low level of reserves ``could leave the company
vulnerable to the potential depletion of its reserve and a possible
charge to earnings in the event of higher-than-anticipated future
claims,'' the center said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoops, Pacificare's chairman and chief executive, said that
Pacificare was able to lower the amount it was putting into reserve
because it had sharply reduced its claims backlog. Its contracts
also allow it to reserve less than its competitors. ``As compared
with many other companies, we are not as exposed to claims
liability,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even if Pacificare's success has entirely been the product
of its own abilities, the future looks uncertain. The company may
not be able to lower its reserves as a percentage of its premiums
in future years, and the Medicare market is proving extraordinarily
difficult for any HMO to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking health plans to operate with too little money,''
said Kirby Bosley, a principal with the consulting firm of William
Mercer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to pay HMOs about 2 percent more next
year, but health care costs are expected to climb 6 to 8 percent.
The costs of prescription drugs are expected to rise even faster,
anywhere from 12 to 15 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, who have been pushed to accept less to deliver care and
assume more of the risk of unexpected spikes in medical costs, may
not be willing _ or able _ to provide care under these terms.
Pacificare plans to offer them about half the premium increase it
will get in 1999 _ an increase of less than 1 percent. Doctors
``are hurting already with what they are being paid,'' Ms. Bosley
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if some medical groups fail, Pacificare may be affected.
When FPA Medical Management, a company that bought and managed
physician practices, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this
year, Pacificare had to ante up $35 million to cover possible
unpaid claims by FPA and other insolvent providers. But Hoops of
Pacificare contends that FPA was an exception and that the vast
majority of medical groups are financially sound.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the government could end up paying these plans more
for their coverage than it indicated it would. But predicting what
will happen in Washington is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the government also represents another risk.
According to the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, the
mass defection of HMOs from the Medicare market could prompt the
Office of Inspector General of the Health Care Financing
Administration to take a look into how HMOs, ``particularly those
with relatively large Medicare concentrations,'' are determining
the benefits they offer and designing their plans. Pacificare said
it believed it was in full compliance with any federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Pacificare could have a hard time
achieving its ambitious profit goals next year. The company says it
can get the bulk of its higher earnings through its commercial
business, where it has been increasing its rates. But a third of
the costs it incurs covering employees is not controlled through
its capitated arrangements. And Pacificare is still counting on
some improvement in profitability in its Medicare business by
increasing membership and lowering overhead expenses. And its
Medicare business still accounts for more than half of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare is also counting on increasing its overall membership
by about 5 percent ``in our existing markets,'' according to Hoops,
despite the membership declines the company expects to report for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare may prove the skeptics wrong. But it will not be
easy. Even Hoops concedes that if the government continues to
refuse to increase its payments in line with rising medical and
drug costs, the company may be forced either to cut its benefits or
raise its prices. ``We can't make it,'' he said, ``and neither can
the physicians.''

BANANA SPAT COULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR WORLD TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few Americans care whether Europe buys bananas from Ecuador,
Guatemala or Honduras. So many wondered whether the Clinton
administration recklessly started a trade war when it announced
this week a list of European luxury products _ ranging from
cashmere clothing to chandeliers _ that it vowed to tax into
extinction if the European Union did not open its borders to
bananas from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions grew worse when it became known that a political
power behind the administration's action was Carl Lindner, a large
contributor to both political parties and the chief executive of
Chiquita Brands International, one of two big American distributors
of Latin American bananas in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the motive, the administration picked its battle
wisely. If Europe gets its way in this otherwise trivial trade
spat, it could gut the world's three-year-old mechanism for
resolving trade disputes, a mechanism that professor John Jackson
of the Georgetown University Law School regards as ``the finest
international legal tribunal in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's complicated system for allocating licenses to import
bananas discriminates in favor of European companies that
distribute bananas grown in Europe's former colonies in the
Caribbean and Africa. Some types of discrimination are allowed
under international trade rules. But Europe's system flagrantly
violates these rules, according to three international trade
tribunals over the last six years. Europe ignored the first two
rulings, exercising the right under the toothless pre-1995
procedures of defendants to veto adverse rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But veto rights were rescinded three years ago when the world's
trading partners created the World Trade Organization and adopted a
revised system for referring trade fights to impartial dispute
panels. Victorious plaintiffs, like the United States in the banana
case, were explicitly authorized to impose sanctions under
authority of the WTO if the offending country refused to make
amends.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the United States thought. But in the banana case, Europe
has exploited a loophole in the rules. By revising its licensing
laws in a manner that the United States and other countries call a
sham, Europe contends it has complied with the trade panel's
ruling, thereby stripping the United States of any authority to
retaliate. The European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon
Brittan, has called the Clinton administration's threatened
sanctions ``unilateralism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros and cons of the banana dispute are not overly
important. Europe's legal maneuver is. The truth, according to
Jackson and many other legal experts, is that WTO rules include one
section that appears to give the United States the right to
retaliate if Europe does not correct its licensing system. But
another section appears to give Europe the right to declare itself
in compliance and force the United States to begin a new trade
case, taking years to resolve, if it cries foul. And there is no
guarantee that once the new case is resolved, Europe will not carry
out another sham response, ensnarling the United States in one
fruitless legal dispute after another.
</P>
<P>
   But as cynical as Europe's ploy may be, it has a point. Its
accuser, the United States, cannot, once a panel has ruled, serve
as sole judge as to whether Europe's practices conform to
international standards. Yet victorious plaintiffs cannot tolerate
indefinite delay as international tribunals are asked to review
every evolution of a nation's trade rules. If Europe's
interpretation prevails, the WTO will become as toothless as its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington proposes a way out of the box. He would submit Europe's
new licensing system to binding arbitration. The arbitrator would
decide whether the system conforms to WTO rules. Fairness would
require appointing as arbitrator someone from the WTO appeals panel
that ruled on behalf of the United States. Otherwise, the United
States would be faced, in effect, with having to win its case twice
_ once before the initial panel and then again before an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agrees that binding arbitration is the best way to close
the loophole exposed by Europe's maneuvering and cites precedent
under the WTO for such a solution. He cautions that it will take a
lot of time and effort because more than 100 member countries would
have to approve new trade procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever effort it takes to fix the dispute mechanism is
warranted because the three-year-old system has been a nearly
unqualified success. In a series of politically delicate and
economically tricky cases, trade panels have issued carefully
crafted and smart rulings that show no bias in favor of the rich
and powerful. The WTO, for example, ruled in favor of Venezuela and
Brazil when they correctly accused the United States of shutting
out their oil exports. To the administration's credit, it quickly
brought American trade practices into line, giving it credibility
in the current dispute with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson points to other rulings that he says were carefully
balanced: against Europe's prohibition of beef imports from the
United States that the Europeans say are tainted with growth
hormones, and against an American prohibition on imported shrimp
caught by vessels that endanger sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd sense, Europe's stance may be indirect payback. During
the 1994 congressional fight over membership in the new WTO,
Clinton's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, infuriated many
Europeans by arguing that membership in the trade organization
would not obligate America to obey its rules. The United States
could defy the rules and accept retaliation knowing full well that
few countries, no matter how valid their case, would choose to
initiate a trade war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has not explicitly endorsed Kantor's legalistic view. But
its maneuvering on bananas bears the footprints of his legalisms _
legalisms that if unchecked could undo a system that has so far
kept big and small countries playing by the same set of fair rules.

PROTESTS OVER LESBIAN SCENE CLOSES INDIA CINEMAS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By BARRY BEARAK 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Of the two beautiful women, one was married
to a cad, the other to a fool, and when these husbands proved
neglectful, the wives themselves fell into bed, their fingers
touching each other's skin as if feeling an intricate brocade.
</P>
<P>
   This scene from ``Fire'' is the first time an Indian film has
explicitly shown homosexual relations, an event both repellent and
opportune to a waning fringe Hindu movement known as Shiv Sena. Its
offended minions have attacked theaters, shutting down the movie in
Bombay, New Delhi and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become the victim of an Indian gestapo,'' lamented
Deepa Mehta, 43, the film's director. ``This is so very ridiculous
_ and also so scary. I don't even think it's the lesbianism that
threatens them. It's that the movie says women have choices, and
that is frightening to a male-dominated society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta, who divides her time between Toronto and New Delhi,
was seated in a front room of her parents' home here as three
severe-looking men with automatic weapons held vigil outside. These
bodyguards were ordered by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Already shown in several countries, ``Fire'' is a two-year-old,
award-winning film that has struck some critics as sensitive and
acute and others as a soap-operatic bore. The government's Censor
Board approved the movie without cuts in May, and it had been
playing to good crowds for two weeks before Shiv Sena discovered
the nature of its romantic heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fair to show such things which are not part of Indian
culture?'' Balasaheb K. Thackeray, Shiv Sena's leader, asked in a
magazine interview. ``It can corrupt tender minds. It is a sort of
a social AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a politically correct mix of men and women and alerting
the news media beforehand, so-called Shiv Sainiks rampaged through
a matinee show in Bombay on Dec. 2, smashing glass and burning
posters. The next day, theaters in New Delhi, Pune and Surat were
similarly hit. Then came a theater in Calcutta, though the audience
there fought off the marauders and the movie remained open.
</P>
<P>
   With these highly publicized incidents, the nation's elite began
taking sides. The venerable film star Dilip Kumar spoke in favor of
artistic freedom only to find near-nude Shiv Sainiks circling his
home. If Kumar favored such cinematic immodesty, they reasoned, he
should be treated to a continuing procession of men in underpants.
</P>
<P>
   For India's Hindu nationalist leadership _ troubled by heaps of
dirty linen among the strange bedfellows in its coalition
government _ its Shiv Sena allies have become an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray's party controls the populous state of Maharashtra,
but his support is accompanied by his tongue, an instrument that
has praised Hitler while denouncing Christians, Muslims and Sikhs.
This year, a report of a judicial inquiry named him a provocateur
of frenzied Hindu mobs that in 1992 burned Muslim homes and
businesses and killed 1,200 in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Recent parliamentary elections have shown a drop in the Shiv
Sena's appeal to disaffected Hindu slum-dwellers. Thackeray seems
to be grasping for issues.
</P>
<P>
   Just before attacking ``Fire,'' he tried to have the Pakistani
cricket team banned in India, a notion rebuked by Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee. The prime minister also has condemned the
movie theater violence, though it is the Supreme Court that has
commanded protection for Ms. Mehta and the film's exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners so far are unwilling to reopen the film. The
national Censor Board has decided to review its approval of
``Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy is nothing new to Indian censor boards, especially
given the prodigious film industry's simultaneous instincts for
prudishness and lust. In the 1970's, kissing on the lips was being
debated while the very same movies reliably featured orgiastic
dances by scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   Today, bedroom embraces remain as timid as Rock Hudson and Doris
Day, though virtually every film has singing sweethearts who do so
much pelvic thrusting that a love scene appears more like an
exercise video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erotic movement: this is the devil's food of Hindu cinema,''
said Vishnu Khare, a film critic. ``Everyone may remain fully
clothed, but there is a lot of sexual posturing and rubbing
together of bodies. It is a supreme form of voyeurism.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence, including rape, is also customary in the films. ``The
victim is either the hero's sister or the hero's brother's wife,''
Khare said. ``It can't be the heroine because by becoming a rape
victim a woman becomes untouchable. As soon as I see a hero's
sister-in-law, I know she is there to be raped and then killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign films are held to a different standard. In New Delhi,
some two dozen theaters show ``morning movies,'' a popular pre-noon
display of soft pornography from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a white female torso, nobody minds it,'' Khare said.
``It merely proves to Indians how fallen and decadent white people
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with American films beamed nightly on television, many
Indians fear that their bedrooms are being colonized and their
sexual conventions transformed.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this sexual timorousness may seem odd. After all, this
is the land of the Kama Sutra and ancient triple X-rated temple
carvings.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of homosexuality remains uncommon here, and this was
especially so at the Shiv Sena headquarters in northern New Delhi.
Inside a tiny office sat the group's local chief, Jai Bhagwan
Goyal, 43, a small-factory owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we assume lesbianism does happen, what is the point of
showing it to people?'' he asked in exasperation. ``Everyone knows
what goes on between a husband and wife, but they do not do it in
the middle of a road.''
</P>
<P>
   To further make his point, Goyal made a few phone calls and
brought together 10 women from the group. Dressed in saris and
shawls, these housewives were pained to discuss a world where
homosexuality even existed, let alone one where it was portrayed in
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an insult to Indians everywhere, and we would gladly
go to jail or even die before we allow such a thing to be shown,''
a woman said as the others nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Goyal then ushered them out. He and his men had something to do
that could not involve mixed company. He had obtained a bootleg
video of ``Fire'' and, for the first time, would see the film.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men watched it at Goyal's factory so as not to defile
their homes. They switched it off before it ended, in part because
their copy was in English instead of one dubbed in the more
familiar Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they had viewed ``Fire'' long enough to see the
much-talked-about sex and had reach a shared conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could ever be more disgusting,'' Goyal said, though
this simple pronouncement did not seem quite enough. So he repeated
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said. ``Nothing, nothing.''

ESCAPE ON AN ICE-COATED HIGHWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a special reason to be thankful this
holiday season: I'm alive.
</P>
<P>
   For a few harrowing seconds in Wednesday's wee morning hours, on
an icy stretch of Interstate 35, I thought my time had come.
</P>
<P>
   It was around 1 a.m., and bone-chilling cold outside. There was
no precipitation _ and no highway danger as far as I could tell _
as I drove north on I-35 in Austin to drop off a friend.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning, conditions abruptly changed as I got back on
the freeway heading south. It began to sleet. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ice quickly covered my windshield, almost instantly blocking my
view. I hit the defrost and windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
   As my vision cleared, I saw some cars ahead of me. I remember
thinking, as my foot gently pressed down on the brake pedal,
``What's wrong with these dad-gum brakes?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for me to realize my brakes were not the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   I was on the cutting edge of a Texas ice storm, completely out
of control in my 1989 Ford pickup heading down I-35.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the cars next to me were also fishtailing left and
right. That we would meet each other in a violent collision at that
very moment seemed certain.
</P>
<P>
   I saw no way out.
</P>
<P>
   With little left to do but pray, I kept my foot off the brakes
and my hands firmly gripped on the steering wheel. Somehow, in the
absurd ice gallery that I-35 had become, an opening appeared.
</P>
<P>
   And with no help from me or my balding-tired truck, I slipped
through. Twenty-five minutes later, after driving 10 mph on
sleet-covered streets, I was home _ and thanking my lucky stars.
</P>
<P>
   Those behind me were not so lucky. Nor were the ones who came
after them. When it was over, 59 cars had piled up on both sides of
the freeway, and two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   I know that a thousand events could have conspired to produce a
different outcome. Having to stop at a single red light could have
caused me to show up two minutes later than I did. That might have
been too late.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was.
</P>
<P>
   I will say a prayer this Christmas for the families who lost
loved ones on that bitterly cold freeway. For everybody else, I'll
say: Drive carefully, and count your blessings. .MDBR/.MDNM/

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first frenzied weeks after the name Monica Lewinsky
lurched into the news last January, it was clear that the media had
entered uncharted waters _ a rip current where competition between
old and new media was rewriting the rules of gathering and
reporting news.
</P>
<P>
   There was Matt Drudge, who first posted the story, pilfered from
Newsweek, on his Internet tip sheet; the talk shows that gave it
legs; the 24-hour cable news networks that rode it up the ratings,
and the handful of respected newspapers that publicly stumbled in
the scramble to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the past 11 months, many people inside and
outside journalism described the episode as a laboratory experiment
for the post-modern media age _ the moment when the diverse forces
of the instant communication era converged for the first time on a
major political scandal.
</P>
<P>
   How members of the media have performed _ and how the public
fared _ is a subject of stark disagreement. After months of
criticism, many working journalists now express a sense of almost
vindication. Most of what was reported, they said in recent
interviews, has turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, described the last 11 months as ``a very dark
chapter in the history of the American press,'' as Geneva
Overholser, a former ombudsman for The Washington Post, put it.
After such shameful excesses, some said, it is an inadequate
defense to point out that the stories were not wrong after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this other task,'' said Jay Rosen, a journalism
professor at New York University. ``The news media have to help us
have the best conversation we can about what became a
constitutional crisis. Looked at that way, the performance of our
journalists can be seen as a kind of national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy because the media cooperated in the expansion
of this story to a sort of partisan, divisive and directionless
game,'' Rosen said. ``It also produced a level of public exhaustion
that is now a serious defect. We don't need the American public to
be exhausted by impeachment at this hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific charges against the media are familiar by now:
sensationalism, rumor-mongering, overreliance on unnamed sources,
sanctimoniousness, speculation, salaciousness, leaping to judgment
and losing all sense of proportion and self-control, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters became ``tank drivers'' for Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, said David Halberstam, the journalist and author.
Cable television talk shows were more like professional wrestling
than real dialogue, said Rem Rieder, the editor of The American
Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kind of Chinese water-torture news,'' said Robert
Lichter, a political scientist who is president of the Center for
Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan media monitoring group in
Washington. ``People were driven mad by the constant dripping of
rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, after offering up to $1 million to any woman who could
prove she had had sex with a member of Congress, Larry Flynt, the
publisher of the sex magazine Hustler, is taking credit for the
disclosure of extramarital affairs that forced House Speaker-elect
Bob Livingston to announce on Saturday that he would resign from
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many working journalists look back on the coverage
quite differently than do their critics.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have nearly all the stories been borne out, including
the improbable tale of Ms. Lewinsky's unclean dress, but also, one
can no longer argue that the subject did not deserve the attention,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that, now that the media encompass everything
from The Wall Street Journal to Drudge, they can no longer be seen
as monolithic. Certain news organizations did well, especially
those that relied on their own reporting and stuck to their
standards, many said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were heartened by what Gene Roberts, a former managing
editor of The New York Times, called the ``self-correcting
process'' at work, through which news organizations that reported
stories that could not be substantiated ended up becoming the focus
of media scrutiny themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Print journalists tended to praise the work of the print media
and disparage that of television. Broadcast television journalists
faulted cable. People at CNN drew distinctions between their
network and those of Fox News and MSNBC. One online editor
criticized newspaper editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about what we did,'' said Rich Oppel, the
editor of The Austin American-Statesman and a former Washington
bureau chief for Knight Ridder. ``I would credit the major
newspapers with having handled the story responsibly. And clearly,
the story has had sustained importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Sorenson, vice president of MSNBC, the cable news network
whose blanket coverage earned it the nickname the Clinton
Impeachment Channel, said, ``I'm not sure there is anything I would
have done differently in terms of coverage decisions and
programming decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some close observers outside journalism said much of the
criticism was misplaced. Michael Schudson, the author of ``The Good
Citizen'' (Free Press, 1998), a history of American civic life,
said that over-eager media coverage had little to do with the
crisis set in motion by the story of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is that there is an intense and bitter partisanship
in Washington which has its own logic,'' said Schudson, a professor
of communication at the University of California at San Diego. ``I
think that's why, between Washington and the rest of the country,
there is such a gulf.''
</P>
<P>
   The story may mark the moment at which the notion of a serious
so-called disconnect between the public and the press became
conventional wisdom. The press presumed to understand what was
important, and what was not, in a way that many Americans came to
resent.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brill, whose media-watchdog magazine, Brill's Content,
made its debut in July with a critique of the coverage, said the
magazine's mail suggested that many Americans viewed the Washington
press corps and political leaders in many ways as one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're celebrities and they're having their own debate and
discussion about this, and we don't care much about it,'' Brill
said, characterizing the view of the public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of which worries people, particularly an older generation of
reporters who wonder about the question: On what basis do people
make up their minds about important issues when they have lost
confidence in the institutions that once brought them the news?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not on the basis of what the CBS `Evening News'
reports but on the basis of talk shows, Internet gossip, chat rooms
and water-cooler conversations, we have a very serious and historic
problem,'' said Marvin Kalb, a former correspondent for CBS and NBC
who is now director of the Shorenstein Center on press, politics
and public policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   But others are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Rossetto, a co-founder of Wired Ventures, the original
publisher of Wired magazine and the creators of Hotwired, an
Internet magazine, said the loss of credibility was good. The old
media are losing their monopoly on analyzing current events, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one overarching mainstream like Walter Cronkite
talking to the entire nation,'' Rossetto said. ``To me, that's a
lot healthier. Everyone then has a more skeptical attitude about
the information they're getting. People shouldn't believe what they
see; they should question what they're told.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, only a few journalists made any predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time an intern walks into the Oval Office with a
pizza and flashes a piece of lingerie, I think the president is
likely to call the Secret Service and say, `Get this lunatic out of
here!''' said Jeff Greenfield, a senior analyst for CNN. ``That's
what I would predict.''

CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR FULL SENATE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that sentiment in the Senate is running
toward censure and against a full impeachment trial, conservative
Republicans in both houses said on Wednesday that they want to hear
a thorough airing of the evidence and arguments from the
prosecutors and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With many senators searching for ways to end the impeachment
process quickly, Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip who was the
driving force for impeachment in the House, said it would be wrong
for the Senate to ``short-circuit the process'' through a quick
censure vote. He urged senators to review the ``reams of evidence
that have not been publicly aired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before people look to cut a deal with the White House or their
surrogates who will seek to influence the process, it is my hope
that one would spend plenty of time in the evidence room,'' DeLay
said in a statement. ``If this were to happen, you may realize that
67 votes may appear out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's staff said later that the Texas congressman was simply
urging the senators to study all the evidence closely, and was not
referring to anything in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the impeachment vote was approaching, about a
dozen wavering House Republicans were invited into a sealed room
where they reviewed a number of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers, first placed under seal by the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, and then made available to House members,
include a hearsay accusation that Clinton had forced himself on a
woman about 20 years ago. The president's lawyers released an
affidavit from the woman early this year flatly denying that such
an incident took place.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's statement about a full trial was echoed in large part by
several conservative Republican senators on Wednesday, who said
they want a thorough trial in the Senate followed by a vote on
whether Clinton is guilty of one or both articles of impeachment
approved by the House. Those articles charged that the president
lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to make a decision prior to considering all the
evidence in a formal setting would be a dangerous precedent,'' said
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``We must commence the trial and consider
the evidence. We can begin by considering the evidence presented by
the House. We could end a trial at that point. But we need to
exonerate this president or convict this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to talk about a quick resolution of the impeachment
process, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said, ``I've just been alarmed
that since Sunday so many of my colleagues think this band wagon is
gaining speed. Well, nobody called me.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats continued to insist on Wednesday that there
were not enough votes in the Senate to convict the president and
that there was strong, bipartisan sentiment to find a way to open a
trial but then wrap it up quickly, through a swift vote to dismiss
the charges, to acquit the president or to censure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a real desire to move in a bipartisan way and
with more dispatch than was done in the House,'' said Sen.-elect
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who voted against impeachment in the House
and plans to vote against conviction in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring about a quick conclusion of the process,
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader, has been
serving as an unofficial liaison between the White House and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott in discussions over the shape of a trial
and the possibility of censure, according to several senators.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is on vacation in his home state of Mississippi and was not
available for comment on Wednesday. But his spokesman, John
Cwartacki, said Lott has said that he would oppose ``any effort to
short-circuit'' the impeachment process, and thinks that a trial
must at least begin in the Senate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One Democratic senator criticized DeLay following his statement
on Wednesday, asserting that he should not be trying to influence
the Senate. Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey said that
efforts by House Republicans to meddle in the Senate ``will be
resisted and resented and not just by Democrats. They can present
their case when called upon on the Senate floor but otherwise their
involvement in the process is over.''
</P>
<P>
   A House panel will present the case for impeachment on two
charges, perjury and obstruction of justice, to the 100 senators,
who will serve as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel for the Democrats
on the House Judiciary Committee, said of DeLay's remarks: ``The
notion that there is any evidence in the secure room that if read
in its entirety would add anything to the debate is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation that Clinton sexually assaulted a woman about 20
years ago came up in the Paula Jones sexual harassment trial.
Earlier this year, the president's lawyer, Robert Bennett, released
a signed affidavit in which the woman, known as ``Jane Doe No. 5,''
flatly dismissed the accusations, which were originally made by
acquaintances of the woman, as untrue.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican investigators from the Judiciary Committee went
back and did their own interviews in the case, and some of that
information has been available to House members.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell added, ``When I last checked, Mr. DeLay was the majority
whip of the House and I hadn't realized that somewhere between last
Saturday and today he had become involved in the leadership in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for DeLay said he was not trying to direct senators
to particular documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just meant, `Take your time and listen to the evidence,' ''
said Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay. ``What we're saying is
there's a lot of evidence there and we didn't pass these articles
of impeachment on a whim.''

MODERATE'S INS AND OUTS IN AN ANTI-IMPEACH VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWALK, Conn. _ Facing a tableful of politicians at a Capitol
Hill club last week, the waitress picked out Rep. Christopher Shays
and exclaimed, ``You're the guy that I saw on TV. You're the guy
that had that meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, the famously bland Connecticut Republican whose
constituents had vented about impeachment until 2 a.m. at a town
meeting that C-Span broadcast live on Tuesday of last week, said he
took the woman's name so he could delve into her views on the topic
later.
</P>
<P>
   Shays calls himself ``an extreme moderate'' and last week he was
decidedly undecided about whether to vote to impeach President
Clinton. So Washington hung on his every hem and haw.
</P>
<P>
   First he declared that he opposed impeachment. Then early last
week, in a grim sign for the White House, he said he was rethinking
that. By midweek, he had become convinced the president had
obstructed justice and was set on voting ``yes.'' Then he returned
to his original position.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he presided over the town meeting for 1,500 at
Norwalk City Hall, huddled privately with the President on Friday,
and adopted the stance of a solicitously curious country doctor, as
he sought the views of voters in private chats.
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters in his district, here in the Connecticut
suburbs of New York City, it all reflected rigorous research, deep
thinking and admirable independence. To his critics, it was
ludicrous hand-wringing. Shays was greeted by both camps on
Wednesday as he returned to his district to explain himself with
the mantra that ``impeachable offenses were not proven and the
proven offenses were not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   He does remain highly critical of Clinton and asserted that
``The worst thing he could do is to treat the Senate like he
treated the House, and that was by not fully complying with the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he finally decided on Friday morning, just 24 hours
before he would break from his party and become one of five
Republicans who voted against impeachment. Later that day, he met
with the president for 70 minutes. To set an intimate tone, Shays
brought no staff, which for Washington's powerful is nearly as
remarkable a gesture as showing up barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who kept one of his lawyers in the room, may have
been wasting his time. Shays, who said he will keep the specifics
of their discussion secret, said he had been determined to make up
his mind in advance, noting that the president ``can be very
persuasive.'' So instead, Shays used the meeting to tell the
president about the very mixed views that had emerged at the town
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Karen D. Blackwell, an antiques dealer,
hugged Shays as he returned to Norwalk City Hall to meet
constituents. Ms. Blackwell, a member of the Norwalk Republican
Committee, had favored impeachment but was willing to forgive her
representative's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher voted his conscience and his heart,'' Ms.
Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth J. Slapin, a local Democratic organizer, accused
Shays of being on a ``showboat circuit,'' and scolded him for
``trying to have it both ways by bashing the president and then
voting against impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who stopped publicly discussing his views in the four
days before the votes on articles of impeachment and had not
explained them since, offered an earnest autopsy on Wednesday. He
said he began to re-examine his opposition to impeachment when
several colleagues who had been anti-impeachment began to waver.
``I was thinking, `What are they seeing, what are they aware of,
that I'm not aware of,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the town meeting on Tuesday of last week, he said he heard
powerful arguments for and against the president, and said he was
struck by the number of constituents who ``not only dislike him,
they think he's a despicable person.'' As he began driving back to
Washington in the hours before dawn, he was leaning against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really concluded that those who wanted the president
impeached wanted to set a standard,'' he said. ``But I didn't feel
that impeachment was the way you _ quote, unquote _ set a standard.
When the American people elect someone, I believe it's sacred and I
believe you only remove for high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, he changed his mind after he looked at
some secret material about Clinton, including a description of an
unsubstantiated encounter with another woman, that the independent
counsel's office had provided to the House Judiciary Committee. The
material, which was viewed by several moderate Republicans who were
wrestling with their decisions, was available to members of
Congress but not to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very alarming, very unsettling,'' Shays said. ``It
involved conduct by the president that is alleged to be pretty
horrific.'' He said he began to ``believe that this information I
was looking at would support obstruction of justice.'' He said that
when he went to bed, he was convinced he could vote for at least
one article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he said he went back and looked at the documents
again, spoke to Republican lawyers and investigators who had looked
into it. That afternoon, he said he became concerned that the
allegations had not been proven. The next day, he talked to a
person familiar with the material, whom he would not identify
beyond saying that the person is outside Congress or the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual said to me, `There is no obstruction of
justice,''' Shays said. ``So whatever I thought about the actions
that involved the president, there was no obstruction of justice.''
However, Shays said that if the House eventually is asked to join a
joint censure with the Senate, he will think about it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks barreled ahead Wednesday with two main gauges
setting records and a third, the Dow Jones industrial average,
posting a gain that left it just 1.8 percent shy of uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Although trading volume trailed off with the approach of the
Christmas holiday _ the market will close at 1 p.m. Thursday _
mutual fund managers and other professionals were said to be busy
shuffling portfolios to cast them in the best light for year-end
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple days, there's been a rush to get money to
work,'' said Robert von Pentz, a portfolio manager for Columbia
Partners in Washington. At the same time, he added, many investors
who otherwise might be inclined to cash in some profits remained on
the sidelines to avoid having to pay taxes on them.

   ``If you were thinking of selling your big winners, you might
wait until January,'' von Pentz said. Unloading them then would
would defer the tax bite an extra year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the speculative frenzy in Internet stocks generally
subsided even as a few of them posted sensational gains.
Ticketmaster, for example, soared 32, to 80 1/2, while Ubid
rocketed 53 1/2, to 188, less than three weeks after going public
at 15.
</P>
<P>
   One source of market inspiration came from Merrill Lynch, which
raised its long skeptical view of Intel to ``accumulate,'' helping
to drive the stock up 5 15/16, to 125. Microsoft, another
technology kingpin, jumped 5 1/8, to 143 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index advanced
51.56 points, or 2.43 percent, to 2,172.54, handily surpassing the
record it set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, the benchmark for many
portfolio managers, rose 24.97 points, or 2.07 percent, to
1,228.54, its third straight record. The Dow climbed 157.57 points,
or 1.74 percent, to 9,202.03.
</P>
<P>
   The day's relentless advance, which seemed to disregard both
President Clinton's impeachment and the latest batch of economic
reports, was dampened briefly after the Federal Reserve published
the minutes of its Nov. 17 policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides confirming an assumption that the central bank had
abandoned its bias toward lower rates, the minutes portrayed Fed
policy-makers as less convinced that the economy was about to slow
than many analysts had believed them to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the minutes seemed to harden the view that the Fed's
third rate cut this autumn would be its last for some time, stocks
resumed their advance and closed at or near their best levels of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent American casualty was Lockheed Martin, the
military contractor, which issued another warning of lower profits
and plunged as low as 82 before closing at 84 1/2, down 10 1/2. But
United Technologies, another company with military operations, was
the biggest gainer among the 30 Dow blue chips, up 3 7/8, to 108
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The next three were Procter &AMP; Gamble and Wal-Mart Stores, each
up 3 7/16, and Coca-Cola, up 2 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market remains comfortable with
large-capitalization growth stocks,'' said Daniel Eagan, a
portfolio manager at Black Rock Inc. in Philadelphia. Value stocks,
he suggested, will need to wait for ``another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers, some of which have been battered of late, rebounded
smartly. Pfizer rose 3 3/16, to 120 3/8; Merck was up 2 1/4, to 149
5/8, and American Home Products climbed 1 15/16, to 54 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Financial issues were mostly higher, with Suntrust, up 3 1/2 to
77 1/2, a leader among banks, and Charles Schwab, up 2 3/8 to 57
13/16, posting one of the biggest gains among brokers. Equifax,
however, which provides credit reports and other financial
information, skidded 9 1/2, to 34 1/2, after warning of an earnings
shortfall because it had been too optimistic about its European
business.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest major market in Europe Wednesday was Germany's,
where the main index climbed 2.03 percent. The gains in France and
Britain were 1.36 percent and 1.12 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the Bovespa rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, but
stocks fell 1.59 percent in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of killings reported so far this year in
New York City has fallen to 606, putting the city on a pace to end
the year with fewer homicides than it had in 1964, when the Beatles
played the Ed Sullivan show, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened
and a young woman named Kitty Genovese was killed in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The huge drop in crime means that the city will log fewer than a
third the number of homicides this year than it did in 1990, when a
record 2,262 people were killed. Overall, the number of major
crimes reported through Dec. 20 dropped 11 percent from 1997,
according to preliminary police figures. The biggest declines were
in homicide, which dropped 19 percent from last year, and car
thefts, which dropped 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reported crime dropped in every borough, in the subways and in
public housing. There were fewer reported robberies, assaults,
burglaries, grand larcenies, car thefts and _ despite early
indications that the drop in rapes was leveling off _ 11 percent
fewer rapes.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the decline are varied: Experts point to the
stronger economy, a drop in the number of people in their late
teens and early 20s, the waning of the crack epidemic and an
increase in the number of people behind bars. But a growing number
of criminologists now also give credit to police assignments and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the plummeting crime
rates vindicate the department's move away from the
community-policing strategies of the early 1990s, which called for
more neighborhood officers on the beat, toward a new strategy of
using computer maps to chart crime and assigning officers to major
anti-drug initiatives in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied by community activists who say,
`We want feel-good cops,' '' Safir said in an interview. ``The
bottom line is crime reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime has been dropping across the nation for the last six
years, but not as steeply as it has in New York City. In 1997, the
last year for which national statistics are available, reports of
major crimes dropped 2 percent nationwide but 9 percent in New York
City. To some extent, criminologists say, the decline in New York
City has contributed substantially to the nationwide statistical
drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But while the city is on pace to log even fewer homicides this
year than it did in 1964, when 636 people were reported killed _
among them Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death as 38 neighbors
heard her screams and did nothing _ little else about the nature of
crime in the city and the criminal justice system remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, 27 percent of the city's homicide victims were killed
by guns; in 1998, more than twice as many victims _ roughly 60
percent _ were killed by guns. After guns, the most common means of
murder in 1998 were knives, blunt instruments, brute force and
strangulation in that order, according to police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to compare how other crimes measure up to 1964
levels because the Police Department overhauled its counting
methods in 1966, charging that ``self-serving'' police officials
had undercounted crimes other than homicide for several years. So
the official 1964 levels, which experts say they believe are
artificially low, show that there were fewer than half as many
rapes then as there were in 1998, a quarter of the robberies and
half as many assaults. The number of reported burglaries this year
is roughly the same as it was in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   While overall population slightly decreased _ 7,781,984 in the
1960 census compared with 7,322,564 in 1990 _ the size of the
Police Department has grown tremendously since 1964. Then, there
were 25,897 people on the force. Now, the department has swelled to
nearly 40,000, fed by the 1993 mergers with the transit police and
housing police and by the Safe Streets-Safe City tax increase to
pay additional officers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of arrests has skyrocketed since then as well. While
93,627 people were arrested in 1964, 396,237 people were arrested
this year, largely a result of the Police Department's crackdown on
``quality of life'' crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of prisoners has gone way up. In 1964 the average
daily population in the city's jails was 10,848; this year it is
nearly 18,000. The increase in state prisons is even more
pronounced: The average daily population has risen from 19,439 in
1964 to over 69,000 prisoners today.

EASY TO PACK, HARDER TO UNDERSTAND  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Issey Miyake is easy to pack. This is often the first thing a
smart woman will tell you when you ask her why she wears Miyake's
clothes. You can roll his dresses into a ball, they take up
practically no room in your luggage, they weigh almost nothing, and
when you arrive at your destination you just unroll and wear them.
You can brown bag it around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Issey Miyake: Making Things,'' a show of the last 10 years
of the Japanese designer's work now on view at the Cartier
Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris, Miyake stages a witty
play on the ease of traveling with his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A huge wheel of black stretch fabric stands upright in the
corner of one gallery. Partly unrolled across the floor, the fabric
forms a continuous train that connects a tableau of five dresses,
all made from the same material. It's a transformation scene, a
metamorphosis in style. You could take the wheel anywhere, unroll a
few dozen yards, snip, snip, et voila! Instant fashion show.
(Flashbulbs not included.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Things'' extends an invitation to unpack Miyake. Why is
Issey Miyake _ yet again _ the subject of major show in an art
museum? Why are his clothes preferred by so many prominent figures
in the arts? Why was he the first fashion designer to be featured
on the cover of Artforum magazine? Why is Miyake so often singled
out as a fashion designer whose work somehow lies above or beyond
fashion?
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that Miyake is creating the fashion of the
future, or that his work is timeless. These descriptions are less
than useful. His work is grounded in that stretch of history called
the present and draws meaning from fashion's immediate context.
``Making Things'' presents that context with immense glamour and
wit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before one walks into Jean Nouvel's airy Left Bank
building, its vast glass walls reveal dozens of pleated color and
monochrome dresses, ranged slap against the glass in untidy rows.
Is this a department store vitrine or a stained glass window? Au
Printemps or Sainte Chappelle? But why be so fancy? The display
also brings to mind haphazard laundry on a rigging of tenement
clotheslines.
</P>
<P>
   On entering, you walk into an immense fashion mobile installed
in the grand, three-story, ground-floor space. Twenty-five garments
are suspended from the ceiling on cables. As you walk past, your
movement activates a mechanism that reels the dresses swiftly up to
the ceiling and lets them float down like gaily colored parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   The room is constantly in motion, animated by what looks like a
parody of that old fashion game of rising and falling hemlines.
Even those who hate to shop may think this would be a terrific way
to try on clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark galleries below, the focus is on the theme implied
by the show's title, with displays demonstrating modes of
manufacture. One wall is hung with garments that have been sealed
in sheets of foil. Movement causes the foil to split, creating
patterns in gold, silver and copper that vary with the wearer.
</P>
<P>
   (If this were architecture, one could say that each garment
comes equipped with its own expansion joints.) Starburst, Miyake's
name for this series, is his precious version of environmentally
sustainable fashion: the clothes encased within the foil have been
recycled.
</P>
<P>
   Other production techniques are demonstrated with slide
projections on the floor. Here we see what are, in effect,
blueprints for the costumes hanging above: two-dimensional images
of cloth cut into bold geometric shapes, awaiting assembly and the
application of compression, twisting, folding, shrinking, and other
methods that give the completed outfit texture and volume. These
diagrammatic pools of cool blue light help explain the appeal
Miyake's work holds for architects.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the figure, it helps to appreciate the ground. In
an essay called ``Fashions in Ballet,'' published 20 years ago in
The New Yorker, the dance critic Arlene Croce noted with
disapproval the apparent lack of any rationale behind the Who's In,
Who's Out lists published by W and other fashion magazines. ``Ins
and outs are a good game when the choices are guided by some
underlying principle that we can guess at,'' Croce wrote, ``but the
lists that W puts together appear to be packs of names selected at
random, as if it would be more amusing to have no underlying
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   To Croce, this abdication of taste was a symptom of exhaustion
following the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. But for some
thinkers who came of age then, the upheavals of that decade were
themselves a symptom of much deeper cultural stresses. To the
French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, for example,
the uprisings were a product of advanced capitalism and its
discontents.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument might go like this. The market system runs on the
excitation of consumer desire. When the system is operating
properly, libidinous energies are constantly drawn into the public
sphere and channeled into a limitless array of attractions: this
laundry detergent or that movie star, this politician or that
desktop computer, this TV show or that brand of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result is a culture of increasing dissociation, a society of
personalities that are forever splitting into fractured identities,
ideologies and tastes, unbound by any underlying principle that
might jeopardize potential market shares.
</P>
<P>
   For Deleuze and Guattari, schizophrenia, with its attendant
fugue and dissociative states, is not a simple pathology, to be
cured by chemical or psychiatric means. It is the natural condition
of late capitalist society. Free enterprise induces a
free-associational way of life.
</P>
<P>
   I model, therefore I am. It is a sweet coincidence that theory
and fashion have converged on Paris. And, to their detractors, at
least, philosophers like Deleuze and Guattari are guilty of
fashionable thinking: superficial, sensationalistic, without
evident rigor, their theory has been attacked as little more than a
motley get-up of Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Lacan and R.D. Laing.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to buy the theory to see that fashion is a
good illustration of it. As Croce observed 20 years ago, no art
form has so glorified the random and meaningless. Nor has any
consumer product so nearly emulated pornography in the stimulation
of desire.
</P>
<P>
   A ``fashion week,'' in Paris, New York or Milan, is a festival
of desire overload, a vaudeville of voyeurism and exhibitionism
with throbbing musical background. Sex sells. But the splitting
evoked in the observer's mind by fashion's fleeting erotic imagery
may be more powerful than the imagery itself.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what Isaac Mizrahi had in mind when he opened a fashion
show a few years back with an excerpt from Bernard Hermann's
screeching music for the shower scene in ``Psycho''?
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be fashions in multiple-personality disorders as
well as colors and silhouettes. Some figures on the national stage,
from politicians to movie stars, invite us to regard the self not
as an integrated unit, but as a jumble of memories, fantasies,
desires, images, that pop up on the national screen like a net
surfer's ride through a cybersettlement of chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   With such fractured figures ruling the earth's political life,
it's no wonder that fashion has gained inordinate stature in the
cultural scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the figure. If Miyake has attained a position above and
beyond fashion, that may be largely because he has given
differentiation an architectural shape. Unity, duality,
multiplicity: Miyake works with the phenomenon of splitting as if
it were a basic law of life, not just a contemporary cultural
affliction. He has refined the madness of fashion into a
contemplative, creative method, almost a form of meditation on the
multiple self.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake's wheel of black jersey dresses is a good illustration of
this. Viewed from the side, the display begins with the spoke, a
point of no dimension. The tube of fabric spirals around the spoke
in the form of a line: one dimension. Then the flattened tube is
drawn out into a train that reads as a plane: two dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The train rises up into a black dress that conforms to a
mannequin's human contours: three dimensions. Then the dress is
multiplied in a sequence that evokes the fourth dimension of time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Starburst collection, the splitting of the foil produces
a binary tension between the humble (the recycled clothes) and the
exalted (silver and gold). Colombe, a serape-like dress of white
vinyl, derives its manifold shapes from a series of interplays
between point and plane. The garment _ a tunic for ancient Greeks
from outer space _ is made from a white sheet of plastic studded
with round metal fasteners. The sheet drapes into different folds
depending on what points are snapped together.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Miyake's primary mode of differentiation
has been the pleat. Permanent folds that expand a plane of cloth
into volumetric space, pleating is the designer's basic binary
move, the zig that depends upon the zag.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cartier Foundation, the style is represented by examples
from Pleats Please a series of chemises, shirts, and jumpsuits that
Miyake has issued since 1991, periodically in collaboration with
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   For one edition, Miyake printed the cloth with photographs of
work by Cai Guo-Quiang, a shamanistic Japanese artist who sets
trails of gunpowder ablaze on pieces of fabric. The artist's singed
gray and brown images create a dingy, free-form counterpoint to
Miyake's crisp, regular pleats.
</P>
<P>
   Another edition of dresses features a reproduction of an Ingres
nude, ``The Source,'' part of a composite work created by Yasumasa
Morimura. The printed image, borrowing Ingres' spatial perspective,
supplies the illusion of three dimensions, while the wearer's body
dissolves the illusion into three-dimensional space.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake intends the Cartier Foundation show to be seen as a
collaboration, too. He has conceived the installation as an
exchange between his clothes and Nouvel's building. The mobile
dresses echo the elevators that rocket up and down the building's
exterior.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The clothes hanging inside the ground-floor windows offer both a
complement and a contrast to Nouvel's crisp lines. Nouvel's exposed
steel structure draws out Miyake's architectonic approach. The
division between lower and upper galleries spatializes the
relationship between creative process and finished work,
introspection and presentation, the artist's private and public
realms.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this an ideal site for Miyake is not just the formal
merits of Nouvel's building, but also the background that both
designers share. Both men were living in Paris during the uprisings
of 1968, and both were affected by them.
</P>
<P>
   Each came to appreciate the links between the cultural and the
political spheres. Both came to regard art as a form of social
action. Both saw themselves as actors in a drama of rupture, a
break with the mid-century's High Modern triumphal moment.
</P>
<P>
   But rupture had become a way of life for Miyake long before
1968. Born in 1938, he belonged to the first generation to come of
age after the Second World War. Like Arata Isozaki, Shuro Kuramata
and other designers and architects who later attained international
stature, Miyake grew up in a nation whose traditions had been
substantially obliterated by nuclear holocaust and foreign
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Artists of Miyake's generation started from ground zero. Their
work has been shaped as much by Western as by Japanese influence.
It embodies a global perspective unique in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake moved to Paris in 1960 to study, and later worked for Guy
Laroche and Givenchy. After a year in New York, where he was design
assistant to Geoffrey Beene, he returned to Tokyo in 1970 and
founded the Miyake Design Studio. Today, the studio is based in a
building of silky concrete designed by Yoshio Tanaguchi, architect
of the new expansion of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake's outlook has remained global. He regularly shows in
Paris, and divides his time between Tokyo and the fashion capital,
where he lives in a stunningly spare flat overlooking the Eiffel
Tower.
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese Buddhism there is a concept called two but not two.
East and West is a good example of it. These are relative terms for
two sides of the same planet. Or consider the zig and zag of one
pleat. Two but not two represents a holistic way of regarding
dualisms that, in the modern West, have been overdefined in terms
of the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   We set great store, for instance, on the difference between art
and design, but traditionally the distinction has meant little to
the Japanese. Miyake has sought to bypass dualism by emphasizing
the nature of his craft. He describes himself not as a fashion
designer but as a maker of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Deleuze and Guattari proposed a nomadic philosophy for coping
with the schizoid state of advanced capitalist culture. People
should rove freely among world views, political perspectives,
states of mind, without trying to build any one of them into a
rigid hierarchical system. I can't see that this philosophy differs
from what writers have practiced for centuries. For that matter,
who isn't nomadic in this sense?
</P>
<P>
   But Miyake (easy to pack) does design the fanciest clothes a
nomadic philosopher could possibly wear. Even at rest, many of them
suggest flux: tents, flying saucers, fisherman jackets, Bedouin
burnooses. All of them embrace the body as a metaphor for
self-reliance. He is, perhaps, to be regarded as a visual
philosopher of modern movement, an architect of traveling light.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake's particular subject is the woman's body, viewed at a
historical moment when the social identity of women is a highly
mobile abstraction, an entity moving between acting subject and
passive object, often occupying both states at once, to excellent
and lively confusion. In the service of that entity, his clothes
are worn beneath the skin as well as draped over it.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the Cartier show is like drifting through
encampments of social possibility: astronaut, insect, idol,
hostess, casualty of war. While Miyake's dress forms are female,
the roles are transsexual. Anyone could drape a fragment of self
within these wrapped, tied, coiled, singed, scrunched-up,
levitating pieces of cloth. Two but not two genders per customer.
</P>
<P>
   Does continuity require rupture? Here is a larger issue framed
by ``Making Things.'' Miyake and Nouvel are ``two children of Marx
and Coca-Cola,'' as Godard once dubbed those who came of age in the
1960s. But both have helped to reinvigorate the modern tradition
that this generation was once eager to toss into history's dustbin.
</P>
<P>
   Nouvel has pushed the glass building envelope and structural
expression toward a state of transparency far beyond Miesian
precedent. Miyake has pursued a wholly modernist exploration of the
formal potential of new materials and methods.
</P>
<P>
   He has also revived the connection between Japan and the West
that was critical to Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius and other
pioneering modernists. Both designers propose a zigzag history to
replace the linear unfolding of time.
</P>
<P>
   Is this how it has ended up, then, 30 years after the events of
May 1968? Fashionable frocks in a jeweler's showcase? If so, this
is no disgrace. One of the achievements of Miyake's generation was
to show that art deals with consciousness, and that consciousness
can be revolutionized by a song, a film, a photograph, a hemline,
the view from a window. Together, Nouvel and Miyake light up the
town.

CIA IGNORED REPORT OF PAYMENTS TO CHINESE FOR CONTRACTS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JEFF GERTH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ CIA officers in China told headquarters in March
1996 that a consultant for an American aerospace company had made
payments to Chinese officials in hopes of getting lucrative
contracts, U.S. intelligence officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, made in a secret cable, should have set off
alarm bells. U.S. law bars companies or individuals from paying
bribes overseas to secure contracts, and the CIA has agreed to
share information about potential criminal activity with the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that remain unclear, the cable languished in CIA
files for more than two years, the officials said. It was unearthed
this year only after congressional committees began examining
whether the Clinton administration had compromised national
security in its zeal to promote high technology exports to China,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant is Bansang Lee, a Chinese-American who worked for
Hughes Space &AMP; Communications and for Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the cable specifies on whose behalf Lee
would have been making any payments to Chinese officials, or what
kind of officials these were. Nor is it clear whose money the CIA
believed it was, or how much money passed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the Justice Department is now
examining Lee's activities more closely.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Brian O'Neill, said his client ``has never made any
unlawful or improper payments of any kind to any Chinese
official.'' Spokesmen for Hughes and Loral deny any wrongdoing but
declined to discuss Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA official said the failure to pass the cable on to the
Justice Department had been an oversight that was now being
reviewed by the CIA's inspector general. But it marks the second
time this year that CIA officials have acknowledged that they
failed to disseminate potentially significant information about
questionable dealings involving China and American satellite
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also illustrates the pressures that confront
American manufacturers as they compete with European companies for
a share of a Chinese market in which individual satellite sales can
be worth as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was born in China but educated in the United States,
receiving a doctorate from Princeton University in electrical
engineering. Industry executives say he served as a crucial
intermediary between American companies and Chinese aerospace
officials who on one hand were buying Western satellites and on the
other hand marketing their country's ability to launch these
satellites with China's own rockets.
</P>
<P>
   State Department documents and interviews with industry
executives suggest that Lee appears to have had a hand in both
endeavors. During his years working for Hughes, the company sold
hundreds of millions of dollars in satellites and
telecommunications equipment to Chinese concerns, and Loral made
its first satellite sale to China after it hired Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When he was working at Loral, Lee suggested that the company
help Chinese rocket scientists understand the causes of a failed
satellite launch in 1996, according to State Department documents.
Loral sent technicians to China, and their dealings with Chinese
scientists, carried out without U.S. government approval, are now
the focus of a criminal investigation and Congressional inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is examining whether Loral, in 1996, and
Hughes, in an earlier accident investigation, illegally shared
American expertise with China, helping it improve the reliability
of their launchings of satellites and ballistic missiles. The
companies deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry had its roots nearly a decade ago when American
satellite manufacturers sought to do more business with China after
the Bush administration approved the first launches of American
satellites on Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was the first American satellite maker to establish a
foothold in Beijing, and it opened a new office for Asian deals in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired Lee as a Hong Kong-based consultant in 1989,
and by the early 1990s, former executives said, Hughes was seeking
closer ties to the powerful China Aerospace Corp., which sells
missiles, launches rockets and makes communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was an ideal go-between. He had a close working relationship
with Liu Jiyuan, the chairman of China Aerospace, a satellite
industry executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee moved to Beijing in 1992 and the next year became a
full-time Hughes employee, satellite executives said. One executive
said the company was so pleased with the business that Lee had
generated as a consultant that it failed to conduct a thorough
background investigation before hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Lee's Chinese business dealings came under
scrutiny within Hughes after company employees in Beijing raised
questions about some of his private business deals, said a former
Hughes executive, who declined to be identified but read from notes
he kept of the inquiry into Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lee's separate business deals with a China Aerospace
subsidiary entitled him to payments of about $1 million for every
Hughes satellite launched on a Chinese rocket, the former Hughes
executive and a government investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee told Hughes officials that no payments had ever been made,
that he had disclosed the general outlines of the deal to the
company previously and that the agreement was no longer active,
former Hughes executives said. But some Hughes officials called for
his immediate dismissal, the former executives said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Hughes, Helen Sanders, would not discuss Lee's
resignation, saying it was the subject of a confidential agreement.
She said Lee had stopped working for the company in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Loral, which was trying to break into the
Chinese market, hired Lee, aerospace executives said. Thomas Ross,
Loral's vice president for government relations, said the company
was not aware of any ``allegations at the time'' it hired Lee and
knows of ``no allegations of wrongdoing by Lee during the period he
has served as a consultant to Loral.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Loral executive said Loral's chief of security had been
concerned about Lee's close ties to Chinese officials. But other
satellite executives said Loral had been pleased with Lee's work,
especially his instrumental role in getting Loral to sell its first
satellite to China, Chinasat 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's activities in China appear to have attracted little
attention in Washington, except for the neglected 1996 CIA cable.
Intelligence officials said the cable mentioned both Hughes and
Loral, but further details could not be learned.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was dormant until 1998, when it was disclosed that
Loral and Hughes were under investigation for possible illegal
transfers of rocket expertise to China. Congress began its own
inquiries, and a House select committee asked the CIA for
information about Lee, bringing the 1996 cable to light.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, inquiries from the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence led to the discovery that a CIA scientist, Ronald
Pandolfi, had learned about Hughes' sharing of expertise with the
Chinese in 1995. Pandolfi wrote a draft intelligence estimate
report warning about the military implications in April 1996, about
a month after the cable arrived. The CIA decided not to distribute
the classified report to select government officials, as is
routinely done with intelligence estimates, saying it was
insufficiently rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Both the cable and Pandolfi's report were written at a time when
President Clinton was moving to ease restrictions on satellite
deals and had shifted primary oversight of sales from the State
Department to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   In recent reports the Pentagon largely embraced Pandolfi's
conclusions, saying Hughes had provided valuable technological
insights to the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the State Department's intelligence arm asserted
in a separate report that China had significantly improved its
ability to launch rockets reliably as a result of the help from
Hughes, lessons inherently applicable to China's missile program,
an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and State Department have raised similar concerns
about the help that Loral gave the Chinese in 1996 as it
investigated another failed launch.
</P>
<P>
   The outside review of that accident was organized by Liu, the
China Aerospace chairman and associate of Lee. In February 1996,
before the outside committee was formed, Lee asked the Chinese to
include a Loral representative as part of the investigation,
according to a State Department cable recounting what Lee told a
U.S. diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, when Liu specifically sought a top Loral
executive to head the outside review, Lee relayed the Chinese
request to the Loral executive, according to Loral documents.

NETWORKS SEEK MAXIMUM HYPE BY OFFERING MEGA-MINI-SERIES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Two hundred camels, 600 horses, 1,000 extras, 300
wigs, 1,500 pieces of jewelry. An epic saga of sex, greed and the
clash of ancient civilizations! A desperate true-life tale of a
once-mighty entertainment medium, beset on all sides by ruthless
new competitors, struggling to retain its viability!
</P>
<P>
   Sound vaguely familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Cleopatra,'' the megabudgeted four-hour ABC mini-series,
brainchild of the flamboyant and free-spending producer Robert
Halmi Sr., the king of big-budget television. Said spectacle is
currently finishing a five-month shooting schedule in Morocco and
England, among other exotic locales, and is scheduled to be
broadcast on two nights during the vital May sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   As even casual media buffs can tell you, the last and more
famous ``Cleopatra'' _ the megabudgeted 1963 motion picture
starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison _ nearly
bankrupted 20th Century Fox and brought a definitive halt to the
hegemony of the major movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a portentous parallel that people in the network
television business, particularly people like Susan Lyne, ABC's
executive vice president for movies and mini-series, steadfastly
refuse to draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's material that stands out,'' she says of the $30 million
television production, which stars Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar,
Billy Zane as Marc Antony and Leonor Varela, a French-Chilean
actress, as the Queen of the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these days,'' adds Ms. Lyne, ``in order to attract
attention, you have to give television audiences something big and
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``big'' (if not, strictly speaking, different) is the
rallying cry in the made-for-television-movie world these days.
Staggeringly expensive epics are prime cannon fodder during sweeps
periods, the thrice-yearly ratings matchups that determine
advertising rates for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   These mega-mini-series or mega-movies _ NBC calls them Big
Events _ contain exotic locations, stellar international casts
and/or lavish special effects. A majority contain all three. A
typical two-hour network television movie costs $3 million; these
cost approximately $12 million to $35 million each.
</P>
<P>
   This February, for instance, NBC has scheduled a three-hour
``Alice in Wonderland,'' starring Martin Short, Gene Wilder, Ben
Kingsley and Whoopi Goldberg, among others. ABC has ``Stephen
King's Storm of the Century,'' a six-hour horror story that the
author wrote directly for television.
</P>
<P>
   In May, CBS will counter ``Cleopatra'' with ``Joan of Arc,'' now
filming in Prague. NBC has tentatively scheduled ``Noah's Ark,''
starring Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen and F. Murray Abraham, and
``Atomic Train,'' a disaster-suspense epic starring Rob Lowe and
appropriately lavish special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabian Nights'' (ABC), to be filmed in Turkey and Yemen, and
``Aftershock''(CBS), about a major earthquake that hits New York
City, are already in production for November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Alone among the four major broadcast networks, Fox is
currently out of the big-budget mini-series race. That decision can
be traced to the frighteningly low ratings of ``Gargantua,'' an
expensive horror movie that it presented last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the networks believe they're getting their money's
worth,'' says Mark Carliner, the producer who nudged the high end
of the budget scale when overseeing ``Storm of the Century''
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Carliner, who previously produced the movies ``Stalin'' and
``George Wallace'' for HBO, spent $12 million on special effects
and set construction. It cost $1.5 million, he says, to rebuild
much of the business district of Southwest Harbor, Maine, inside a
sugar beet storage facility near Toronto, in preparation for
destroying large parts of the town in a giant wave pool in Tucson.
That cost another $1 million. The mini-series has 60 speaking
roles. The casting process took four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, it has to be an event,'' says Carliner. ``And in order
for it to be an event, a lot of money has to be spent. If we get a
huge tune-in, than ABC has six hours to promote other parts of its
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good, explains the producer, because in the last few
years ABC, along with the other major networks, has lost large
chunks of its traditional audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' he adds. ``These days, most people have no
idea what's on ABC.'' Or on any of the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when a mega-mini-series succeeds _ like NBC's medieval
sword-and-sorcery epic ``Merlin,'' which had its premiere in last
May's sweeps and attracted a spectacular 16.5 rating and 37 share _
it not only trounces the competition but rolls back, at least
temporarily, the hordes of upstart diversions competing for
American television viewers' leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just competing with cable,'' says Lindy DeKoven,
NBC's executive vice president for mini-series and movies for
television. ``Not just with 500 channels, and not just with the
Internet. We're competing for people who are working longer hours
and have less time and patience to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, they'll come to see an episode of `Dateline'
about the septuplets. They'll come to see Monica Lewinsky on
`Barbara Walters.' They'll come for a spectacular mini-series. But
will they come for just another episode of `Frasier'? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of pressure, to create distinctive ``appointment
television,'' that has caused networks and mini-series producers
alike to attempt to outdo and outspend one another. Paradoxically,
it has also tended to make each mega-mini more and more like its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For instance: gone, perhaps forever, are 9- or 13-part
mini-series like ``Roots'' or ``War and Remembrance.'' Accepted
wisdom is that committing to all those hours is simply too risky:
if viewers tune out early, the networks are left with weeks of
ratings poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard for an audience to make that kind of a
commitment,'' says Sunta Izzicupo, CBS senior vice president for
movies for television and mini-series. ``And with the increase in
costs it's just not economically feasible any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at a decided disadvantage are original stories by unknown
writers, as opposed to historical-biblical epics, end-of-the-world
scenarios and new renditions of oft-adapted literary classics. Ms.
Lyne says, ``It helps if it's a story that people know _ and
particularly love _ and that you're telling in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Izzicupo says: ``An average person can tell you lots about
Joan of Arc. She was young; she was French; it was long ago. She
led an army, was divinely inspired, wore armor, was burned at the
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a big head start with the audience, agrees Ms. Lyne, makes
it simpler to create billboards, advertisements and on-air
promotions, a prime consideration when staking so much on only a
few precious hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier when you don't have to explain everything
in a 30-second promo,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeKoven says, flatly, ``I'd say I spend 80 percent of my
time thinking about how to promote these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all that much time, however, is spent thinking about how to
finance the more expensive mega-minis. To a surprisingly large
extent, this chore is handled by the aforementioned Halmi. He was
the progenitor and major force behind more than half the projects
mentioned in this article, including ``Merlin,'' ``Noah's Ark,''
``Arabian Nights'' and ``Alice in Wonderland,'' in addition to
``Cleopatra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I pick my projects? I'll tell you, I just look at my
bookshelf, which is pretty big and extensive, and I pick them as
they come before my eyes,'' says Halmi, 74, by telephone from his
office in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've breathed a little bit of fresh air into stale network
programming,'' he adds. ``And since they only have about 57 percent
of the market now, they need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Often described as an ``old-style showman,'' Halmi is something
of a throwback to bygone movie moguls like Spyros Skouras, Darryl
Zanuck and Sam Spiegel. Asked why he makes his mini-series in such
remote and inaccessible locations, he replies, ``If I make it in
the back lot, it smells of the back lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the Hungarian resistance and, after World War
II, a photographer for Life magazine, Halmi began producing
television movies and mini-series in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Halmi's production company was bought by Hallmark, the
privately held greeting card and entertainment company. Hallmark is
majority owner of the Odyssey Channel, a domestic cable network,
and Hallmark Entertainment Networks, an international
pay-television service.
</P>
<P>
   After Halmi's mega-minis are shown on the American networks
(typically for a license fee of only about one-third of their
cost), they are sold internationally, then reserved for use as
programming on their own networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will end up making lots of money,'' he says. ``Believe
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Halmi approached NBC with his first pitch for a star-
and-special-effects-laden fable, and with some trepidation the
network agreed to make ``Gulliver's Travels,'' starring Ted Danson.
In February 1996, it won an impressive 29 share of the audience. In
May 1997, Halmi's production of ``The Odyssey'' hit a homer, as one
weekly magazine put it. Then came ``Merlin,'' and the other
networks opened the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   But such proliferation may lead to problems. A serious one, say
industry executives, is that not every expensive mega-mini-series,
not even every Robert Halmi mega-mini-series, is a success. Last
October his production of ``Crime and Punishment,'' filmed in
Budapest and starring Ben Kingsley, Julie Delpy and Patrick
Dempsey, finished fourth in its time period. Of course, dismissive
reviews didn't help either.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger is viewer saturation. ``I stay up nights
wondering how we're going to top ourselves next time,'' admits Ms.
DeKoven.
</P>
<P>
   And how many times will they have to rebuild ancient
civilizations? All of his sweeps wins are fine as far as they go,
maintains Halmi, ``but one or two mini-series a year won't make
anything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks have to think of the in-between times,'' he says.
``They'll have to enter new dimensions. They'll have to be
creative. And they'll have to spend more money.''

 (ATTN: Fla., Ind., Ill., La., Ga., Conn., Pa., Ore., Calif., N.J.,
Mo.) INSPIRED BY TOBACCO SUITS, CITIES TAKING ON GUN INDUSTRY  
 (EDS: 2ndTAKE to move within 15 minutes)  
(nk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First the states sued the tobacco companies and
recovered hundreds of billions of dollars in smoking-related
Medicaid costs. Now more than a dozen cities either have sued the
gun industry or are preparing to, in a growing campaign to
ultimately win in court the handgun controls that gun interests
have kept them from winning in state legislatures and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although gun manufacturers have defeated suit after suit brought
by individuals, many mayors express confidence that they will
prevail, forcing firearms makers to pay huge damages or accept new
restrictions on the production and marketing of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the tobacco litigation had a tremendous impact
on us,'' said Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County. ``Before,
people thought the tobacco industry was untouchable, and the same
with the gun industry. Now there is a ray of hope, and it's time to
send the bill for gun deaths and injuries to the gun makers.''
</P>
<P>
   One city after another is joining the list of those taking on
the industry, and the number is expected to grow to 40 or 50 by
next summer. One reason for their optimism is that, where juries
tended to view criminals or the injured parties themselves as
responsible for the damages cited in suits brought against the
industry by individuals, the cities' lawyers believe that those
juries, as in the tobacco litigation, will be more receptive to the
argument that a broader society is burdened by the costs resulting
from use of a dangerous product.
</P>
<P>
   The cities are encouraged as well by their recognition that the
gun industry not only is much smaller than the tobacco industry,
with far less money to wage courtroom wars, but also could be a
more vulnerable foe before urban jurors, many acutely sensitive to
the effects of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal handgun litigating began in late October, when New
Orleans became the first city to sue the gun industry. New Orleans
contended that gun makers failed to incorporate enough safety
devices in their weapons, a shortcoming that the suit said made
them ``unreasonably dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago followed two weeks later, advancing a different
argument: Its officials maintained that Chicago suburbs, where
gun-control laws are more lax than in the city, were being flooded
with guns by the industry. The resulting illicit flow of weapons
into the city creates a ``public nuisance,'' says Chicago, whose
suit demands $433 million to cover police and hospital costs
attributable to handgun violence since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, Conn., and Newark, N.J., plan to file suit before
the end of the year, officials there say, to be followed in January
by Miami and by Gary, Ind., and in February by Boston. Leaders in
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla., plan suits later in the winter or
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has not indicated when, or even whether, it will
join the list, but many others are expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is reasonable to assume that unless we have some
strong action by the gun industry, there will be 40 to 50 lawsuits
out there by July 1,'' said Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell,
who heads a task force on guns for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
``This is going to be a different day'' for the gun makers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, said Tom Cochran, executive director of the
Conference of Mayors, more than a hundred cities will sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot going on,'' Cochran said. ``The lawyers are
seeing green on this issue.'' Some of those lawyers were involved
in the tobacco litigation, he said, and they think ``they can bring
the gun industry to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits are especially threatening to the industry because it
is so much smaller than the cigarette industry, with combined sales
of handguns, rifles, shotguns and ammunition of only $1.4 billion
in 1997, compared with sales of $48 billion for the tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, sales of all types of firearms have been stagnant for
almost a decade, slipping to 3.8 million guns in 1996 from 4.3
million in 1989, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. In California last year, sales of handguns
were at their lowest level since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the deep pockets the tobacco companies have,''
said Kristen Rand, a senior lawyer for the Violence Policy Center,
a research and advocacy group in Washington. ``The gun industry is
in denial. They were shocked that the cities filed suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun industry executives express equal confidence that the
cities will fail, just as did suits on behalf of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a leg to stand on, as far as the law is
concerned,'' said Paul Januzzo, vice president and general counsel
for one gun maker, Glock Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes were supposed to be enjoyable, relaxing, and they
turned out to be lethal,'' Januzzo said. ``But guns are designed to
be lethal. That's why people buy them,'' he said, dismissing the
accusation, as is made in the New Orleans suit, that the gun
manufacturers are liable for a defective product.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a bunch of frustrated big-city executives who
have lost control of the crime problem,'' Januzzo said, ``and they
are looking to blame someone else.''

WILLIAMS' ANTICS CAN'T `PATCH' UP THIS FILM

   Robin Williams is starting to seem more and more irrelevant by
starring in another of what seems like a series of movies about
contemporary nonconformists. (Collect 'em all!) His role as
unconventional medical student Patch Adams is the latest. When you
add this one to ``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Good Morning,
Vietnam,'' you get the feeling that Williams isn't paying a whole
lot of attention to his filmography. When he falls back on that
tired sight gag he uses to indicate bitchiness _ he hisses like a
cat and bares his claws _ the younger children in the audience may
think they're watching a big-screen TV and reach for the VCR's
fast-forward. Or wish they could.
</P>
<P>
   Pop singer Billy Joel once talked about having gone through a
deep, depressed state as a very young man _ he tried to commit
suicide by drinking furniture polish _ and committing himself to a
mental institution. After spending time among people who were
chronically psychologically disturbed, he gained a new insight _ or
perhaps just an insight _ into his problem and left the asylum.
Patch undergoes a similar transformation. He commits himself to an
asylum, but the suffering he sees, much of which comes at the hands
of an indifferent doctor, motivates him.
</P>
<P>
   While in the mental hospital, Patch immediately helps jittery,
fearful Rudy (Michael Jeter), a fellow patient who can't set foot
on the floor of the room because he's afraid of a vicious
(imaginary) squirrel. After he jokes Rudy out of his anxiety, Patch
leaves the institution and commits himself to a calling; he enters
med school so he can help people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' sets Williams up as a hippie messiah _ it takes
place in the late '60s and early '70s. Williams isn't as wound up
in this film as in some others, showing some of the radiant calm
evident in his ``Dead Poets' Society'' performance. When he has
such moments, his actor's training (he studied at Juilliard, at the
same time as William Hurt) is visible. (Considering that it's hard
to think of a Williams performance in which he isn't jabbering and
flailing as if he's trying to flag down a tow truck, he's a
surprisingly believable listener.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' is an attempt to get to the serious side of the
road for Tom Shadyac, its director, as well. Shadyac directed the
Jim Carrey comedies ``Ace Ventura'' and ``Liar, Liar.'' (It seems
that not only does Carrey want Williams' career, his director and
writer do as well; ``Adams'' was written by Steve Oedekerk, who
scripted the ``Ace Ventura'' movies.) ``Adams'' is sunny and bright
_ Shadyac has found a visual realization of the late hippie era; it
looks like a rainbow. The picture glides along competently _ but
not only have you seen this movie before, you've seen this movie
before with Robin Williams in it. Counting ``Vietnam'' and
``Awakenings,'' this is the third time he has appeared in a bland
feel-good bio-film. And this is the second time he has played a
doctor in one of these neutered bios. ``(Awakenings'' was the
first.) It's too bad he wasn't given a chance to break down some
walls when he essentially portrayed the restless
philosopher-physician Oliver Sacks in ``Awakenings.'' And ``Patch
Adams'' is just ``Vietnam's'' Adrian Cronauer in a more maudlin
setting, as he brings laughter to the sick.
</P>
<P>
   His constant joking seduces most of the characters in the movie,
except the uptight medical school prof (Bob Gunton, flashing his
standard institutional villainy _ it's the J.T. Walsh role). Philip
Seymour Hoffman, a specialist at wormy creeps uncomfortable in
their own skin, is Patch's major competition, a cold, technically
brilliant student who lacks Adams' heart. He's lucky _ he's one of
the few who isn't won over by Patch's antics. Monica Potter plays
the determined, serious one, nervous because she's one of the few
female students at the school, and whom Patch liberates from
herself.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself wanting to like ``Patch Adams'' because
its heart is in the right place. Patch wants to bring empathy back
into the medical practice. (The movie should play especially well
in these days of medical-factory HMOs.) The film's guerrilla
assault on the medical establishment is reminiscent of the old days
when B movies sent doctors into the inner cities to make a
difference. But Patch is such a hero that even disaster sets him
back only momentarily; the entire picture is stacked in his favor.
I'm sure the real Patch Adams wishes his life were so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' is rated PG-13 for crude humor and strong
language.

FRENCH INDUSTRIALIST, FORMER NATO OFFICIAL CONVICTED IN BELGIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A leading French industrialist and a former
secretary-general of NATO were among 12 defendants convicted by
Belgium's highest court Wednesday on corruption charges involving
two military contracts in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Dassault, 75, head of the French defense concern Dassault
Aviation, was convicted of authorizing payment of 60 million
Belgian francs, or $1.76 million, from the Electronique Serge
Dassault subsidiary to the Socialist parties in the Dutch- and
French-speaking parts of Belgium in 1989 in exchange for a $192
million contract to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
He received a two-year suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Willy Claes, 60, who resigned as secretary-general of NATO in
October 1995, was found guilty of charges that in 1988, as an
official of the Socialist Party in the Dutch-speaking part of
Belgium, he authorized the acceptance of $1.37 million in kickbacks
from an Italian helicopter manufacturer. He received a three-year
suspended jail sentence, the maximum demanded by the prosecution,
and was barred from holding office for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The court also found the former defense minister of Belgium, Guy
Coeme, 52, and deputy prime minister, Guy Spitaels, 67, both
Socialist officials, guilty of receiving bribes from Dassault and
gave each of them two-year suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other Belgian party officials were also convicted of
various other corruption charges and received suspended jail terms
of up to two years each.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for Claes was the maximum under Belgian laws that
until recently had permitted corporations to make ``donations'' to
political parties, a common practice in the freewheeling world of
military contracting before 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Dassault had long refused to go to Belgium to answer questions
from investigators but attended the trial in Brussels, protesting
his innocence, and left after Wednesday's verdict. The only
payments he knew about, he testified, were $1.76 million that his
since-deceased mother had been tricked by Belgian swindlers into
sending to a Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
   But the court found that $1.76 million in payments by Dassault
had insured that the electronics contract went to the French
company instead of to the main rival bidder, Litton Industries of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors picked up the corruption trail after Andre Cools, a
Socialist leader in French-speaking Belgium, was murdered in Liege
in 1991, purportedly for a share of bribery money from the Italian
company Agusta SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Claes was Belgium's economic affairs minister in 1988, when
Agusta received a $353 million contract to supply 46 A-109
helicopters, winning against bids from French and German
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   He became secretary-general of NATO in September 1994, but the
Belgian Parliament voted to lift his parliamentary immunity from
prosecution in October of the next year and he resigned, insisting
he was ``totally innocent'' of charges that he had approved a $1.5
million kickback from Agusta to the party. But the Belgian court
ruled Wednesday, ``It is not excluded that prior to awarding the
contract he gave his assent to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Claes said Wednesday that he would appeal to the European Court
of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.

IF THE BIBLE WERE A COMIC BOOK ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam and Eve frolic in the nude. The drawings are so small, or
are done in such a way, that even the most prudish readers should
not object.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful images are featured in a new Bible done in the
upscale comic-book style of a graphic novel. It was released
recently by Lion Publishing in Oxford, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion Graphic Bible'' is not the first attempt _ and I'm
sure not the last _ to bring the Bible to readers who might not be
attracted to a traditional version of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Adam is a muscular, bearded man, and Eve is an attractive young
woman with shoulder-length auburn hair. As might be expected, Adam
is wide-eyed when God creates a woman to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   A balloon over Adam's head states: ``At last! One of my own
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The next panel shows Adam and Eve looking into each other's
eyes, and the newly created man speaking to Eve in paraphrases from
Genesis: ``Bone taken from my bone, flesh from my flesh. I will
call you `woman' because you were taken out of man.''
</P>
<P>
   One close-up illustration shows Eve eating the forbidden fruit.
Bits of the fruit are popping out between her perfect teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A green serpent, first seen as walking upright, tempts Eve into
eating the fruit, and she shares it with Adam. After they eat it,
as most Bible readers know, they experience shame for the first
time and realize they are naked.
</P>
<P>
   When God confronts the couple trying to hide themselves, Adam
declares: ``It's not my fault! This woman you put here with me _
she told me to do it.'' Eve says the serpent tricked her, and God
curses the serpent, taking away his legs so he must ``crawl on his
belly in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The realistic drawings are by award-winning British cartoonist
Jeff Anderson, who has worked with many well-known companies,
including DC Comics. British writer Mike Maddox did the script, and
lettering is by Steve Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``''The Lion Graphic Bible'' has been a labor of love for the
people here in Oxford,'' Paul Wilson, a representative of the
Oxford publishing firm, said this week. ``It has taken five years
for our illustrator to do the 2,000 pictures required.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been good in Britain, he said. ``The Lion Graphic
Bible,'' which sells for $29.99, has just become available in U.S.
bookstores. It is being distributed by Broadman &AMP; Holman, the
Southern Baptist Convention's publishing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been comic-book style versions of portions
of the Bible in the past, this is the first to cover the entire
Bible using sophisticated graphic novel-style drawings, Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Patterson of Nashville, a publicist for the Southern
Baptist Convention publishing agency, said the ``The Lion Graphic
Bible'' appeals to adults even though it is targeted at teens and
preteens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could reach a younger audience, too,'' she said. ``My son,
who is 4, loves it. He can't read the words, but he loves the
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   One goal of ``The Lion Graphic Bible,'' Wilson said, is to lure
young people away from computers and videos and back to books. It
hopes to repeat the success of other graphic novels about Batman,
Superman and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Samson,
Esther and other Old Testament characters are vividly related in
words and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   One panel shows an evil-looking knife that Abraham almost uses
to sacrifice his son, Isaac, until God stops him with the words:
``Abraham! Do not harm the child!''
</P>
<P>
   A retelling of the Christmas story focuses on the tension Joseph
feels when he discovers that his future wife, Mary, is going to
have a child. A glowing angel tells him, ``Do not be afraid to take
her as your wife, son of David.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panel states: ``Theirs wasn't the first wedding where
the bride was obviously pregnant, nor was it the last. But Joseph
trusted the words of the angel, and turned a deaf ear to the
gossip-mongers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some humorous touches are used in the stories of Jesus. When
Nicodemus, the Jewish scholar, visits Jesus late at night, a comic
panel shows Jesus yawning and saying, ``Rather late, isn't it?''
Salome dances seductively during the retelling of the beheading of
John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Lion Graphic Bible'' may not find its way into
seminaries, it will fascinate many young people _ and even adults _
searching for a fresh look at the age-old Scriptures. .MDBR/.MDNM/

COURT ENDORSES CLASS-ACTION SUIT OVER LAB CONTAMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA MASCARO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- A class-action lawsuit over contamination
at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Lab is to move forward after a
federal appellate court declined an appeal of the class-action
status, which paved the way for more than 200,000 residents and
workers to potentially join the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers will resume plans to begin notifying possible plaintiffs
within 90 days after receiving the decision Wednesday from the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals not to take up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another step forward in a long journey,'' said
plaintiff's attorney A. Barry Cappello from Cappello &AMP; McCann, the
Santa Barbara, Calif.-based firm that is the lead on the case.
``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne officials said that while they were disappointed in
the court's decision, believing there is no evidence to establish
the class, it was no indication of how the suit would play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we're disappointed by this,'' said Rocketdyne
spokesman Dan Beck. ``I think it's important not to read anything
into the 9th Circuit Court's ruling other than they didn't want to
deal with those issues at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judges Robert Beezer and A. Wallace issued a decision
Dec. 17 denying the appeal filed by Rocketdyne's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The case is among a number of suits stemming from the field lab
where nuclear and chemical contaminants have been found in soil and
water on the site, where the company for decades tested rocket
engines in the hills above suburban Simi Valley in Southern
California's Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   The case claims toxins contaminated the ground and air affecting
a class of potential plaintiffs living, working or owning property
in a rectangular area bounded roughly by the Ronald Reagan and
Ventura freeways, from Simi Valley to the San Diego Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The suit calls for medical monitoring of the plaintiffs and
compensation for property damage. The group excludes those with
cancer or other designated illnesses. Some of the area residents
who fall into that category are being represented in other
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Audrey B. Collins granted class-action
status in July, nearly a year after having denied the status on the
plaintiffs' previous attempt to move forward as a group.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, both sides received notice that the 9th Circuit
Court would not take up the appeal, essentially deciding not to
address the issue at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Cappello said Wednesday that his firm would begin planning class
notification, which could involve contacting between 200,000 and
500,000 residents, workers or property owners in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on class notification would be held in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed by a resident against Rocketdyne's parent
company Boeing North America and Rockwell International.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne officials have maintained that the case is without
merit, and that the plaintiffs have not produced facts to support
their claims about the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (plaintiff attorneys) have yet to offer any proof that
anybody has suffered adverse affect because of off-site
contamination,'' said Beck. ``We will continue to defend against
this lawsuit as being completely without merit and lacking in any
scientific validity.''

NEW YORK CITY CRIME PLUMMETS, AS HOMICIDES FALL TO 1964 LEVELS

 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of killings reported so far this year in
New York City has fallen to 606, putting the city on a pace to end
the year with fewer homicides than it had in 1964, when the Beatles
played the Ed Sullivan show, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened
and a young woman named Kitty Genovese was killed in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The huge drop in crime means that the city will log fewer than a
third the number of homicides this year than it did in 1990, when a
record 2,262 people were killed. Overall, the number of major
crimes reported through Dec. 20 dropped 11 percent from 1997,
according to preliminary police figures. The biggest declines were
in homicide, which dropped 19 percent from last year, and car
thefts, which dropped 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reported crime dropped in every borough, in the subways and in
public housing. There were fewer reported robberies, assaults,
burglaries, grand larcenies, car thefts and _ despite early
indications that the drop in rapes was leveling off _ 11 percent
fewer rapes.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the decline are varied: Experts point to the
stronger economy, a drop in the number of people in their late
teens and early 20s, the waning of the crack epidemic and an
increase in the number of people behind bars. But a growing number
of criminologists now also give credit to police assignments and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the plummeting crime
rates vindicate the department's move away from the
community-policing strategies of the early 1990s, which called for
more neighborhood officers on the beat, toward a new strategy of
using computer maps to chart crime and assigning officers to major
anti-drug initiatives in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied by community activists who say,
`We want feel-good cops,' '' Safir said in an interview. ``The
bottom line is crime reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime has been dropping across the nation for the last six
years, but not as steeply as it has in New York City. In 1997, the
last year for which national statistics are available, reports of
major crimes dropped 2 percent nationwide but 9 percent in New York
City. To some extent, criminologists say, the decline in New York
City has contributed substantially to the nationwide statistical
drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But while the city is on pace to log even fewer homicides this
year than it did in 1964, when 636 people were reported killed _
among them Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death as 38 neighbors
heard her screams and did nothing _ little else about the nature of
crime in the city and the criminal justice system remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, 27 percent of the city's homicide victims were killed
by guns; in 1998, more than twice as many victims _ roughly 60
percent _ were killed by guns. After guns, the most common means of
murder in 1998 were knives, blunt instruments, brute force and
strangulation in that order, according to police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to compare how other crimes measure up to 1964
levels because the Police Department overhauled its counting
methods in 1966, charging that ``self-serving'' police officials
had undercounted crimes other than homicide for several years. So
the official 1964 levels, which experts say they believe are
artificially low, show that there were fewer than half as many
rapes then as there were in 1998, a quarter of the robberies and
half as many assaults. The number of reported burglaries this year
is roughly the same as it was in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   While overall population slightly decreased _ 7,781,984 in the
1960 census compared with 7,322,564 in 1990 _ the size of the
Police Department has grown tremendously since 1964. Then, there
were 25,897 people on the force. Now, the department has swelled to
nearly 40,000, fed by the 1993 mergers with the transit police and
housing police and by the Safe Streets-Safe City tax increase to
pay additional officers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of arrests has skyrocketed since then as well. While
93,627 people were arrested in 1964, 396,237 people were arrested
this year, largely a result of the Police Department's crackdown on
``quality of life'' crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of prisoners has gone way up. In 1964 the average
daily population in the city's jails was 10,848; this year it is
nearly 18,000. The increase in state prisons is even more
pronounced: The average daily population has risen from 19,439 in
1964 to over 69,000 prisoners today.

<P>
   ``The criminal justice apparatus is much bigger, much
expanded,'' said Dr. Andrew Karmen, a sociologist at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice who studies murder in New York City.
``In those days, there was a greater emphasis on rehabilitation,
alternatives to incarceration and getting to the root causes of
crime. Today there's more emphasis on punishment and incarceration.
But it's an open question whether or not the criminal-justice
system deserves the credit for the drop in crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The subways, which saw a troubling increase in crime in the last
months of 1997, showed a 24 percent drop this year. Safir added
more than 300 officers and detectives to the Transit Bureau late
last year. There was only one murder case in the subways this year,
down from four homicides last year, and it involved a woman killed
by her former husband. There were 369 fewer robberies reported and
89 fewer assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Rapes, however, saw a marked increase in the subways. Fourteen
rapes were reported in the system this year, up from only two last
year. Investigators believe several of those rapes were the work of
a serial rapist now in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Crime dropped in every precinct in the city, Safir said. In
Central Park, where a murder and a flurry of well-publicized
muggings created the perception of a crime wave this fall, crime
actually dropped by 22 percent. In Greenwich Village, where
residents grew concerned that there were four killings this year,
up from none the year before, overall crime was down nearly 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drops in reported crime were in the traditionally
most dangerous neighborhoods. The 32nd Precinct in Harlem saw a 70
percent drop in reported homicides, to six this year from 20 last
year. The 34th Precinct in Washington Heights saw a 55 percent drop
in killings, to eight this year from 18 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides did rise in some areas. The 48th Precinct in the
Fordham section of the Bronx saw the number of killings rise 64
percent this year, to 23, up from 14 last year. And the 75th
Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn, reported the most homicides in
the city this year, 37, up from 31 the year before. But it is well
below 1993, when 110 people were killed there.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that the department's anti-drug initiatives in
northern Manhattan, northern Brooklyn, the south Bronx,
southeastern Queens and Staten Island had helped drive crime down
across the city. The initiatives use undercover officers and
detectives who focus on rounding up drug dealers, and uniformed
officers who are sent to new sites every day to crack down on
``quality of life'' crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are both fond of pointing out
that the leaders of adjacent communities have complained to them
that New York's effective policing has moved crime to neighboring
areas. And for Giuliani, the continued drop in crime under his
watch is sure to become a potent campaign issue should he run for
higher office.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are
beginning to feel safer in the city, from the new bodegas opening
in Washington Heights without bulletproof glass to the families who
stroll through Times Square to a boom in tourism, many New Yorkers
have yet to cast off their seemingly innate wariness.
</P>
<P>
   Even as crime fell this year, the number of security guards who
were licensed by New York State rose to 97,261 this year, up from
91,852 last year. Private security companies, burglar alarm
manufacturers and armored car companies are all reporting increased
earnings, said John Mallon, publisher of Security Investing, a
monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the crime rates are down in the city and elsewhere,
you wouldn't know it by the continued growth of the security
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while some of the old neighborhood crime watches that were
formed during the worst of the crime epidemic of the early 1990s
are now having trouble enlisting volunteers, plenty of new
neighborhood watch groups are springing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the longstanding patrols are sort of suffering because
people have dropped off,'' said Ed Powell, executive director of
Umma Group, a community organization that trains neighborhood watch
groups. ``There seems to be a sense that crime is down, that
everything is better.''
</P>
<P>
   But some new groups are taking the places of the old ones.
``Strangely enough, a lot of new patrols are popping up now,''
Powell said, noting that he had just been helping a group of
Pakistani immigrants form a watch group in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

 BOSTON: someone else.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are signs that the dozens of gun companies, most of them
small and privately held, are taking steps to set aside customary
rivalries and mount a joint defense.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade association, has been busy lining up
national law firms with experience in tobacco litigation, like
Goodwin, Proctor &AMP; Hoar in Boston, to help represent the firearms
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are either going to address the issues that are coming at
us head on, or we are going to get picked off, one by one,''
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the manufacturers who were sued in the tobacco
cases, he noted, but some of the cities are planning to sue not
only the gun makers but also the distributors and local dealers,
and some gun makers may be tempted to blame dealers who have been
caught selling illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Boyd, a lawyer with Goodwin, Proctor &AMP; Hoar, said the gun
companies as well as the cities could learn from the tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiffs don't have to win all of these cases, they just
have to file enough of them and you can count on an aberrant
decision by a judge somewhere letting a case go to trial,'' Boyd
said. ``That creates enormous risk for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These suits,'' he added, ``are far more political than legal.
They are a multifront attack through a public forum, and if you
don't rebut them politically you can find yourself losing entirely.
And that in turn affects judges who are sensitive to political
currents.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman described the cities' resort to litigation as ``very
dangerous to American democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are supposed to be decided in the legislature,''
he said, ``not the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayors say that for too many years, the gun makers and
the National Rifle Association have controlled the state
legislatures and Congress as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is practically politically impossible to go into our state
legislature in Indianapolis and reasonably hope to get more
restrictive gun laws,'' said Mayor Scott King of Gary, which has
long had one of the nation's highest homicide rates.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors believe that by shifting the venue from the
legislature to the urban courtroom, where some jurors are likely to
have had firsthand experience with gun violence, they have a better
chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the courts are there to do, to fix
inequities that you can't accomplish in the legislature,'' said
Penelas, of Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty for the cities has been to decide which legal
avenue to pursue: a product liability claim, the New Orleans model,
or Chicago's claim of a public nuisance, or both. Most cities say
they are leaning toward the product liability approach, although
the final decision depends on differences in state and city gun
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Rendell, of Philadelphia, believes that it
will take five or six years _ from suit filing until the end of the
appeals process _ to win any money from the industry. He envisions
a point in the interim when the cities will sit down to engage in
collective negotiations with the industry for a settlement
providing new controls.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes he would like are a limit of one handgun
purchase a month per customer, a ban on advertisements that guns
are safe and a halt to the production of large clips for handguns
and bullets that can pierce police armor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said she worried that
such negotiations ``could be a disaster'' because many city
officials and gun-control groups ``would be willing to settle for
very little.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they ought to hold out for making the gun makers submit
to oversight by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, like other
industries, and forcing them to adopt more careful inventory
controls to prevent sales to criminals or straw purchasers acting
on behalf of criminals. Recent investigations by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have found that as many as half the
handguns used in crimes had been purchased from licensed dealers
within the prior three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, N.J., agreed that gun makers ought
to be subjected to additional federal regulation .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reached a point where we want to hold the gun
manufacturers accountable,'' he said. ``They are putting concerns
for profit over life. We've just allowed them to sell weapons like
popcorn and ice cream.''

AN AIR OF MYSTERY SURROUNDS THE ABRUPT RESIGNATION OF BIOGEN
CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James R. Tobin, the president and chief executive officer of
Biogen Inc., resigned abruptly and mysteriously on Wednesday,
sending the stock of the biotechnology company down 8 percent in
heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen said that Tobin had resigned his posts and his seat on
the board of directors, effective immediately, for ``personal
reasons.'' His positions will be assumed by James L. Vincent, the
company's chairman, who had been the chief executive before Tobin
took over in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the company, based in Cambridge, Mass., declined
to elaborate on Tobin's reasons for stepping down and said he was
not available to comment. But they insisted the resignation, which
came at a board meeting on Tuesday, was not related to the
operations of the company, which are ``in the best shape'' in the
company's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The event is not connected with any other happening at the
company,'' Vincent said in a conference call with securities
analysts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a discharge,'' Vincent said. ``This was not a
gentle pushing. This was not a whisper in the ear.'' He also said
that he did not have a dispute over strategy with Tobin and that
Biogen was ``not going to have any lurching changes in strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reluctance of the company to state the reasons led to
numerous rumors and clearly worried investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Biogen fell $7.0625, or 8 percent, to $79.8125, with
17.7 million shares changing hands, 12 times the recent daily
average. Tobin had been popular on Wall Street because of his
friendly manner and was credited by analysts with spurring sales of
Biogen's only product, Avonex, a multiple sclerosis drug. Before
Wednesday's tumble, Biogen stock price had nearly tripled from its
12-month low of $32.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's disturbing to have something like this happen
and it's going to put a cloud over the stock for the short term,''
said Meirav Chovav, a biotechnology analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. But she added that Avonex continued to do well and that she
``fully believes'' that there are no operational issues involved in
the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Biogen reported net income of
$37.57 million, up 83 percent compared with results in the period a
year earlier. Revenue surged 44 percent, to $152.9 million, mainly
from sales of Avonex.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Geller, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in New York, said
that despite rising Avonex sales, Biogen still faced critical
challenges, including coming up with a second product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing yet that's compelling, where you can say this
clearly is going to be a product,'' he said. Meanwhile, he said,
Avonex, which is known generically as beta interferon, already
faces competition from a similar drug, Betaseron, marketed by
Schering A.G. of Germany. And a third company, Ares-Serono S.A. in
Switzerland, is trying to enter the U.S. market with its drug.
Also, he said, the company's royalties from products it developed
but that are sold by others will shrink starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, 59, who will once again take over as chief executive,
came to Biogen as chief executive in 1985, turned the money-losing
company around and then brought Avonex to the market in 1996. But
he then turned the company over to Tobin. He said he intended to
remain chief executive this time for only a year or two and planned
to find a successor from within Biogen's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, 54, spent most of his career at Baxter International, the
medical products company, rising to president and chief operating
officer in 1992. But he resigned _ also just before Christmas _ in
1993 after disputes over strategy with the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen hired him in February 1994 as president and chief
operating officer and made him chief executive in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said that because Tobin resigned voluntarily, he would
not receive severance pay. But the company proxy from last April
showed that Tobin owned 541,668 shares of Biogen, including
options, which would be worth more than $40 million.

RECENT LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS FACE INCREASED DANGER HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For years it has been a mantra among immigrants from
Latin America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   You have gotten past all the thieves lurking in the shadows of
the border lands, past the Border Patrol dragnet. You are in the
big city, more than 100 miles from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Home free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But for many these days, the danger doesn't stop at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Police and federal agents say that crime against immigrants has
been escalating at a rapid rate recently because there's more money
to be made _ by charging more to smuggle, and mixing drugs with the
human cargo. That breeds robberies and violence and immigrants
often are caught in the crossfire. But they remain willing to take
the risk, fleeing worsening economic conditions back home.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three immigrant families living in a southwest
Phoenix home were victims of a home invasion in which an infant in
its mother's arms was shot and critically wounded after demands for
cash, drugs and valuables were not met. The same residence also had
been invaded on two other recent occasions, one in which a man was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   That follows another home invasion in central Phoenix in late
September in which a group of five robbers laid siege to a drop
house of 16 illegal immigrants, killing one man, pistol whipping
another and kidnapping a third.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been fighting back. One woman from El Salvador called
Phoenix police last year when a coyote, an illegal-immigrant
smuggler, demanded $2,000 more than the agreed-upon price to
release her two daughters who were brought illegally to this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like that are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt these people are being targeted more and
more,'' said Phoenix police Sgt. Mike Torres. ``But we don't hear
very much about it because they think they will be deported.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Homan, who heads investigations for the Phoenix office of
Immigration and Naturalization Service, also said his office hears
about only a small percentage of crime in which recent immigrants
are victims or perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it comes to anyone's attention is if someone is
shot and even that doesn't mean the police will be called,'' Homan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Homan said that drop houses are constantly being ripped off by
rival smuggling gangs and, sometimes, even by other people who live
in the area who anticipate big cash inside. drop houses are
residences where illegal immigrants are held after being smuggled
from the border until family or friends pay the coyote's fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is big now, just about as big as dope,'' Homan said.
``We took down one house a few weeks back at 18th Street and Van
Buren with 114 illegals in it which had $140,000 in cash inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to never find weapons in drop houses. Now, you seldom
find one that doesn't have numerous arms in it. The smugglers are
more violent now and the people they smuggle are more desperate to
stay here. You get more abuses but the silence about it is
deafening. For example, we have a major problem with hostage
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   One undercover INS agent, who asked that she be referred to as
Ophelia Ruiz to protect her true identity, said she had just
finished working a hostage case. A coyote had placed a gun to the
head of a man he had smuggled into Arizona and made him call his
wife, demanding additional money for his smuggling fee.
</P>
<P>
   Because of intensified security at the border, the cost of
smuggling an illegal from Nogales to Phoenix has increased from
$150 to $500 during the past three years. Ruiz also said she has
worked other cases where rival smuggling organizations rip off drop
houses just as most illegals inside have paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they (rival smugglers) will go and advertise back in
Mexico that this and that coyote isn't any good because they can't
offer security for the people they smuggle,'' Ruiz said. ``It's a
vicious cycle which leads to more crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz also said that most illegals are unaware when they come to
the Phoenix area that the coyotes also are smuggling drugs with
them, often hiding it on small children in groups of illegals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, people smuggling and drug smuggling were two
different things,'' Ruiz said. ``Now, 98 percent of the time, the
people smugglers have drugs also.''

   FED DISCLOSES DISSENT ON NOVEMBER RATE CUT
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's decision on Nov. 17 to cut interest rates
was driven by concern that problems in the financial markets might
again intensify and drag down the economy, a summary of the meeting
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed minutes said that the decision to cut rates in November
``was viewed as a close call by several members,'' but the sole
dissenter was Jerry L. Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Cleveland. He said that two previous quarter-point cuts had
been sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ADVANCE
</P>
<P>
   Orders for durable goods rose 1 percent in November, more than
expected. Consumer confidence remained high during December, the
University of Michigan said.
</P>
<P>
   FOR CHILDREN, MEDICINE OR CANDY?
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies are selling candy-like over-the-counter remedies
for treating children's ailments like colds, sore throats and even
asthma. But some doctors say that treating any medicine as if it
were candy is confusing and potentially dangerous for children.
</P>
<P>
   SUIT CITES CHASE AND J.P. MORGAN
</P>
<P>
   A suit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn accuses Chase
Manhattan and J.P. Morgan of wrongfully seizing bank accounts and
safe-deposit assets of Jewish customers during the Nazi occupation
of France in World War II. Chase called the suit unnecessary;
Morgan said it would look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHEED MARTIN WARNS ON PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin said profit this year and next year would be
even lower than it forecast last month because sales were declining
and production delays were increasing. Its shares tumbled 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   CRAY TRADE RULING TO BE REVIEWED
</P>
<P>
   A federal court ordered U.S. trade officials to reconsider their
ruling that unfairly priced exports by Japanese supercomputer
makers threatened to harm the Cray Research division of Silicon
Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH INDUSTRIALIST CONVICTED
</P>
<P>
   Serge Dassault, 75, head of the French military concern Dassault
Aviation, was convicted by Belgium's highest court on corruption
charges involving two military contracts in the late 1980s, as was
Willy Claes, 60, a former NATO secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   FORD LINK IS RUMORED FOR VOLVO
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both Volvo AB and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, or BMW,
jumped on speculation that each carmaker was holding talks with
Ford Motor that could lead to a merger or another link. BMW called
merger rumors unfounded, while Volvo and Ford declined comment.
Excess capacity in the global auto industry has raised expectations
of more mergers like Daimler-Chrysler.

   ITALIAN CENTRAL BANK CUTS RATE

   The Italian central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate

   CITIES SUING THE GUN INDUSTRY
</P>

   Heartened by the success states have had in suing tobacco
companies and recovering hundreds of billions of dollars in
smoking-related Medicaid costs, more than a dozen cities are now

   PHOENIX _ A few days before last Christmas, I stood outside the
front door of a hospital in western Pennsylvania. The temperature
was in the 30s and I wasn't wearing a coat or gloves.
</P>
<P>
   I was cold, but not cold enough, so I wrapped my hands around
the support pole of an awning and held on until my fingers went
numb and began sticking to the metal.
</P>
<P>
   Then I pulled them off and ran into the building, up the stairs
to the second floor, down the hall to Room 205.
</P>
<P>
   I walked inside, sat down next to the bed, and put my freezing
hands on my mother's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhh, that feels good,'' she said, not opening her eyes.
``Where were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Just getting a little air, I answered, leaning over to brush my
icy cheek against hers, and to kiss her.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing I could do at a time when it seemed as if there
was nothing I could do. She was feverish. She'd been in the
hospital for weeks. It was near the end.
</P>
<P>
   My father and brother and I filled the days as best we could,
waiting _ as the nuns in Catholic school used to say _ for angels
to come and get her.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. &QL; 
THE ONES I COULD SEE &QL; 
Afterward, it wasn't those angels I was most grateful to, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ones I could see. The nurses and doctors and hospital
volunteers who were there every day.
</P>
<P>
   We have people like that here.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them work for Hospice of the Valley, the oldest
not-for-profit hospice organization in town.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Hospice sent out a notice looking for more
volunteers to help patients and families dealing with terminal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   It involves four hours a week and might include anything from
reading, playing cards, talking or running errands. The kind of
things Gordon Murphy has been doing for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a relatively new volunteer,'' the retired lobbyist
told me. ``I knew I wanted to do something useful with my time and
had read about Hospice. As it turns out, it's me who's benefited
most. I've seen so many wonderful people at work. And met so many
wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospice of the Valley is one of the organizations that have
received grants from ``The Republic's'' annual Season for Sharing
campaign. Every day there's a donation coupon printed on Page A2.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions are matched dollar for dollar by the Robert R.
McCormick Tribune Foundation in Chicago until the total reaches
$800,000. &QL; 
THE LITTLE STUFF COUNTS &QL; 
If you're like me, and don't have the wings to actually BE an
angel, it's one way to provide a little lift for those who work for
outfits like Hospice.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy volunteers at Gardiner House, a care facility for
terminally ill patients. Other volunteers visit Hospice clients and
their families at home. Still others help with fund-raising or
office work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with people at the very end of life,'' Murphy
said. ``It's difficult, but the compassion from the Hospice staff,
and the professionalism, really puts the patient's mind at ease.
And it really helps the families, who are dealing with so many big
things all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that's true.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a year later, it's little things I remember.
</P>
<P>
   Family photos taped to a hospital wall.
</P>
<P>
   The sports page being read out loud.

GOP WHIP'S COMMENTS ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 _ Following is a statement Wednesday by Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, about the
impeachment of President Clinton and prospects for a Senate trial,
as provided by DeLay's office:
</P>
<P>
   I am reluctant to make statements regarding the impeachment
process now that it is in the hands of the Senate. However, after
watching events unfold over the past few days I thought it was
imperative to shed some light on some misinformation being batted
around by the media.
</P>
<P>
   First, as majority whip in the House it is my job to count
votes. I can tell you with great certainty that a censure
resolution would have failed in the House. The Democrats'
resolution was too weak, a Republican resolution would have been
viewed as too strong, and the White House will never negotiate in
good faith. Any resolution's chances of passage were minuscule at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Second, as we saw in the House, without any review of the
evidence it is premature to be talking about a deal or
short-circuiting the process. There are reams of evidence that have
not been publicly aired and are only available to members.
</P>
<P>
   I make these remarks with the utmost respect for the members of
the Senate, but these are uncharted waters for the Senate and the
complexity of the situation is being underestimated by some members
of the media and the White House. The reason the House adopted
articles of impeachment was due to the overwhelming evidence
against the president. Before people look to cut a deal with the
White House or their surrogates who will seek to influence this
process, it is my hope that one would spend plenty of time in the
evidence room. If this were to happen, you may realize that 67
votes may appear out of thin air. If you don't, you may wish you
had before rushing to judgment.

SUIT SAYS CHASE AND MORGAN SEIZED ASSETS OF FRENCH JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Israel)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the nation's leading banking companies, Chase
Manhattan and J.P. Morgan, were accused in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday of wrongfully seizing bank accounts and safe-deposit
assets of Jewish customers during the German occupation of France
in World War II and then failing to return them after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on behalf
of Jewish citizens of France, Israel and other nations who survived
the Nazi occupation or are relatives of victims. A lawyer for the
plaintiffs said he believed it was the first class-action suit
charging American banks with having wrongfully seized and kept the
assets of Holocaust victims. Seven French banks were also named as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Kenneth McCallion, said the suit had been brought
under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which permits foreigners to bring
suits in American courts charging violations of international law.
</P>
<P>
   McCallion said he and other lawyers in the case were looking
into the possibility of adding Chase and Morgan as defendants in a
suit, previously filed in the same court against the French banks,
in which the plaintiffs include Jews who are citizens of the United
States and who survived the Nazi years in France. American citizens
who are relatives of French Jewish victims are also plaintiffs in
this suit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Morgan, Michael Golden, said, ``We understand
the seriousness of this issue and will certainly look into these
allegations with care.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan called it an ``unnecessary lawsuit,'' saying it
had been in discussions with the World Jewish Congress for several
weeks in an effort to ``establish a process for facilitating
payment to former customers of the Chase Bank of Paris or their
heirs whose accounts were frozen and subsequently seized by the
Vichy French or Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it was ``recently made aware of questions of
propriety'' concerning its actions in World War II, and that it had
begun ``a vigorous examination of the historical records'' and
started consulting with Jewish organizations and experts to
identify former customers or their heirs. ``Chase immediately said
it would pay these customers or heirs with interest,'' the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was the latest in a series in the last two years that
have leveled similar charges against banks of other nations. In
August, Credit Suisse and UBS settled, agreeing to pay $1.25
billion in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Because seven French banks were named as defendants, along with
Chase Manhattan and Morgan, the plaintiff class potentially numbers
``tens of thousands of people,'' McCallion said. Most of them live
in France, Israel, Canada and Australia. But the great bulk of
those affected have claims against the French banks, he said.

 &HT;    Equifax shares plunge on earnings warning
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equifax stock tumbled 22 percent Wednesday after the
company said fourth-quarter earnings would be about 31 cents a
share instead of the 41 cents expected by analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The slide knocked $1.4 billion off Equifax's stock market value.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax said about half of the earnings shortfall resulted from
the fact managers in Europe included in fourth-quarter internal
projections revenue that should not have been attributed to that
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are very disappointed with the developments in
Europe, we immediately assessed the causes and impact and moved
swiftly to make the appropriate management and process changes,''
Thomas F. Chapman, president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nick J. Bevan, an Equifax executive vice president, was replaced
as head of the Atlanta-based company's European operations by C.
Richard Crutchfield.
</P>
<P>
   The European division's chief financial officer, whose name was
not disclosed, resigned, said Marietta Edmunds Zakas, corporate
vice president. Steve Ford, an Equifax controller, was named
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement might give some investors concern about
financial controls at Equifax, said analyst Kevin R. Gruneich, who
follows the company for Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it really seems financial controls worked in this case.
The corporate headquarters found something was awry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Equifax ``will be in the penalty box'' for a while,
Gruneich said, he did not change his ``buy'' rating. ``I think it's
silly to downgrade the stock or to sell the stock after it opened
down $9.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakas said the fourth-quarter projection from Europe included
all the revenue on contracts that extend as long as three years.
The revenue should be recognized over the life of the contracts,
not just in one period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were forecasting revenue for those was not
consistent'' with the company's practices, she said. ``They were
doing it incorrectly. It was caught at the forecast stage, we sent
a team to investigate ... then we changed management.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakas emphasized that projections, not reported results, were at
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is isolated to the fourth quarter. It is isolated to
Europe,'' she added. ``All of our other operating segments are
doing very well for the quarter and the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Equifax said the rest of the earnings shortfall is due to ``the
cancellation or postponement of several projects ... the
collectability of past-due receivables, increased bad check losses
... in Europe and a softening in the U.K. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also wrote off its investment in RequesT, a start-up
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Zakas said Equifax now expects to report 1998 earnings of about
$1.34 a share, and $1.57-$1.59 a share in 1999, including the
impacts of Year 2000 computer costs and its Brazilian acquisitions.
The company earlier said the acquisitions would reduce 1999 results
by 7 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Equifax reported earnings of $1.24 a share, before
unsual items, a nonrecurring gain and an accounting charge.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning was, as Zakas noted, ``uncharacteristic'' of
the company, which has been in business since 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax has in the past consistently met or beat analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose headquarters are at 1600 Peachtree St. in
Midtown, employs 14,000 people in 18 countries, including about
2,800 in metro Atlanta.
</P>

 &HT;    Doing less is better for Smith
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In these giddy days of uncommon deeds, a moment,
please, for those Falcons whose major contribution has been to do
less.
</P>
<P>
   When this team lost _ it used to do so regularly, you know _ the
Smith family was right out there, pilloried for all to see. Now, in
the midst of the Falcons' winningest season ever, you'd scarcely
know they still own the majority of the team. It is addition by
absenteeism, a strategy of non-involvement that has paid off
handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems happier about the results than the forgotten
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen-and-two, I have to pinch myself, it's so hard to
believe,'' said Taylor Smith, the team president and point man for
the Smiths since the death last year of his father, Rankin Smith
Sr. ``Every Monday, I find myself saying, `My God, we won again!'
And the way we win makes you feel good _ there are no flukes in the
way we play. It's just amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   What about ego? Doesn't this route to success rub against the
Jerry Jones that lives in every NFL owner? ``No, not at all,''
Smith said. ``You don't get too many opportunities to hire people
like (Dan Reeves). To have somebody like that, it was like a
relief. We needed a strong, strong leader in here, and that's what
we got.''
</P>
<P>
   What about missing the intimate involvement with the day-to-day
operations of an NFL franchise? ``Stepping back, that's the easy
part. ... Mainly in the contract area, my role is different. Thank
goodness. I don't want anything to do with that anyway,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one party that makes all the football decisions. The
way we were set up in the past, there was a personnel area and a
coaching area. I was the final say if anything came down between
them. Believe me, I like this set-up a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Smith still maintains a large, cluttered office in the
heart of the Falcons bunker, but there is no question about who is
running the show. One gets the truest sense of how much Reeves
means to the continuing health of this franchise by how eager the
Smiths are to hand over all authority and credit. Much hinges on
Reeves' recuperative powers. For everyone's sake, get well soon,
Dan.
</P>
<P>
   On the late October day in '97 that Rankin Smith Sr. died, the
Falcons lost to Charlotte to fall to 1-7. The man who had
wet-nursed pro football in the South did not live to see his team
turn around, but his son insists that he knew this day was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible for me to think that we've won 19 of 23 games
since the day Dad died,'' Taylor Smith said. ``You could see from
the beginning that Dan was special. We were losing, but we were
barely losing. Chris (Chandler) was hurt, we had played Denver
tough (losing 29-21), played San Francisco tough (losing 35-28) but
we weren't getting anything out of it. (Rankin Sr.) felt really
good about Dan. I believe he's sitting up there and knows what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sorry state of the Falcons, the Smiths spent much
of their days serving as a community punch line. The frustrations
all bubbled to the top of the organizational chart. They were
ridiculed as bumpkins unable or unwilling to construct a winner.
There grew the belief that the Falcons would never amount to
anything as long as the Smiths owned them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the glow of success, Smith chooses not to bare any old
scars. In fact, he'll join the chorus of those who have questioned
the past:
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in it, I know (criticism) is the nature of the
beast. It's hard. The highs and lows are unbelievable. It's been
real important to the family for this team to be a winner. I always
felt that while we didn't always make great decisions, we tried to
do things that were right. We didn't make any excuses for it; we
were just looking for the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way you can make any excuses as to what our record was. We
had some brief periods of success but never sustained it. We dug
ourselves a big hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've missed the boat for so long. Atlanta has really deserved
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, of course, is to make this team mean something in
the long run. There have been brief spikes in Falcons history,
always followed by the inevitable plunge. In 33 seasons, this
blighted franchise never has had consecutive winning records. Its
success has been as accidental as a winning lottery ticket or
lightning strike.
</P>
<P>
   The team president counts on Reeves' complete recovery from
bypass surgery and his continued immersion in the Falcons' affairs.
It is their last best hope for consistency. ``Dan wants to make
this thing special over a long period of time,'' Smith said. ``He
says that's the only way you're really successful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the present, these are among the best of times for the
Falcons' first family. They gather this Christmas at their
Thomasville plantation and gladly celebrate what they haven't done
this season.

 &HT;    Reeves speaks briefly to his players
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The doctor-imposed isolation of Falcons coach Dan
Reeves was suspended briefly Wednesday morning when he spoke to his
players by speaker phone from his hospital room, congratulating
them for their NFC West championship and telling them to play hard
this week against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It was his second address to the squad since he had quadruple
heart bypass surgery Dec. 14, and the first since he was readmitted
to Piedmont Hospital on Sunday after experiencing an accelerated
heart rate two days after his original release.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, team officials were told Reeves would not be allowed
contact with players or assistants this week because the
54-year-old coach tried to do too much too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the rest has done Reeves good, although it is still
not clear when he will leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Team internist Charlie Harrison and heart surgeon James Kauten
``had a change of heart and allowed Dan to speak to the team,''
interim head coach Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He congratulated the team (and) told them merry Christmas. I
don't know whether he'll be home at Christmas or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety William White said it was important to hear from
Reeves for the first time since the team clinched the NFC West
title with a 24-17 victory at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great to hear from your leader, and he is our
leader,'' White said. ``He was real proud of the way we handled
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is listed in stable condition. He has been taking blood
thinners, and doctors have experimented with medications to
regulate his heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the morning after he was first released, Harrison
drove Reeves to team headquarters in Suwanee, where he intended to
review a 10-minute highlight film from the previous game at New
Orleans. Instead, he spoke only a few minutes and was too tired to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voice sounded really good (Wednesday),'' quarterback Chris
Chandler said. ``It sounded a lot stronger than on Saturday. He
said, `Merry Christmas,' but he didn't let us know when he might
get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he was glad he made the decision earlier this week
not to rest any players this Sunday, even though the Falcons can
gain nothing in terms of playoff positions with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I did,'' Brook said, ``because I got that talk from
Dan very briefly this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reeves) told us champions never stopped proving it,''
Chandler said.

 &HT;    Three killed in Austin pile-up
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Three people were killed and dozens injured Wednesday
in more than 400 traffic accidents, including two pileups on
Interstate 35 involving a total of 64 vehicles, as freezing rain
and temperatures wreaked havoc on roads and holiday travel plans
across Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More freezing rain was expected today and forecasters warned
motorists to expect the same conditions this morning as they saw
Wednesday. Slightly warmer temperatures were expected today,
however, and officials expected conditions to improve during the
afternoon. Today's high should reach 34 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go through another bad batch of weather before
it starts clearing up,'' said Tony Perez, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials cautioned people to stay at home
if possible, but conceded holiday travelers likely would be trying
to get to their Christmas destinations. If driving today, ``assume
that any wet spot on the road is ice,'' said Steve Collier, Office
of Emergency Management director for Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Travel throughout Texas was disrupted Wednesday by freezing
rain, sleet and snow, with the Dallas and Fort Worth areas
especially affected. The Department of Public Safety reported 10
people died across the state due to weather-related accidents as of
Wednesday evening, and Irving police added an 11th _ a man in a
multi-vehicle wreck got out of his car and was struck by another
car.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austin area, Wednesday's icy drizzle brought many
activities to a standstill. Austin and Travis County governments
sent non-essential employees on Christmas break a day early. Many
holiday shoppers stayed home. Some home health care providers were
unable to reach patients. Cold weather shelters were packed.
American Airlines canceled all its flights out of Austin Wednesday,
while other airlines struggled with delays. The Trail of Lights
Christmas display at Zilker Park was closed, but could be open for
its final night tonight if conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police reported 360 traffic accidents between midnight
and 3:30 p.m. Wednesday _ more than four times the 75 collisions
they typically handle on a rainy day. Travis County also reported
52 wrecks by noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting it to get bad around the morning hours, but
things started to happen around 1 or 2 in the morning,'' said
Carlos Cordova, a city of Austin spokesman. ``There were just some
really bad collisions today. Just very tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst occurred in the 6100 block of I-35 near U.S. 290, when
separate chain-reaction accidents happened three minutes apart on
either side of the divided highway, killing two people, injuring
more than 20 and clogging all lanes.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 vehicles slammed into each other on the northbound
side of I-35 at 1:10 a.m. after one vehicle hit an icy patch and
its driver lost control. Cynthia Perez, 19, of the Wells Branch
neighborhood north of Austin, died at Brackenridge Hospital after
being injured in one of the secondary crashes in the northbound
accident.
</P>
<P>
   While police rushed to the northbound side, at least 40 vehicles
crashed into each other in the southbound lanes at 1:13 a.m. Police
said three or four cars skidded into retaining walls along the
highway, causing a domino-effect pileup of trailing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ransel, 30, a wrecker driver, was pronounced dead at the
scene of the southbound crash. Police said he was towing a Toyota
sedan behind his wrecker truck when he slammed into the back of an
tractor-trailer truck that had stopped to avoid the pile-up. His
wrecker bounced off the rear of the 18-wheeler and hit another car
on the shoulder of the roadway, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Ice caused both interstate accidents, which were not related
even though they happened so close together, police said. A
concrete barrier separates the northbound and southbound lanes.
Police said the number of cars involved is a conservative estimate
because a number of drivers drove away or were waved on before
officers were able to get statements from them.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of southbound U.S. 183 near Mustang Ridge, in far
southeastern Travis County, were closed all day Wednesday after a
6:18 a.m. crash involving a car and a tractor-trailer truck near
Evelyn Road.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Lynch, 38, of Buda was pronounced dead at the scene. She
was driving north on U.S. 183 when she struck a sheet of ice and
slammed into the truck, which was traveling south. Her car caught
fire after the accident, an EMS spokesman said. Lynch was not
wearing a seat belt at the time, a Department of Public Safety
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Icy conditions were blamed for the majority of Wednesday's
wrecks. But too many drivers navigated the slick roads as if it
were a normal day and that contributed to the number of accidents,
emergency management officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty bad ice storm, as far as accidents are
concerned,'' Collier said. ``There is no reason to be driving
normal speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service forecast improved conditions today,
with a 50 percent chance of rain and freezing rain that would taper
off by late afternoon. The low should not drop below the uppers
20s, Perez said. By Christmas Day, temperatures should be in the
mid-40s and climb throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wait and see and keeping fingers crossed, basically,''
said Terri Dusek, spokeswoman for Hospice Austin. The hospice, like
other home health care providers and delivery services Wednesday,
had problems getting nurses and workers to its 150 patients but
eventually were able to get to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's network of church-sponsored cold weather shelters for
men, youths and families were filled to capacity Wednesday. A
second youth shelter at the Congregational Church of Austin opened
Wednesday night after more than 20 young people showed up at
University Baptist Church Tuesday night. The Baptist church
normally shelters about a dozen people, said Sharon Bieser,
ecumenical outreach coordinator for St. Austin Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The city's only full-time shelter, the ARCH building on West
Second Street, stayed open two hours later than normal and was
filled with an estimated 200 people _ twice the normal attendance.
More than 300 people took shelter at the Salvation Army on East
Eighth Street.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters needed winter clothing, food and volunteers, members of
the Austin Metropolitan Ministries said.
</P>
<P>
   A 75-year-old Granger man was treated for hypothermia at Johns
Community Hospital in Taylor after neighbors found him outside his
apartment Wednesday around 7 a.m. The hospital would not release
the man's name, but said he was in stable condition Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   One area mostly unaffected by the cold _ so far, at least _ was
the city's electrical power and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the City of Austin Utility Department said
only 36 people since Tuesday had reported not having power, mainly
because they'd tripped their main breakers after plugging in too
many heat sources during the day. The number was average for a
24-hour period, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone wires also remained intact Wednesday, with little
danger expected from the relatively light winds and dusting of icy
accumulation, a Southwestern Bell spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   American-Statesman staff writers Bob Banta, Debbie Hiott, Claire
Osborn, Leah Quin and Jason Spencer contributed to this report,
which also contains information from the Associated Press.

 &HT;    Sack-happy Dolphins to test offensive line
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a season full of good news, Atlanta is worst in the
league in sacks surrendered per passing play, giving up 53 in 464
passing attempts, or one every 8.8 passing plays.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's opponent, Miami (10-5), has 45 sacks this season, tied
for second-most in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Atlanta's high sacks-surrendered total is attributable
to problems with blitz pickups, but it's also a reflection of
quarterback Chris Chandler tending to hold on to the ball a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he makes plays happen that way, as he did a few times
Dec. 13 at New Orleans. But sacks happen, too.
</P>
<P>
   A good example came in last Sunday's 24-17 win at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Harold Green made a mistake in the second half,
going the wrong way on a pass play, leaving Chandler no receiver on
the right side as he attempted a naked bootleg.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a sack by Detroit's Robert Porcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same play (as the 28-yarder earlier) out of a
different formation,'' said interim head coach Rich Brooks.
``Harold was supposed to be a receiver on the other side. What
Chris should have done ... was just throw the ball away. Instead,
he took the sack.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Trace Armstrong, who doesn't even start, leads the
Dolphins with 10.5 sacks. Right defensive end Jason Taylor, a
second-year player, has nine sacks, and rookie defensive end
Lorenzo Brommel, who doesn't start and has missed two games, has
eight sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff picture
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, as NFC West champions and the No. 2 seed in the NFC
playoffs, will have a bye in the first week of the playoffs, the
weekend of Jan. 2 and Jan. 3. The next weekend, they will have a
home game, either Jan. 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of the playoffs, the NFC East champion Dallas
Cowboys (9-6) will play either Arizona (8-7), the Giants (7-8) or
Tampa Bay (7-8), and San Francisco (11-4) will play Green Bay
(10-5).
</P>
<P>
   If Dallas wins, the Cowboys will come to Atlanta the following
week.
</P>
<P>
   If Dallas loses, the team that beats the Cowboys will go to
Minnesota the next week, and the winner of the Green Bay-San
Francisco game will come to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the Vikings are slated to host the
lowest-remaining seed. Even though both Green Bay and San Francisco
might have better records than Dallas, the Cowboys are seeded
higher (No. 3) by virtue of being division champions
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   There are about 7,500 tickets remaining for the first playoff
game. There are a little more than 17,000 remaining for the second
home playoff game, if the Falcons have one.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials are cautioning fans who attempt to purchase
tickets from scalpers that counterfeit tickets are likely to be
plentiful, not only for playoff games, but also for this Sunday's
regular-season finale against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket manager Jack Ragsdale said that for the Nov. 22 game
against the Bears, there were at least 70 instances of fans getting
into the Georgia Dome with counterfeit tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Those fans usually found out that either the seat printed on
their ticket did not exist, or was occupied by a legitimate buyer.
Fans with counterfeit tickets are escorted out of the stadium, with
no refund.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson talks
</P>
<P>
   James Sims, the agent for running back Jamal Anderson, was in
Atlanta last Friday, chiefly to speak with Anderson, but he did
meet briefly with Falcons general manager Harold Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons began discussions six weeks ago on a contract
extension for Anderson, who has one year left after this. Both
sides say no deal will be done soon, meaning it will not happen
before Saturday, the last day a player can sign a contract
extension and have the signing bonus spread out over 1998 and the
additional years of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are in pretty good shape, as defensive end Lester
Archambeau (thumb), weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett (knee)
and reserve cornerback Randy Fuller (shoulder) are all listed as
probable for Sunday's game. Archambeau had one of the three pins
removed from his broken left thumb, which may help alleviate some
pain. ... Miami left tackle Richmond Webb (triceps) and reserve
linebacker Larry Izzo (knee) are out. Running back Karim
Abdul-Jabbar (concussion) and starting right guard Kevin Donnalley
(knee) are questionable. Running back John Avery (ankle), starting
linebacker Robert Jones (quadriceps), starting cornerback Sam
Madison (hip) and reserve wide receiver and special-teams player
Nate Jacquet (concussion) are probable.
</P>
<P>
   The race
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle has led the Falcons in tackles
for nine consecutive seasons. Entering the final game, he and
Bennett are tied for the team lead with 112 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: Free safety Eugene Robinson (88), Archambeau and strong
safety William White (77 each).
</P>
<P>
   Going for it
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta wins, it will be the first time in franchise history
the team has gone undefeated at home. ... The Falcons have scored
404 points, third-most in their history. They scored 426 points in
'81, and 405 in '80. ... Atlanta has scored 30 or more points six
times, one short of the team record, set in '80 and matched in '81.
... Anderson has 2,062 yards from scrimmage, trailing only the
2,176 by running back William Andrews in '83. Anderson also is
second in the NFL with 100 first downs, tied with Denver's Terrell
Davis, and trailing Indianapolis running back Marshall Faulk. Davis
leads all rushers with 1,830 yards; Anderson is second with 1,743.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Chandler has thrown 23 touchdown passes from
inside the 20-yard line with no interceptions. He leads all
quarterbacks with a 121.2 passer rating in the fourth quarter. ...
With four interceptions this season, Robinson has 53 in his career,
making him the NFL's leading active interceptor and No. 16 in
league history. ... Atlanta, which leads the league in average time
of possession (33:32), is 13-0 this year when it has an edge in
time of possession, 0-2 when it does not. ... The Falcons worked
out former Canadian Football League defensive lineman Joe Fleming,
who played at New Hampshire, and cornerback Keith Thibodeaux, who
was waived earlier this season by Washington. Thibodeaux, who
played for the Redskins last year, played collegiately at
Northwestern State (La.). ... Atlanta will practice early today, at
10:30 a.m. and then practice Friday morning. Next week, when the
Falcons have a bye, they will practice Wednesday and Thursday. ...
In the past six games, 20 of Morten Andersen's 31 kickoffs have
gone into the end zone, and 13 have been touchbacks. ... Dan
Stryzinski has 24 punts inside the opponents' 20-yard line, tying
his career high, set in '93 with Tampa Bay.

ON THE ROAD, SEARCHING, ON CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ He will be on the road by the time you read this,
searching for his Christmas gift, gas pedal to the floor, America
streaming past. He is 33, my age exactly, and my bosom friend. His
name is Robert, but we call him ``Kooz.''
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, the gift Kooz covets was not under the
Christmas tree. &UR; It's the most hard-won present a man can receive,
the most precious gift of all.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of himself.
</P>
<P>
   For some it comes naturally; for others never. Look around you,
inside you, on this Christmas day: You know if you have the gift of
yourself. If so, I say be glad. I know a man who does not, and
right now he is driving the highway with a seat full of maps,
directions of every sort, but no destination, no sense of
direction.
</P>
<P>
   I have been there. Maybe you have, too. It sounds fun, but every
mile takes you down a toll road. Heavy dues. The gift of yourself
costs plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Kooz told me by phone from Florida on
Wednesday. ``I just want to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, that meant college, Florida State, where we went
together after high school. Then came 10 years at Sears, a
part-time job that became a career that became a rut. The raises
were small. The management promotion never happened. Last winter,
he got an offer, made a break. There were infinite tests, months of
training. Morgan, Stanley, Dean Witter made him a stockbroker. &QL; 
Out of the rut &QL; 
He got a Series 7 license, a Series 31, a Series 63, a Series 65.
He bought nice suits, a condo on the beach in Fort Lauderdale. He
advised people, made them a bundle, made himself a smaller bundle.
</P>
<P>
   Made himself miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was averaging about 150 cold calls a day,'' he explained.
``I was doing all right. That wasn't the problem. I just found
myself staring out into space for a couple of hours at a time,
staring at the quote boards. It just wasn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   So he took a sheet of company letterhead and scribbled a few
paragraphs. The boss thought he was kidding. The guy in the next
cubicle laughed until there was no punch line. Tuesday morning Kooz
was a stockbroker. Tuesday afternoon he was cashing in his 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   He sounded low when he told me, and I felt low for him until I
saw the courage it took. Some might call what Kooz did quitting; I
call it summoning guts enough to face the unknown. It is a
different risk than the one most of us take, we who find the
courage to stay and plod, to gut it out for a paycheck and a
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I see nobility in both choices, and sacrifice. In 33 years, I
have stayed and I have gone. Either way is tough. A five-day
workweek sometimes feels like a month. A thousand miles of
Interstate 95 can feel like a galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Kooz is now, ripping north through Florida,
somewhere between Lauderdale and New Orleans. His makeshift
itinerary calls for stops in Houston, San Antonio, El Paso and
Phoenix for New Year's. Then it's Utah, Denver, St. Louis, maybe
Chicago. &QL; 
`I wish I had done that' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be 50 years old and thinking to myself, `I
wish I had done that before I got married,' '' he reasoned. ``Why
should I be 33 years old and never have seen the Rocky Mountains?''
</P>
<P>
   Or never have seen himself?
</P>
<P>
   That glimpse is the gift he desires most, and if I could find it
in a store, I would buy it for him with pieces of my flesh.
Sometimes, you look up and there it is _ a man likes your sentences
and gives you a newspaper column, a career, then a kind blonde
likes your eyes and gives you a life. Other times, you stare at the
telephone and every cold call seems colder than the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm looking for,'' said Kooz. ``I just want
to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's out searching on Christmas, on a road free of traffic,
but crowded with fellow travelers. He is living the American dream
_ to chuck it all _ and the American nightmare _ for what?
</P>
<P>
   He wanted advice. I told him drive carefully. Not sage words,
but I want him to get there alive. Wherever there is.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Perhaps it is no coincidence that as the Cold
War ended, the golf-club war began. In their quest for the ultimate
ball launcher, club manufacturers turned to the space-age
materials, computer-aided design techniques and laid-off engineers
of their Southern California neighbors, the aerospace companies.
And they guard their secrets just as closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security here is tighter than it was at Lockheed,'' said
Tom Preece, who worked as an engineer on the F-22 fighter and is
now product design manager at Callaway Golf Co., where robots test
clubs by hitting balls with a consistency that would make a weekend
duffer weep with envy.
</P>
<P>
   But now _ also like the aerospace business before it _ the
golf-club industry is enduring a serious retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aging baby boomers' rising interest in golf and a new
influx of young players, sales in the $2.5 billion American
golf-club market are off 10 to 20 percent this year, executives and
analysts said. Golfers who once paid as much as $500 for the latest
oversize titanium driver are becoming more cost-conscious. So
prices are falling and inventories rising.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, new rules being adopted by the U.S. Golf
Association, the sport's governing body, could make it far more
difficult for manufacturers to devise the next great advance that
might stimulate demand. Indeed, the USGA's season-long review of
how technology affects the game hung over the industry like a cloud
all year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest hit has been the largest club maker,
Callaway, which is known for its Big Bertha line. In October, the
company dismissed its chief executive, Donald Dye, and gave the
reins back to Ely Callaway, 79, its founder. In November the
company dismissed 700 employees, or nearly a quarter of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Made Golf Co., the second-largest club maker, and Cobra
Golf Inc., the third-largest, have also had layoffs; Cobra
president Bob Dubiel departed a few months ago. Lynx Golf Inc. and
Snake Eyes Golf Clubs Inc., two smaller manufacturers, have filed
for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The problems come at a time when, by most measures, the sport is
doing well. Owing largely to the popularity of Tiger Woods, the
number of American golfers increased 7 percent in 1997 to 26.5
million, according to the National Golf Foundation, an industry
group. The number of golf newcomers soared 51 percent, to 3
million. Until those gains, the numbers had barely budged since
1990, the foundation said. Figures for 1998 are not available, but
people in the industry say the Tiger Woods boom has cooled.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the industry was hurt by the poor weather
inflicted by El Nino storms early in the year as well as by the
economic crises in golf-loving Japan and the rest of East Asia.
Callaway, which relies on Japan for about 10 percent of its sales,
is selling half as much in that country as it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger problem, analysts and retailers say, is a lack of
new products to excite golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Club sales boomed in the 1990s, spurred initially by
``oversize'' drivers _ which were said to offer a bigger sweet spot
for hitting longer and straighter shots _ and then even more when
the industry developed clubs made of titanium, which is lighter and
stronger than steel. The number of golfers barely changed, but club
sales in the United States soared like a perfectly hit seven-iron,
from $1.3 billion in 1993 to $2.5 billion last year, according to
the National Sporting Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, golfers have their titaniums and neither Callaway
nor Taylor Made has introduced anything to replace them. ``There's
no must-have club out there,'' said Bud Leedom, publisher of Golf
Insight &AMP; Investing, a newsletter in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   With the giants idle, two companies came out of virtually
nowhere to pitch new fairway woods. Orlimar Golf Equipment Co., an
obscure operation for most of its 38-year history, expects sales of
more than $50 million this year from its Trimetal clubs, versus
only $1.5 million in 1997. And Adams Golf, of Plano, Texas, which
makes the Tight Lies clubs, should achieve sales of about $100
million this year, up from $3 million two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their gains came out of the hide of Callaway, whose
market share in metal woods fell from about 39 percent a year ago
to 27 percent in September. Taylor Made also lost a few points of
market share.
</P>
<P>
   But the golf industry's problems might be catching up even to
the new highfliers. Adams, which went public in July at $16 a
share, closed Wednesday at $3.875 and the company expects to barely
break even this quarter. Orlimar, based in Hayward, Calif.,
postponed plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Some golfers say equipment makers raised prices too high. ``It
got to a ridiculous point, with Callaway coming up with bigger
heads and charging $100 more each time they improved it,'' said
David Palmer, 28, a corporate bond salesman at Lehman Brothers, who
has not yet bought a titanium driver.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have started to plummet. Taylor Made, for example, cut
prices three times in 12 months on its top-of-the-line Ti Bubble 2
driver, bringing the retail price down from more than $450 to as
little as $250.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that arrogance in price has not really
worked,'' said George Montgomery, president of Taylor Made, which
is owned by Adidas-Salomon, the German sporting goods company.
Adidas reported that Taylor Made sales shrank 24 percent in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown has hit hardest in Carlsbad, a city of 70,000 about
20 miles north of San Diego that is home to Callaway, Taylor Made,
Cobra and smaller companies like McHenry Metals Golf Corp. That has
earned it the moniker ``Titanium Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is less interaction among the companies than, say, in
Silicon Valley. Callaway and Montgomery, for example, have never
met. And the companies are always shooting barbs at one another in
their public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Golf remains the biggest industry here, but the number of
workers has shrunk from more than 5,000 to about 4,000, about a
tenth of the town's labor pool. Still, city officials say, Carlsbad
is not suffering; unemployment in San Diego County was only 3.2
percent in November. The opening next spring of a Legoland theme
park should also help.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway's layoffs came after its net income dived 84 percent in
the third quarter to $5.8 million; sales fell by a third, to $173
million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the success of the Big Bertha line, Callaway's sales
shot from $21 million in 1990 to $843 million last year. But this
year sales will drop to about $700 million; the company's share
price has plunged from a 12-month high of almost $34 in February to
$10 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the company simply took its eye off the ball.
It began moving into other businesses like golf-book publishing and
driving ranges. That strategy, now abandoned, cost Dye, the former
chief executive, his job.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway, who was chairman during Dye's two-year tenure, said
the worst is behind the company. ``We're not going to have anywhere
near the negative surprises we've had,'' he said. But the company
also does not expect significant sales increases for several
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are also hurting. Cobra experienced a
``significant'' decline in sales and profits in the third quarter,
according to its parent company, Fortune Brands, a conglomerate
that also makes Titleist clubs and balls and Footjoy golf shoes.
Cobra sales are down 2 percent for the year, but 15 percent in the
third quarter. In contrast to Cobra, Titleist's golf club sales are
up 38 percent this year because of new product introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is also trying to promote new lines. In August, it
introduced a smaller-headed line of steel drivers and fairway woods
that seems to have stopped its losses to Orlimar and Adams; it is
now working on a new line of titanium woods. Callaway would not say
when it would be introduced but suggested that the clubs would stay
oversized and expensive. He scoffed at those who say that club
heads have gotten too big and prices too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come up with something that's better than what we have
now, the price will be secondary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a question of just how much better any club can
get. When the U.S. Golf Association initiated its review of whether
technological advances in equipment let players hit the ball with
greater distance and accuracy _ thus imperiling the integrity of
the game _ the industry held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA could have, for example, banned titanium clubs, but
took a middle path instead. In November, it adopted new regulations
to limit what it called a ``trampoline effect,'' in which the club
face bends inward when it hits the ball and then springs back,
propelling the ball farther. Under ferocious lobbying by the
makers, though, the USGA said that virtually all existing clubs
conformed to the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some manufacturers say, future advances will be
stymied. Callaway acknowledged that a ``substantial improvement
over existing clubs probably will not conform'' to the
association's guidelines. He threatened to sue if the association
rejected a Callaway club.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the sport needs to attract more players by making
playing times shorter and protocols less intimidating. The bulk of
golf equipment is bought by only about 5.6 million avid golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize,'' said Leigh Bader, manager of the pro
shop at the Pine Oaks Golf Course in South Easton, Mass., ``what a
small pie is being fought for.''

OUTBREAK OF FOOD POISONING LEADS TO WARNING ON HOT DOGS AND COLD
CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JO THOMAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that
has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August
have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and
cold cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot
dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in
Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States. Bil Mar is a
division of Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and
soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is
carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into
contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat. It
thrives in refrigerators, but can be destroyed by boiling or
reheating food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   When ingested, Listeria bacteria can cause illness and death
among the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened
immune systems. In a normal year, an estimated 1,850 people become
seriously ill. Of these, 425 die.
</P>
<P>
   Three who have died in this outbreak have been elderly. They are
a man, 79, from the Rochester, N.Y., area, and two others from
Ohio, one from Toledo and one from Cincinnati. The fourth victim,
from the Toledo area, was a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has had the largest number of cases, 13. New York has had
12. Tennessee, Massachusetts and West Virginia have each had 3.
Michigan has had two cases. Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and
Georgia have had one each. The outbreak began on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Koch, acting state epidemiologist in Ohio, said
the DNA of the bacteria involved in the outbreak showed ``a very
rare pattern,'' called Pattern E.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the source, health officials from New York, Connecticut,
Ohio and Tennessee worked with the agency to examine the diets of
affected patients. Most had eaten cooked hot dogs the month before
they became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, said that on
Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators
isolated this strain of Listeria on an open package of hot dogs
that a month earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill.
It is not known how or where this package was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products
might contain the Listeria bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The products recalled were only those labeled with Establishment
Numbers EST P261 or EST 6911 for Ball Park, Bil Mar, Bryan Bunsize,
and Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack hot dogs, and Grillmaster, Hygrade,
Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped operations for those product lines at the
plant,'' Theresa Herlevsen, a spokeswoman for Sara Lee, said in a
telephone interview, emphasizing that there had been no conclusive
information about contamination of these products.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herlevesen said Sara Lee estimated the cost of the recall at
$50 million to $70 million. Consumers may return the recalled
products to the place of purchase for a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to commend the company for taking this step,'' said
Skinner of the disease control agency, noting that the company was
cooperating with federal investigators. ``What's important is that
people at risk, such as the elderly and pregnant women, need to
reduce their risk by avoiding these products or thoroughly cooking
them before eating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thoroughly cook your hot dogs,'' Skinner said, ``you
kill the Listeria. We don't want people to stop eating hot dogs and
cold cut meats.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the source and cause of the outbreak was
continuing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease control agency said healthy adults and children were
occasionally infected with Listeria, but rarely became seriously
ill. People with weakened immune systems, including those with
cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, are much more vulnerable.
People with AIDS are almost 300 times more likely to get
listeriosis than people with normal immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms are those of a flu-like illness, and may include a
fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea or a stiff neck. A blood test
is the most reliable way to diagnose the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risks, the disease centers, recommends thoroughly
cooking raw food from animal sources, washing raw vegetables, and
keeping uncooked meats separate from vegetables. Hands, knives and
cutting boards should be washed after coming into contact with
uncooked foods.
</P>
<P>
   Although the risk of listeriosis associated with foods from deli
counters is relatively low, the disease agency says pregnant women
and immunosuppressed people may choose to avoid these foods or
thoroughly reheat cold cuts before eating. They should also avoid
soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined and
Mexican-style cheese.

 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four people died in the superheated, smoke-filled
stairwell of a Manhattan high-rise building on Wednesday as they
tried to escape a fire that started in a 19th-floor apartment where
the family of the actor Macaulay Culkin lived.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second fire with multiple deaths in a New York City
apartment building in less than a week, coming just five days after
three firefighters were killed responding to a blaze in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials had not determined the exact cause of the blaze,
but said they suspected that an electric heat pump in the apartment
may have shorted out.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ three women and one man living in apartments on
floors above the fire _ were probably trapped in what Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen described as ``a blast of heat and
smoke that went up the stairway like a chimney.'' The victims were
found in a stairwell on the 27th and 29th floors, officials said.
The man was identified as Maitiu Breathnach, 32. Officials had not
yet been able to identify the dead women.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal circumstances, Von Essen said, were similar to those
that led to the deaths of the three firefighters last Friday. In
that case, the firefighters died when a fireball engulfed them as
they entered the narrow hallway of the burning Brooklyn building.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start to move in, the fire comes out _ it roars out,
it vents itself up through the stairwells, then out the building,''
Van Essen said. ``And if these people were coming down or were
trying to get down below the fire, they could have gotten caught in
that blast of smoke and heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-alarm fire was reported shortly before 10 a.m. at South
Park Towers, a 51-story building at 124 West 60th Street with 542
apartments on the upper floors and medical and commercial offices
on the lower 10 floors.
</P>
<P>
   As white ashy smoke poured from the window of the Culkin
apartment, on the southeast corner of the building, residents of
other apartments above, below and on the other side ran onto their
balconies waving and shouting for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Culkin family escaped without injury.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 firefighters and fire trucks from 48 separate
companies arrived on the scene. Nine firefighters were injured,
most with neck, back and shoulder pain. Two were in stable
condition at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where they were
treated for burns on their faces and necks.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the blaze started in apartments
19D and 19E, separate units that had had been combined into one
apartment. They said they suspected that an electric heat pump,part
of a heating unit mounted on the wall of each apartment, may have
shorted out.
</P>
<P>
   The unit from the scorched and gutted apartment was removed and
will be sent to electrical engineering consultants for study, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one witness, observing the fast-spreading fire from an
adjacent building, said he saw a Christmas tree on fire inside the
apartment. The witness, Joe Libretti, an ironworker at a building
under construction at 2 Columbus Circle, said he looked over to
South Park Towers from his perch on the 15th floor at about 9:45
a.m. and saw the window of the 19th-floor apartment blast open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a pop _ it cracked it and it popped,'' Libretti
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the apartment, he added, he and his co-workers saw a
Christmas tree burning. The fire was so intense, Libretti said,
that the window frame of the apartment melted as the fire ``spread
like a wild cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Culkin's mother, Patricia Bentrup, lived in the apartment, as
did at least three of Culkin's younger brothers, according to
neighbors. One of the brothers, Kieran, has also appeared in films,
including ``Father of the Bride 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Macaulay Culkin, who gained fame with his lead role in the film
``Home Alone,'' lives separately from the family. Michele Bega, his
publicist, said, ``The Culkins are fine, but saddened for those who
perished in the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bega said she had no information on the family's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they saw Mrs. Bentrup and some of the children,
several of whom attend acting classes at the nearby Professional
Children's School, in the building lobby, wrapped in blankets,
shortly after the fire alarm sounded.

THE REAL GIFT OF CHRISTMAS IS BORN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   this, I am sitting in the house in which I grew up, the house
where I spent the first 22 Christmases of my life.
</P>
<P>
   And I am thinking about gifts.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't in a while, at least not in this fashion. As you grow
older, the old saw about it being better to give than receive rings
more and more true. As an adult, you're more concerned about
whether your wife will actually wear that pair of electric-blue
shoes you got her than you are with what's in the packages under
the tree with your name on them.
</P>
<P>
   But just lately I have been doing a mental rewind, trying to
remember the best gifts that I saw waiting as I trotted down the
stairs as a child, the tree in the sun porch visible from the
landing, my Christmas radar cranked up into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The electric-football game was a big hit, as I recall. The
electric-train set was also a winner, as were the fire engine and
the G.I. Joe and the toy saxophone. Sure wish we'd hung on to the
Rock 'Em-Sock 'Em Robots; they're supposedly worth a fortune today.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other gifts came and went _ played with, broken and
discarded before they made much of an impression. I doubt I'll ever
be able to dredge them up from my memory. &QL; 
FADING MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   I grew up the youngest of five children, the baby brother. For
much of my life I saw Christmas from that perspective. I was the
first to volunteer to get out the box of tree decorations from the
closet, the last to tire of hanging stockings on the mantel, the
only remaining holdout when it came time to drop whatever you were
doing and sit down to watch ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even I started to wear down a bit as I grew older. There was
magic in those gifts I unwrapped as a kid. Later in life, they grew
more serviceable, more practical. Yes, I'm always happy to receive
underwear, but it doesn't make me giddy the way a Monkees talking
hand puppet did. Can't be helped. Everyone grows up sometime, which
is not necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change a little when my siblings started having
children. On trips home for the holidays, I loved reading ``A Visit
From St. Nicholas'' to my nieces before they went to bed Christmas
Eve; I loved lending Santa a hand with toys that needed to be
assembled after they drifted off. Still, nice as it was, something
was missing.
</P>
<P>
   A BOY'S LIFE II But this year, my perspective has taken a nice
little jaunt in the Way-Back Machine. That's because this is the
first Christmas I'll spend with my own child. She is too young to
remember anything that goes on here, of course, but that hasn't
made the holiday any less festive for me. Despite her tiny status,
we have put her through many of the holiday paces, and it's been
wonderful. Seeing the holiday through her eyes has made me a kid
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' suddenly packed all its old power
_ Linus' holiday-saving soliloquy once again brought a tear to my
eye. I'm paying more attention to TV toy commercials. The mere
jingle of a sleigh bell is enough to make me break into an off-key
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran parents tell me it only gets better. Hard to imagine,
but I'll happily take them at their word. I'm enjoying this
newfound innocence and wonder too much to doubt them.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about those gifts. I know they aren't what Christmas is
really about (ask Linus). Still, gifts have been on my mind lately.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this Christmas Eve, I'll read about the night
before Christmas to my own daughter for the first time. With luck,
she'll nod off shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, I'll gather up the greatest gift I've ever
gotten _ the greatest gift I'll ever get _ and place her in her
crib for the night.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she sleeps through till Christmas. &QL;

U.S. STANDS FIRM IN CALLING FOR U.N. INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of international calls for changes in
the Iraqi weapons inspection program, the Clinton administration
said Wednesday that it would stick to its demand that Iraq allow
strict U.N. inspections to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Pentagon ordered a withdrawal of some of the U.S.
forces sent to the Persian Gulf, National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said in a speech that the United States would continue to
work to contain the regime of Saddam Hussein. He said that
Washington stood ready to use force again to stop Baghdad from
developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and he demanded
that economic sanctions remain in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's not some method of verifying compliance, then we
cannot envision there being any form of sanctions relief,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The strategy we can and will pursue is to
contain Saddam in the short and medium term, by force if necessary,
and to work toward a new government over the long term. The goal of
containment is to prevent Saddam from rebuilding his deadly weapons
and from threatening his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Berger spoke, a former concealment expert with the
U.N. Special Commission, Scott Ritter, said in an interview that
the United States and Britain relied on obsolete intelligence in
directing their bombing campaigns against Iraq's weapons-related
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no doubt that we bombed a lot of empty
buildings,'' said Ritter, who resigned from the Special Commission
in August in disgust at U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis had been prepared for a military strike more than a
month ago, when President Clinton called off a bombing raid at the
last minute, and so had moved much of its most critical
weapons-related equipment and infrastructure long before last
week's air raids, Ritter said. ``I can tell you that the U.S.
intelligence is not very good on this stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ritter's statements were echoed by a current Unscom inspector,
Rod Barton, a microbiologist whose Op-Ed article in The New York
Times on Wednesday was critical of the Clinton administration's
Iraq policies. He wrote that the ``damage done to Iraq's
weapon-making ability was probably marginal.'' Iraq, he wrote, has
a well-honed ability to move and hide elements of its weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the face of such criticism _ in addition to renewed
pressure from France, Russia and other nations for a diplomatic
compromise between the United Nations and Iraq _ Berger's speech
was intended to make it clear that Washington is not going to ease
up on Baghdad, a White House official stressed. ``The message is we
are going to stay engaged in containing Saddam, and loosening the
sanctions regime is not going to happen,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the United States would oppose any efforts to weaken
Unscom's authority to inspect and monitor Iraq's weapons programs,
while also rejecting suggestions that the U.N. Security Council
make it easier for Iraq to end years of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not reward Iraqi intransigence with new watered-down
monitoring mechanisms designed to meet Iraq's demands,'' he said.
``We don't believe that we ought to lower the bar. We don't believe
we ought to dumb down the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger also observed that the bombing campaign was not designed
to eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, or to oust him
from power. Instead, the operation had less ambitious goals _ to
degrade his weapons programs, and diminish his ability to control
his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation that ended on Saturday inflicted substantial
damage on Saddam's weapons-of-mass-destruction programs and on his
military capability to threaten his neighbors,'' Berger said.
``That does not mean the threat is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States is moving to unwind the large
military force it had built up in the region in recent weeks,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. troops in the gulf region is scheduled to be
reduced from more than 29,000 to 21,000 to 22,000.

ONLY CELTICS AND SPURS MAKE THEIR FINANCES PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association is like a chain of 29
franchised stores arrayed strategically nationwide, each catering
to a different market, each hoping to sell out its inventory of
seats. The chain's employees earn unusually high salaries, but, in
turn, the 29 outlets can charge steep prices to watch their
costumed workers perform in glitzy arenas or on television.
</P>
<P>
   But the nearly six-month-old lockout has altered the chain's
business. The stores are closed, the employees are not being paid
and advance ticket revenues must be refunded on a prorated basis
each month. The only bright spot for team finances is the combined
$465 million being paid by NBC and Turner Sports, the league's
national television partners, even if the season is shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   The financial health of the NBA's teams has been at the crux of
the league's negotiating stance as it presses for something
resembling cost certainty. The NBA has claimed financial distress
for some of its franchises and seeks relief in a restructured
contract with the players. But in an industry generating $2 billion
annually, and with most team finances unavailable to the public, it
is difficult to discern exactly where the problems are.
</P>
<P>
   The league and the players union disagree on how many teams are
losing money, but only two teams, the Boston Celtics and the San
Antonio Spurs, make their finances public. The Celtics are a public
company and the privately owned Spurs released their statement in a
so-far-unsuccessful bid to get city government financing for a new
arena to replace the five-year-old Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Celtics missed the playoffs under coach Rick
Pitino but still earned $12.3 million on revenues of $75.7 million.
Sparked by the return of center David Robinson and the addition of
the rookie Tim Duncan, the Spurs returned to the playoffs, but lost
$1.8 million on revenues of $65.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without the playoff revenue, the Spurs' loss would have been
$3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest difference in the teams' revenues was derived from
ticket sales: The Celtics collected $39.1 million (which may
include luxury-suite income, but the statement is not explicit)
compared with the Spurs' $24.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' and Celtics' figures are normal for NBA teams _
greater than unsuccessful teams with lower payrolls like the Los
Angeles Clippers, but less than what the Chicago Bulls reap and
spend, several sports finance experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine estimated the Bulls' 1997-98 revenues at $112.2
million and operating profit at $8.6 million, while the Knicks made
$18.3 million on $109.7 million in revenues. The Clippers took in
$39.3 million, but lost $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics are a typical big-market team, but they're just
another tenant in an arena, and the Spurs are similar, in a small
market,'' said Michael Ozanian, statistics editor of Forbes
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Celtics and the Spurs, neither owns the arena
they play in. Teams like the Bulls, Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers,
Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards and Portland Trail Blazers have
the advantages of earning revenues from other events like hockey
and circuses, while paying no rent to a city or county.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, a lot of revenue is tied to paying off debt service
to build the arena, and the other events were supposed to be
gravy,'' Ozanian said. ``Someone like Abe Pollin has a lot of debt,
and what was gravy isn't the case now.'' Pollin owns the year-old
MCI Center, the Wizards and the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and the 76ers have the added edge in also being part
of the same company that carries their games on cable television.
The companies are now losing out by not being able to sell
lucrative commercial advertising to their teams' games.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics reported TV and radio revenues of $28 million, $11.4
million from NBC. The rest came from Turner Sports, and local radio
and TV deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs received $14.7 million from NBC and Turner, and $18.7
million more from local media rights and arena advertising, the
latter an unusually steep figure for a team in one of the league's
smallest markets that also plays in an arena without a corporate
name attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Celtics did not itemize what they received from
royalties from the national licensing that they split with all
other teams, the Spurs revealed their share to be $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who receive 80 percent of the revenues from the
city-owned Alamodome's luxury suites and club seats, reaped about
$2 million from that lucrative area. Suite revenues at the Fleet
Center in Boston are divided among the Celtics, the Bruins and debt
payments; the Celtics may have included that income in ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   For both teams, the largest expense is salaries. The Celtics
reported $43 million in total basketball expenses, most of which is
paid to their players; the Spurs' reported a $34.9 million payroll,
led by the $12.4 million paid to Robinson.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But a comparison of the Celtics and the Spurs presents an
anomaly. While Boston is the sixth-largest market, three times
larger than San Antonio, the Spurs' $67.7 million in expenses is
greater than the Celtics' $61.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind, whether it's a small market or a big one, teams
are competing in the same market for players,'' said Paul Much,
managing director of Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment
banking firm in Chicago. ``And while big-market teams usually have
bigger revenues, they usually have higher expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the players are not getting paid during the lockout,
coaches, executives and other employees will continue to be. To cut
down expenses, teams will almost certainly lay off workers if the
season is canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics must pay one unusually high salary during the
lockout _ Pitino's. Even if Pitino doesn't coach a game this
season, his contract to be coach, president and director of
basketball operations calls for annual salaries of $6.75 million
through May 6, 2003, and $2 million annually through 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The team will also keep paying Red Auerbach, its former coach
and general manager. Now a consultant, Auerbach receives $250,000 a
year for life; he got bonuses of $500,000, $600,000 and $100,000 in
each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although all teams will have to pay ongoing expenses if the
season is canceled, the Celtics and the Spurs won't have to pay
rent to their landlords. The Celtics' Fleet Center lease requires
no rent payments, while the Spurs' payment of $5,000 a game is not
required if the team doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle SuperSonics and the Golden State Warriors are in
rent disputes at the Key Arena and the New Arena in Oakland,
Calif., respectively, and disagree over whether their leases
require them to pay rent even if they don't play.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Seattle may lose $4.8 million if the NBA cancels the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go to arbitration, but after Jan. 1, we'll sit down
and try to negotiate,'' said Sue Donaldson, the Seattle City
Council president. ``We feel the team has an obligation to pay,
whether they play games or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors' quarterly rent of $375,000, and other payments,
are needed to repay the debt incurred by the county for $100
million in arena renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The team and Alameda County will go to arbitration next month to
settle their dispute, said Kyle Spencer, a Warriors spokesman, over
what the team thinks is a lease clause that absolves it from paying
rent during a work stoppage.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
(af) 
 By VINCENT CANBY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Parade'' is a big complex musical that looks as if it were
just starting a long out-of-town tour designed to get things right
before opening on Broadway. The cast is able, the staging is smooth
and the scenery moves on and off without threatening the actors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Parade'' is without life. It plays as if it were still a
collection of notes for a show that has yet to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Parade'' isn't in New Haven, Minneapolis,
Baltimore or Toronto. The production, presented by Lincoln Center
Theater in association with the now-bankrupt Livent Inc., is at the
end of the line: in New York, onstage at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong, and at what point did that happen?
</P>
<P>
   The show's provenance is impressive. The director is Harold
Prince, who has directed more innovative Broadway musicals than
anybody except maybe his mentor, George Abbott. Alfred Uhry
(``Driving Miss Daisy'') wrote the book, and though Jason Robert
Brown, the composer and lyricist, is here making his Broadway
debut, he was picked by Prince, who should recognize talent when he
hears it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is also promising: the true and terrible story of Leo
Frank, the Brooklyn-born, middle-class Jewish businessman, the
supervisor of a pencil factory in Atlanta, who in 1913 was tried
and convicted for the murder of one of his employees, a 13-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was so dubiously conducted, and brought into the open
so much virulent anti-Semitism, that it became something of a cause
celebre in the rest of the country. In 1915, shortly after Frank's
death sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment, he was
hauled out of a Georgia jail and lynched by a mob whose members
were never identified. Though there were persuasive theories as to
the identity of some killer other than Frank, the case was not
pursued and no one else ever charged.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Frank's arrest, conviction and murder is clearly a
very big subject, with all sorts of social and political
associations, but ``Parade'' goes through them as if checking off
the information for items listed in a curriculum vitae. Because the
show has no real doubt about Leo's innocence, or about the identity
of the probable killer (a roguish black man), the audience has
little to do except consider the show's stern cues. That is, to try
to weep for the innocent and to feel loathing for the opportunists
and bigots who rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for the production would have you believe that
``Parade'' is really a tragic love story about Leo, an uptight
fellow, initially as chilly and finicky in his personal life as he
is in business, and his wife, Lucille, who is vaguely characterized
as a Southern Jewish belle.
</P>
<P>
   Having been brought together in an arranged marriage, she longs
for romantic love, while he works long hours to support a woman
whom he wishes were more serious and would recognize her
Jewishness.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Parade,'' disaster so transforms Leo and Lucille
that at last he is able to express his feelings and she can mature
into proud, assertive womanhood, becoming her husband's most
effective defender.
</P>
<P>
   It is typical of ``Parade,'' however, that they seem to fall in
love only late in the show and offstage. This leads to the couple's
having one idyllic, somewhat unlikely picnic and conjugal visit at
the jail (onstage), before he is kidnapped and hanged.
</P>
<P>
   Uhry is Georgia-born and bred, as well as Jewish. He knows the
territory. Yet his book possesses none of the subtleties of
character and event that make ``Driving Miss Daisy'' such a wise
and substantial entertainment. Except for Leo and Lucille,
``Parade'' is populated by characters who could have been ordered
from a catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: the drunken newspaper reporter who rides the murder
story to fame and fortune; the governor who says, ``We gotta get to
the bottom of this one fast''; a fundamentalist newspaper publisher
who denies Jesus was a Jew, and the district attorney who coaches
perjured testimony from witnesses, including the black man who he
suspects is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The DA's excuse for going after Leo: ``We don't need another
negra hanging from a tree.'' Suddenly, Jews take precedence over
blacks as lynching material.
</P>
<P>
   As if to acknowledge this new perspective on race relations in
the South, where, in spite of the fate of Leo Frank, the status of
Jews has never been comparable to that of blacks, the show inserts
a most peculiar number, ``A Rumblin' and a Rollin'.''
</P>
<P>
   A small group of blacks, including the probable murderer, sing
bitterly of white folks coming down South to protest Leo's trial
and conviction (though there is no evidence of any such invasion on
the stage). The point of the song: if the victim had been a black
girl, nobody would have cared.
</P>
<P>
   The number purposely evokes the freedom marches and voter
registration drives that would not come until the 1960s, when
hundreds of activists, many of them Jewish, invaded the South to
fight the good fight, some losing their lives in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the effect of the song in the context of ``Parade'' is
simply to reinforce the skepticism, held by some whites today but
seldom openly expressed, that blacks have never fully appreciated
the help they received from their kindly white Northern brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' has one short, splendid sequence (``Come Up to My
Office'') during the extended trial scene. As three young women are
testifying how Leo would spy on them, make them indecent proposals
and fondle them, the shy, tautly strung Leo suddenly jumps up from
his place at the defense table. He becomes the lewd, sweaty-palmed
pervert the girls have described, as he sings, dances and proudly
exults in the licentiousness they have talked about in such polite
euphemisms.
</P>
<P>
   This burst of theatrical fantasy comes like a flash of
lightning. It briefly lights up the show's murky landscape to allow
you to see all that ``Parade'' hasn't achieved so far, and won't
achieve again. Among other things, it also permits the audience to
acknowledge for the first time the dimensions of Brent Carver's
fine performance as Leo.
</P>
<P>
   You should remember Carver for his Tony-winning work as the
window dresser in Prince's ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' In
``Parade'' he is so disciplined, so effective as the buttoned-up
Leo that this glimpse into the character's raging psyche has the
force of a coup de theatre.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After that, the musical slips back into narrative conventions
and social confusion. The first act ends with Patricia Birch's
prettily choreographed hoedown in which the citizens of Atlanta
merrily celebrate Leo's conviction. If the show were working, the
end of the act would be ironic. As it is now, all that dancing just
looks ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's score has some pleasing melodies but his lyrics are
banal (I assume) by design in the way of commonplace speech. They
aren't easy to listen to. Mull over this plaint, sung by the
newspaper reporter before he comes upon Leo's story: ``You got a
kitten up a tree?/Well, come to me and I'll see/It makes it on the
front page!/The mayor's mother broke her toe?/They gotta know!/It's
the scandal of the age!'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Carver, the only actors to register with
distinctively realized performances are Carolee Carmello, who plays
Lucille and has a lovely voice, and Rufus Bonds Jr., who plays Jim
Conley, the janitor at the pencil factory, the man thought to be
the true killer.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds even survives one of the silliest chain gang scenes ever
put on a stage. The material holds everybody else in check. The
physical production is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   What was Prince thinking of in allowing ``Parade'' to be
produced in this condition? He believed in it, certainly, but
something happens in the course of long pre-production work,
readings, workshops and rehearsals, even to the pros. Collaborators
have a way of psyching one another up, as they should. At the same
time, they can become so isolated, so self-absorbed, so removed
from reality and so mired in tiny details that they begin to see
results not visible to the outsider.
</P>
<P>
   The show then opens, but it's too late. That mysterious,
pulsating entity they have been assembling turns out to be a
corpse. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kidman, briefly nude and much in shadow, and Iain Glen,
more boldly nude for a longer period of time (during which he turns
what could be a dangerous cartwheel), are the stars as well as the
entire cast of ``The Blue Room'' at the Cort Theater.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sam Mendes's Donmar Warehouse production, which
originated in London, of David Hare's briskly satiric comedy
adapted from Arthur Schnitzler's ``Reigen'' (``Roundelay''), best
known in this country as ``La Ronde'' for the exquisite 1950 French
film version directed by Max Ophuls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kidman and Glen each play five roles as they trace a sexual
relay race through 10 couplings: a whore seduces a cabdriver who
seduces an au pair girl who seduces a student who seduces a married
woman, and so on. Each seducer, in turn, is effectively betrayed by
the partner seduced. The sexual appetite is insatiable. Bleakness
follows bliss followed by another conquest. The round continues.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Not a great deal, but it's refreshing to
see the tall, coolly beautiful Ms. Kidman and the muscular,
chameleonlike Glen move with such invention and ease from one
distinct characterization to the next with the split-second timing
of, say, Everett Quinton. They are prettier than Quinton, but he's
funnier.
</P>
<P>
   It is also invigorating to behold the usually sober-sided Hare
(``Plenty,'' ``Racing Demon,'' ``Skylight,'' among others) having
what looks to have been a lot of fun. It is apparent that he can
write brutally sarcastic off-the-wall dialogue that brings to life
characters of questionable intellect and few moral scruples, who
reflect their times without presuming to analyze them. As a London
critic once wrote of Myra Hess in a wartime concert: the playwright
is in an unbuttoned mood.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hare's narrative is essentially the same as that of the
Ophuls film, ``The Blue Room'' is far more brusque and punishing in
its humor. Gone is the sophisticated Ophuls perspective, which is
expressed not only in the text. It is also evident in the contrast
between the rococo elegance of the Viennese decor and the blunt
sexual needs of its mannerly characters.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's characters exist in bright, cold, neon-lighted isolation,
but there is no doubt that the world's more grim realities are
never far away. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The characters in Paul Rudnick's newest comedy, ``The Most
Fabulous Story Ever Told,'' at New York Theater Workshop, are
searching for the meaning of life, and they are tired. They should
be: they have been searching since the creation of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Most Fabulous Story'' is ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' as it
might have played if Thornton Wilder had been writing from the
point of view not of Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus, but of two gay couples:
Adam and Steve and Jane and Mabel.
</P>
<P>
   The one-liners are nonstop and suitably skeptical. Sample:
``Angels are just the Prozac for poor people.'' Adam and Steve and
Jane and Mabel are tossed out of Eden, endure the Flood, tangle
with the Pharoah who adopted Moses (here named Brad) and, in one
way and another, arrive in New York in the time of AIDS, gay
marriages, gay parenting and public access television gurus.
</P>
<P>
   The impeccable production was directed by Christopher Ashley.
Alan Tudyk, Juan Carlos Hernandez, Becky Ann Baker and Kathryn
Meisle head the excellent cast. Also note Amy Sedaris, as an
unimpressed stage manager, and the scene-stealing Peter Bartlett,
who plays the fashion-conscious Pharoah, just one of his five
roles. Rudnick's second act goes on far too long, but he never
bores. ``The Most Fabulous Story'' is a rudely hilarious lark.

learning to trust her instincts as she improvises a bucolic

arranging seems as absurd as New Yorkers going to Tokyo for
rudeness seminars. But come they have, embracing and learning yet
another Western way. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

York City Police cadets attend graduation ceremonies where 1,798
officers were added to the ranks in 1996. The number of murders
reported in New York City has fallen to 601 so far this year,
putting the city on pace to end the year with fewer homicides than
in it had 1964. However the size of the department has grown from
25,897 in 1964, to nearly 40,000. (James Estrin/New York Times

 Mutual Fund Firm for Sale  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIFE, a Walnut Creek mutual fund company specializing in bank
stocks, is seeking to sell all or part of the firm to finance
expansion, a company official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stead, SIFE's chief investment officer and manager of
its $1.06 billion-asset SIFE Trust Fund, said he expects a sale to
take place by summer. He said SIFE has frequently been contacted by
potential buyers, but doesn't have an offer on the table now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue for us is that we need more capital,'' Stead
said. ``We would like to grow our business and add additional
mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   SIFE stands for Selected Investments in Financial Equities.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers estimated the closely held SIFE could fetch
as much as $50 million if it sold all the equity in the firm based
on its estimated $5 million in pretax income.
</P>
<P>
   SIFE could attract a mutual fund family that wanted to add a
financial sector fund to its menu, said Joe Hershberger, a New York
investment banker with the firm Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola and
Thornton, which specializes in the sale of investment management
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a robust market for mutual funds,'' Hershberger said.
``A lot of people are looking to expand the range of options for
their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers cautioned that SIFE's attractiveness to a
buyer is limited because the company manages just one equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Stead's track record is solid, he isn't the sort of
widely known star portfolio manager whose name would command a
premium in a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, SIFE Trust has averaged a 24.01
percent annual return, slightly below the 27.04 percent return of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. SIFE had been ahead of the S&AMP;P 500
until bank stocks fell hard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bloomberg News reported that SIFE had hired
the investment bank Paine Webber Inc. to find a buyer. Bloomberg
also reported that the Boston mutual fund group owned by Liberty
Mutual Life Insurance Co. bid unsuccessfully to buy SIFE.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Stead confirmed Paine Webber was
representing SIFE. He said the investment bank was hired because
``we were tired of having to react to bidders. We want to be in the
driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   SIFE would use proceeds of a sale to launch additional funds,
such as a global fund that would invest in both U.S. and foreign
financial institutions, Steads said.
</P>
<P>
   Stead said a condition of any sale would be that his team could
stay in place. His deputies include research director Scott Edgar
and analyst/trader Laurie Buntain.

 Citrus Hit Hard By Frost  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California citrus farmers have been slammed by two nights of
subfreezing temperatures, causing a preliminary $591 million in
agricultural damage.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were farmers in the central San Joaquin Valley,
where the lemon crop is nearly a total loss and the navel orange
crop is in serious jeopardy with yet another freezing night
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Orange grower Darwin Smith was philosophical yesterday even
though the unusual winter freeze had ruined his entire crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``With farming, you work your crop for a whole year,'' Smith
said as he assessed the damage on his 75-acre grove in Orland,
north of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's harvest time and all of a sudden Mother Nature puts
you out. It's like working for a whole year and not getting a
paycheck. (But) when you get snow in San Francisco, where that
hardly happens, that's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The freeze hit Fresno, Tulare and Kern counties early in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The state Agriculture Department said those counties reported
100 percent losses to lemon and grapefruit crops, while 50 to 70
percent of navel orange crops were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's tangerine and mandarin orange crops were
``devastated,'' according to the California Citrus Mutual, the
state's main citrus trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Lemons were the first to go because they have less
freeze-inhibiting sugars than oranges.
</P>
<P>
   But naval  &LR; navel oranges in trees on the more exposed sides of
groves were also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten worse as the hours go by,'' said Joel Nelson,
president of the trade group. ``We don't know what's left and
what's lost. It's not looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should start to see higher prices for the affected
fruits at supermarkets sometime after January 4, when fruit already
harvested begins to run out, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The damage in Ventura County, which accounts for 65 percent of
the state's lemons, and other southern California counties like
Glenn, San Bernardino and Riverside, will not be known until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers set up fans with heaters and were running water through
their fields in a desperate attempt to raise temperatures just
enough to avoid damage as the thermometer dropped into the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus crops generally can survive for about four hours below
freezing but Central Valley farmers have battled 10 hours of sub
25-degree temperatures, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy El Ni &LR; n &LR; o rains earlier this year delayed the citrus
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the fruits would have been picked as early as
mid-October, but this year's crop wasn't ripe enough for harvest
until Thanksgiving week, meaning only about 10 to 15 percent of the
fruit has been picked, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other crops such as strawberries, artichokes and lettuce were
not affected, &LR;  because they were dormant, already harvested or in
areas not hit by the freeze, said California Farm Bureau spokesman
Bob Krauter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So far, the damage isn't as severe as that from a cold snap in
1990 that sent temperatures dipping into the teens.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the 1990 freeze slammed into the state overnight,
while the current cold snap, although milder, has lasted longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a slow death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a farmer for 13 years, said he is resigned to the fact
that his crop and about 800 acres in surrounding Orland farms were
lost.
</P>
<P>
   He has crop insurance to cover the cost of planting and raising
the crop, but has yet to calculate the losses in sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cut into the oranges now and it's all ice,'' he said. ``In
a matter of weeks, they will all fall off to the ground and we will
start getting prepared for next year's crop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do any good to get depressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to be a farmer and I have to be able to take the good
years with the bad years. You have to be optimistic and think next
year will be better.''

SIMPLE GIFT-GIVING: VALUES, NOT PRICES; JOY, NOT STRESS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Erin Oates didn't buy any Christmas presents this
year. She doesn't expect to get any from Santa, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Ms. Oates, 40, a public-relations professional who
lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, is a Scrooge. Or that she was
too naughty to make Santa's list. She wants it this way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hauling a garbage bag full of gifts for her nephews
home to Mississippi this year, Ms. Oates will take a video camera.
Fresh from the pain of her grandmother's death at 91 earlier this
year, she and her brother plan to spend Christmas interviewing
their parents, 66 and 69, to capture the story of their lives and
their love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call myself a religious person,'' Ms. Oates said,
``but there's a beautiful, spiritual aspect of the season. When the
focus is all on what you're getting, that gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that you could tell from the crowds of shoppers on Madison
Avenue, or even the new studies pegging the average amount spent on
holiday gifts at nearly $1,000 per family, but Ms. Oates is part of
a growing though still small movement of people, in New York and
around the country, who have simplified their celebrations of
Christmas and Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it is about cutting back to save money and avoid debt.
For others, it is an environmentally conscious effort to reduce the
reams of wrapping paper clogging landfills. For many, it reflects a
deeper cultural shift, as they struggle to redefine the season not
as one of sales but of sharing, replacing stress with serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Gerken and her boyfriend, John Wodnick, high school
teachers who live in Montclair, N.J., spent last weekend making
ornaments out of pine cones with his family. Renee Fogarty, a
mother of two in Yorktown, organized people on her block to put a
basket of food, in secret, on the steps of the house of an elderly
neighbor each day this week. Virginia Peckham of Port Chester, made
books combining cartoons she drew of her stepgrandchildren with
funny things the children have said as gifts for their parents.
</P>
<P>
   At Debbie Steinke's family gathering in Queens on Christmas Eve,
each person plans, in lieu of gifts, to share a favorite holiday
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more fun, there's more time, and there's more
meaning,'' said Betsy Taylor, director of the Center for a New
American Dream in Takoma Park, Md., which distributed a brochure
about simplifying the holidays this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor has reduced the number of presents she gives her two
children, stopped gift giving among the adults and turned Christmas
dinner into potluck. The family has also established new traditions
for itself: having the youngsters decorate shoeboxes filled with
useful gifts to take to homeless shelters and creating a special
play for everyone to perform on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not one time been asked, `What am I going to get for
Christmas?''' Ms. Taylor said. ``But I have been asked 10 times,
`What's the play this year?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A poll commissioned by Ms. Taylor's group found that 44 percent
of Americans said they felt pressure to spend more than they could
afford during the holidays, and only 28 percent said the season
leaves them feeling joyful. Those polled said 1 of every 3 hours
during the holiday season was devoted to activities that made them
feel ``stressed or uncomfortable.'' Four out of five said they
would prefer a photo album of their childhood to a store-bought
gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation of self-storage units because we can no longer
fit in our houses all the stuff that we own,'' said Bill McKibben,
author of a new book, ``Hundred Dollar Holiday,'' which joins
``Simplify Your Christmas: 100 Ways to Reduce the Stress and
Recapture the Joy of the Holidays'' by Elaine St. James as
documents of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it started, we were very pious, and thought that it was
about the environment, what a waste of stuff and batteries and
things, and all this money should go to poor people,'' said
McKibben, 38, who lives in Johnsburg, in the Adirondacks. ``Really,
it was about the fact that too many people had come to dread the
approach of Christmas at least as much as we anticipated it. We
wanted to figure out how to make it more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the Alternative Gifts Catalog (www.altgifts.org), where
people can buy a pig for a farmer in Laos or a bicycle for an
orphan in Haiti, neither of which have to be stored in their
apartment. ``The rush to buy Christmas gifts is a kind of unholy
thing that we engage in every year,'' said Harriet Prichard,
founder of Alternative Gifts, which raised $970,000 for charities
around the world last year. ``This becomes really a self-sustaining
gift that multiplies.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the capital of commercialism, the quest for simplicity is
complicated. People are busy. Galley kitchens are not conducive to
homemade jam. And all those sparkling lights and shiny bows beckon
from store windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a little harder to do this in New York,'' Ms.
Taylor acknowledged. ``People from all over the world go to New
York to shop. Everywhere you step, you're bombarded with the
message: buy this, show your love through this gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Peckham's repeated attempts to start a ``simplicity
circle'' of people trying to downshift have fallen apart; next
year, she is moving to Maine. Linda Fingerson of the Upper East
Side is a member of such a support group, but said ``the degree to
which I've simplified anything is not very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's murder, especially in this season, when everything's out
there,'' said Naomi Kavish, an electrologist who lives on the Upper
West Side and has committed to cutting back, decreasing her debt
and saving for retirement. ``It's a lot of fun, but what happens is
you get caught up, and before you know it, you've spent hundreds of
dollars that you didn't intend to spend, so you spend the rest of
the year catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavish, 58, has always given her daughter, 21, a separate
gift for each of the eight nights of Hanukkah, plus one whopper at
the end. This year, she shopped only with cash so as not to exceed
her budget, avoided impulse buying by waiting a week between
spotting and buying gifts and cut the price tags on her daughter's
presents in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `There's not going to be Hanukkah,' then I said,
how can I take the holiday away from her?'' Ms. Kavish said. ``Last
year, it was two CD's. It was nuts. Now it's like, enough, one is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   People with young children find it more challenging to cut back.
But Julius Adams, who lives in Rego Park, Queens, said he buys his
sons small gifts, toys they can play with together. The family also
gives money to the children's library at their synagogue, where the
boys spend a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, simplification is not you get rid of everything; it's
scaling down and deciding what's important,'' said Adams, a
consultant who works at home. ``To me, it's if you're much calmer
about your life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ms. Fogarty puts ``Recycled gifts only'' on her boys'
birthday invitations. And why Claire Mayer, 68, of Morristown,
N.J., is giving her son a quart of homemade soup each week for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Reine says, he has time to select thoughtful gifts instead
of grabbing items at the last minute. He ordered 200 copies of the
Center for a New American Dream's brochure ``Simplify the
Holidays'' to hand out in his neighborhood.

 &HT;    Adversity can't keep Southern U. from bowl
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was supposed to be easy for Pete Richardson and his
Southern University Jaguars this season. Even in the Southwestern
Athletic Conference 1998 media guide, one headline read, ``Loaded
SU Team Has Manpower to Retain Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Jaguars did repeat as SWAC champions. But the road
back to Atlanta and a berth in the Heritage Bowl has been anything
but easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the most challenging season since I've been at
Southern University,'' said Richardson, who took the job at the
school in Baton Rouge, La., in 1993 and promptly led the team to 11
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem came during spring drills. All-SWAC running
back Steve Wofford broke his foot, and the effects of the fracture
lingered into the season.
</P>
<P>
   After a season-opening loss to Northwestern (La.) State, junior
quarterback Marcus Jacoby, a two-year starter, quit the team. Days
earlier, Richardson's decision to fire receivers coach Oscar
Williams had been met with varying degrees of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the team could adjust to senior Sam George at
quarterback, injuries began to cripple the offensive line. In the
eighth game, Southern faced Alcorn State, with Florida A&AMP;M, Texas
Southern and Grambling coming up.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alcorn game, George went down with a severe ankle injury
and missed the better part of two games. Punter Matt Bushart
injured a knee, limiting his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his team's trials, Richardson has steered it back to
the Heritage Bowl for the third year in a row, and for the fifth
time since he became coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been inconsistent on both sides of the ball, and that
has mainly been because of injuries,'' Richardson said. ``But we've
found a way to win somehow. We've had some people step up and make
some plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wofford, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound senior who rushed for 1,274
yards last season, is one Jaguar who has played well. Despite being
slowed by the broken foot, he has played in 10 games and gained 996
yards. And when he was healthy, George, who has thrown for 1,661
yards and 17 touchdowns, was effective. The 5-8, 165-pounder, who
backed up Jacoby, probably will start Saturday instead of Troy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, All-SWAC junior linebackers Channing Warner (80
tackles) and Endrick Claiborne (66 tackles) and senior safety
Jackie Mitchell (61 hits) have led the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams have 11-game schedules. We have 11 _ with the
Heritage Bowl down there at the bottom,'' Richardson said. ``It's
what we shoot for every year.

 NEW YORK COURT REDUCES LEGAL FEES IN DEATH PENALTY CASES  (dw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an action long sought by Gov. George E. Pataki and other
proponents of the death penalty, New York state's highest court
Wednesday sharply reduced the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers
who represent poor defendants in capital murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals did not explain why it was ordering the
reductions. But Pataki and many state lawmakers who support the
death penalty have been pushing for a cut in the fees, contending
that they were higher than in other states and that the defense
costs in the state's capital murder trials had been too high.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, many academic experts on capital punishment and
even some district attorneys have been lobbying to maintain the
fees. They said that lowering them would make it less likely that
the most skilled defense lawyers would accept death penalty cases,
and that the overall quality of the defense in capital cases would
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment was reinstated in New York three years ago.
So far, 31 defendants have been indicted on first-degree murder
charges and formally notified that prosecutors would seek the death
penalty in their cases. Six have gone to trial, and two have been
sentenced to die. Nearly all the other cases were settled through
plea bargains or are awaiting trial. One defendant killed himself
before his case could come to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Capital defendants who cannot afford to hire a lawyer _ and the
vast majority cannot _ are represented by lawyers from the Capital
Defender Office, which was created by the legislature, by local
public defenders or by private lawyers appointed by the courts. The
reduction in fees applies only to court-appointed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals, which by law determines rates for capital
cases, in 1996 set the fee at $175 an hour for a lead counsel and
at $150 an hour for an associate counsel. In reducing the fees, the
court also created a two-tiered system. It provides one rate for
lawyers while they represent defendants charged with first-degree
murder, and a higher rate once those defendants have been formally
notified that prosecutors will seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A lead lawyer will now be paid $125 an hour for legal work, a
reduction of 29 percent, after a district attorney has filed what
lawyers call a ``death notice.'' The fee for a lead lawyer will be
$100 an hour for representing a murder suspect before a
death-penalty notice is filed.
</P>
<P>
   The fee for an associate counsel will be $100 an hour after a
death notice is filed, a reduction of 33 percent. The associate
counsel's fees for work prior to a death notice will be $75 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Dale M. Volker, a Republican from Depew, outside
Buffalo, who led the effort to reinstate the death penalty in New
York for two decades, has lobbied strongly for a reduction in
defense lawyers' fees. Volker did not return calls seeking comment,
but he made clear his position in an interview two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attorneys in New York are getting more money than any
attorneys in the country in capital cases, and we need to put some
brakes on it,'' Volker said. ``I believe we should give adequate
compensation to lawyers who represent defendants in capital cases.
But there isn't a doubt that there has been some padding here by
attorneys, that they are trying to say, `The death penalty is too
expensive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed lawyers in federal capital cases receive $125 an
hour. In other states, fees range from $150 an hour in California
to $20 an hour in Alabama, according to data provided by the Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and some district attorneys said capital cases
were more complicated, time-consuming and expensive than typical
criminal cases. They say lower fees might prevent the best lawyers
from representing capital defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to create a crisis in the death penalty where
none existed.'' said Jonathan E. Gradess, executive director of the
New York State Defenders Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Court of Appeals struck down as unconstitutional
most of the plea bargaining provisions in New York's death penalty
law. It is likely that plea bargains will now be harder to obtain
and that more capital cases will go to trial. ``There is now a
greater need for experienced counsel,'' Gradess said. ``They turn
around and cut the fee.''

`MIGHTY JOE' YOUNG AT HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This pleasant, undemanding remake of ``Mighty Joe
Young'' plays like ``Free Willy'' with fur.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the 1949 kiddie favorite gives the
giant-ape-on-the-loose-in-L.A. story line an eco-conscious gloss.
This time, the 15-foot gorilla isn't shipped over from his African
homeland to headline a cheap vaudeville show; he's shipped over to
be the star attraction at a nature conservancy park. It's not
irresponsible drunks but evil poachers (Rade Sherbedgia _ who used
to call himself Serbedzija _ and Peter Firth) who get Big Joe all
riled-up and loose on Hollywood Boulevard this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is the compassionate white hunter/zoologist and
Charlize Theron is the beautiful white jungle girl who are Joe's
best friends. She and Joe both lost their mothers when they were
little primates _ courtesy of those same evil poachers, in a
sequence that owes a lot to Spielberg's ``The Lost World'' _ and
their bond, as fundamentally hokey as it may be, is genuinely
touching.
</P>
<P>
   Joe himself is a pretty cuddly creation. Slicker than the
stop-motion puppet created in 1949 by Willis O'Brien and Ray
Harryhausen (the latter, along with original ``Joe'' heroine Terry
Moore, makes a nice little cameo appearance in the new movie), the
new 2,000-pound gorilla is a state-of-the-art creation. Designed by
five-time Oscar winner Rick Baker, who has excelled at the hairy
thing in the likes of ``Greystoke'' and ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
the new Joe is a seamlessly expressive blend of animatronics,
computer graphics and guys in monkey suits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in the first film, it's impossible to believe that
this lovable lumberer actually frightens the citizens of Los
Angeles while he avoids a small army of cops. Unlike O'Brien's more
indelible creation King Kong, Joe has never generated the tragedy
and terror that his big brother unleashed. He still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Ron Underwood, who made ``City Slickers.'' He
does his best to prevent this thoroughly Disneyfied remake from
seeming more silly than it is. Of course, it wouldn't be ``Mighty
Joe Young'' if it wasn't goofy, so it's just as well that Underwood
didn't succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Kids should be enchanted and amused, and that's all this junior
varsity film fable should ever aspire to anyway.

MINIMED SHARES RISE ON HEARING NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of MiniMed Inc. continued to sizzle
Wednesday, surging more than 10 percent after regulators set a
hearing date for the company's breakthrough diabetes treatment
system.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gained $9.375 to $98.625 for its seventh record close
in the last nine sessions. The issue has gained 26 percent during
that period and 85 percent since early November as bullishness has
grown over its micro-sensor for monitoring glucose levels.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's gain was triggered by the announcement that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has set Feb. 26 for an FDA advisory
panel to vote on MiniMed's device, which provides doctors with
continuous readings of a patient's glucose level.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Wilmoth, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said
final FDA approval is likely to come within three months if the
panel endorses the MiniMed product for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement that the FDA has assigned a hearing date is a
light at the end of the tunnel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth noted that the device will give doctors a better idea of
how much insulin to prescribe for a diabetic. ``Currently, big
swings in glucose levels represent the challenge for physicians,''
she said. ``The system will give physicians much more information
about the patient than they've ever had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been impressed with the prospects for the device
because it has potentially widespread applications in the treatment
of diabetes. The current worldwide market for devices monitoring
glucose levels is estimated to be more than $3 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed has said it plans to first introduce the device,
described as ``minimally invasive'' for insertion in the abdominal
area, as a diagnostic tool. It will then introduce other
applications such as combining its insulin delivery pumps -- which
eliminate the need for daily injections -- with the monitoring
system to create what would be an artificial pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is very important,'' said Marc Davis, an
analyst with GS2 Securities. ``It would be very attractive for
those using the pumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm over MiniMed, which has about $100 million
in annual sales, has also been fueled by the growing possibility
that the Sylmar, Calif.-based company may attract a takeover offer.
Wilmoth said Wednesday's announcement makes that scenario slightly
more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of cardiac
pacemakers, announced in early November it would make a $30 million
investment in MiniMed. The stock was trading at $61 before that
announcement.

SPORTS COLUMN: A SEASON FOR CHEER AND TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1995, Gary Cavalli, an energetic marketing
maven in California, predicted that the United States was ready for
a women's professional basketball league. In October 1996 Cavalli
unveiled the American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   The next summer, the Women's National Basketball Association,
with ferocious backing from the NBA, launched its inaugural summer
campaign. From that instant the question became whether there was
enough interest and money for two women's league. On Tuesday the
verdict was delivered in cold, crushing fashion: the ABL announced
that it was declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations, effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave every ounce of energy and blood, sweat and tears to
keep it going,'' Cavalli said Wednesday from his office in San
Jose, Calif. ``We ran out of time and we ran out of money. I don't
know what the final judgment of all this is going to be. Maybe it's
that there is only room for one, and I'm not sure which one it
would have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictions of failure _ and the steady signs of it
for the last two and a half years _ no one was prepared for
Tuesday's announcement. Carolyn Young, the New England Blizzard
star and the ABL's second-leading scorer, was Christmas shopping
when she got the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband called me,'' she said. ``He said: `I've got some
bad news for you. The league has folded.' I told him, `You must be
kidding.' I didn't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   K.C. Jones, the coach of the Blizzard, was in his office
watching tape when he got the call. ``Wow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the scene at team headquarters Wednesday, when the
staff had to clear out, was the saddest thing he had seen in his
sports career. That career covers consecutive national basketball
championships at the University of San Francisco in 1955 and 1956;
eight consecutive NBA titles with the Boston Celtics; a gold medal
as a member of the 1956 U.S. Olympic team in Melbourne; two years
in the Army, where he played football; a brief fling with the L.A.
Rams, and, finally, NBA championships as head coach of the Celtics
in 1984 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones' history, you begin to grasp the magnitude of pain,
sorrow and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being sad, this was the biggest,'' Jones said.
``You're talking about people out of jobs. The whole league just
went down.''
</P>
<P>
   The consistent response from players and coaches was shock over
the league's collapse and the lack of warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked,'' said New England guard Jenn Rizzotti. ``I
never saw it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cavalli said there was abundant warning _ not of the place
and time, but certainly of the ABL's financial condition. ``We
never told them we were headed toward bankruptcy. But players have
been aware for six months that the situation was unstable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a players' advisory board meeting in August, we said we did
not have enough money to make it through the season. But we kept
holding out hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Could all of this have been avoided? Cavalli thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we were by ourselves we would have won,'' Cavalli
said. ``Maybe we could have made it in basketball season doing the
way we did it if we didn't have to battle the NBA. Or maybe they
are right in that the only way it works is if it's in the summer
and out of season _ I would hope that was not the case. But if it
is, that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to have happen here is that there's
women's professional basketball in the United States. As the wife
of one investor said, `I'm glad we tried.' That's how I feel: I'm
glad we tried.''
</P>
<P>
   They tried hard. Cavalli said he spoke with players in the
league about accepting a 5 percent pay cut. They would give the
money back to the league, which would purchase tickets for
underprivileged children. The league furnished players with forms
to fill out; 30 of 90 responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to organize a doubleheader with NBA players,'' he
said. ``We had picked out dates, and place. No network would pick
it up. I thought that was a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The rival WNBA has been conciliatory. Valerie Ackerman, the
president of the WNBA said in a statement: ``This is an unfortunate
setback for the women's sports movement. We applaud the great
efforts and passion of the ABL's players and all the league and
team personnel who labored so hard to start and sustain the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   For ABL players and coaches, all this is irrelevant. As Jones
said, everyone is in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bizarre,'' he said. ``Nothing to do, no games to
play, nobody to coach.'' &QL;

   EDITORIAL: A BAD LILCO DEAL GETS WORSE
 (dw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   As 1998 ends, Long Island residents can breathe easy about one
thing: They won't have William J. Catacosinos to worry about
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos, the former chairman of the Long Island Lighting
Co., or Lilco, became a figure of scorn on Long Island as his
company came to be known for high electric rates. A complicated
transaction, in which Lilco merged into the parent of Brooklyn
Union Gas while a state agency bought some of the company's assets,
was supposed to end the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it only intensified the furor. Catacosinos had a
contract whose generosity soon became infamous. Although the
essentials of his deal had been disclosed in regulatory filings, it
was not completely understood either by state officials or by those
of Keyspan Energy, the Brooklyn Union parent. The deal gave
Catacosinos $42 million in cash _ much of it provided under a
golden parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Such parachutes normally protect executives who lose their jobs.
But Catacosinos got the money even though he was staying on as
chairman and chief executive of the merged company. After
embarrassed state officials cried foul, he was forced out of the
new job, although he got to keep his office, along with a car and
driver, until July 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the final insult to shareholders, he has negotiated a
deal that will allow him to keep those perks for another year,
until July 31, 2000. The company will put up $25,000 to buy
furniture for him, and will pay rent on an office away from company
property. In return, he agreed not to have anything to do with any
effort to take over Keyspan.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the payments to Catacosinos came from Keyspan,
whose shareholders have seen the value of their investment fall
since the Lilco transaction was completed. It is they who have
suffered as a result of Catacosinos' greed and the poor job done by
officials from the state and Keyspan in negotiating terms of the
merger.

 &HT;    _ ``A Mountain We Will Climb'' 
A tribute to Laura Evans 
of Expedition Inspiration by 
songwriter Deborah Liv Johnson &HT;    
 &HT;     By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk to anyone who has beaten breast cancer and
you'll likely find it made that person healthier. It's the irony of
a life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any survivor will tell you it's the worst thing and the best
thing,'' said Karyn Blackmore-Hagy, 35, of Westlake Village, who
was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago. ``It's a wake-up
call. Cancer can definitely improve somebody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Better diets. Stronger workout regimens. And the ability to
seize opportunity before it slips away.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmore-Hagy recognized her opportunity following cancer
treatment at USC, where she heard an adventurer speak during a
seminar. The woman described how she and a team of 16 other
breast-cancer survivors scaled the highest peak in the Western
Hemisphere _ Argentina's 22,841-foot Mount Aconcagua.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great victory to reach the summit of this mountain,''
Blackmore-Hagy thought. ``It seemed to be a symbol of their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, conquering cancer and conquering a mountain have
significant parallels, as Blackmore-Hagy learned firsthand in
August, when she crested Mount Whitney _ at 14,494 feet, the
tallest point in the contiguous United States _ with a team lead by
the USC speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What occurred to me is had I not had this disease and survived
it, I would never have had this opportunity to be sitting on the
top of this incredible mountain looking at this incredible
scenery,'' said the mother of two boys who sells advertising.
``Before, I might have said, `Ah, forget it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Using the outdoors as a means to speed the physical and
psychological recovery from breast cancer treatment _ and to bring
about awareness and research funding for the disease _ is the
premise of two national organizations, Expedition Inspiration and
Casting for Recovery.
</P>
<P>
   While several community groups stage single-day outdoor events
and a range of athletic races are held to raise funds for cancer
cures, Expedition Inspiration and Casting for Recovery immerse
participants in outings that cover several days. The experience can
be a turning point in the their ``post-diagnosis'' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel stronger. They feel that the little problems
aren't so important. It really empowers them and makes them
understand that nothing is beyond their grasp,'' said Laura Evans,
founder and president of Ketchum, Idaho-based Expedition
Inspiration. ``They realize that if they can climb to the top of
this mountain _ something they weren't sure they could do or maybe
thought they couldn't do _ they can achieve any goal if they put
their hearts into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Himelfarb, a freelance writer and poet from Pacific
Palisades who had a lumpectomy and radiation treatment for breast
cancer in 1996, agreed. Beating cancer was the 58-year-old
four-time grandmother's mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a choice. You can wallow and talk about cancer and be
afraid that you're going to get it again,'' said Himelfarb, who
attempted Whitney with Evans but was forced to turn around at
12,500 feet after getting altitude sickness. ``Or you can move on
and say, `You know, if I can conquer this, boy, I can do anything,'
and that's basically my outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a former fashion designer, thought she might not climb
after she overcame the 15 percent chance of survival doctors gave
her when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990. But she
didn't stop hoping during her two-month hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single night I visualized my fists in the air, having
climbed one of the highest mountains in the world, and that dream
kept me going,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has led breast cancer survivors _ and many others
sympathetic to the cause _ on five climbs and 14 day-long trips,
most recently a hike through Paramount Ranch near Agoura Hills that
attracted more than 800 participants.
</P>
<P>
   The climb up Aconcagua alone raised $2 million for breast cancer
research and earned Evans and her team a trip to the White House.
``We do not raise money to climb; we climb to raise money,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time on the other side of the country, Gwenn
Perkins of Manchester, Vt., was starting another nonprofit
grassroots group with a tiny staff, Casting for Recover, to provide
fly-fishing opportunities for breast cancer survivors of any
cultural or financial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know why I fly-fish. I fly-fish because it is very relaxing
and peaceful and it gets my mind off things that are bothering
me,'' said Perkins, who has not had cancer but developed her
program after discovering that a doctor prescribed fly-fishing as
therapy for a breast cancer patient. ``I thought that if for only a
moment these women could get away from their diagnosis that it
would be a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by grants and donations, the program offers retreats at
no charge ``to women who spent so much money on treatment they
aren't well-off,'' said Perkins, a freelance fishing-school
instructor whose office is her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations are extended at the suggestion of doctors, hospitals
and support groups. Outside organizations interested in conducting
Casting for Recovery retreats must follow the casting methods and
psycho-social and nutritional guidelines mandated by internal
operating packets the group provides at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, 14 retreats have produced 100 graduates; the first
West Coast outing is slated for May in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For Maplewood, N.J., graduate Brigitta Neu, Casting for Recovery
offered a rare camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tears. Nobody minded, they just passed another
tissue. But there was also laughter, and laughter is the best
medicine,'' said Neu, who was given a 20 percent survival rate when
diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago. In September, while
fly-fishing for the first time, she landed the first fish of a
Casting for Recovery excursion in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you have the same fears, the same understanding,''
Neu explained. ``To have someone to lean on who has gone through
the same thing, feeling empathy, your strength is reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   From a medical standpoint, such bonding is critical, said Dr.
Benita Walton, a plastic surgeon specializing in breast
reconstruction in Janesville, Wis., who co-founded Casting for
Recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical treatment is only a start. Part of the healing
process is talking about it. It's a basis for emotional growth,''
said Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, others try to avoid using the big `C' word; they
tiptoe around it. It's uncomfortable. You don't know what to say,''
she said. ``But being in one of these groups, the subject is right
there. They really hash it out, like, `I haven't stood in front of
the mirror or in front of my husband, partly because I don't like
the way I look and I don't think my husband will like the way I
look.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows women to share a pretty devastating experience with
women who have been through the same thing. There is a certain
amount of patience and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   And, physically, the motion of fly-casting provides mobility to
the upper extremities that are compromised by cancer treatment, in
a setting that is more stimulating than a physical therapist's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' Walton said, ``these women are sick of going to the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton has her own metaphor on the subject of finding a cure for
cancer, as it relates to angling: ``To fish is to hope. You have to
believe that it is out there and that you can catch it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   How earnest and public-minded it sounded when tobacco company
executives warned early this year that the attempt to jack up
cigarette prices through the pending national tobacco bill would
inevitably lead to smuggling and a black market. No less than
Steven Goldstone, the chairman of RJR Nabisco, warned that it was
virtually impossible to stop a determined batch of smugglers, given
that 14 million cigarettes can fit into a single truck. Goldstone
called it ``irresponsible'' to ignore the smuggling that
neighboring countries had experienced when they raised cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it turns out that Goldstone assuredly was right about
the dangers of smuggling. The only problem was, he pointed his
finger in the wrong direction. This week a marketing subsidiary of
his own company pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a $15
million fine for actions that enabled others to smuggle cigarettes
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was hatched after the Canadian government raised
tobacco taxes in an effort to cut smoking. Those taxes applied only
to cigarettes sold in the Canadian market, not to exports. So
cigarettes were shipped from a Reynolds plant in Canada to the
United States where the guilty Reynolds subsidiary aided the filing
of false statements that they were to be shipped on to Russia and
Estonia, a maneuver that exempted them from taxes in both Canada
and the United States. In reality, the cigarettes were sold to
distributors in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary has admitted only to customs violations, not
smuggling. But in truth, says U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Maroney, the
subsidiary knew that the cigarettes were destined to be smuggled
back into Canada, in this case through an Indian reservation in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco says it ``very much regrets'' the episode and calls
its subsidiary's actions ``inconsistent with the way Reynolds does
business.'' It has closed the subsidiary and is taking steps to
prevent a recurrence. But the apologies seem a bit late. The
tobacco industry has long been accused of looking the other way
when it comes to smuggling. Now we know it is even worse. The shame
of this episode is that a subsidiary of America's second-largest
tobacco company actually joined the criminals.

   EDITORIAL: FIGHTING OFF THE FLYNT VIRUS
 (dw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's press secretary, strained the
holiday bonhomie in the White House press room this week when he
mentioned ``a news magazine'' preparing to publish sordid details
about Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``News magazine?'' a chorus of reporters howled, as Lockhart
smiled and amended his comment to simply ``magazine.'' He was
talking not about U.S. News but about Hustler, Larry Flynt's
monthly smut magazine. Nevertheless Lockhart's misstep, if that is
what it was, laid out a serious problem for today's journalists.
Far too many readers and viewers believe, wrongly, that Flynt's
sleaze empire is just another branch of the established media.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion is understandable given the big national story of
1998. Moreover, the First Amendment offers protections to all
varieties of the media, even Matt Drudge, who shovels raw gossip
onto the Internet. That does not mean, however, that Larry Flynt is
in the same profession as Ted Koppel. For starters, professional
journalists do not pay for the stories they get. Truth is hard
enough to find without the allure of dollars to encourage an
elaboration here, the shaving away of conflicting data there.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, who put an ad in The Washington Post offering up to $1
million for evidence of congressional adultery, has acknowledged
that he is actually paying for at least some of the dirt kicked up
by his offer. That means that Hustler's charges about congressional
sex ought to be given the same skeptical scrutiny as the pile of
documents, faxes and raw gossip that the nation's mainstream
journalists must sort through and check out each day as they search
for publishable material.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out news always has been a complicated and inexact art,
of course. The argument in earlier times was that any personal item
about a public figure must have something to do with the official's
job.
</P>
<P>
   Now this rule has spawned so many sub-arguments that sensational
publications or tabloid television can find the rationale to carry
almost anything. That is probably not going to change, given human
nature and the current environment. There is no way to eradicate
gossip. But that is no reason for the mainstream media to abandon
their standards or values. They must not give an inch on the
refusal to buy information.
</P>
<P>
   As for dealing with the political or policy impact of gossip,
each media organization must craft its own code, remembering that
the most trusted news outfits will be those that try hardest to
preserve the traditional journalistic values that the public still
trusts, even when distracted by gossip. Some days the most
important story a publication handles is the one it decides not to
run.

   EDITORIAL: THE LIMITS OF CHINA'S REFORM  (DW) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's leaders are running dissidents through a revolving
door. This week three leading democracy activists, Xu Wenli, Wang
Youcai and Qin Yongmin, were given 11- or 12-year sentences for
subversion after sham trials lasting only a few hours each.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men had no lawyers. But the government tried to quiet
international criticism by releasing another dissident, Liu
Nianchun, into exile in the United States after serving 30 months
in a labor camp. After a few signs of limited political
liberalization this year, China's Communist leaders are reverting
back to form.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed repression is a rebuff to President Clinton's call
for greater freedom in China, and the White House properly
condemned the actions this week. But in general Washington has not
pursued human rights issues with sufficient vigor, with the
exception of Clinton's visit to Beijing last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by China's importance as a trading partner and the
failure of a more adversarial policy to win many concessions, the
Clinton Administration has muted its criticism of China and treated
human rights as one part of a complex relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has not been without serious costs. Washington
chose to withdraw its usual support for a resolution censuring
China before a United Nations human rights panel. The
Administration also has refrained from harsh criticism of China's
role in Pakistan's nuclear program and its sale of sensitive
missile technology to Iran. It has not pressed China hard enough on
possible attempts to influence the American elections through
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   China has made important economic reforms under President Jiang
Zemin. It has also made its legal system somewhat fairer and more
predictable, progress that needs continued encouragement. Earlier
this year China did permit a narrow political opening. A debate
arose in small-circulation journals on such issues as individual
rights and whether village elections should be expanded. In
October, China signed the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But then it began its crackdown on democracy groups, imprisoning
men like Xu Wenli, who was only trying to hold China to its own
laws and the international treaties it had signed.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders clearly fear that any political opening might
imperil Communist Party rule. They should know that China can never
achieve the world respect its leaders crave if they block all
political expression. Washington, for its part, must return to
speaking honestly and frequently about China's human rights abuses.

ANATOLY RYBAKOV, 87, WRITER LINKED TO GLASNOST'S DAWN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anatoly Rybakov, whose long-suppressed novel about
the Stalinist era, ``Children of the Arbat,'' finally appeared in
1987 to affirm the reality of glasnost, died Wednesday at his home
in Manhattan. He was 87 and also had a home in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tatyana Rybakova, said he died in his sleep. He had
heart surgery last summer and recently suffered a bout of
bronchitis, but two days before his death he had attended a party
for a visiting Russian democrat, Grigory Yavlinsky. His widow said
the author's remains would be cremated and his ashes returned to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1987, ``Druzhba Narodov,'' or ``Friendship of the
Peoples,'' one of the Soviet Union's so-called ``thick journals,''
published ``Children of the Arbat,'' the reaction inside and
outside the the nation was immediate and remarkable. In the Soviet
Union, the magazine's circulation, went from its normal run of
150,000 to 800,000. Abroad, the book's release sharply raised the
credibility of President Mikhail Gorbachev's talk of new thinking,
reform and openness.
</P>
<P>
   Using fictional characters in a historical setting, the book
described and evoked the Stalinist past, portraying the lives of
childhood friends from a Moscow neighborhood as they became
enmeshed in the terror of the 1930s, some as prisoners in Siberian
camps, others as apparatchiks compromised by opportunism. Stalin
was portrayed mostly through imagined interior monologues as
cunning, brutal and cynical.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the literary quality of the work that stimulated
such a wide response. Irving Howe reflected the views of most
critics when he called the work ``disappointing, lumbering and
uneven.'' He noted that it lacked ``the lyricism of Boris
Pasternak's `Dr. Zhivago,' the moral fire of `The First Circle,'
the intellectual audacity of Vasily Grossman's `Life and Fate.'''
Instead, Howe contended, ``What we have here is a novel that seems
made to order, decades in advance, for the Gorbachev moment: tell
more than anyone since Khrushchev about the time of terror, but
don't stray too far from the party's orthodoxies and avoid the
`delicate' problem of the relations between the terror and the
system. Boldness of presentation fades off into timidity of
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was precisely ``the boldness of presentation'' that made
``Children of the Arbat'' so singular. This was, after all, a book
that first appeared in the Soviet Union. It was not published in
some samizdat, or underground, venture and then reprinted abroad.
It had been written 20 years earlier, and twice before, in 1966 and
in 1978, it had been announced that it was to be serialized in
journals only to have those decisions countermanded by Communist
Party officials. When the book first appeared, the poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko declared, ``After this, it will be impossible to have
the same history books in our libraries and schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it was written not by a marginal dissident, but by a
writer who had been enormously well known throughout the Soviet
Union for his children's stories, which had been turned into films
and which four decades earlier had won him that imprimatur of
orthodoxy, the Stalin Prize.
</P>
<P>
   A short but stocky and powerful man, who had used his own
experiences as a gulag prisoner, truck driver, war hero and dance
instructor, in ``Children of the Arbat'' and its two sequels,
Rybakov was abashed by the criticism that related his work to that
of Pasternak and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. ``These are great
writers and I am not trying to equate myself with them,'' he said
in an interview in 1987. ``But their books were published across
the border, and mine was the first to be published in the Soviet
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote two novels that continued to trace the lives of
the scattered group of friends from the old Arbat neighborhood.
``Fear'' was published in 1992 and ``Dust and Ashes,'' which
concludes as the Soviet Army is turning the tide of battle in World
War II, was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rybakov continued to write until his death, while serving as a
leader of Russia's PEN Club. He divided his time between Moscow and
New York, saying that because of the nearly steady stream of people
eager to see him in Russia and enlist his support for their causes,
he found it easier to write in his Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Rybakov was born on Jan. 14, 1911, in Chenigov in what
is now Ukraine. His father, Naum, was an engineer. The family,
assimilated Jews, moved while Anatoly was still a child to the
Arbat district of Moscow, where he attended the Moscow Institute of
Railway Engineers. He was still in school when he was arrested in
1933 and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia. He once said
that as a committed Communist, ``I was very depressed after the
arrest for I had done nothing.'' He added: ``But I soon found out
from others that if you did nothing you only got three years. If I
had done something, they would have given me 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his first book, a work for children called ``Kortik''
(``The Dagger''), in 1948. A story of wartime heroism, it became
extremely popular and was made into a movie. Stalin is said to have
admired it, and in 1951, after having written several children's
books and a novel called ``The Drivers,'' Rybakov was awarded the
Stalin Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Rybakov's novel ``Heavy Sand'' appeared in the Russian
literary journal Oktyabr. It dealt with the plight of Ukrainian
Jews tortured and killed by the Nazis. Peter Lewis, writing in The
Times Literary Supplement, said the publication ``caused a
sensation in the Soviet Union,'' where ``Russian writers, while
pouring out material about the Patriotic War of 1941-45, have shied
away from the uniquely terrible Jewish experience of that time for
domestic political reasons (including Stalinist and post-Stalinist
anti-Semitism).''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons from earlier
marriages, Aleksandr and Aleksei.

HIGH SIERRA TREK SIMPLY SPECTACULAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRY WOOD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ It is situated in one of the most heavily
trafficked backcountry regions of the High Sierra, but Ediza Lake
and the serene landmarks that dot the 17{ miles taking trekkers to
it and back are largely lost on the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the more beautiful hikes that we have,'' said Mike
Morse, a backcountry ranger who serves in the Mammoth Ranger
District. ``It's pretty spectacular, and I would recommend that
anyone do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you regard yourself as an intermediate or advanced
backcountry wanderer who doesn't mind a few miles of off-trail
hiking, file this trip away in your must-do folder. It's a gem.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the rugged route in the Ansel Adams Wilderness
northwest of the Devils Postpile National Monument is known as the
Crossing. It also involves memorable visits to Shadow, Iceberg,
Cecile and Minaret lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In a relatively short distance, it takes hikers through some of
the most riveting Alpine scenery to be found in the Inyo National
Forest. In the route's upper reaches, one will likely encounter
climbers heading toward the jagged summits of the daunting Minarets
in the Sierra Nevada's Ritter Range. Banner Peak at 12,936 feet and
13,143-foot Mount Ritter serve as its stalwart sentinels.
</P>
<P>
   Well-conditioned hikers can cover the 17{ miles in two days.
Indulgent, exploration-minded visitors will want to allot at least
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Start at Agnew Meadows pack station (elevation: 8,335 feet). It
is found 3 miles below Minaret Summit on the road of the same name
that leads visitors northwest from Mammoth Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the urge to travel up the magnificent High Trail (also
the path of the Pacific Crest Trail) and instead set out on the
River Trail. In less than 2{ miles, after passing small Olaine Lake
(8,040 feet), head west at a trail junction that points toward
gorgeous Shadow Lake.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing a well-engineered footbridge, begin a steep,
sun-exposed march up a rocky, wearying course. A 700-foot climb
will culminate at Shadow Lake's shady east-shore outlet (8,737
feet), where anglers are routinely gathered in search of trout.
</P>
<P>
   Camping is not allowed near Shadow Lake as a means to protect
the intensely popular area, so proceed farther west along Shadow
Creek _ on the short distance of the trek that is the John Muir
Trail _ where signs indicate campsites.
</P>
<P>
   The next major destination is beautiful Ediza Lake (9,265 feet),
less than 2{ miles from Shadow Lake's west end along Shadow Creek
and 6{ miles from Agnew Meadows. Because of its fragility, camping
and campfires are not allowed along its shores.
</P>
<P>
   As trees become shrubs and the massive Minarets and its acres of
exposed granite loom before you, hop across Shadow Creek at Ediza's
outlet and stick to the lake's east bank.
</P>
<P>
   As the shore bends toward the Mount Ritter to the west, start
heading south and pick your own path. An indistinct footpath
exists, but it is fairly obvious that the rocky, sometimes icy
1{-mile route is one that closely parallels the outlet stream
tumbling down from 9,774-foot Iceberg Lake, the Crossing's next
whistle-stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you leave Ediza, there's not a real clear trail,'' Morse
said. ``It's not a maintained route that we can send trail crews in
to work on, but there are ducks (rocks arranged to flag a route)
you can follow. A lot of foot traffic has been through there over
the years, so that's beaten in a pretty good trail system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to get lost,'' he explained. ``You have the
Minarets on one side and Iceberg's right in front of you as you go
up from Ediza. If you have a topo map, you can pretty much figure
where you're going.''
</P>
<P>
   From this stark, beautifully sculpted basin south of Iceberg
Lake, scramble up more than 400 feet to reach 10,239-foot Cecile
Lake under imposing Clyde Minaret. Expect to find ice floes and
snow here even in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Along Cecile's eastern shore, begin selecting a track down to
Minaret Lake (9,793 feet). It is steep and potentially tricky, but
slow, deliberate steps should place discerning hikers on Minaret's
north shore safely.
</P>
<P>
   This off-piste ``crossing'' from Ediza Lake to Minaret Lake is
just about 3\ miles but will likely consume at least a half-day of
energy because of all the gawking and gingerly striding involved.
</P>
<P>
   Camping is permitted at Minaret Lake, so spend another night
here or walk the easy 7.8 miles to the Devils Postpile campground
(7,600 feet). The final 1.9 miles south from 8,150-foot Johnson
Lake is once again along the John Muir Trail.
</P>
<P>
   If you reach the campground and adjoining ranger station while
the shuttle bus is still running, ride it back to your starting
point at Agnew Meadows or up to Minaret Summit, where most visitors
leave their cars before tackling the Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced backpackers recommend making the journey late in the
hiking season, in September or October, to avoid lingering snows
from the previous winter. And less moisture on the ground means
fewer bugs. Dress warmly because the nights are cold, and check on
the weather to steer clear of early snowstorms.

STERN'S DEADLINE TO CANCEL SEASON IS JAN. 7
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Commissioner David Stern will recommend Jan. 7 that
the National Basketball Association owners cancel the entire season
if a a new collective bargaining agreement has not been reached by
then, a development that leaves two weeks for a resolution to the
league's costly and calamitous labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has scheduled a special board of governors meeting for
that date, at which the NBA's labor relations committee will submit
a report to representatives from the league's 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are where we are now on Jan. 7, David and I will
recommend to the board that we cancel the season,'' said deputy
commissioner Russ Granik. ``I expect there to be negotiations
before then. But if we don't get anywhere _ and there's no reason
to think otherwise right now _ we'll have done what none of us
thought was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA had not lost a game to work stoppage in its 52 years
before this season. Now, the players and owners are perilously
close to becoming the first league in professional sports history
to lose an entire season to labor strife. Already, the first three
months of the season has been lost and losses in player salaries
may exceed $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The day after they took out full-page ads in The Los Angeles
Times and USA Today to portray their side in the lockout, top
officials of the National Basketball Players Association declined
comment on the NBA's deadline. But the feeling among many players
was that at least they now have a date to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weeks ago we tried to get the league to establish a date, if
only to bring immediacy to the negotiations,'' said Danny Schayes,
a member of the union's negotiating committee. ``If anything, it
gives us a measuring stick when we have to get a deal. There's no
question, we now have to meet. We can't make a deal in our living
rooms. I hope this will spur activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the league nor the union is expected to resume talks
until after the Christmas holiday, possibly as early as Monday.
Union executive director Billy Hunter returned home to Oakland,
Calif., on Tuesday. Stern has been at his vacation home in Aspen,
Colo., since the weekend. Granik said that the two have spoken
every day, and that the decision to call the meeting rested with
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik have resisted requests to decide on a drop-dead
date, believing that if a deal were close to being consummated, a
deadline would serve no purpose than to apply undue pressure to the
process. But Wednesday they appeared to conclude that any agreement
signed after the first week of January may not be profitable enough
for the owners or legitimate enough to the fans to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we have to face up to the facts,'' Granik said,
when asked why a date was finally picked. ``We can't lose the
season without a board meeting. It just became obvious with how
things we're going. At least as of that date, we'll know where
we're headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcement Wednesday, Day No. 175 of the lockout
was proceeding like many others; no talks and no hope of an
immediate settlement. The last round of bargaining took place 11
days ago, a session that broke off after less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Granik have admitted that a deal could be hashed out
in 24 hours, but the union has been much more optimistic than the
league about actually having a season.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972,
including a 232-day strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series, it
has never lost an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League and the National Hockey League
played through both world wars and, like baseball, never lost an
entire season of competition to labor strife. In 1919, the Stanley
Cup playoffs were not completed due to a flu epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those players ever lost $1.1 billion in salaries,
the price tag for the players if the season is canceled. Patrick
Ewing has lost $6.1 million so far, nearly a third of his annual
salary of $18.5 million, currently the league's highest.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $300 million to $400 million in leaguewide
revenues would be lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the players' full-page ad, which began ``Setting the
Record Straight,'' did not do much to break the stalemate,
according to Granik.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows to me why we are exactly where we are,'' Granik said
of the ad, which contained charts, graphs and full explanations
about the players' positions. ``We're about ready to cancel the
season. To come out with that kind of rhetoric ... it almost seems
like the union wants to guarantee that we cancel the season.''

RECOVERING FROM INJURY MAKES ONE TAKE STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walking gingerly into my apartment after 10 days in the
hospital, one of the first things to greet me was my trusty
mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely look at it, hardly able to face the fact that it
would be several weeks before any attempt to ride it again. The
next day, however, I placed my hands on the handlebar... for as
long as my tender ribs would allow me.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to realize that I'm a very impatient patient. I don't
so much mind the pain as not being able to get right back out and
ride. Watching my fitness drain out of me like a bucket with a big
hole in the bottom wasn't much fun, either.
</P>
<P>
   Most adventurers rarely think about the consequences. I prefer
to think of it as selective denial, a defense mechanism of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting cycle. We participate in an activity
consciously ignoring the danger. Then, when we get hurt, we again
ignore the negatives in order to get back in the game. What makes
athletes able to focus on the positives?
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes seek the challenge of the activity; fear of injury
isn't really too relevant,'' said John Ernst of Thousand Oaks, a
sports psychologist and an active road cyclist and volleyball
player. ``People are consciously pushing themselves to that edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In my career as an athlete, I've had few injuries that have
sidelined me for more than a few days. But this latest injury,
which will keep me from riding my mountain bike aggressively _ and
sleeping comfortably _ for at least another month, has come at a
time in my life when I must seriously reflect on just how important
being active is to me.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking with several athletes who have endured long recovery
periods, there seems to be a common theme: It's a matter of keeping
a positive attitude, to ``take it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of recovery from injury, it's just another challenge
to overcome. The feeling that `I can do it' (is an overriding drive
in athletes),'' Ernst said. ``The limitations are frustrating and
they'll work to get past them, push themselves to get back. They
approach it as another part of their training, a new challenge to
work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers is a good example of the
athletic competition, pushing himself to come back from a serious
knee injury the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be very easy to sink into a game of wondering what could
have been done differently to avoid the injury. But the bottom line
is that there is nothing you can do except strive for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   If you are prepared and well-equipped, then you've done
everything you can do. Let's face it, you can get seriously messed
up just driving to work. The fact is, most of us live dangerous
lives just by being alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things my friend Robert said to me as I lay in
the emergency room after breaking some ribs and puncturing both
lungs was: ``Don't think about what you could have done. It's in
the past; there's nothing you can do about it. From now on you have
to think about getting better and know that you will.''
</P>
<P>
   I've come to the conclusion that practicing a positive outlook
carries over into all aspects of life. Achieving a goal, becoming
proficient at a sport or activity, allows us to grow our self-worth
and improve our self-esteem. In failure, as well as in triumph, one
must find success. As the saying goes, ``No experience is negative
unless you learn nothing from it.''
</P>
<P>
   My doctors tell me to be as active as possible, that broken ribs
don't take any longer to heal than other bones; they just hurt more
during the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of physical and psychological bonuses from
exercise,'' Ernst explained. ``Athletes are simply looking to
duplicate the feelings of well-being they get from exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sitting around is boring.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all I needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   First it was short walks around the neighborhood. Then a few
days on a stationary bike. Last week I actually got on a bike for a
short ride around the block. And for the last few days I've been
doing easy off-road rides.
</P>
<P>
   My senses are more alive than before I was injured, every
movement being monitored, some feeling like I'm doing them for the
first time. Trails that I've ridden dozens of times look more
pristine; sunsets appear more vibrant than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it hurts, it feels so good to be pedaling,
breathing hard and filling my lungs not just with oxygen, but with
a renewed joy of life. &QL;

 &HT;    Would-be `teacher of year' molested boys
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon and Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Friday, the day he was to receive
teacher of the year honors at Palm Beach Community College, a
horticulture instructor resigned after officials learned he lied on
his job application about being a convicted child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Weerts, 63, a former Catholic priest, was sentenced to
six years in an Illinois state prison in 1986 after pleading guilty
to three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving boys
between the ages of 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is investigating Weerts
after receiving a complaint that a young boy from New Mexico, who
was staying at Weerts' home, might have been abused, sheriff's Sgt.
Jim Stormes said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has returned home and charges are unlikely because an
interview the boy had with New Mexico authorities turned up no
evidence of a crime, Stormes said.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts, who taught at the Palm Beach Gardens campus, could not
be reached for comment. College officials said they believe he has
left the state.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his PBCC duties, Weerts, a suburban Palm Beach
Gardens resident, also taught a college-level class to students at
Jupiter High School. The district normally conducts background
checks on all employees, but relied on PBCC in this case because
Weerts was a college employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district does not employ individuals with criminal
backgrounds,'' said spokesman Nat Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the community college has not performed background
checks on its employees, accepting what is written on notarized
applications, said PBCC spokesman Robert Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this has occurred, we are putting that mechanism in
place to do that (background checks),'' Cole said. All employees _
present and future _ will likely face scrutiny, he said.
</P>
<P>
   School district offices are closed this week and officials on
Wednesday couldn't say how many students were in Weerts'
horticulture class, how often it met or how many other classes
attended by high school students are taught by community college
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty had chosen Weerts to receive the 1998 Teacher of
Excellence Award for the Eissey campus, which was to have been
awarded at Friday's graduation ceremonies, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts had been at PBCC since 1993. Colleagues said he got his
students excited about horticulture.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie McDaniel, a teacher at Bear Lakes Middle School in West
Palm Beach, knew Weerts and allowed him to speak to Bear Lakes
students about the college's program on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a very innovative and serious teacher,''
McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Weerts first surfaced in September 1985 in
Liberty, Ill., where he had been Father Weerts at St. Brigid and
St. Thomas churches for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1986, he pleaded guilty to three sexual abuse charges
as part of a negotiation with prosecutors, court documents show.
Two other counts were dropped, they show.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Edward Dittmeyer sentenced Weerts to six years in
prison, denying prosecutors' requests for the maximum seven years
under Illinois law.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts served three years at Vienna Correctional Center, a
minimum security facility in the southern tip of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courtroom at the sentencing was full of nuns and
priests,'' Thomas Leeper, the former state attorney who prosecuted
the case, said Wednesday. ``The defense raised objections to every
detail I presented. I'll never forget the atmosphere in that
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeper said he submitted a 225-page report prepared by
investigators that concluded Weerts had been sexually involved with
boys for as long as 18 years and that church officials knew of his
problem but repeatedly reassigned him to other parishes.
</P>
<P>
   But according to court records, Weerts told the judge: ``I cared
for them and was good to them. I loved those boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The three boys, at least one of whom was an altar boy, filed a
civil suit against the Diocese of Springfield and won a
seven-figure settlement before the civil case went to trial, said
their attorney, Stephen Tillery of Bellville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very substantial settlement that by order cannot be
disclosed,'' Tillery said. ``The destruction this man caused was
horrible. One of the three boys is damaged beyond repair. The toll
on the families was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Weerts won the trust of the parents and took their boys into his
home for overnight visits during which he had sexual contact with
them, Tillery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the ultimate betrayal,'' Tillery said. ``Lives were
shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The diocese assigned Weerts for rehabilitative treatment at a
facility for pedophile priests in Jemez Springs, N.M., upon
learning of the charges against him. The Rev. Michael Edward Foley,
an administrator with the Servants of the Paraclete monastery
retreat, testified that Weerts had been successfully treated and
was no longer a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and '80s, the church sent dozens of sexual
offenders to Jemez Springs, then reassigned them to rural parishes
throughout New Mexico, where many of the offenders claimed new
victims. The Santa Fe Diocese was nearly bankrupted by the 200
civil suits and $50 million in settlements that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that Weerts would ever be able to work with
children again,'' Tillery said.

SIGHTING SANTA AS PROBABLE AS BAGGING CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a nice Christmas stocking-stuffer it could have been for
the Rangers' loyal fandom.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, fantasize. Believe in Santa.
</P>
<P>
   To counter last month's Grinch-move of hiking ticket prices for
the third time in three years, team management announces that
coming down the chimney tonight would be none other than Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's enough fantasy. Back to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Clemens, it now appears the Rangers will be
delivering a partridge, a pear tree and Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment is that Clemens' chance of ending up in
Arlington appeared very good, if not now, at least by Groundhog
Day. But this was dependent upon Clemens remaining his normal
greedy self.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Clemens had his current team, the Toronto Blue
Jays, held hostage with both a trade demand and a doubling of his
salary demand. Rangers owner Tom Hicks had the money end of it
covered and, in player-value via trade, the Blue Jays were going to
be forced to take about a dime on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clemens announced Tuesday he was withdrawing his Toronto
trade demand, and that he was no longer seeking a massive contract
renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   This all but blows up the Rangers' opportunity to land Clemens.
Toronto suddenly deals again from a position of strength. For a
Doug Melvin, that means the Blue Jays will be asking for a
combination of Rusty Greer and/or Rick Helling, combined with top
prospect Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, refused yesterday to
completely eliminate himself, but he did say, ``This new
development seems to put Houston back in the driver's seat, or
either Toronto keeps Clemens. I think one of those will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two theories on why Clemens surprisingly backed off
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, commissioner Bud Selig stepped in privately and
advised Clemens' agents that the ``side letter'' in his Toronto
contract was not valid. This involved the agreement Clemens had
with former Toronto executive Paul Beeston that he could demand a
trade after two years in Toronto if the pitcher believed the Blue
Jays were no longer a World Series contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side letters in a contract are basically not legal,'' Melvin
said. But that's what touched off a firestorm around Clemens three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Beeston is now Selig's right-hand man in the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The other theory is that after being vilified in baseball and in
the national media for ``greed,'' Clemens had a guilt attack. If
so, it would be the first time a baseball player was ever insulted
over being labeled ``greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said Tuesday he no longer wanted to pitch in Houston
because of strong comments made by Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker, who was angry at the renegotiation demands. But Houston
owner Drayton McLane did keep open the line of communications with
Clemens' agents.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin: ``I think Drayton will work hard to mend the ill will
and, really, Roger could end up a hero in Houston, his hometown, if
he ultimately went there and pitched under the terms of his
existing contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said how active he continues to be in the pursuit of
Clemens depends ``on what Gord \RAsh, the Toronto GM\S has to say
if he calls. I don't know where we stand at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Melvin and the Rangers had been the most active
club in trying to work out a deal for Clemens. But catcher Pudge
Rodriguez definitely won't be involved in trade talks, and Melvin
termed it ``highly unlikely'' that outfielder Rusty Greer would be
dealt.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves pitcher Rick Helling as the key figure in a Clemens
trade, but it would defeat the purpose of acquiring Clemens to
significantly strengthen a questionable rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And if a young outfielder like Mateo is not included, Toronto
doesn't figure to be that interested in making a deal involving
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Forget Clemens. It's no longer worth the price or
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made the good run at acquiring him, had the good
chance to get it done, and then saw it collapse when Clemens backed
down from his trade demand.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson was strike one. Now Clemens puts the Rangers down
0-and-2 in the pitching-ace count.
</P>
<P>
   As Hicks said, smiling, after Johnson signed with Arizona,
``I've never been involved in a business where you can offer a guy
$12 million a year and he turns you down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's baseball, and that also means the Rangers' hunt for 1999
pitching help lingers on.

REPLACING PITTMAN IS 4-MAN JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Quick. How many players does it take to replace
Cowboys defensive end Kavika Pittman?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey says the total is four. And growing.
</P>
<P>
   With Pittman out the next three to five weeks with a strained
hamstring, the Cowboys plan to rotate at least four players at his
rush-end position. Rookie fourth-round draft pick Michael Myers
will get the start against the Washington Redskins on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   He will be backed up by veteran lineman Hurvin McCormack on
regular downs. On obvious passing downs, defensive tackle Leon Lett
and strongside linebacker Randall Godfrey will see time at the
primary pass-rush position. Defensive end Antonio Anderson also
might play.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive end-by-committee strategy is just another of the
Cowboys' continuing efforts to revive their lethargic pass rush,
though Gailey said the Cowboys have done a much better job lately
of getting to the quarterback. He said Pittman will be missed
because he was a big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we are not getting sacks and don't have tangible
evidence, I feel we were getting around the passer better,'' Gailey
said. ``Kavika was doing a good job. Any time you lose a player
like Pittman with speed on the field, that's going to impact your
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, who leads the team with six sacks, could return for a
possible second-round playoff game. Until then, the Cowboys are
counting on Myers, an unassuming former Alabama player, to shoulder
a bulk of the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a good job of spelling Kavika and now will get more
time playing for us,'' defensive line coach Jim Bates said. ``He
will play on all run downs and be involved in some third downs. His
production has been real good when he's been out there. He makes
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates said the regular-season finale against the Redskins gives
the Cowboys a chance to take a look at Myers over a prolonged
period, considering the rookie will likely get the start in the
first-round playoff game next week.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet and soft-spoken Myers said he has prepared himself all
season to be ready when called upon and is excited about the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he's not nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous when I first got here,'' Myers said. ``Now, I'm
just trying to do my job as well as I can and help the team out.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his tumultuous senior season in college last year,
anything that has do with playing in a game is far from a tense
situation.
</P>
<P>
   After playing two games for the Crimson Tide last season, the
NCAA suspended Myers for violating NCAA rules by making contact
with an agent. Not only did it take Myers away from the game, but
it cost him dearly on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   A possible first-round pick before the season, Myers fell to the
Cowboys in the fourth round. Myers, who called the time away lonely
and boring, doesn't like to talk much about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put it behind and looked forward to the future,'' Myers
said. ``I made a mistake. But I didn't get depressed. I know I had
a chance to play in the NFL and that Alabama wasn't going to be the
end of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers primarily played tackle in college, and it was his quick
first step, which reminded the Cowboys of Lett, that prompted them
to select the 6-foot-2, 275-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a playmaker coming out of college,'' Bates said.
``That's one thing he showed on the college tape. He was always
very active.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still project Myers' future to be at tackle. They
moved him to defensive end to strengthen the position where Myers
could succeed because of his quickness and his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been natural for him,'' Gailey said. ``He's a
natural inside player, who has done a good job playing end. He
still has that quickness and a very good understanding about
football.''

CORPORATE BOWL LINEUP BREEDS GREED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some distressing news emerged from the Deep South
this week. Former coach Mike Gottfried, who was last fired by Pitt
but is currently sporting an undefeated record as an ESPN analyst,
announced that he is close to bringing a new bowl game to his
hometown of Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   If the group Gottfried represents produces a $2 million line of
credit to the NCAA by Jan. 8, then we will all have the thrill of
yet another bowl game in a do-nothing town.
</P>
<P>
   Someone needs to draw a thick red line to stop the breeding of
these bogus bowls, but it will certainly not be the NCAA. A bowl
game used to be a reward. Now it's often just a 12th game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: There were 55 teams in Division I-A with winning
records this season. And 44 of those got into bowl games. If
Gottfried has his way, there will be 46 teams in bowls next season.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 48. The MAC is seeking approval to stage a bowl game
next season in Toronto at the SkyDome. And no, they won't play by
Canadian rules, although that would probably raise interest in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The system is basically out of control thanks to the wonderful
world of corporate sponsors. They not only hijack the names of bowl
games _ the Copper Bowl is now the Insight.com bowl _ they have
also created a mind-numbing menu of games that no sane fan can
decipher or follow.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, who's in the Micron PC Bowl? Guessed Miami and North
Carolina State correctly, huh?
</P>
<P>
   OK, what about the Humanitarian Bowl? (Answer below).
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone even watch these games? Not in person. Only 16,000
watched last year's Humanitarian dud between Cincinnati and Utah
State.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance figures are barely a concern to the old guys that
wear loud sports coats and run these games. Once they get corporate
sponsorship and secure a good TV deal, the rest is just icing on
the cake.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout would be nice, too, but that's not where the real
money is found.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it will only get worse before it gets better. Even as
college football is headed toward a playoff system, there will
always be an array of often-meaningless bowls to be played.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you wouldn't have the chance for 21 teams this season
to claim success because they won their final game of the season,
even if it was in the Motor City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And no football coach wants to see that opportunity disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian Bowl answer: Idaho (8-3) plays Southern Miss (7-4),
live on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll: It's been a great month for Tennessee offensive
coordinator David Cutliffe. He was hired by Mississippi and will
get to coach the Rebels in the Independence Bowl. Then this week,
he received an oral commitment from quarterback Eli Manning, the
son of Archie Manning and brother of Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Low Tide? Although Alabama has reached the Music City Bowl,
coach Mike Dubose is just 11-11 after two seasons, and there are
rumblings he could be in trouble with a loss to Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Couch quandary: Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch is having trouble
deciding about whether to turn pro early. The Cleveland Browns
expansion franchise has the first pick, but no coach. Does Couch
want to risk playing for an expansion team without even knowing who
the coach is?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has already denied his request to extend the deadline
for underclassmen past Jan. 8, so he has to make his decision in
the next couple of weeks. Couch has said he wouldn't mind playing
for Denver Broncos assistant Gary Kubiak, rumored to be the
front-runner for the job, but it's believed Kubiak may wait and try
to get hired by a more-established franchise.
</P>
<P>
   What's your number? Charter Oak High School's Steve Stevenson,
one of the more highly regarded wide receivers in the state, told
USC quarterback Carson Palmer this week he would only attend Troy
if he got to wear No. 3, which Palmer plans to wear next season.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like Stevenson will consider going elsewhere, because
Palmer made clear he's not spending another season wearing No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the ugliest number there is,'' Palmer said. &QL;

CIA IGNORED REPORT OF PAYMENTS TO CHINESE FOR CONTRACTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs 1st graf to change `company' `companies')  (bl) 
 By JEFF GERTH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ CIA officers in China told headquarters in March
1996 that a consultant for American aerospace companies had made
payments to Chinese officials in hopes of getting lucrative
contracts, U.S. intelligence officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, made in a secret cable, should have set off
alarm bells. U.S. law bars companies or individuals from paying
bribes overseas to secure contracts, and the CIA has agreed to
share information about potential criminal activity with the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that remain unclear, the cable languished in CIA
files for more than two years, the officials said. It was unearthed
this year only after congressional committees began examining
whether the Clinton administration had compromised national
security in its zeal to promote high technology exports to China,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant is Bansang Lee, a Chinese-American who worked for
Hughes Space &AMP; Communications and for Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the cable specifies on whose behalf Lee
would have been making any payments to Chinese officials, or what
kind of officials these were. Nor is it clear whose money the CIA
believed it was, or how much money passed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the Justice Department is now
examining Lee's activities more closely.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Brian O'Neill, said his client ``has never made any
unlawful or improper payments of any kind to any Chinese
official.'' Spokesmen for Hughes and Loral deny any wrongdoing but
declined to discuss Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA official said the failure to pass the cable on to the
Justice Department had been an oversight that was now being
reviewed by the CIA's inspector general. But it marks the second
time this year that CIA officials have acknowledged that they
failed to disseminate potentially significant information about
questionable dealings involving China and American satellite
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also illustrates the pressures that confront
American manufacturers as they compete with European companies for
a share of a Chinese market in which individual satellite sales can
be worth as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was born in China but educated in the United States,
receiving a doctorate from Princeton University in electrical
engineering. Industry executives say he served as a crucial
intermediary between American companies and Chinese aerospace
officials who on one hand were buying Western satellites and on the
other hand marketing their country's ability to launch these
satellites with China's own rockets.
</P>
<P>
   State Department documents and interviews with industry
executives suggest that Lee appears to have had a hand in both
endeavors. During his years working for Hughes, the company sold
hundreds of millions of dollars in satellites and
telecommunications equipment to Chinese concerns, and Loral made
its first satellite sale to China after it hired Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When he was working at Loral, Lee suggested that the company
help Chinese rocket scientists understand the causes of a failed
satellite launch in 1996, according to State Department documents.
Loral sent technicians to China, and their dealings with Chinese
scientists, carried out without U.S. government approval, are now
the focus of a criminal investigation and Congressional inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is examining whether Loral, in 1996, and
Hughes, in an earlier accident investigation, illegally shared
American expertise with China, helping it improve the reliability
of their launchings of satellites and ballistic missiles. The
companies deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry had its roots nearly a decade ago when American
satellite manufacturers sought to do more business with China after
the Bush administration approved the first launches of American
satellites on Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was the first American satellite maker to establish a
foothold in Beijing, and it opened a new office for Asian deals in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired Lee as a Hong Kong-based consultant in 1989,
and by the early 1990s, former executives said, Hughes was seeking
closer ties to the powerful China Aerospace Corp., which sells
missiles, launches rockets and makes communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was an ideal go-between. He had a close working relationship
with Liu Jiyuan, the chairman of China Aerospace, a satellite
industry executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee moved to Beijing in 1992 and the next year became a
full-time Hughes employee, satellite executives said. One executive
said the company was so pleased with the business that Lee had
generated as a consultant that it failed to conduct a thorough
background investigation before hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Lee's Chinese business dealings came under
scrutiny within Hughes after company employees in Beijing raised
questions about some of his private business deals, said a former
Hughes executive, who declined to be identified but read from notes
he kept of the inquiry into Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lee's separate business deals with a China Aerospace
subsidiary entitled him to payments of about $1 million for every
Hughes satellite launched on a Chinese rocket, the former Hughes
executive and a government investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee told Hughes officials that no payments had ever been made,
that he had disclosed the general outlines of the deal to the
company previously and that the agreement was no longer active,
former Hughes executives said. But some Hughes officials called for
his immediate dismissal, the former executives said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Hughes, Helen Sanders, would not discuss Lee's
resignation, saying it was the subject of a confidential agreement.
She said Lee had stopped working for the company in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Loral, which was trying to break into the
Chinese market, hired Lee, aerospace executives said. Thomas Ross,
Loral's vice president for government relations, said the company
was not aware of any ``allegations at the time'' it hired Lee and
knows of ``no allegations of wrongdoing by Lee during the period he
has served as a consultant to Loral.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Loral executive said Loral's chief of security had been
concerned about Lee's close ties to Chinese officials. But other
satellite executives said Loral had been pleased with Lee's work,
especially his instrumental role in getting Loral to sell its first
satellite to China, Chinasat 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's activities in China appear to have attracted little
attention in Washington, except for the neglected 1996 CIA cable.
Intelligence officials said the cable mentioned both Hughes and
Loral, but further details could not be learned.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was dormant until 1998, when it was disclosed that
Loral and Hughes were under investigation for possible illegal
transfers of rocket expertise to China. Congress began its own
inquiries, and a House select committee asked the CIA for
information about Lee, bringing the 1996 cable to light.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, inquiries from the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence led to the discovery that a CIA scientist, Ronald
Pandolfi, had learned about Hughes' sharing of expertise with the
Chinese in 1995. Pandolfi wrote a draft intelligence estimate
report warning about the military implications in April 1996, about
a month after the cable arrived. The CIA decided not to distribute
the classified report to select government officials, as is
routinely done with intelligence estimates, saying it was
insufficiently rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Both the cable and Pandolfi's report were written at a time when
President Clinton was moving to ease restrictions on satellite
deals and had shifted primary oversight of sales from the State
Department to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   In recent reports the Pentagon largely embraced Pandolfi's
conclusions, saying Hughes had provided valuable technological
insights to the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the State Department's intelligence arm asserted
in a separate report that China had significantly improved its
ability to launch rockets reliably as a result of the help from
Hughes, lessons inherently applicable to China's missile program,
an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and State Department have raised similar concerns
about the help that Loral gave the Chinese in 1996 as it
investigated another failed launch.
</P>
<P>
   The outside review of that accident was organized by Liu, the
China Aerospace chairman and associate of Lee. In February 1996,
before the outside committee was formed, Lee asked the Chinese to
include a Loral representative as part of the investigation,
according to a State Department cable recounting what Lee told a
U.S. diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, when Liu specifically sought a top Loral
executive to head the outside review, Lee relayed the Chinese
request to the Loral executive, according to Loral documents.

CITY TO APPEAL NEW FORMULA FOR SHARING TOBACCO WINDFALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case pitting New York state against New York
City, a judge approved a revised formula Wednesday night for
sharing the more than $25 billion from the national suit against
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute is far from settled. The city's lawyers, who
have charged that the plan shortchanges the city by as much as $2
billion, said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary windfall involved, projected at $1 billion a
year for 25 years starting in 2000, plus an amount as yet
undetermined beyond that, provoked an intense legal scramble
involving the governor, the state attorney general, New York City
and Westchester and Erie Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The formula approved Wednesday was the third version drafted by
the attorney general, Dennis Vacco, whose office is authorized to
settle the case, subject to court review. That approval came from
Justice Stephen Crane, the administrative judge in charge of civil
cases in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's appeal is expected to keep the case from being
resolved until after Jan. 1, when Vacco, a Republican, is to turn
over the post to Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has criticized Vacco's handling of the case, but has so
far declined to comment on the allocation of money, except to say
that he is open to reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you slice it, it's a huge amount,'' he said. If
he does try to modify the formula, he would confront the prickly
political considerations and conflicting regional interests that
already complicate the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The money sharing would be based partly on population and partly
on Medicaid costs. If Spitzer tries to raise the city's share,
someone else would lose money. Lorna Goodman, a senior litigator
for the city, said: ``I don't know what will happen when we get a
new attorney general. He, of course, can change it. But it's a
zero-sum game.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula approved Wednesday night would give $12.8 billion to
the state, $6.7 billion to the city and $5.5 billion to the 57
counties outside the city. Erie and Westchester Counties both
challenged the formula.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could also be an early test of Spitzer's relations
with Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, rival
Republicans who campaigned against Spitzer but who are sparring
with each other over the tobacco money. Spitzer paid a previously
scheduled visit to the mayor Wednesday, but it was not known
whether the money was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pataki was upset with Vacco's second draft, which had
given $7.1 billion to the city. After the governor objected, Vacco
issued the third version, restoring $400 million to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's office was pleased by the judge's decision upholding the
formula. At an afternoon court hearing, the counsel to Vacco, Lucia
Valente, defended the plan. ``It is fair, and it is reasonable,''
she said. ``We are balancing the interests of everyone.'' Ms.
Valente added, ``We are talking about the biggest settlement in
state history and the biggest settlement in national history.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's press secretary, Colleen Roche, said,
``The judge's decision is unfair, and we will pursue every
appellate avenue to ensure that New York City gets treated
fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman of the city's legal staff said: ``All the counties
lumped together get 145 percent of their tobacco-related medical
costs and we get 74 percent of ours. That's a gross disparity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the mayor's stand, City Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
whose approval is needed for the city to settle the tobacco suit,
urged an appeal. Hevesi, a Democrat, said, ``I'm hopeful the new
attorney general will fully review this case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city raised three main arguments against Vacco's latest
plan. The city said the formula is partly based on population,
which does not reflect the actual health costs caused by smoking;
that the formula omits the smoking-related costs of health coverage
for government workers, retirees and their families, and that the
formula was based on erroneous figures for Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers defended the formula as correct and fair to the
city and said that population has been used in allocations
elsewhere, notably in California.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said he was not empowered to revise the formula, only to
reject or accept it as fair. He said the city's share compared
favorably with what it would receive in some other states. In
Texas, the state government took 87 percent and left 13 percent to
counties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was reluctant to challenge the intricacies of the
calculations. ``The complexity and controversy over the formulas
used by the city versus those used by the state to derive the
Medicaid figures alone,'' he wrote, ``provide eloquent evidence of
the wisdom of according the attorney general's allocation a
presumption of fairness, reasonableness and adequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane credited Vacco with negotiating the formula ``in good
faith and at arms length.'' The ruling concluded: ``For sure, other
terms could have been negotiated. Likewise, other allocations could
have been made between the counties, state and city of New York.
But these observations do not render the settlement, including the
class action allocation, less than fair, reasonable and adequate.''

STARTERS WON'T REST VS. REDSKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey doesn't plan to rest
any of his starters, despite the meaningless nature of Sunday's
season finale against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going with two objectives,'' Gailey said. ``The first
one is to win the game. The second one is to improve. We can't do
that without the starters playing and playing a good bit. That's
how we are going to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said how long the starters play will be dictated by the
flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys (9-6) beat Washington (6-9), they would become
the first team to go through the NFC East unbeaten and untied. It
would also be the 23rd time the Cowboys have registered a 10-win
season, the most of any NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cowboys players said reaching 10 wins is] important,
considering it would be a reversal of last season's 6-10 mark.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur (sprained knee) practiced with the team
yesterday and did fairly well, Gailey said. LaFleur is expected to
play against the Redskins after missing the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   The inclement weather yesterday shortened the Cowboys' practice
by 20 minutes but did not prevent the team from having a quality
practice, Gailey said. The Cowboys considered moving practice to
Texas Stadium, but Gailey decided against it because of icy roads
and the iced-down artificial turf.

ADVERTISING: AGENCIES TRY TO PREDICT FALL TV HITS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GREG FARRELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network executives like Peter Roth, the recently departed
president of Fox Entertainment, or Warren Littlefield, who left a
comparable position at NBC in October, are not the only people
whose careers and reputations ride on their ability to pick hits
for the fall television schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On the ad agency side, dozens of executives are responsible for
previewing the networks' fall schedules in May and June and
deciding which programs will be hits. The agencies' clients pledge
nearly $6 billion up front to buy commercials on prime-time shows
each fall, and these clients _ which include giant advertisers like
General Motors, Unilever and Procter &AMP; Gamble _ do not want to fly
blind in deciding what shows to support.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery to hit shows like ``ER'' or ``Ally McBeal.''
Agencies know who watches these programs, and the networks
guarantee a certain audience: if the show in question does not
deliver the viewers promised, the network will make it up to the
client by providing free commercial time _ ``make goods'' in the
industry parlance _ elsewhere on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge for agency prognosticators is to look at the
new shows that have no track record _ some 37 were introduced by
the six networks this fall _ and decide which to support and which
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are wary of associating themselves with programs of
dubious quality, and so woe to the agency that passed up an ad on
NBC's ``Frasier'' in favor of a commanding presence on ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a UPN misfire canceled soon after its
debut.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when there were only three networks, each of
which enjoyed huge ratings every night, the agency prognosticator's
job was easier. Today, with six networks competing for 55 percent
to 60 percent of the viewing audience on most nights, the
competition for every share point is fierce. Consequently, the big
agencies need people who can predict which shows will be hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role has become more important,'' said Steve Farella, the
executive vice president and director for integrated marketing at
Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners in New York. ``Clients are more
interested in what's going on'' in TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Frank, who was a forecaster at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample,
said, ``We were one of only a handful of agencies that commented on
TV programs and had meetings with the management of the TV
networks,'' in the 1980s. After Dancer became part of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, Ms. Frank continued the practice at Zenith Media Worldwide
before joining MTV Networks last year as executive vice president
for research and development. ``In recent years, most every agency
is doing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing pilots last spring, Bill Cella, the executive vice
president for broadcast and programming at McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising in New York, predicted which programs he
thought would make it and which would not. So far, most of his
calls have been accurate. In an internal booklet published last
summer for clients of McCann _ part of the McCann-Erickson World
Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. _ Cella predicted that
CBS's ``The Brian Benben Show,'' NBC's ``Encore! Encore!'' and
Fox's ``Costello.'' would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is gut feel,'' Cella said. ``It's all about
writing in network television. It has to be sharp. Then you see
where they're going to place it: What night? What's the lead-in?
And then, star power.''
</P>
<P>
   How much influence do Cella's predictions have at the network
level? Not much, he says. ``My influence is with the sales
operations of the networks,'' he said. ``If they think I have a
problem with several of their shows, the creatives will listen. But
it would have to be an industrywide thing'' for an agency
executive's opinions to influence a programming decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever killed a show,'' said Jon Mandel, a
co-managing director of Mediacom, the media-buying unit of Grey
Advertising in New York. ``And I don't think the networks should
listen to what any single one of us says. But if they hear a
consensus building, they listen and they kill things.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president for broadcast and
programming-U.S.A. at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather in New York, a unit of WPP
Group PLC, agrees. ``The networks call around to see if there's any
buzz for a show,'' he said. ``But they do it more from a pricing
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Steele, who replaced Ms. Frank as lead forecaster at
Zenith last year but who is joining Fox Broadcasting as vice
president for research and marketing, takes a different approach.
Foremost in her book is a show's time period: where a show is
scheduled determines what kind of lead-in it will have and what its
competition will be on the other networks. Then she looks at the
show itself: who is the target audience? What's the genre? The
answer to those questions leads to the next question: Is there a
possibility that this show will bring in a new audience? Finally,
Ms. Steele looks at the quality of the show's pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot is important,'' she said, ``but more and more, it's
not as important as you think. We've seen pilots we hated that went
on to become popular shows.'' As an example, Ms. Steele points to
the NBC hit series ``Friends''; she ``truly hated'' its pilot. Even
last year's big hit, ``Ally McBeal'' from Fox, caught her somewhat
by surprise based on the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   As to this season's biggest surprise, Ms. Steele says it is
ABC's ``Sports Night.'' ``It's a fabulous show,'' she said. ``It's
well written, smart and it takes chances in terms of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these agency prognosticators predicted a strong fall
season, but none are happy with the accuracy of their forecasts
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've made our predictions, we hope we're wrong
and that there are hits everywhere,'' said Chrisanthopoulos of
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. ``We need network TV to stay vital.''

ABL PLAYERS PICK UP THE PIECES   (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the women's American Basketball League folded a
third of the way through its third season, officials would not talk
Wednesday about what would happen to its 90 players and whether
those players would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving league, the Women's National Basketball
Association, was not talking, either. As one WNBA official said,
``It's premature to talk about questions that exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ABL players talked, some were in tears. In general, players
seemed more concerned about the league than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us realized that the ABL was a risky venture,'' said
Kate Starbird of the Seattle Reign, ``but I believed in what the
ABL was about. I really believed we'd play out the season. But as
players, we realize the basketball door isn't shutting on us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely to shut on Venus Lacy of the Nashville Noise, a
1996 Olympian. ``I wish somebody would wake me up and tell me it's
not so,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Smith of the Columbus Quest, a member of the U. S.
national team, said, ``I'm a little surprised at the timing of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbird, Lacy and Smith are elite players who will find a home
in the WNBA or in an overseas league. But for the average players
from the ABL's nine teams and for the fringe players in the WNBA,
fewer jobs will mean more competition for roster spots, even with
the addition of two WNBA teams next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says the WNBA will hold a draft of ABL players. But Bruce
Levy, an agent for 38 WNBA players and nine ABL players , said it
was not that simple. The WNBA players have a union _ the National
Basketball Players Association, which also represents the
locked-out NBA players _ and there are antitrust implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA might set up an expansion draft with two ABL players
per team,'' Levy said. ``That would mean that many WNBA players
would be out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the ABL folded, the WNBA could have absorbed 30 to 35
players next season, maybe 25 college seniors and the rest
foreigners. Now, they can have ABL players with much more
experience than college players, so maybe only a dozen college
players will get jobs. The college kids will be hurt the most. The
Chamique Holdsclaws will have jobs, but they would have had them
from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, the Tennessee senior, is college basketball's most
glamorous player. Had the ABL survived, she would have been the
prize in a bidding war between the two U. S. leagues. She will
attract bids from European teams, but she wants to play in the
United States and will go to the WNBA for less money than she would
have received a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, which made its debut with 8 teams in 1997 and had 10
last season, will have new teams next summer in Orlando and
Minnesota. Several other cities with NBA teams want WNBA
franchises, too, and Johnny Buss, who owns the WNBA's Los Angeles
Sparks, said the league might add four teams for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, no ABL team is likely to be added to the
WNBA The possible exception is the New England Blizzard, the ABL's
attendance leader from its start. Although all WNBA teams are in
cities with NBA franchises and play in the same arenas, a case can
be made for the Blizzard, which plays in the Hartford Civic Center.
For years, the NBA's Boston Celtics played many home games in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the Blizzard's box-office success is its
proximity to Storrs, the home of the University of Connecticut. The
UConn women's team is a perennial national leader and has been
ranked No. 1 in the nation most of this season. Jen Rizzotti, Kara
Wolters and Carla Berube, all members of UConn's 1995 national
championship team, play for the Blizzard.

PARENTS AGE; FAMILIES MUST MAKE PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You're having a nice Christmas Day get-together
with your parents and you wonder for the 100th time if you should
finally have the heart-to-heart chat you know is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen the film ``One True Thing,'' in which Kate
Gulden (Meryl Streep) loses her health, forcing her to become much
closer with her grown daughter, or you've heard the stories about
nursing-home bills driving families into bankruptcy. But if you're
like most adults with senior-citizen parents, chances are you'll
talk about the weather instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part of us that would like to preserve our parents
as omnipotent and eternal because that allows us to be an eternal
child,'' said Margaret Huyck, professor of psychology at the
Illinois Institute of Technology. ``The idea of confronting them as
not being reliable and then gone -- that's something we don't want
to deal with. And parents often want to preserve that illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As unappealing as it sounds to discuss a parent's health care
and financial well-being, avoiding it is a critical mistake. ``You
wouldn't believe how often people don't talk about these issues
until it's an emergency situation,'' said Gail Reid, an American
Express certified financial planner in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a blessing to have good health that you've got to do
something while you still can.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is simple, according to Matty Kent-Dychtwald, a
consultant and lecturer on aging issues. ``You need to get through
your own psychological unease about the problem,'' she said. ``You
need to say, `I don't want to end up in a bad situation with no one
knowing what to do.' I believe that once you're past the emotional
barrier, the rest isn't that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to discuss, experts say:
</P>
<P>
   -- Is there a living will instructing doctors what they should
and should not do if extraordinary measures are needed?
</P>
<P>
   -- Is there any estate planning, including a will?
</P>
<P>
   -- Has anyone been given power of attorney so that a parent's
affairs can be handled if the parent become disabled?
</P>
<P>
   -- Are there plans for long-term medical care and how will it be
financed?
</P>
<P>
   Experts admit that starting such a discussion isn't easy.
``Talking about this should be done when people are feeling good
about each other,'' Huyck suggested. ``It's important to figure out
just how competent your parents are, because the most offensive
thing to do is assume that if someone is over 70, they must be
losing their faculties.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent-Dychtwald strongly suggested an oblique approach: ``You
need to have a very frank conversation but you can start by just
asking `How do you feel today?' as part of bringing up the need to
exercise. It's very simple to ease into the other questions and
it's the most important issue anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for working out the details is peace of mind, said
Grace Lebow, co-founder and co-director of the Aging Network
Services in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``People as they get older appreciate it when their children
show an interest in their lives,'' she explained. ``They all say
they don't want to burden their kids, but they usually love it when
they can talk about it because parents do think about these issues
as they get older. It's happening to all their friends.''

FAMILY MATTERS GIVE COOPER HER STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cynthia Cooper went to the hospital earlier this
month to visit her mother, who recently had given death the slip
for the umpteenth time. She just assumed that if there were any
frantic phone calls to be made she'd be the one doing the dialing.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cooper picked up the receiver at the hospital and heard
the hysteria in her sister's voice, fear rose like bile in her
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having your fervent prayers that the material world will
hold onto your mother interrupted by the news that your house had
burned to ash. For some people, that would have been enough to
purge the holiday season of its greetings and the plums of their
sugar and the winter wonder from the land.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, though, approached the calamity with uncommon
equanimity. Better to have lost 5,000 square feet of brick and
belongings, she reminded herself, than the woman who has been her
bedrock for the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person I grew up with was strong and independent and full
of life,'' Cooper said the other day from Houston. ``That's the
person I remember. To see my mom go through this terrible illness
is devastating. Sometimes it's unbearable to see what she's going
through. Everything else pales by comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cobbs has been battling cancer for as long as the fifth of
her eight children has been playing ball professionally in the
United States. The cells in her body have been spreading but _
thank goodness for small blessings _ not as quickly as Cooper's
renown.
</P>
<P>
   A solid player on the USC teams that won back-to-back national
championships in 1983 and 1984, Cooper spent a decade playing for
lira and pesetas in Italy and Spain before the WNBA and stardom
found her, in that order. She was assigned to the WNBA team in
Houston before the inaugural 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooper-led Comets have won back-to-back championships and
Cooper, who was totally eclipsed by Cheryl Miller and Pam and Paula
McGee at USC, has put up numbers that would make Michael Jordan
drool. A two-time league MVP, Cooper is an overnight sensation that
arrived some two decades late.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she has made it, she'd gladly slow down and take a
leisurely victory lap and soak up the sweet perfume of success, if
only life would stop placing in her path hurdles far taller than
the ones she used to clear while running track in high school.
</P>
<P>
   You want obstructions of justice? This month alone, Cooper has
faced her mother's marked decline after a few months of enough
small miracles that the player had allowed herself to believe that
cancer finally had surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   There was the fire, accidentally set by her 5-year-old nephew
Tyquon, whom she is legally raising as her own. And then there was
the maniac who ran her off the road one night as she was returning
home from _ where else? _ the hospital, giving Cooper a real pain
in the neck to add to all her other woes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire thwacks 70 home runs and one popular weekly anoints
him one of the 25 most intriguing people of 1998. Meantime Cooper,
35, has carried the Comets, her mother, seven nieces and nephews
and her six surviving siblings on her back without complaint or
kudos. That makes her far more interesting in our eyes, even if you
won't find her sharing a ``People'' cover with the likes of Cameron
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's something about Mary's daughter. Cooper's
devotion to her family surpassed laudable a couple of legal
guardianships ago. She has raised a niece and four of her nephews
from infancy and provides a safe harbor for four others.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not playing basketball or promoting breast cancer
awareness or making sure inner-city kids have access to computers
or fulfilling her obligations to her sponsors, which include Nike
and General Motors, she usually can be found attending
parent-teacher conferences, school recitals or her nephews' and
nieces' sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   She is a no-nonsense, hands-on parent just like her own mom, who
somehow found the time to show she cared even when, as Cooper put
it, ``it seemed like she was working 24-hour days'' to keep her
kids clothed and fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people want their parents to give them the magic words to
success,'' Cooper said of her upbringing in Watts. ``What my mother
did was she put a reality twist on everything. She showed us by
example how to have a better life. For 20 years she did it through
hard work and sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people inherit their mother's eye color. Cooper got Cobbs'
work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 shooting guard has made herself into a superstar,
using elbow grease to smooth over the rough edges of her talent.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cooper can control the flow of a basketball game the way
a damkeeper can water, it's doubly difficult for her to accept that
there are some things she can't bend to her will. Her mother's
health, for example. Cooper finds herself increasingly willing to
suspend belief at the drop of the latest so-called cancer cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you hear rumors they have a magical drug,''
Cooper said with a sigh. ``Because the reality of it is, whatever
it is, it ain't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Cooper is able to keep a stiff upper lip. And
if it starts to quiver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go for a jog to kind of gather my thoughts and emotions and
get myself under control,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   So much has been out of her hands this holiday season. Thus, it
is no small blessing to Cooper that the fire that claimed so many
of the gifts her loved ones would have been unwrapping this week
left untouched the greatest gift of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Christmas Day,'' she asserted, ``we will appreciate that we
are all together.'' &QL;

THIEVES STRIKING L.A. TRAVEL AGENCIES FOR AIRLINE TICKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Travel agencies and bargain plane ticket seekers
beware: A group of thieves has hit at least three San Fernando
Valley companies this week to steal blank airline tickets and sell
them to unsuspecting travelers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen this many robberies of travel agencies in a
long time,'' said Los Angeles police Detective Ron Ponzi, who
specializes in airline fraud. ``There's been a lot of robberies
here in the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspect the same group of two to three robbers is
behind at least half a dozen travel agency robberies and burglaries
in the suburban area northwest of downtown Los Angeles since
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers are described as being from 18 to 23 years old, said
Detective Al Aldaz of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys
robbery section.
</P>
<P>
   The men are about 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall with
shaved heads or very short hair. They routinely wear ski masks and
sometimes have a woman with them, Aldaz said. They have driven away
from some of the thefts in a red import vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two weeks, such robberies have occurred in Santa
Clarita, Glendale, North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour after a botched robbery attempt at a Sherman Oaks
travel agency Tuesday, the same two robbers hit another agency,
Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   They headed to nearby Granada Hills, where they forced an agent
and customer to the floor at gunpoint and tied their legs before
they ransacked the office and got away with about 100 tickets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Cosby, a travel consultant at My Travel Agent in Granada
Hills, said that just an hour before the two men robbed her place,
she received a fax from an airline association alerting her about
the rash of area robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say is cooperate with them. Just give
them what they want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries have resulted in the robberies, police said.
But the crimes have prompted the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide unit to
examine the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the series of robberies, police have encouraged
travel agencies to lock their doors during business hours and allow
in only customers who have produced some identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have them knock, especially during this holiday season,''
Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   If an agent is still suspicious, have the customer give them a
driver's license or another form of identification through a mail
slot, Aldaz said. Most thieves will not hand over identification.
</P>
<P>
   Also avoid working alone, Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also encouraged bargain ticket hunters to go though the
airline or reputable travel agencies or know the source of the sale
for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen tickets appear to be usable, but an alert airline
ticket counter clerk should be able to tell by computer that they
are stolen, police said. Some travelers have been left stranded or
faced paying the full price when caught with bogus tickets.

CAR OF MAN SOUGHT FOR QUESTIONING IN DOCTOR'S KILLING FOUND AT
AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Vt., Canada) 
 (nk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A car belonging to the man wanted for questioning in the October
killing of a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor who provided abortions has been
found at Newark International Airport in New Jersey, law
enforcement officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The police still have not located James C. Kopp, the itinerant
antiabortion protester from Vermont who witnesses believe they saw
jogging in the Amherst, N.Y., neighborhood of Dr. Barnett A.
Slepian on the morning of his slaying. But on Friday, they found
Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier _ which had also been spotted
near Slepian's home in the days before the shooting _ in the
long-term parking lot of the airport, keys in the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, said the car had been at the airport since Dec. 4, a
month after the FBI named Kopp as a material witness and issued a
warrant for his arrest. Law enforcement authorities have not named
Kopp or anyone else as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has impounded the car and its contents for analysis, but
Trevor said the officer who discovered the car found only a spare
tire, some scrap papers and a map in the dirty vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That car doesn't solve this case,'' said Michael A. Mason, of
the FBI's office in Buffalo, where a multi-agency task force has
tracked 1,100 leads since the Oct. 23 slaying. ``Finding the car
finds us the car that a witness saw in the area at that time.
That's all it does. It doesn't get us any closer to where he is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said the car was left at the airport with expired New
Jersey plates, rather than the Vermont tags it had when seen in
Amherst. The FBI had put out an alert throughout the United States
and Canada for both the black Cavalier and a green 1977 Dodge
Aspen, which was also registered to Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities said they do not know whether Kopp
took a flight after the car was left at the airport. There is no
video surveillance in the long-term lot, which houses about 32,000
cars a day, officials said. Videotapes from inside the airport
remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers do daily checks of the lot at midnight and log
every car in the computer, Trevor said. On Friday an officer
noticed that the car's inspection sticker was torn and expired, and
when he checked the vehicle identification number he discovered the
FBI alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything that's going to be a
case-breaker'' in the car, said Keith McKaskill, an inspector in
the Winnipeg Police Department, which is part of the U.S.-Canadian
task force investigating the attacks on Slepian and four other
abortion providers in western New York and Canada. ``We have no
idea where he is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The car in Newark is just the latest link law enforcement
officials say they have found between Kopp and the New York
metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that Kopp was working construction jobs
in the region in the days leading up to and directly after the
Slepian shooting. FBI agents have interviewed the owner of a
delivery service in Hoboken, N.J., and a contractor in Jersey City,
both of whom said Kopp worked for them recently.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Grodofsky of Jersey City said in a recent interview with
The New York Times that Kopp _ whom he knew by the name Clyde
Swenson _ did carpentry work for him from about March until August,
when Kopp said he was taking a job with a contractor in Manhattan.
Grodofsky said Kopp also lived in a building he owns in Jersey City
off and on for about two months ending in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Grodofsky described Kopp as a ``true believer'' who attended
Mass frequently, had antiabortion stickers on his dashboard, and
once got in a fight with another worker who was drinking on the
job. Kopp and Grodofsky talked often of the Bible and World War II,
Grodofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a highlight every day,'' Grodofsky said. ``He was
funny. He was incredibly smart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dingy apartment where Kopp stayed, he left behind some
plastic containers from Taco Bell, two paperback novels _ an Agatha
Christie mystery and a war story _ several marketing manuals and a
Spanish-language calendar from a Roman Catholic funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Castillo of Jersey City, who worked with Kopp on
construction projects for Grodofsky, described him as ``a little
strange,'' comparing him to a hermit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `I'm a pro-lifer, I don't believe in a woman
choosing,''' Castillo recalled of one conversation about abortion.
``I said, `What's wrong with a woman's choice?' He said: `It's not
right. It's a woman's right to choose for the baby to live. The
Lord will prevail.' He blew me away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Buffalo clinic where Slepian worked, abortions continued
as scheduled Wednesday. Doctors from around the country have flown
in to keep the clinic operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that what they find in the car can help with the
investigation,'' said Melinda DuBois, director of the clinic,
Buffalo GYN Womenservices. ``The longer it takes to find this guy,
the colder the trail goes.''

PARENTS AGE; FAMILIES MUST MAKE PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You're having a nice Christmas Day get-together
with your parents and you wonder for the 100th time if you should
finally have the heart-to-heart chat you know is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen the film ``One True Thing,'' in which Kate
Gulden (Meryl Streep) loses her health, forcing her to become much
closer with her grown daughter, or you've heard the stories about
nursing-home bills driving families into bankruptcy. But if you're
like most adults with senior-citizen parents, chances are you'll
talk about the weather instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part of us that would like to preserve our parents
as omnipotent and eternal because that allows us to be an eternal
child,'' said Margaret Huyck, professor of psychology at the
Illinois Institute of Technology. ``The idea of confronting them as
not being reliable and then gone -- that's something we don't want
to deal with. And parents often want to preserve that illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As unappealing as it sounds to discuss a parent's health care
and financial well-being, avoiding it is a critical mistake. ``You
wouldn't believe how often people don't talk about these issues
until it's an emergency situation,'' said Gail Reid, an American
Express certified financial planner in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a blessing to have good health that you've got to do
something while you still can.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is simple, according to Matty Kent-Dychtwald, a
consultant and lecturer on aging issues. ``You need to get through
your own psychological unease about the problem,'' she said. ``You
need to say, `I don't want to end up in a bad situation with no one
knowing what to do.' I believe that once you're past the emotional
barrier, the rest isn't that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to discuss, experts say:
</P>
<P>
   -- Is there a living will instructing doctors what they should
and should not do if extraordinary measures are needed?
</P>
<P>
   -- Is there any estate planning, including a will?
</P>
<P>
   -- Has anyone been given power of attorney so that a parent's
affairs can be handled if the parent become disabled?
</P>
<P>
   -- Are there plans for long-term medical care and how will it be
financed?
</P>
<P>
   Experts admit that starting such a discussion isn't easy.
``Talking about this should be done when people are feeling good
about each other,'' Huyck suggested. ``It's important to figure out
just how competent your parents are, because the most offensive
thing to do is assume that if someone is over 70, they must be
losing their faculties.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent-Dychtwald strongly suggested an oblique approach: ``You
need to have a very frank conversation but you can start by just
asking `How do you feel today?' as part of bringing up the need to
exercise. It's very simple to ease into the other questions and
it's the most important issue anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for working out the details is peace of mind, said
Grace Lebow, co-founder and co-director of the Aging Network
Services in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``People as they get older appreciate it when their children
show an interest in their lives,'' she explained. ``They all say
they don't want to burden their kids, but they usually love it when
they can talk about it because parents do think about these issues
as they get older. It's happening to all their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebow also noted that if parents don't want to talk about these
issues, they'll let you know right away. ``If that happens, I
always suggest letter writing,'' she says. ``It works well because
everyone can make sure that their needs are understood.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four people died in the superheated, smoke-filled
stairwell of a Manhattan high-rise building on Wednesday as they
tried to escape a fire that started in a 19th-floor apartment where
the family of the actor Macaulay Culkin lived.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second fire with multiple deaths in a New York City
apartment building in less than a week, coming just five days after
three firefighters were killed responding to a blaze in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials had not determined the exact cause of the blaze,
but said they suspected that an electric heat pump in the apartment
may have shorted out.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ three women and one man living in apartments on
floors above the fire _ were probably trapped in what Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen described as ``a blast of heat and
smoke that went up the stairway like a chimney.'' The victims were
found in a stairwell on the 27th and 29th floors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was identified as Maitiu Breathnach, 39, an executive of
PricewaterhouseCoopers and a native of Dublin, Ireland. The women
were identified as Wanda Chappell, 39, a senior vice president of
Random House; Lillian Lowder, 28, who worked in an office in the
building; and Constance Hurley, 77, who lived alone on the 28th
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal circumstances, Von Essen said, were similar to those
that led to the deaths of the three firefighters last Friday. In
that case, the firefighters died when a fireball engulfed them as
they entered the narrow hallway of the burning Brooklyn building.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start to move in, the fire comes out _ it roars out,
it vents itself up through the stairwells, then out the building,''
Van Essen said. ``And if these people were coming down or were
trying to get down below the fire, they could have gotten caught in
that blast of smoke and heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-alarm fire was reported shortly before 10 a.m. at South
Park Towers, a 51-story building at 124 West 60th Street with 542
apartments on the upper floors and medical and commercial offices
on the lower 10 floors.
</P>
<P>
   As white ashy smoke poured from the window of the Culkin
apartment, on the southeast corner of the building, residents of
other apartments above, below and on the other side ran onto their
balconies waving and shouting for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Culkin family escaped without injury.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 firefighters and fire trucks from 48 separate
companies arrived on the scene. Nine firefighters were injured,
most with neck, back and shoulder pain. Two were in stable
condition at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where they were
treated for burns on their faces and necks.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the blaze started in apartments
19D and 19E, separate units that had had been combined into one
apartment. They said they suspected that an electric heat pump,part
of a heating unit mounted on the wall of each apartment, may have
shorted out.
</P>
<P>
   The unit from the scorched and gutted apartment was removed and
will be sent to electrical engineering consultants for study, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one witness, observing the fast-spreading fire from an
adjacent building, said he saw a Christmas tree on fire inside the
apartment. The witness, Joe Libretti, an ironworker at a building
under construction at 2 Columbus Circle, said he looked over to
South Park Towers from his perch on the 15th floor at about 9:45
a.m. and saw the window of the 19th-floor apartment blast open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a pop _ it cracked it and it popped,'' Libretti
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the apartment, he added, he and his co-workers saw a
Christmas tree burning. The fire was so intense, Libretti said,
that the window frame of the apartment melted as the fire ``spread
like a wild cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Culkin's mother, Patricia Bentrup, lived in the apartment, as
did at least three of Culkin's younger brothers, according to
neighbors. One of the brothers, Kieran, has also appeared in films,
including ``Father of the Bride 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Macaulay Culkin, who gained fame with his lead role in the film
``Home Alone,'' lives separately from the family. Michele Bega, his
publicist, said, ``The Culkins are fine, but saddened for those who
perished in the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bega said she had no information on the family's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they saw Mrs. Bentrup and some of the children,
several of whom attend acting classes at the nearby Professional
Children's School, in the building lobby, wrapped in blankets,
shortly after the fire alarm sounded.

IMPEACHMENTS PAST 
MISSING PERSON 
PETER PRINCIPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH PHOEBE HOBAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is to preside over any
Senate trial of President Clinton, may profit from public interest
in impeachment even before he gavels the proceeding to order.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, William Morrow's Quill division will issue a
paperback version of Rehnquist's six-year-old book, ``Grand
Inquests: The Historic Impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase and
President Andrew Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow said that Rehnquist would receive royalties on the
25,000-copy reprint, but a Morrow spokeswoman, Sharyn Rosenblum,
declined to say how much money was involved. A Supreme Court
spokeswoman had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some authors who write epilogues for their second
editions, Rehnquist did not add anything to ``Grand Inquests.'' The
text will appear exactly as it did in hardcover in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's not appropriate for him to do any updating on
it,'' Ms. Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Hints on the chief justice's thinking on presidential
impeachments may be hard to discern. Forrest McDonald, who reviewed
``Grand Inquests'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1992, wrote
that Rehnquist's account of the Andrew Johnson impeachment in 1868
left some questions unanswered. ``Why did Congress bother to
impeach the president at all,'' McDonald asked, ``when he had less
than a year of his term remaining?''
</P>
<P>
   Dated Card
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some 1998 Christmas cards date back a bit. Consider
the one from the Michelangelo Hotel, at 152 W. 51st St., which
shows the hotel staff with Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably over a year ago, in the wintertime,'' said
Debbie Rearley, who works in the hotel's marketing office.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the Santa suit, Michael Blackman, is still the
general manager. But there have been some changes of personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the picture,'' said Ms. Rearley, who joined the
staff in September.
</P>
<P>
   Tell-Some Memoir
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Lawyer: A Life of Counsel and Controversy,'' the
posthumously published autobiography of Arthur Liman, is not one of
those tell-all memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   It does not tell all about the three men named Peter involved in
its completion.
</P>
<P>
   The book looks back on Liman's career as a partner at Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison; his investigation of the 1971
Attica prison uprising, and his work as chief counsel to the Senate
committee that investigated the Iran-contra affair.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgments credit Peter No. 1, Peter Sistrom, a former
associate of Liman's at Paul, Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be a ghostwriter,'' said Sistrom, who worked
as an editor and researcher on a 100-page transcript of notes Liman
had written on _ what else? _ legal pads after he was found to have
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we never had a formal arrangement, which was odd, given
that we were two lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sistrom's work on ``Lawyer'' ended when he took what he called
``a leave of absence'' from the project in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Peter No. 2. The title page says that Liman wrote the book
``with the assistance of Peter Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the manuscript was done,'' said Israel, a former
publisher at Putnam. ``But parts of it were sketchy. I think there
was a feeling on Arthur and Ellen's part that we needed to make a
big push, and I was called in semi-extremis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a terrific amount of work by spewing faxes back and
forth.'' (Ellen is Liman's widow, who said that a non-Peter _ their
son Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, was also
involved.)
</P>
<P>
   The finished manuscript was delivered to Peter No. 3, Peter
Osnos, who had left Random House to start his own firm, Public
Affairs, shortly before Liman's death on July 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is emphatically Arthur's book,'' Osnos said, ``but he was a
lawyer, not a memoirist.''

THREAT OF CHEMICAL HAZARD CLEARS CABLE OFFICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Please DISREGARD story's slug. Officials did not specify
the nature of the chemical threat.) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATSWORTH, Calif. -- An anonymous telephone caller's warning of
a chemical hazard forced 200 employees at Time Warner Cable
Television Co. to evacuate Wednesday -- at least the third similar
threat since Friday in the suburban San Fernando Valley area of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear if the call was connected to a
series of anthrax threats at government buildings and businesses in
recent weeks in the valley and Southern California. Officials at
the scene said they didn't find any contamination, but they would
test samples taken from the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize this as a hoax and a threat,'' said Cmdr.
Bruce E. Hagerty of the Los Angeles Police Department. ``We
searched the building. We found no device, nothing to give any
credibility to the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Wednesday, Assemblyman Robert
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said he will introduce a bill to impose up
to 12 years in prison for anyone who makes a terrorist threat.
Hertzberg said such crimes now are a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we saw all too clearly this week in the San Fernando
Valley, terrorism and the threat of terrorism are -- unfortunately
-- facts of modern life,'' Hertzberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department developed the
legislation, working with the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's threat at Time Warner's Chatsworth office,
approximately 26 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, occurred
about 10 a.m. when firefighters received a call, Los Angeles Fire
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a very cryptic call warning of a chemical hazard at the
building,'' Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were allowed to re-enter the building at 3:45 p.m.,
and police said the business would reopen immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Like it did with evacuees at a similar threat Monday at Van Nuys
Civic Center, the county Department of Health Services issued
fliers advising people to avoid contact with others, bag their
clothes and shower in case of contamination. The department said it
would contact them if tests of samples from the scene showed they
had been exposed to any toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Klein, Time Warner's vice president of operations, said all
scheduled home-cable maintenance Wednesday was uninterrupted and
all of the business's telephone calls were answered at another
facility.
</P>
<P>
   There was no interruption in cable service because the company's
automated system remained up and running, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives were prepared for this kind of threat and
had an action plan to deal with it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday about 2,200 people were evacuated from the Los Angeles
Superior and Municipal courthouses in the suburban San Fernando
Valley community of Van Nuys when someone called 911 and claimed
anthrax had been released there.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouses were scheduled to reopen today, but all court
cases and hearings were postponed until next week, court officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, an anonymous caller told authorities that
the bacterium had been released into the ventilation system at the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court building in the suburban San Fernando Valley
community of Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Westwood office building was evacuated Thursday
when a letter threatened anthrax contamination there.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty said there's no indication any of the four recent
threats in the city are connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several clues that we're investigating. We have some
very good leads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we will make arrests,'' Hagerty said, though he
wouldn't specify why or give details about the leads that
detectives are following.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of exposure to anthrax usually develop in two to six
days. They include coughing, muscle aches and chest pains, and a
sustained fever of more than 100.5 degrees.

APOLOGY OK BY PALMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last page has finally been written _ literally
_ regarding some of the controversial comments made after last
month's USC-UCLA football game.
</P>
<P>
   USC quarterback Carson Palmer said he has received a handwritten
letter of apology from UCLA linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo over
Ayanbadejo's statements about the true freshman. Ayanbadejo said
Palmer was ``terrible'' and that the Bruins' redshirt freshmen
quarterbacks were better than Palmer following UCLA's 34-17 victory
over the Trojans at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice thing for him to do,'' Palmer said. ``I had
heard about it (before) because his coach was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Palmer accepted Ayanbadejo's apology, he said the
comments will still motivate him for next season's game against the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to remember that next year against
UCLA,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Making the pitch: USC coach Paul Hackett is starting to get more
and more questions about the future of juniors Chris Claiborne and
R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne is fully expected to turn pro after the season, and
Soward appears to be headed in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly as a coach, Hackett would love to have both players
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to what they really want to do,'' Hackett said.
``We're going to run a tight ship, get degrees and play hard-nosed
football. If both of those guys come back, we've got a chance to
make a real jump next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton on mend: Tailback Chad Morton missed Wednesday's practice
to rest his sore ankle, although Hackett said he didn't think it
would affect his status for the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been next (week), I'd really be panicking,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward also missed his second straight day of practice because
he has had a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes no better: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes, who has a
sprained big toe, went home to Stockton and did not practice
Wednesday with no improvement in his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he is in a few more days,'' Hackett said. ``He's
certainly in jeopardy for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep it down: USC practices have been quieter this week, with
only limited use of the air horn used to end drills. The reason is
that adjacent Dedeaux Field has been transformed into a replica of
the Detroit Tigers' spring-training facility for a baseball movie
being filmed starring Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   And the film's crew asked for less use of the loud air horns on
Howard Jones Field.

MODANO'S HAT TRICK HELPS SINK TORONTO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ While most teams have looked back on memories of past
games in their final trip to the historic Maple Leaf Gardens, the
Stars decided to create new memories last night.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Mike Modano's first hat trick of the season and Ed
Belfour's sometimes frenetic goaltending, the Stars crumpled the
Maple Leafs, 5-1. The victory extended the Stars' unbeaten streak
to 10 games (7-0-3) and was only Toronto's second loss in the past
11 (9-2) games at the venerable Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs are scheduled to move out of the 68-year-old
building Feb. 20 and into the new Air Canada Centre, signaling an
end of the last pre-1960s building in the NHL. And while many teams
have been caught up in the nostalgia of the moment, the Stars were
too tired to be involved in the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``After playing those three games in four nights, we really felt
like we needed the energy,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of his
decision not to practice at the Gardens in the morning. ``We didn't
want to cheat ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had plenty of energy and few distractions, receiving
all five goals from the Modano-Jere Lehtinen-Brett Hull line and
moving to a 20-5-6 record. The Stars have a league-best 46 points.
</P>
<P>
   While Modano's energy clearly was up, the Stars as a team
started slowly. The Maple Leafs outshot the Stars, 7-1, to start
the game, and Belfour was tested early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our goalie was the best player on the ice early in
the game,'' Hitchcock said. ``Eddie saved our bacon.''
</P>
<P>
   And that performance by Belfour paid off when Modano zipped a
wrister through the legs of Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph four
minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get it on net,'' said Modano, who broke a
seven-game goal-scoring drought. ``It just kind of slipped
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto fell to 19-12-2, and Joseph dropped to 14-10-2. The
former Edmonton Oilers goalie, who joined the Maple Leafs as a free
agent in the off-season, was facing the Stars for the 17th time,
playoffs included, since April 1997. Joseph is 5-12 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Stars had Cujo's number. With Toronto's Gary
Valk off for elbowing, Hull scored his 10th goal of the season at
the 9:46 mark of the first period by deflecting in a Darryl Sydor
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs came back to make it 2-1 on a Sergei Berezin
goal, but Modano gave the Stars a 3-1 first-period lead when he
ripped a 45-foot slap shot past Joseph with the Stars short-handed
at the 17:47 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen quickly punched that to 4-1 at the 5:41 mark of the
second period when he deflected in a Derian Hatcher shot for his
team-leading 11th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars would lead the rest of the way, but that didn't mean
Lehtinen would stay in the goal-scoring lead alone for the Stars.
Modano registered his fifth career hat trick when he took a
Lehtinen pass on an odd-man rush and whistled a wrister past
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Modano-Hull-Lehtinen line has 32 goals this season,
including eight points last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars ended their four-game pre-Christmas road trip with a
3-0-1 record and moved to 9-3-4 on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play on the road, so we have to be conscious of
the energy,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're just playing a strong road
game overall right now.''

COUPLES WANTS A FAST START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The personal trauma is behind him and ``Mr.
November'' again looks forward to life on the road.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Fred Couples sounds like a man at
peace with where he has been and where his travels will take him.
After all, the road has been very good, making him a
multi-millionaire and one of the most popular golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for a back that exploded on the driving range at
the 1994 Doral-Ryder Open and some wrenching emotional experiences,
who knows what heights Couples might have scaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe I will play a lot early in the year,''
Couples said this week in discussing his 1999 schedule. ``All the
way up to the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   His West Coast swing includes traditional stops at the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, where he is defending champion, and Riviera
Country Club for the Nissan Open. Couples may even put in a rare
appearance at the AT&AMP;T National Pro Am at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname ``Mr. November'' comes courtesy of astounding past
performances in golf's ``silly season'' where players compete for
money rather than prestige. Couples turned it into his own personal
cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus seems to be shifting to titles. There were times
in the past, he said, when he just went to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to win, that's a goal. If I get in a hot stretch,
I'll pay attention and work hard on my game. There have been times
when I just played _ and finished 25th _ but that's not me. My goal
is to win and play well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples owns one of the game's most effortless swings and it
brought fame and fortune in equal measures. He's a gallery favorite
wherever he goes and is one of the world's most laid-back athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was life away from the fairways and greens that opened
the deepest wounds and turned 1997 into what for Couples was a
statistical freak. He played 15 events, his fewest appearances
ever, and fell to 55th on the PGA Tour money list, his third-worst
showing in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Life away from golf was simply more important then. Couples'
father, Tom, was dying of leukemia and his girlfriend Thais Bren,
was battling breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The father, a former Seattle recreation and parks employee who
introduced his son to golf, died on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Couples mourned his loss and entered 1998 focused on winning. It
happened quickly, at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a shock,'' he said of last year's win at the
Hope. ``I was doing a lot of things besides playing golf. (But) I
was pretty peaceful after the passing of my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   He also won the Memorial, Jack Nicklaus' personal tournament
that is one of the most prestigious titles on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Couples banked $1.7 million in official money this year and
climbed into 11th place in the world golf rankings. Best of all,
last summer he married Bren, who has recovered from her cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more riches than ever on the table as the tour
enters the 1999 season and it is the kind of money that can still
get Couples' attention, though he has his own way of putting it in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Journeymen pros can earn $800,000 in a year if they win one
tournament and have a couple of other nice finishes. Most of us
would take it. Couples notes that's the salary of a utility player
in baseball or the 10th man on an NBA team, assuming the league is
ever seen in public again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a younger player I would be licking my chops. At 39,
I still am,'' he said. ``I think golf pays off in the long run.
Until we screw it up, I believe anyone playing golf should be able
to play for a lot of money for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Organizers of the Hope have distributed a record $1.5
million to Palm Springs area charities from the proceeds of the
1998 tournament. The event has raised $31 million since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Donations were made to 42 charitable organizations. The largest
donation, $1 million, went to the Eisenhower Medical Center....
Masters, British Open and World Match Play title-holder Mark
O'Meara has bagged yet another honor to cap a career season:
Official King of the Unofficial Money Season. Among players who
participated in at least two events, O'Meara pocketed the most
change, $730,000. His pal Tiger Woods finished second with
$650,000. &QL;

CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR FULL SENATE TRIAL

   (Eds: ADDS new 5th graf bgng, Delay's suggestion ..., to ADD that

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that sentiment in the Senate is running
toward censure and against a full impeachment trial, conservative
Republicans in both houses said on Wednesday that they wanted to
hear a thorough airing of the evidence and arguments from the
prosecutors and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With many senators searching for ways to end the impeachment
process quickly, Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip and the driving
force for impeachment in the House, said it would be wrong for the
Senate to ``short-circuit the process'' through a quick censure
vote, and he said there were ``reams of evidence that have not been
publicly aired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before people look to cut a deal with the White House or their
surrogates who will seek to influence the process, it is my hope
that one would spend plenty of time in the evidence room,'' DeLay
said in a statement. ``If this were to happen, you may realize that
67 votes may appear out of thin air.''

   DeLay's staff said later that the Texas congressman was simply
urging the senators to study all the evidence closely, and was not
referring to anything in particular.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's suggestion that people deciding the president's fate
spend ``plenty of time in the evidence room'' seemed puzzling in
one sense. A senior Republican Judiciary Committee aide said
senators would not even be allowed into the room where nonpublic
materials are kept because House rules allow only House members and
certain aides to see those documents. However, the
Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee or the full House could
vote to share those materials with the Senate, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the impeachment vote was approaching, about a
dozen wavering House Republicans were invited into a sealed room
where they reviewed a number of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers, first placed under seal by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr and then made available to House members, include a
hearsay accusation that Clinton had forced himself on a woman about
20 years ago. The president's lawyers released an affidavit from
the woman early this year flatly denying that such an incident took
place.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's statement about a full trial was echoed Wednesday by
several conservative Republican senators, who said they wanted a
thorough trial in the Senate followed by a vote on whether Clinton
was guilty of one or both articles of impeachment approved by the
House. Those articles charged that the president lied under oath
and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to make a decision prior to considering all the
evidence in a formal setting would be a dangerous precedent,'' said
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``We must commence the trial and consider
the evidence. We can begin by considering the evidence presented by
the House. We could end a trial at that point. But we need to
exonerate this president or convict this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to talk about a quick resolution of the impeachment
process, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said, ``I've just been alarmed
that since Sunday so many of my colleagues think this band wagon is
gaining speed. Well, nobody called me.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats continued to insist on Wednesday that there
were not enough votes in the Senate to convict the president and
that there was strong, bipartisan sentiment to find a way to open a
trial but then wrap it up quickly, through a swift vote to dismiss
the charges or acquit the president and then to censure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a real desire to move in a bipartisan way and
with more dispatch than was done in the House,'' said Sen.-elect
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who voted against impeachment in the House
and plans to vote against conviction in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to bring about a quick conclusion of the process, Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, has been
serving as an unofficial liaison between the White House and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott in discussions over the shape of a trial
and the possibility of censure, according to several senators.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was not available for comment Wednesday. But his spokesman,
John Cwartacki, said the senator had vowed to oppose ``any effort
to short-circuit'' the impeachment process, and thought that a
trial must at least begin in the Senate.

   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., criticized DeLay following his
statement on Wednesday, asserting that he should not be trying to
influence the Senate. Efforts by House Republicans to meddle in the
Senate, Torrecelli said, ``will be resisted and resented and not
just by Democrats. They can present their case when called upon on
the Senate floor but otherwise their involvement in the process is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   A House panel will present the case for impeachment on two
charges, perjury and obstruction of justice, to the 100 senators,
who will serve as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel for the Democrats
on the House Judiciary Committee, said of DeLay's remarks: ``The
notion that there is any evidence in the secure room that if read
in its entirety would add anything to the debate is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that Clinton sexually assaulted a woman about 20
years ago came up in the Paula Jones sexual harassment trial.
Earlier this year, the president's lawyer Robert Bennett made
public a signed affidavit in which the woman, known as Jane Doe No.
5, flatly dismissed the accusation, which was originally made by
acquaintances of the woman, as untrue.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican investigators from the Judiciary Committee did
their own interviews in the case, and some of that information has
been available to House members.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell added, ``When I last checked, Mr. DeLay was the majority
whip of the House and I hadn't realized that somewhere between last
Saturday and today he had become involved in the leadership in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to DeLay said he was not trying to direct senators to
particular documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just meant, `Take your time and listen to the evidence,' ''
said the aide, Michael Scanlon.
