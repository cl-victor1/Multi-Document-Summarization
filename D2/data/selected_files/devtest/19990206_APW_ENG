<HEADLINE> Reagan Celebrates 88th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former President Ronald Reagan was to spend  
his 88th birthday on Saturday quietly, at home with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	No formal celebration was planned at the Bel-Air residence for  
Reagan, who has Alzheimer's disease and has been absent at recent 
birthday events attended by his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi  
Valley offered birthday cake to visitors and invited them to sign 
an oversized card for Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the hotel where then-President Reagan stayed when away  
from the White House -- the Westin Century Plaza Hotel &AMP; Tower -- 
unveiled a $5,400-a-night Ronald Reagan Suite featuring 
presidential photographs and memorabilia.

<HEADLINE> Once-Mighty Kansas Now Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Roy Williams ripped off his jacket and  
threw it across the floor. The Kansas Jayhawks on the bench 
pretended not to notice as it went sliding past. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stands, 16,000 fans sat shocked and nearly silent.  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, a road-weak also-ran that had lost its last 15 games  
at Allen Fieldhouse by an average of 24 points, had erased a 
17-point deficit to tie the score with about a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jayhawks went on to win on a last-second shot, but the game  
wasn't even supposed to be close. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Kansas basketball, 1998-99. Things are not exactly  
the way they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach told us ... this team was going to give him a heart  
attack,'' forward T.J. Pugh said with a wry grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sort of joking.''  
</P>
<P>
	He was?  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who won more games (282) than any other coach in his  
first 10 years, says at least 25 percent of all his gray hair has 
sprouted since practice started for season No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, he knew all those first-round draft picks and first-team  
All-Americans were gone. No one expected Eric Chenowith, Nick 
Bradford and Jeff Boschee to morph into Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce 
and Jacque Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 15-6, the youthful, mistake-prone Jayhawks already have  
as many losses as in the past two seasons combined -- and it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this season, I've done more thinking than any time  
since my first year here,'' Williams said. ``Sometimes in games we 
do just the opposite of what we practice. (The players) think I 
might die of a heart attack sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One proud streak after another has come tumbling down in this  
painful year of transition. Iowa stopped the Jayhawks' 
school-record 62-game home winning streak and Nebraska broke a 
nine-game losing streak against Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the Big 12 began play three seasons  
ago, the Jayhawks are not in first place. And last week, for the 
first time since January 1991, a Williams team failed to make The 
Associated Press Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have struggled with my own evaluation of how good a job I'm  
doing with this team more than with any team,'' the coach said. 
``I've got to figure out the right way to ask them, to teach them. 
I'll never blame a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losing three out of four, the Jayhawks came close to rock  
bottom last Saturday against Colorado but ended up winning 77-74. 
</P>
<P>
	Boschee, a freshman point guard, saved what would have been a  
third straight defeat with a last-second 3-pointer that restored, 
at least temporarily, a sense of well being among the Jayhawk 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys would have been ready to go jump off the top of a  
building if they hadn't won,'' Williams said. ``There may have been 
seven or eight of us up there at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas probably won't struggle for long, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Everybody but two players will be back next year. And waiting to  
become eligible is Luke Axtell, a talented shooting guard who 
transferred from Texas. In addition, a freshman class many believe 
is the finest Williams ever signed will be in uniform next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happening now is very temporary,'' senior guard Ryan  
Robertson said. ``Trust me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, it's not as if this team is terrible. The  
Jayhawks still are capable of winning their fifth straight 
conference championship. Barring a complete collapse, they're 
probably going back to the NCAA tournament, too. 
</P>
<P>
	And, at times, they've played well. They beat No. 24 Missouri on  
the road, something LaFrentz and Pierce couldn't do their last two 
trips there. And last Monday night, in their first outing as an 
unranked team, they came out inspired and beat Kansas State by 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's saying we're wounded and we're not as good,''  
Williams said. ``Well, I think we're pretty good. It's just that 
we've set the standard so high the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players seem more worried about Williams than about their  
place in Jayhawk history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's starting to wonder if he's doing a poor job, and  
that's ridiculous,'' Robertson said. ``He's done the same things 
with this team that he's done with all the other teams. It's just 
that for some reason this team hasn't taken to things he's said 
like the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that has to do with the fact we don't have two  
All-Americans anymore. But I still think we're going to be tough to 
play in March.''

<HEADLINE> ABA To Vote on Independent Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leaders of the American Bar Association are  
poised for a vote on whether to recommend that Congress kill the 
independent counsel law -- a law the attorneys' organization helped 
create. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ABA has been a parent of the independent counsel law going  
back to Watergate,'' Philip S. Anderson, president of the ABA, said 
Friday. ``It was believed it would restore public confidence in 
government and take politics out of high level investigations. We 
have to ask ourselves if it has done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, speaking during a news conference at the association's  
midwinter meeting, said, ``I do not think it served the purpose it 
was designed to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA House of Delegates is to vote on a recommendation  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government  
Act is scheduled to expire in June under a ``sunset'' provision 
unless it is renewed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard of no support in the ABA for continuation of the  
independent counsel act,'' Anderson said. ``I hear there is no 
support for its reauthorization in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's news conference was called to discuss other programs,  
but it was dominated by questions of ethics and the independent 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about a statement by Michael Emmick, an associate  
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, that Monica Lewinsky's rights 
were not violated when she was not permitted to call her lawyer the 
first day she was questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said ABA rules clearly prohibit lawyers from talking to  
a party in litigation who is represented by a lawyer unless the 
lawyer is notified. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if prosecutors should be disciplined for their actions in  
the Lewinsky case, Anderson said, ``It is not for the ABA to take 
disciplinary action against prosecutors.''

                           *John J. Barone    	
</P>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- John J. Barone, a lawyer, entrepreneur and  
former chairman of the Ohio State University Board of Trustees, 
died Thursday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Barone was a lawyer for more than 62 years and served as U.S.  
commissioner for northwest Ohio -- equivalent to a U.S. magistrate -- 
from 1945 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an Ohio State trustee for nine years, ending in 1993 when  
he was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Barone got involved in many businesses over the years. He was a  
principal owner and chairman of the board of Toledo Testing 
Laboratory, now known as TolTest Inc., until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	He established Barone Enterprises and Rosie's Fine Foods, which  
began marketing food products in the 1970s. In the 1980s, he helped 
sons Philip and Michael start a chain of Rosie's Family 
Restaurants. There are five such restaurants in the Toledo area, 
named after Mrs. Barone, whose Italian recipes are featured on the 
menus.

</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Neville Bonner, the first Aborigine  
elected to Australia's federal Parliament, died Friday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner became one of Australia's highest profile Aborigines and  
an important influence on Aboriginal issues during a time of 
conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a consistent advocate of Aboriginal land rights and  
critic of assimilationist policies, positions that often put him at 
odds with his own colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner lost his seat after being relegated to an unwinnable  
position on the Liberals' 1983 Senate ticket, prompting him to say: 
``I feel rejected by the tribe I chose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He held numerous low-key public service positions during the  
1980s and '90s. 

</P>
<P>
 *Don Dunstan    	
</P>
<P>
	ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) -- Don Dunstan, a colorful Australian  
politician and social reformer, died Saturday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunstan was premier of South Australia State for two terms in  
the late 1960s and 1970s, and was an influential member of the 
Labor Party nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunstan's period in office was marked by social reforms  
including the decriminalization of homosexuality, making his the 
first state in the country to do so. He was also known for 
supporting the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	One day in 1972, Dunstan defied convention and attended  
parliament wearing pink shorts instead of the traditional gray 
suit. Dunstan said he had sought to inject some panache into the 
conservative corridors of power.

</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Lotfi el-Khouli, a prominent Egyptian  
writer, died Friday of pneumonia. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer by training, el-Khouli joined Egypt's leading newspaper  
Al-Ahram in 1963 and became one of its top columnists. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Khouli was best known for his positions on Israel.  
</P>
<P>
	He began as a staunch opponent of the Jewish state and served as  
a consultant to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat from the early 1970's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, el-Khouli was a member of the Egyptian delegation to  
the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	After Arafat signed the Oslo peace accord with Israel in 1993,  
el-Khouli became one of Egypt's chief advocates of peace with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he helped found the Egyptian Peace Movement, a group  
that advocates normal relations with Israel as opposed to a 
so-called ``cold peace,'' where unions and other groups refuse to 
have any contact with their northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement received government recognition in 1998.

 *Spencer A. Samuels    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Spencer A. Samuels, an international art  
dealer and expert on old masters who advised J. Paul Getty on his 
art acquisitions, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels organized major acquisitions for such museums as the New  
York Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Chicago Art Institute, the 
National Gallery of Art, the Tate Gallery and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	His expertise was also sought out by his friend Getty and other  
major collectors, including Los Angeles' Norton Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	As a dealer, Samuels sold rare works by such old masters as  
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Raphael, Goya and El 
Greco as well as works by French Impressionists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, Samuels discovered the world's 35th known Vermeer,  
``St. Praxedis,'' when he bought an oil painting from the estate of 
a private collector. The painting was attributed to an obscure 
Italian artist named Felice Ficherelli but was signed ``Meer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A National Gallery curator authenticated it as Vermeer's copy of  
a Ficherelli work painted about 1640.

<HEADLINE> Former Mine Hunting Dolphin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A 20-year-old dolphin trained to hunt mines,  
sniff out enemy swimmers and retrieve torpedoes for the Navy has 
died of a stomach infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake, a bottlenose dolphin that the Navy donated to a Florida  
sanctuary and then retrieved after an illegal release, died 
Wednesday during emergency surgery, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was from natural causes, there's no doubt about that,''  
Navy spokesman Tom LaPuzza said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake and two other military-trained bottlenose dolphins were  
retired and donated to a dolphin sanctuary in the Florida Keys in 
late 1994. They were among about 20 animals offered to marine parks 
and aquariums after the Navy began reducing its marine mammal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jake and another dolphin were returned to Navy pens at  
Point Loma in 1996 after the animals were illegally released and 
were later found offshore, undernourished and dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake's infection apparently was caused by a lesion on his  
stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals in the wild get these lesions and probably die from  
them all the time,'' LaPuzza said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- One horse was killed and two others injured in a  
spectacular three-horse spill during the third race at Aqueduct 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Petey Bubba, who led into the stretch, broke down and fell  
passing the three-sixteenths pole in the allowance race for 
3-year-olds. Regal Flash, unable to avoid the fallen horse, fell 
over him and into the path of the favorite, Greek Tycoon, who 
tumbled over the first two. 
</P>
<P>
	Track veterinarian Celeste Koontz said that Petey Bubba broke  
his right foreleg and was euthanized on the track. Regal Flash and 
Greek Tycoon sustained only minor abrasions and lacerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The jockeys in the mishap, Cornelio Velasquez (Petey Bubba),  
Rene Douglas (Regal Flash) and Aaron Gryder (Greek Tycoon), all 
appeared to have escaped serious injury despite falling heavily to 
the ground.

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Broncos' Braxton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton was cleared  
of accusations he exposed himself in a crowded nightclub, and 
awarded $8 damages from the women who made the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver jury on Friday found the four women who brought a  
lawsuit against Braxton guilty of outrageous conduct and awarded 
him $2 damages from each woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Braxton said. ``These allegations were  
horrible. It feels great to be completely vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Sulton, an attorney for the four women who brought the  
lawsuit, declined to comment. The women -- Reyniko Abram, Shellyann 
Allen, Aretha Moore and Turkesha Tillis -- left the courtroom 
without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had sued Braxton, claiming they were ``assaulted'' by  
Braxton when he supposedly exposed himself at a Denver bar on Jan. 
27, 1998, during a celebration of the Broncos' first Super Bowl 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	He countersued, saying the story was a total fabrication and he  
told the jury he only wanted vindication, not money. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury concluded the women's actions, including filing a  
complaint with Denver police, filing a lawsuit against the Super 
Bowl starter and writing to Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, were 
``extreme and outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs fabricated the claims, set Braxton up and shook  
him down,'' said Braxton's attorney, Jeff Springer. ``All we wanted 
was a symbolic verdict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said the verdict sent a message that high-profile  
personalities must stand up to ``nuisance suits'' and not pay money 
to make them go away. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton said he now will be able to enjoy the team's second  
consecutive Super Bowl victory, a 34-19 win over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stay in town and hang out with my wife and T.J. --  
Tyrone Jr. -- who was born two weeks ago today,'' Braxton said 
Friday after the decision. ``I just wanted vindication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Braxton $1 apiece in actual damages and $1 in  
punitive damages from each of the four plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiff's case was dealt a blow earlier when Abram's  
cousin, Leonard Brice, admitted he lied to Sulton about having 
witnessed the incident in order to help her. Brice testified he was 
not even in the club that night.

<HEADLINE> CBS Posts $1 Million Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks, reversing an $861 million 
profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, CBS also  
reported Friday that it had stronger profits from continuing 
operations in the latest quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor 
advertising business offset lower television results, despite the 
NFL's successful return to the CBS network. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits from continuing operations exceeded Wall Street  
expectations. CBS shares rose 31 1/4 cents to close at $36.12 1/2 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said its per-share results were break-even for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. In the same period a year earlier, CBS earned $1.25 
per share, but the profits came from an $871 million gain on the 
sale of the former Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s remaining 
industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 22 percent to $1.79 billion from $1.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter included $7 million in severance payments to  
former CBS chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan, who stepped 
down in October -- earlier than expected -- after transforming the 
former Westinghouse into a pure media company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also lost $7 million on sales of stakes in two cable  
networks. CBS sold its half of CBS Eye on People to Discovery 
Communications Inc. and sold a controlling stake in the 
Spanish-language news channel CBS TeleNoticias to Mexico's Grupo 
Medcom SA. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding all special items, profits from continuing  
operations were $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the 1998 
quarter, compared to a loss of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, in 
the 1997 period.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Drummond Add Spice to Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maurice Greene had just won the 60-meter race at  
the Millrose Games for the second consecutive year when he began 
flinging T-shirts into the crowd at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in Greene's attempts to connect with the fans  
and convince them to keep coming back to watch track and field. The 
sport has struggled in the United States in recent years and Greene 
and his training partner, Jon Drummond, are trying to resurrect it 
with their flair, showmanship, flamboyance and engaging 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Friday night, and Greene had flashed across the finish  
line in 6.51 seconds, .03 seconds ahead of Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was showing his appreciation for the fans because they  
had done likewise for him last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My best memory of last year's Millrose Games was the fans,''  
Greene said. ``When you show them love, they'll give you love. It's 
the energy the fans give you. When you see people smiling and 
laughing, you can perform better. They treated me like I was a son. 
Last year, I went into the stands and talked with them. I also 
signed a lot of autographs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Greene was ready with his T-Shirts, emblazoned with  
his self-proclaimed nickname, ``the phonoMOnon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's phenomenon, but with the MO for Maurice,'' Greene said,  
noting he had eliminated all the ``e's'' from the word. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene would have preferred ``phenomenon'' -- a popular song by  
LL Cool J -- but he said the name already was taken. Still, he has a 
strong feeling for the music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish they would play it every time before I run,'' he said.  
``Every time they play it, good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't played Friday night, but Greene still came up a  
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	So did the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're showmen,'' said the energetic 30-year-old Drummond, who  
ran with a comb in his hair during a relay at the 1993 World 
Outdoor Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond has tried to make the sport so much fun that he has  
earned the nickname, ``The Clown Prince of track and field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he has a co-conspirator in Greene, 24, who became his  
training partner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have such a very lighthearted air about them when not  
competing that their act resembles a comedy team. 
</P>
<P>
	They heckle each other and they heckle other runners. All in  
good clean fun. Nothing malicious. Just an opportunity to keep 
everybody loose. 
</P>
<P>
	And more importantly, they interact with the fans, clowning and  
joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to come out and tap dance, jump up and down, wear  
loud-color shoes and uniforms and add a little flash,'' Drummond 
said. ``We want fans to put faces with names ... Everybody is doing 
it: in football, basketball and wrestling -- the WWF. Fireworks, 
bangs -- that's what track and field needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is happy to be a part of the renaissance of the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in high school, I used to see track and field on  
TV,'' Greene said. ``Now, it's our turn. Now, we have to do 
something phenomenal. I love my sport. I love my fans.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Provider Closes Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The creator of an anti-abortion Web site found to  
be a threat to abortion providers says a decision to shut the site 
down is just a ``temporary setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Horsley said Friday that he would seek a new Internet  
service for his ``Nuremburg Files'' site, which was the focus of a 
federal court trial that led to a $107 million verdict this week in 
favor of abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley was not a defendant in the suit, in which the Portland,  
Ore., jury ruled that such sites constitute threats to abortion 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, which provided the Internet space for the site,  
closed it Thursday night for violating ``our appropriate use 
policies,'' spokesman Serge Clermont said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site included the names and addresses of abortion  
doctors and featured photos of mangled fetuses and drawings of 
dripping blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors whose names appeared on the list were  
killed, most recently last October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was 
gunned down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. His 
name on the Web site was crossed out that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathway Communications, which has maintained the site, said in a  
statement that ``The Nuremberg Files'' was knocked off-line without 
notice. The company said it was informed Friday that it violated 
MindSpring's policy on ``threatening and harassing language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley called the move a ``temporary setback.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We are presently searching for a bolder and more principled  
(Internet service provider) to host the Nuremburg Files,'' the 
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Pavel Bure To Miss At Least a Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Pavel Bure, who scored eight goals in  
his first six games with Florida, will miss at least one week 
because of a slight muscle strain to his right knee, Panthers coach 
Terry Murray said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure did not dress for Saturday's key Southeast Division game  
with the Carolina Hurricanes and could miss at least three games 
next week after an MRI procedure in Florida revealed the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers entered the game trailing division leader Carolina  
by four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure was injured with 2:26 left in the first period Friday night  
in a 3-0 loss at Pittsburgh while trying to redirect the puck with 
his skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ending a season-long holdout and joining Florida in a  
seven-player trade with Vancouver on Jan. 17, the right wing had 
scored at least one goal in all but one of six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have injuries and you've just got to suck it up,'' said  
Murray. ``You always miss your top player more than the other guys. 
We are going to miss him a great deal. He's had a tremendous impact 
on our team from the time he's gotten here, but again that's the 
way things are in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Bure's injury is to the same knee that required  
reconstruction surgery during the 1995-96 season, forcing him to 
miss the final 67 games. However, Murray said this injury is not 
related. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little nervous about it,'' Murray said. ``When you've  
had that reconstruction and anything happens to that leg any player 
would have some apprehension and be nervous about what his status 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Bure will be replaced in the lineup by Alex Hicks,  
who has no goals in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Pavel is in the lineup it still takes the 20 guys that are  
dressed that night to go out and play hard for the 60 minutes,'' 
said Murray. ``The direction of what we need to do is the same. I'm 
sure there will be a lot of juggling of lines out there.''

<HEADLINE> Costner: I Am a Risk Taker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Costner thinks you can't have hits without  
a few misses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had a life that was mistake-free, but if you take a  
big bite out of life, it generally is going to take a big bite out 
of you,'' Costner says in the March issue of Redbook. ``I am a risk 
taker, I am evolving, and I experiment with my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, starring in the upcoming film ``Message in a Bottle,''  
isn't daunted by critical flops like ``Waterworld'' or ``The 
Postman'' since his successes include the Academy Award-winning 
``Dances With Wolves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure doesn't kill you; it increases your desire to make  
something happen,'' Costner says.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Man Freed From Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Anthony Porter sat in prison for 17 years,  
insisting that he was innocent of the crimes that sent him to death 
row. One person never doubted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, walked out of the Cook County Jail and went home to  
his mother on Friday after a journalism professor and his class 
gathered evidence that he was wrongly convicted of two 1982 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so glad to have my son,'' said Clara Porter, hugging him  
as they sat together on her living room sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter came within two days of execution last September before  
the Illinois Supreme Court decided that his case required another 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, key witnesses have recanted their testimony and, on  
Wednesday, another man said on videotape that he had shot Jerry 
Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon, of Milwaukee, made the admission under  
questioning by Chicago private investigator Paul Ciolino, who 
worked on the case with journalism students from Northwestern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald freed Porter on a $10,000  
recognizance bond Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald cited ``news reports of significant evidentiary  
developments that would put into question whether Mr. Porter 
actually committed the crime that he was convicted of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter walked out of the jail clad in a black jacket and  
turtleneck, a slight figure with a deeply creviced face and 
scraggly looking prison dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw his arms around journalism professor David Protess,  
whose investigative reporting class gathered the evidence in his 
favor. Porter then clamped a bearhug around several students, 
lifting two of them joyously into the air as they stood in the 
jail's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said he was relieved to get out, but that his release  
came much too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``They waited too damn long,'' he said. ``They had me locked up  
for 17 years for something I didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first stop after jail was McDonald's.  
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at his mother's home in a gritty and battered  
tenement next to an elevated train track carrying a milkshake in a 
paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daddy! Daddy!'' squealed his 21-year-old daughter, Thelma,  
racing into his arms. ``Glory be to God, Daddy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he hugged his mother and turned to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is my mama, and I love her. This is Ms. Clara Porter,''  
he said, holding her tighter. ``C'mere, girl. She had faith in me 
the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter still is charged with two murders, pending further  
investigation. If his conviction is overturned, he would be the 
10th death row inmate exonerated in Illinois since capital 
punishment was reinstated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to say if they plan to charge Simon, whose  
attorney, Jack Rimland, would not disclose his client's 
whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Denies Clemency to Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis denied clemency Saturday to  
a convicted double murderer who once trained as a Buddhist monk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaturun Siripongs, 43, is scheduled to be executed by injection  
at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday for the December 1981 murders of two people 
during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first clemency request to be considered by Davis, a  
Democrat who campaigned as an ardent supporter of the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the fact that Siripongs has been a model prisoner is  
irrelevant. ``Model behavior cannot bring back the lives of the two 
innocent murder victims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge blocked Siripongs' execution last November,  
saying the state may have misled defense lawyers about the evidence 
former Gov. Pete Wilson would consider when he denied clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Siripongs' native Thailand has asked that his  
life be spared and offered to take him off California's hands to 
serve a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings occurred at a Garden Grove market where Siripongs  
had worked part-time. He was convicted of strangling the manager, 
Packovan Wattanaporn, and stabbing an employee, Quach Nguyen. 
Siripongs was caught trying to use Mrs. Wattanaporn's credit card, 
and most of her stolen jewelry was also traced to him. 
</P>
<P>
	He has admitted taking part in the robbery but insisted the  
killer was an accomplice, whom he has refused to identify.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Petticoat Junction'' co-star Meredith  
MacRae is out of the hospital recuperating at home after brain

	MacRae played Billie Jo Bradley from 1966 to 1970 on ``Petticoat

<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old international business student  
from the University of Buffalo has been crowned Miss USA 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss New York, Kimberly Ann Pressler, broke up the audience  
Friday night when host Shemar Moore, from the soap opera ``The 
Young and the Restless,'' asked whether she would leave her 
boyfriend behind to wear the Miss USA crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh definitely I would,'' she quickly replied as she waved to  
her boyfriend in the audience. ``I think if true love is there it 
will be there afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tennessee, Morgan Tandy High, was named first runner-up.  
Miss California, Angelique Breaux, was the second runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pressler, who is considering a career as an actress, became  
the 48th Miss USA. Afterward she proclaimed it the most wonderful 
experience of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you guys tell I'm happy?'' she asked a crowd of reporters.  
``I feel my smile is filling up my whole face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another night, before another set of judges, Miss Pressler  
said, she might have lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to be in the right place at the right time with  
the right personality,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She now heads to Trinidad and Tobago, where she'll compete in  
the Miss Universe pageant on May 26.

<HEADLINE> Biosafety Pact Could Hit US Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international agreement over genetically  
engineered products being negotiated in Colombia this week could 
have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports could be hit in a range of products including blue  
jeans, soda pop, disease-fighting vaccines, potato chips and many 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiating teams are heading to Cartagena, Colombia, to draft  
the Biosafety Protocol, a United Nations-initiated agreement that 
aims to reduce risks from shipment and international movement of 
living modified organisms, or genetically engineered plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been in the making since 1992 but has run into  
trouble because of a push by some countries for broad regulations 
that bring under its umbrella not just plants but commodities and 
products derived from genetically engineered plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the largest producer of bioengineered crops  
and biogenetic pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops often genetically altered and used in products that  
include corn for chips and cereals; tomatoes for spaghetti sauce; 
cotton for jeans; timber for napkins and paper plates; corn syrup 
for sodas. Even soaps and detergents often are made with enzymes 
derived from the manipulation of genes. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has used biotechnology for years to develop  
better strains of crops like soybeans, corn, squash and potatoes. 
By breeding genes in crops, scientists say they have managed to 
improve taste and make plants more resistant to disease and 
insects. Advocates argue that insect-resistant crops reduce the 
need for heavy doses of pesticides and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming negotiations, things are complicated even more for  
the Americans because the Senate has not acted on the treaty that 
includes the Biosafety Protocol, which leaves the United States 
without a vote on the deal. So far, 174 countries have joined the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tried to be constructive partners in this negotiation,  
but our ability to influence the outcome is limited by that,'' said 
Rafe Pomerance, deputy assistant secretary of state for 
environment. ``We don't have any voting rights at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among proposals being discussed: labeling products that contain  
genetically modified organisms, and requiring exporters to get 
permits for each exportation of a genetically modified product. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants permits only for products suspected to  
have a possible adverse affect on the environment. 
</P>

	``There is a lot of concern out there about genetically modified  
organisms because it's new technology,'' Pomerance said. ``We don't

	Val Giddings, vice president of the Biotechnology Industry

so vast, food and medical aid to other countries could be cut back 
by restraints.

<P>
	``The protocol was intended to ensure the safe transport and use

diversity,'' said Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery 
Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing the food and 
consumer product industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups accuse agricultural-related industries of  
trying to ``water down'' the protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rigorous protocol ... is absolutely necessary to protect the  
safety of humankind and the environment,'' an international 
coalition of groups wrote to Vice President Al Gore. ``Industry is 
arguing that its private interests take precedence over health and 
environmental safety.''

	Some of Lewinsky Deposition on TV Today  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can watch Monica Lewinsky answering  
questions on videotape at President Clinton's impeachment trial 
today. Some of Monday's deposition was expected to be shown today 
at the televised trial along with snippets of presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan's deposition and parts of White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal's testimony. The session is the last before closing 
arguments, scheduled for Monday. With Clinton's acquittal on 
impeachment charges virtually assured, Senate Republicans and 
Democrats are quietly jockeying over how strongly -- if at all -- he 
should be censured for his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his 
efforts to conceal it. Conviction and removal from office requires 
67 votes.

	Jordan Transfers Power to Abdullah  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The government today declared King Hussein  
unable to rule and handed full political power to his oldest son. 
Granting the administrative powers to Crown Prince Abdullah 
effectively marked his transition to the throne. The crown prince 
has all royal powers, including mobilizing the military, dismissing 
parliament and naming Cabinet ministers. Hussein, suffering from 
cancer, is on a respirator, his brain has stopped functioning and 
his liver and kidneys have failed, said palace sources. Death was 
expected within hours or days.

	Rebels Leave for Kosovo Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bowing to international pressure,  
Serb authorities allowed ethnic Albanian rebels to leave for Kosovo 
peace talks in France today. The officials, however, insisted that 
they would not meet with the representatives they called 
``terrorists.'' Officials from the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe escorted delegates from the Kosovo Liberation 
Army from their rural stronghold to the airport, where they joined 
other ethnic Albanian representatives. The delegation then boarded 
two French government planes and flew to Rambouillet, France, for 
the talks.

<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A day after the Philippines put a  
child rapist to death, President Joseph Estrada said today that his 
country should execute drug traffickers next. Leo Echegaray, 
convicted of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, was put to death 
by lethal injection Friday in the Philippines' first execution in 
23 years. Estrada refused to stop Echegaray's execution despite 
pleas from the Vatican, the European Union and human rights groups.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former President Ronald Reagan will spend his  
88th birthday today at home in Bel-Air with his wife, who's been 
smiling through a series of birthday celebrations without her 
popular husband. In honor of his birthday, the Westin Century Plaza 
Hotel &AMP; Tower, where then-President Reagan stayed when away from 
the White House, unveiled its $5,400-a-night Ronald Reagan Suite at 
a party last week.

</P>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Fighting broke out today between  
Eritrean and Ethiopian forces along their disputed border. Both 
governments accused the other of starting the latest round of 
clashes. Eritrean forces attacked Ethiopian positions at dawn at 
the Badme-Sheraro front, 450 miles north of the capital, Addis 
Ababa, government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse told The Associated 
Press. The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said Ethiopian soldiers 
launched a ``large-scale attack'' against Eritrean units. There 
were no immediate reports of casualties.

	Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault  
</P>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was sent back to jail Friday,  
this time for as long as a year, for assaulting two motorists in 
what the judge called ``potentially lethal road rage.'' The 
decision not only puts the former heavyweight champion's career in 
jeopardy, it could lead to more jail time for violating parole in 
Indiana. Tyson ``repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and 
violently,'' Judge Stephen Johnson said after a three-hour hearing. 
``The court views this as a tragic example of potentially lethal 
road rage.''

	Clinton Lawyers Go on Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for President Clinton are playing  
snippets of Monica Lewinsky's testimony to make the point that 
President Clinton never told the former White House intern to file 
a false affidavit. Clinton's defense team began by playing a 
lengthy excerpt of the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky by House 
prosecutors this week. Nicole Seligman said the shorter excerpts 
used by prosecutors during their presentation to the Senate today 
were distorted and incomplete, and aimed at creating the wrong 
impression. Ms. Lewinsky says she knew on her own that she would 
deny her relationship with Clinton if she were ever asked about it 
by the Jones lawyers.

	Kosovo Talks in Trouble Already  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Even as the Serbs and ethnic  
Albanians have opened peace talks in France aimed at ending the 
conflict in Kosovo, new violence erupted in the war-torn 
Yugoslavian province. A homemade bomb exploded in an Albanian-owned 
grocery store in the capital of Pristina. Witnesses say three 
people were killed. But French President Jacques Chirac opened 
negotiations by expressing hope. The two sides are attending under 
the threat of a NATO attack. Serb officials let it be known they 
would not negotiate with ``terrorists,'' as they call the Kosovo 
Liberation Army rebels. But all parties turned up.

	Yugoslavia Takes Over Drug Plant  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian police forced their way into  
a U.S.-owned pharmaceutical plant today, seizing the facility run 
by a political foe of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ICN 
Galenika, the Yugoslav subsidiary of California-based ICN 
Pharmaceuticals, is owned by Milan Panic, a naturalized American 
and former Yugoslav prime minister. The Health Ministry said Panic 
no longer owned a majority of the company but was being relegated 
to a 35.7 percent interest, with the state taking the rest. Panic 
called the move ``completely illegal.''

	Jordan Puts King's Son in Charge

Abdullah. The transfer of authority over the military and Cabinet 
closed nearly a half-century of rule by Hussein, who survived coup 
and assassination attempts and waged war against Israel but later 
made peace. Hussein is gravely ill from cancer and on a respirator. 
His liver and single remaining kidney have failed.

	Six Civilians Wounded in Lebanon  
</P>
<P>
	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli and allied gunners shelled  
southern Lebanon today in retaliation for an earlier bomb attack by 
Muslim guerrillas, wounding six Lebanese civilians, Lebanese 
security officials said. In Jerusalem, an Israeli military 
spokesman said that one militiaman of the Israeli-allied South 
Lebanon Army was killed in a bomb attack in the Israeli-occupied 
zone of south Lebanon. Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try 
to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 militiamen from the 
occupied zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern 
towns from cross-border attacks.

	Can Your Cholesterol Be Too Low?  
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- High cholesterol is always portrayed in  
public health messages as an undivided evil that can trigger 
strokes, but a new study raises the possibility that unusually low 
amounts may sometimes cause them as well. The study presented at 
the American Heart Association's annual stroke conference found 
that very high cholesterol raises the risk of strokes that result 
from blood clots in the brain. But it also showed that low 
cholesterol increases the hazard of the less common but potentially 
devastating hemorrhagic strokes that result from burst blood 
vessels in the brain.

</P>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Eritrean and Ethiopian troops  
clashed today along their disputed border, with each side accusing 
the other of instigating the latest round of fighting. Ethiopia 
said its army had inflicted ``heavy losses'' at Badme, 450 miles 
north of the capital, Addis Ababa, and had seized the Eritrean 
military outpost at nearby Geza Gerlase. Eritrea fought a 30-year 
war against Ethiopia and was granted independence in 1993, but the 
sections of their common 620-mile border were never demarcated.

<HEADLINE> Maier Claims World Downhill Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Austria's bombastic Hermann Maier  
powered his way to victory in the men's downhill Saturday at the 
World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, 26, captured his second gold medal in as many events at  
these championships. He shared a gold medal with Norway's Lasse 
Kjus when they tied in the super-G on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Maier edged Kjus by .31 seconds on the steep,  
treacherous Birds of Prey course. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending World Cup overall, super-G and giant slalom  
champion, attacked from the start, clipping several gates as he 
sought the fastest line down the icy course. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, sixth out of the start house, took  
the early lead with a time of 1 minute, 41.17 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who won a World Cup downhill on this  
course last season, couldn't better Aamodt's time, but Maier could. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing eighth, ``The Herminator'' was faster than Aamodt at  
every intermediate clocking and finished in 1:40.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who won the super-G and giant slalom at the 1998  
Olympics, then waited anxiously in the finish area as Kjus, racing 
next, threatened his time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kjus, a dominating downhiller this season who has won four  
of the seven downhill races on the World Cup circuit and who leads 
both the downhill and overall standings, came up just short at 
1:40.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Then three other members of the powerful and deep Austrian team  
-- Werner Franz, Hans Knauss and Stephan Eberharter -- fell short as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt hung on for the bronze medal. Knauss, Eberharter and  
Franz finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively, in 1:41.19, 
1:41.40 and 1:41.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, the defending world downhill  
champion, was seventh in 1:41.98, and Norway's Audun Groenvold was 
eighth in 1:42.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghedina took ninth in 1:42.79, and Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn was  
10th in 1:42.94. 
</P>
<P>
	A light snowfall reduced visibility in the hours before the  
race. Skies cleared for the first 20 racers, but snow resumed for 
the next half-dozen racers. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian veteran Brian Stemmle was the top North American, tying  
for 16th in 1:43.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Fleischer of Vail, Colo., who placed fourth in a downhill  
training run, was the top American, finishing an unofficial 24th in 
1:45.33, nearly five seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Americans fell.  
</P>
<P>
	Daron Rahlves, nearly out of control twice but able to recover  
early in his run, crashed near the finish. Rahlves, of Truckee, 
Calif., lay motionless on the snow for several seconds, but soon 
was standing without assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Puckett of Crested Butte, Colo., who finished fifth in a  
training run, was well off the pace when he fell just shy of the 
finish, losing a ski. But he hopped on one ski the final 10 yards 
across the finish line to the delight of the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Maine Hosts Growing Toboggan Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, Maine (AP) -- The Hopeless Neurotics, Fat Bloated Idiots  
and Kevorkian's Alternative are all in town, cheerfully ready to 
risk their necks with a plunge down an ice-coated, tree-lined, 
mountainside racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds impressive: the ninth annual U.S. Toboggan  
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But lest anyone take this weekend's winter spectacle seriously,  
the people at Camden Snow Bowl attest that it's purely for fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 300 teams were from Maine, but they were joined by  
some entrants from such tobogganing hot spots as Louisiana, Texas 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the main challenge Saturday was seeing how badly they  
could do. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Pierce, 32, of Portland, said he was proud one of his Team  
Wurst toboggans came in dead last in the marquee four-person event. 
</P>
<P>
	How did they manage that? ``A combination of lack of skills,  
poor equipment and lack of equipment,'' Pierce said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen Wurst, a group of 30-somethings with longstanding school  
and social ties, includes such squads as ``The Way We Wurst,'' 
``Wurstafarians'' and ``Wurst Push From The Chute Operator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group from Gritty McDuff's bar in Portland feigned a more  
serious commitment to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extreme toboggan,'' said five-year race veteran  
Richard Pfeffer, as he sipped a beer in one of the scattering of 
tailgate parties. 
</P>
<P>
	There was hardly a snowflake in sight along the course, but the  
competition uses a wooden chute, just wide enough for a toboggan, 
that is coated with ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakneck joyride starts when an operator yanks a lever to  
release the toboggans on their plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400-foot chute arcs like a long white ribbon down the  
hillside, eventually disappearing under tree branches before 
spilling onto Hosmer Pond, where ice fishermen casually pursued 
their pastime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The course's speeds of up to 35 mph may not be enough to make  
Olympic bobsledders swoon but that's fast enough to blur the 
passing landscape for tobogganers who have no brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``championships'' are held to raise money for the nonprofit,  
municipally owned ski area on 1,300-foot Ragged Mountain, unique in 
the East because its trails offer views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the event drew a few dozen or so teams, ``but it kind  
of grew on its own'' into an annual spectacle, said Beth MacDonald, 
who helps organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the competitors were in their 80s. There were also  
children's teams, with one named Three Buoys and a Gull, inspired 
by the nearby harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teams dress up for the occasion, including the Celestial  
Sisters garbed as nuns and the Four Elmos wearing red outfits to 
look like the Sesame Street character.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Automotive Stock Nets $2.22B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After months of waiting for Wall Street jitters  
to subside, seven companies sold shares to the public Friday, 
raising $2.22 billion in the biggest one-day stock offering since 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
	The offerings were led by General Motors Corp.'s partial spinoff  
of its automotive parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. 
Other sales included Del Monte Foods Co. and MicroFinancial Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial public offerings came against a positive backdrop  
for the stock market as well as for the overall U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were greeted with almost daily reports of good news  
this week. Consumers are still spending, unemployment is holding 
steady at 30-year lows, and the Federal Reserve didn't raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a very ebullient economic environment, which is the  
perfect backdrop for brining out an IPO,'' said Gail Bronson, a 
senior analyst for the IPO Monitor, a publication that tracks 
initial public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest of the stock issues Friday was Delphi Automotive.  
The Detroit-based auto parts supplier sold 18 percent of its shares 
to the public, raising $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi deal was the 7th largest domestic new issue in  
history, according to Securities Data Co., and the biggest since 
December when CBS Corp. sold a 17 percent stake in Infinity 
Broadcasting Corp. for $2.87 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi was the most activly traded stock on the New York Stock  
Exchange Friday, rising $1.43 3/4 to close at $18.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in September, ``we were somewhat anxious, but we also knew  
we had three or four months to see how the market developed,'' said 
Alan Dawes, Delphi's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Monte Foods, which had wanted to go public late last year,  
had to postpone its stock offering until Friday. As fate would have 
it, that day marked the 20-year anniversary of Del Monte's exit 
from the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific Group, which bought Del Monte in February 1979,  
sold a 38 percent stake in the San Francisco-based food company for 
$282 million. Del Monte's shares rose 50 cents to close at $15.50 
on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet front, Pacific Internet Ltd. and Modem  
Media.Poppe Tyson Inc., both soared on their first day of trading. 
Even ETrade's troubles with its online trading system did little to 
slow investors down. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Internet sold 3 million shares for just $17 a piece, but  
more than 3.2 million shares changed hands in the first hour of 
trading Friday, driving the price up as high as $88 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Internet, an Internet service company, is the first in  
U.S. equity markets by an East Asian Internet concern, and the 
first Singapore-founded company on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Internet is a unit of Singapore's diversified  
conglomerate SembCorp. Industries Ltd. Investors were apparently 
unfazed by analysts' warnings that Pacific Internet's stock was 
potentially more speculative than any recent domestic Internet 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Internet gave up much of its gains, ending the day  
at $45. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the U.S. Internet companies to hit the market, Modem  
Media.Poppe Tyson was the darling of the day. The Westport, 
Conn.-based company saw its shares jump from $16 a share to $43.18 3/4 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The company raised $41.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The market for new stock issues is expected to stay hot through  
the first half of the year, according to Bronson of the IPO 
Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to let your plans slide if you are serious  
about going to the market in 1999,'' she said. ``Companies thinking 
about an IPO are trying to get their houses in order, especially if 
they're in technology or a technology-related industry.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks, Heat Square Off Sunday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Knicks and Miami Heat both are a little angry going  
into Sunday's renewal of their bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York opened the season with a 93-85 loss Friday at Orlando,  
while Miami was routed at home by Detroit, 95-81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat defeat followed lackluster showings by the defending  
Atlantic Division champions in a pair of preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be totally alarmed right now, but we've got to nip it  
in the bud before it gets worse,'' Heat center Alonzo Mourning 
said. ``It's just a small wound now. We don't want it to get any 
bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win at New York would give Miami a big boost, but Knicks fans  
have other plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a hostile environment,'' Mourning said.  
``It's to be expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bad blood between teams, fostered by bruising playoff  
showdowns the past two season, has a new element with the Knicks' 
acquisition of Latrell Sprewell, the controversial coach-choking 
guard. Sprewell could give New York the added scoring punch they 
need to overtake Miami in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization is all about winning -- not just having a  
mediocre season, but having a great season and winning the whole 
thing,'' Sprewell said following Friday's loss. ``I haven't had 
that, so to have that is definitely something positive for me. 
We're going to work toward that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks barely made the playoffs last year, then upset Miami  
in the first round in a series marked by a brawl and barbs between 
coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy. There were also punches 
thrown two years ago, and the Heat eliminated a Knicks team 
depleted by suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami and New York consider themselves title contenders this  
year, and Sunday's meeting is the first of four during the regular 
season. The Heat went out of their way to downplay the significance 
of the game, in part because they must also play Monday at 
Charlotte and Tuesday against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is tough, not just New York,'' Mourning said.  
``Everybody is hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are going to come fast and furious,'' Van Gundy  
said. ``We need to somehow improve in the short practice time that 
we have and play a very good Miami team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Heat start playing better, they'll be hard-pressed to  
beat anyone. Miami's 81 points Friday was a franchise low for a 
season opener. The Heat looked sluggish on offense and tentative on 
defense.

<HEADLINE> Ventura, Keillor End Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The war of words between Minnesota Gov. Jesse  
Ventura and Garrison Keillor over the humorist's satirical book 
about a wrestler who becomes governor appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor wishes Garrison Keillor all the luck in the world  
and hopes he makes a bundle,'' said John Wodele, Ventura's 
spokesman. ``Back-and-forth exchanges are not helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura had said that Keillor ``is writing a book, based on me,  
without my permission, without anything of my involvement. ...To 
me, that's cheating, because they are cheating me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He compared the novel -- ``Me -- by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente as  
told to Garrison Keillor'' -- to the illegal T-shirts, unauthorized 
made-for-TV movie and other commercial ventures that trade on his 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's odd that Gov. Ventura thinks I need his permission to  
write a satire of him,'' Keillor, the host of public radio's ``A 
Prairie Home Companion,'' said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Senate Clerk Is Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate clerk whose reading of the roll has  
become familiar to viewers of President Clinton's impeachment trial 
was struck and killed by a motorist on a suburban street. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Senate trial session began with prayers and a moment  
of silence for Raymond Scott Bates, 50, a legislative clerk who 
worked at the Senate for almost 30 years. His wife also was struck 
in the Friday night accident and was injured critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates' chair, below that of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was  
draped with a black ribbon. Flowers were placed on the desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who can forget that resonant voice? Who can forget the call of  
the roll? Who can forget the authority in which he articulated each 
of our names?'' asked Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, joining Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in eulogizing 
Bates before the session opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators come, and senators go, but Scott has been a fixture  
in this Senate for the last 30 years,'' Lott said. ``He was not 
just a co-worker; he was a friend and a great guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates and his wife, Ricki Ellison Bates, were hit by a  
22-year-old driver from Manassas, Va., as they crossed a street in 
Arlington, Va., about 6:30 p.m. EST. The two were flown to 
Washington Hospital Center, where Bates died a few hours later. 
Mrs. Bates was listed in critical condition this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, whose identity was not released, was admitted to  
Arlington Hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries. No charges 
have been filed, but police say they are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers of the impeachment trial have frequently heard the deep  
voice of Bates as he read out the names of senators during votes. 
``In the quietness we can hear his voice call the roll,'' the 
Senate chaplain, the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pine Bluff, Ark., native, son of a member of the Arkansas  
legislature, came to Washington as a summer intern for Sen. John 
McClellan in 1970. He started his career in his present job in the 
Bill Clerk's Office in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates developed the first automated record-keeping system in the  
Senate and established its current system for numbering amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bates works for the Arlington County, Va., public school  
system, neighbors said. Bates also is survived by three children, 
Lisa and Lori, both in college, and Paul, an eighth-grader.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time, the Washington Wizards will  
be the hosts for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said Saturday that the draft would be held June 30 at  
the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted to bring one of the NBA's premier events to  
our nation's capital and to state-of-the-art MCI Center,'' 
commissioner David Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abe Pollin, chairman of Washington Sports and Entertainment,  
said, ``The Washington area is steeped in basketball tradition and 
for basketball fans everywhere, the NBA draft is one of the most 
anticipated events of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft had been held in New York from 1979-91, before being  
moved around to various NBA cities. Since then, it has been held in 
Portland; Detroit; Indianapolis; Toronto; East Rutherford, N.J.; 
Charlotte, N.C. and Vancouver, British Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Can Your Cholesterol Be Too Low? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- While off-the-chart cholesterol levels  
can trigger strokes, a new study raises the possibility that 
unusually low amounts may sometimes cause them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	High cholesterol is always portrayed in public health messages  
as an undivided evil. A study presented Saturday at the American 
Heart Association's annual stroke conference suggests that, in 
truth, the facts about cholesterol are a little more complicated, 
even though on balance low cholesterol is still far better than 
high cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, experts have been convinced that too much  
cholesterol, particularly the variety called low-density 
lipoprotein, or LDL, increases the risk of heart disease. But the 
link between cholesterol and strokes is less clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study attempted to sort this out by looking  
separately at the effects of cholesterol on the two kinds of 
strokes -- bleeding strokes and clot strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that very high cholesterol raises the risk of strokes  
that result from blood clots in the brain. But it also showed that 
low cholesterol increases the hazard of the less common but 
potentially devastating hemorrhagic strokes that result from burst 
blood vessels in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The study calculated that the perfect cholesterol level -- at  
least, for preventing strokes -- is about 200, which coincidentally 
is the target established by the federal government's National 
Cholesterol Education Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear I didn't plan it that way,'' said Dr. David L.  
Tirschwell of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts argued that the study does not change the  
overriding public health message. Even if low cholesterol carries a 
small risk, they said, the hazard is vastly overshadowed by its 
other benefits to the heart and the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	By preventing heart attacks and clot strokes, ``lowering  
cholesterol far, far outweighs the potential negatives of a 
hemorrhagic stroke,'' said Dr. Philip B. Gorelick of Rush 
Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the United  
States, while strokes are No. 3, striking about 600,000 Americans 
annually. About 80 percent of strokes -- what doctors call ischemic 
strokes -- occur when a blood clot blocks an artery, choking off 
oxygen and nutrients to a section of the brain. The rest are 
hemorrhagic strokes and result from ruptured blood vessels that 
flood the brain with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirschwell studied 587 victims of ischemic strokes and 137  
victims of hemorrhagic strokes and compared them to 3,743 healthy 
people. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
	--People with cholesterol over 280 were twice as likely as those  
at 230, the group's average, to have an ischemic stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	--People with cholesterol under 180 had double the risk of those  
at 230 for a hemorrhagic stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	--High cholesterol probably accounts for 10 percent to 15 percent  
of ischemic strokes. Low cholesterol is the cause of perhaps 7 
percent of hemorrhagic strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our data imply that for stroke, an optimal level may be around  
200,'' Tirschwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	While no one knows precisely how low cholesterol might  
contribute to hemorrhagic stroke, Tirschwell said one possibility 
is that cholesterol is needed to keep blood vessels strong to 
prevent rupture. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart association vice president Dr. Rodman Stark criticized the  
study for failing to break down people's cholesterol into the bad 
LDL and the good HDL, which protects the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you accept his conclusion is true, which I don't think  
was justified, you might still accept a slightly increased risk of 
hemorrhagic stroke in order to significantly reduce the risk of 
ischemic stroke, which is four-fifths of the stroke burden,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Sioux Challenges Navajo Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Sioux actor and activist Russell Means  
went on trial before the Navajo Supreme Court on Saturday in a case 
that tests the legitimacy of the American Indian justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	The court convened at Harvard University to hear an assault case  
against Means, a long-time leader of the American Indian Movement 
who led an uprising at Wounded Knee, S.D., and has appeared in such 
films as ``Natural Born Killers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means is accused of beating his father-in-law in 1997 in  
Arizona's Navajo Nation, but as an Oglala Sioux he insists he 
cannot be prosecuted by another tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders nationwide are watching the case, since it could  
mean the erosion of their rights to handle crimes on their own 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Means claims a federal law that gave Indian tribes the right to  
prosecute nonmember Indians is invalid because it came a year after 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a tribe's judicial powers extend only 
to members of its own tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says such a rule discriminates against Indians not  
belonging to the ruling tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you assert jurisdiction over Russell Means, you deny him  
his right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment,'' said 
Means' attorney, John Trebon. 
</P>
<P>
	Means was in Ecuador on Saturday and did not attend the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, members of the Indian rights group AIM seized the  
hamlet of Wounded Knee in protest against reservation conditions 
and the federally backed tribal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Means emerged a leader in the two-month standoff that ensued,  
and shootouts left two occupiers dead and a federal marshal 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his activism, Means has gained recognition  
through roles in such movies as ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``The 
Last of the Mohicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means has vowed to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if  
necessary. The court has consistently scaled back tribal court 
powers over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With intermarriage and intermingling -- as well as violent crime  
-- on the rise on American Indian lands, tribal officials want more 
control over their territories, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Means, by his actions, has consented to the jurisdiction  
of the Navajo Nation and he became part of the community,'' said 
Navajo Nation prosecutor Donovan D. Brown. ``If the court rules 
that there is no jurisdiction, within the Navajo Nation at least, 
it will create opportunities for illegal activists to basically go 
unpunished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown discounted Trebon's arguments that Navajo prosecution  
violated Means' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Constitution does not apply to the Navajo nation,'' he  
said. ``The Navajo Nation predates the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long hearing before Navajo Supreme Court justices was  
held at Harvard Law School, an invitation extended by the school 
because of the case's importance, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting underneath a Navajo Nation flag bearing a rainbow and  
buffalo, the three justices took the case under advisement. They 
are expected to issue a decision in several weeks from their 
headquarters in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin Is Top Contractor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. was the No. 1 defense  
contractor in 1998 for a third year in a row, the Pentagon said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bethesda, Md.-based company received $12.3 billion in  
defense contracts during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1998. 
No. 2 Boeing Co., based in Seattle, received $10.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin became the No. 1 U.S. defense contractor in 1996  
with the merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell Douglas Corp., which merged with Boeing in 1997, had

Corp. at $5.7 billion; General Dynamics Corp., $3.7 billion; 
Northrop Grumman Corp., $2.7 billion; United Technologies Corp., $2 
billion; Textron Inc., $1.8 billion; Litton Industries Inc., $1.6 
billion; Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., $1.5 billion; and TRW 
Inc., $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense awarded a total $118.1 billion in  
contracts during 1998, $1.4 billion more than in the previous 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also released a list of top 10 contractors for  
research, development, testing and evaluation of defense systems 
for fiscal 1998: Lockheed Martin, at $4.8 billion; Boeing, $2.1 
billion; Raytheon, $1.1 billion; Northrop Grumman, $900 million;

<HEADLINE> Ohio Sheriff Charged in Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A four-year federal probe of mob activities in  
a place once nicknamed ``Crime Town U.S.A.'' forced Mahoning County 
Sheriff Phil Chance into an unusual courtroom role: defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Chance pleaded innocent to bribery and extortion  
charges -- the 46th person indicted in an investigation that has 
revived the reputation of the Youngstown, Ohio, area as one of most 
venal spots in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad for us to go through this,'' said Pastor Jay  
Alford of the Highway Tabernacle Church. ``But we have supported 
the federal probe and hope it will bring some cleaning out of the 
corruption here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organized crime can be traced back decades in Youngstown, where  
mafia families in Cleveland and Pittsburgh long fought for control. 
The city earned the ``Crime Town U.S.A.'' nickname in the 1960s 
after a spate of mob-related bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	When Youngstown's economy roared in the 1970s like the open  
hearth steel furnaces that once lit its skyline, the mob's 
influence wasn't so apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the mills closed and the Mahoning Valley's economy  
imploded, the impact of mob influence was slowly revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the late 70s, more than 23,000 steel jobs have been lost,  
and the city's population has sunk from 170,000 to 95,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has already led to guilty pleas in mob-related  
crimes from a senior aide to U.S. Rep. James Traficant, the former 
county engineer, and the police chief, law director and two 
sergeants from Campbell, a small city bordering eastern Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe Chance was one of several public officials  
connected to Lenine ``Lenny'' Strollo, the area's alleged mob boss 
who goes on trial Feb. 16 with four co-defendents on a host of 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Chance has pleaded innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the other indictments have led to guilty pleas,  
and many those people are expected to testify at Strollo's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Chance, who is accused of taking $15,000 in bribes from Strollo,  
is the third Mahoning County sheriff to be accused of bribery in 
the last 20 years. Among them was Traficant, who served as his own 
attorney and was acquitted in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland federal court, U.S. District Judge Kathleen  
O'Malley released Chance, 49, on a $50,000 bond. He will be allowed 
to continue as sheriff but will be confined to his home otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chance rushed past reporters after his arraignment, saying only  
``absolutely'' when asked if he could continue to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long, hard struggle,'' said Leonard Yelsky,  
one of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Gary Frost, who leads the Rising Star Baptist Church in  
Youngstown and is part of a group of ministers who have spoken 
against corruption, blamed organized crime for the struggling state 
of Youngstown's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other communities that have been economically devastated --  
Cleveland, Akron -- have bounced back,'' he said. ``Youngstown 
hasn't bounced back, and that lack of bounce is caused by the 
corruption in this community. Major enterprises are reluctant to 
come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Callen, a board member of the Citizens League of Greater  
Youngstown, a grassroots group that has spoken out against public 
corruption, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that for Youngstown to change, it must accept that it  
has been an insular community where -- for generations -- criminal 
activity has been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that we've had a bunch of crooks come in here and  
corrupt us -- it's been us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, TRW Lose Defense Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Air Force has terminated contracts with the  
Boeing Co. and TRW Inc. for two projects worth more than $800 
million involving the National Missile Defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said Friday the deals were canceled because the  
companies faced technical difficulties and cost overruns of up to 
$79 million over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally it was disappointing,'' said Boeing spokeswoman  
Kathleen Schroeder. ``Years of effort have gone into this 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missile defense system is part of the Space-Based Infrared  
System, a key component in the missile shield the Defense 
Department wanted to deploy by 2005. That system would protect the 
United States from an attack or an accidental missile launch by 
Russia or China. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and Cleveland-based TRW had been competing to develop the  
satellite sensors that would detect a missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is rocket science. It's not easy,'' said John Pike of the  
Federation of American Scientists. ``Clearly the two companies bit 
off more than they could chew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TRW contract was for $683 million, while Boeing's contract  
was worth $148 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said it hopes to award new contracts by April for  
a redesigned system that will be effective and affordable.

<HEADLINE> Divers Find WWII Bomber by Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL CENTRO, Calif. (AP) -- Divers searching the Salton Sea for an  
elderly couple's sunken plane instead found a World War II dive 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue crews have been combing the huge lake in California's  
southeastern desert looking for a Piper Cherokee 180 that crashed 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, they uncovered a 1940's-vintage dive bomber submerged  
in about four feet of mud. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWII-era plane is either a Hellcat or an Avenger, said Jeff  
Reynolds, an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it's in really good condition,'' Reynolds said.  
``You can see the gun barrel coming out of the turret in back and 
the engine and propellers are in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Navy officials are checking their archives to see whether  
the fighter plane was ever reported missing. It has not been 
determined whether the plane will be removed from the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crews continued to search for the wreckage of a plane  
flown by Robert Chatham, 80, and his wife, Grace, 82. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple left northern San Diego County on Christmas morning.  
Radar data indicates their plane crashed in the northeastern 
portion of the Salton Sea, about 120 miles northeast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	A fisherman found Mrs. Chatham's body in the Salton Sea on New  
Year's Day. Authorities believe her husband's body may still be 
belted inside the missing plane.

<HEADLINE> Convict Wins $2M From Guard Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A rapist and murderer who won a $2  
million judgment after claiming prison guards beat him will never 
get a penny, the state attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin King, who was convicted in the 1992 rape and murder of  
15-year-old Patricia Urbanski, claimed two guards beat him in 
retaliation for attacking another guard in a failed escape attempt 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday he was awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages and  
$2 million in punitive damages by a federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Friday that King  
will won't get any money. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said if a new trial or reduction in King's large  
award isn't granted, the state would insist the inmate reimburse 
Connecticut the cost of his incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the state is also poised to demand that King rebate  
workers' compensation costs stemming from his 1996 attack on the 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Wieselman, an attorney who represents Stanislaw and  
Grazyna Urbanski, said the family will seek permission from the 
Legislature to sue King for the $2 million.

</P>
<P>
	But there was no escaping the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	As Nagano began a weekend of festivities to commemorate the  
one-year anniversary since the opening of the 1998 Winter Olympics, 
questions swirled over whether this central Japan city and other 
Olympic hosts went too far in wooing the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano's anniversary festivities began Saturday with a day-long  
concert in Olympic Square, the downtown plaza where most of the 
medals were awarded during the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the concert drew only a few hundred. And when it was over,  
the square reverted back to its current function -- as a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at a nearby hotel, Japan Olympic Committee officials  
met to look into questions about Nagano's bidding activities. They 
were scheduled to continue meeting through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC thing has really taken the fun out of it all,'' said  
Katsuyuki Yamazaki, who was selling Olympic pins from a street 
corner stall near Olympic Square. ``We'd like to have more fun with 
our anniversary, but with the scandal and all, we just can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is in a crisis over allegations that several cities --  
including Nagano, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Sydney and even Sapporo, 
site of the 1972 Winter Games -- went too far in their efforts to 
get the games, and may have crossed the line into bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Though embattled IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is staying  
away from Nagano, several senior IOC officials arrived Saturday for 
the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the city was executive board member Marc Hodler,  
who helped set off the investigations by claiming that prospective 
hosts regularly offered extravagant favors to IOC members in hopes 
of swaying their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in an interview with Japanese national broadcaster NHK,  
Hodler said: ``The people of Nagano, they were very keen to get the 
games. The cities have been in a very awkward position, and the 
mistake was done by certain members of the IOC to allow that kind 
of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler, head the international ski federation, is well known to  
Japanese Olympic fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Nagano Games began, he repeatedly said the course for  
the men's downhill was sub-standard, and threatened to have the 
competition moved elsewhere if the course was not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the games started, I really wondered if it was going to  
work,'' said Kazuo Kainuma, who runs a sporting goods store in 
downtown Nagano. ``Now, just when we are trying to celebrate our 
anniversary, we've got this scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that he is glad the Olympics came to Nagano.  
</P>
<P>
	``It put us on the map,'' he said. ``I guess it was a good  
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Borax Eyed in Medfly Spraying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A substance found in laundry detergents may  
be a safe alternative to the controversial pesticide malathion in 
the battle against the crop-destroying Medfly, two scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to compare malathion with borax in the way we  
propose to use it, this thing is safe. Period,'' said Herb Nigg, 
one of the scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigg and colleague Sam Simpson, who work at the University of  
Florida Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, 
recently received a U.S. patent for their idea. They say borax 
works by preventing female flies from laying eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture officials today use malathion to kill the  
Mediterranean fruit fly. The treatment has been controversial. In 
1997, more than 700 health complaints were reported after 
widespread aerial spraying of malathion in a four-county area of 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The fly, smaller than a household fly, targets 250 kinds of  
vegetables and fruits, especially citrus. State officials fear that 
if an infestation gained a foothold, it would threaten Florida's $7 
billion agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigg and Simpson say a low concentration of borax -- about  
one-half of 1 percent in water-based bait -- stopped egg production 
in female flies for up to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	Borax is especially attractive because it has a long history of  
safe human use, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very common chemical, found in many households,'' Nigg  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, which has been dealing with fruit flies longer  
than Florida, scientists were intrigued by the borax idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hat's off to anybody who's after this,'' said James Carey,  
a professor of entomology at the University of California, Davis. 
``We're all intensely trying to find some alternatives to 
malathion. And my gut feeling is, borax is as good as any.''

	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- Extradition proceedings have been  
initiated in Uruguay against an Egyptian accused of participating 
in a 1997 attack at Luxor, Egypt, that killed 62 people, mostly 
foreign tourists, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian officials have requested the extradition of El Said  
Hazzan al Mokhis to try him for the massacre on Nov. 17, 1997, when 
58 foreigners and four Egyptians were killed in an attack by Muslim 
extremists at the Temple of Hatshepsut. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazzan al Mokhis was arrested last week when he tried to enter  
Uruguay from neighboring Brazil using a false Malaysian passport. 
He was being held at police headquarters in downtown Montevideo, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazzan al Mokhis' lawyer, Cecilia Schroeder, told reporters that  
her client admitted he was the person sought by Egyptian 
authorities but added that ``there is no material proof'' that he 
participated in the Luxor attack.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- One day after violent demonstrations,  
labor and opposition leaders pledged Saturday to launch a 
nationwide strike unless Ecuador's president cancels austerity 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders set a Feb. 20 deadline for President Jamil Mahuad to  
backtrack on economic reform measures he says are essential to 
solve Ecuador's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Friday used tear gas to scatter thousands  
demonstrating in cities across the country against the economic 
policies. Five were injured and scores were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad told a local television station Friday that the measures  
``are painful but necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This oil-rich Andean nation has Latin America's highest annual  
inflation rate at 43 percent and a fiscal deficit of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures imposed by Mahuad included ending government subsidies  
to electric and home gas prices, causing the price of both to 
increase by up to 400 percent. The government also froze public 
employees' salaries and annulled a salary increase for school 
teachers.

<HEADLINE> Washington Co. Recalls Hot Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- A meat processing company has recalled  
about 1,500 pounds of hot dogs and sausage suspected of bacterial 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The products made by B.B. Meat &AMP; Sausage Co. Inc., based in  
Bellingham, may be tainted with Listeria bacterium, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people often fight off the bacterium with no more than  
flu-like symptoms. But it can kill through meningitis or blood 
infection, and can be passed to fetuses, causing miscarriage or 
stillbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled items, distributed through retail outlets in  
Washington, Oregon and Alaska, are: Hempler's Bun Buster Franks, 
with a ``sell-by'' date of March 18; Hempler's Old Fashioned 
Weiners, also with a March 18 date; and Hempler's Cooked Bockwurst, 
with a March 4 date. 
</P>
<P>
	Each package bears the Agriculture Department's inspection mark  
``EST 6410.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company is recalling bulk-packed kielbasa,  
knockwurst and polish sausage intended for institutional use, all 
with a Jan. 21 packaging date. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said there is no evidence the potential contamination  
is related to a recent outbreak of sickness in 14 states linked to 
Sara Lee Corp. meats.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels 90 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines canceled 90 flights  
on Saturday when it came up short on pilots amid a dispute over the 
pay of pilots working for a recently acquired airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recorded statement, American spokesman Tim Smith said  
airline officials are ``very disappointed in this situation and 
regret the inconvenience it caused for our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say AMR Corp., the parent of American, has  
disregarded a contract since purchasing Reno Air six weeks ago for 
$124 million. The pilots say American must pay lower-paid Reno 
pilots at American Airlines' rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the  
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although federal law bars a strike, pilots can refuse to  
volunteer for overtime, which can lead to cancellation or delay of 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot union did not call for the action, but the airline  
said many pilots were unexpectedly absent. Allied Pilots 
Association president Rich LaVoy had said the union board will 
continue to work through the weekend to reach an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Notes From the Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist made clear  
Saturday that, like many others involved in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, he doesn't want it to go one minute longer than 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would the Chief Justice suggest that we take a brief break  
here?'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked after the 
House trial managers concluded their presentation of videotapes of 
depositions taken from Monica Lewinsky and others. Lott's request 
at 2 p.m. was for the third break of the day, with three hours of 
presentations by White House lawyers still coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, let's keep going,'' the 74-year-old chief justice replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Lott appeared taken aback by the reply and other senators  
laughed. ``I guess that settles that. Well, I'll ask you again 
later,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later Lott again rose sheepishly to his feet: ``I think  
I see in the Chief Justice's eyes the desire for a 15-minute 
break.'' This time, Rehnquist didn't object. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist is known as a stern enforcer of protocol and time  
limits in the Supreme Court who is quick to cut lawyers off when 
they go beyond their allotted time. He has made some concessions to 
the different habits of the Senate, where sessions normally start 
late and senators can run on endlessly, but he has on several 
occasions told House trial managers that they've made their point 
and can stop talking. 
</P>
<P>
	He also anticipated long days when at the beginning of the trial  
he asked senators to ignore him when he rises from his seat to 
stretch his aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate press gallery was only about half full Saturday as  
many reporters sought out TV coverage of the trial so they could 
get a better view of the videotaped testimony of witnesses Monica 
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotapes were shown on four TV screens located to the side  
of the Senate chair's seat at the front of the chamber. Only 
reporters in the front row who peered over the balcony could get 
their first glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky speaking before a camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the senators watched intently, many with chins resting  
on their hands. Very few took notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the White House lawyers, Cheryl Mills and Nicole Seligman  
took notes as the House trial managers presented their case, while 
David Kendall chewed his glasses and Charles Ruff, while appearing 
to listen, did not look at the videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	With Senate acquittal of President Clinton on the two  
impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice a near 
certainty, senators from both parties were already working on the 
language of a post-trial motion to censure the president for his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	A large majority of Democrats supported the censure idea, but  
many Republicans were skeptical, saying it was either 
unconstitutional or, from the other viewpoint, too inconsequential 
to mean anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, characterized it as a ``wet noodle  
across the wrist of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska referred to another part of the  
anatomy, calling the Democrat's proposed language for the censure 
``just like a pat on the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	For the House trial managers, presentation of the videotaped  
testimony was their last chance to stun the Senate into recognition 
of the rightness of their case. For many senators seen leaning on 
their elbows, it appeared more a time to mediate on a slow Saturday 
afternoon after a long week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't find anything that struck a great light with me,''  
said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. ``This has been a little bit 
wearisome today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weariness today was bipartisan and extended to the highest  
levels of Senate leadership. Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, for example, was spotted early in the day stifling a yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, was asked after the session what he  
had been scribbling during the trial that day. ``This was a 
three-doodle day,'' Craig responded. He wouldn't show his work, 
saying only that ``I call this my impeachment series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The session ended on a discordant note, with the House managers  
and Senate Republicans refusing a White House lawyer's request to 
show a statement that Clinton friend Vernon Jordan read at the end 
of his deposition last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan made a statement defending his integrity, but House trial  
manager Asa Hutchison, R-Ark., objected to its inclusion in the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would propose that since the issue has arisen of his  
integrity, since Mr. Jordan is an honorable man, and has had a 
distinguished career, that I be allowed to play the approximately 
two minute segment of his own statement about his integrity,'' 
presidential attorney David Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hutchison objected again, saying it wasn't part of the  
Senate record and Chief Justice William Rehnquist agreed. 
Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Barbara Boxer of 
California asked for unanimous approval of motions to reverse that 
decision, but were blocked by Republican senators.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's government prepared today to  
declare a gravely ill King Hussein unfit to rule, handing over 
power to his son, Prince Abdullah, sources said. Under the 
constitution, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh must request that 
parliament give authority to the crown prince, the sources said. An 
announcement carried by the official Jordanian news agency said 
parliament will meet tomorrow. Hussein returned to Jordan

<HEADLINE> New Immigration Guide Has Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A guidebook aimed at providing easy-to-understand  
information for immigrants seeking to become citizens contains a 
mistake about when men must register with Selective Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the government is being more strict about enforcing  
Selective Service rules, would-be citizens who think they're in 
compliance could be denied citizenship as a result of the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	In late December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
began distributing close to 700,000 copies of ``A Guide to 
Naturalization,'' a 47-page booklet which replaces a lengthy 
9-year-old volume. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems center on how the book explains Selective Service  
rules for a military draft, which require that all male immigrants 
register with the Selective Service when they are at least 18 but 
not yet 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide's glossary gives a summary of the rules that says  
males must register if they are over 26. The INS acknowledges it 
made an error, but there are no plans to recall the guides. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake will be corrected in the next printing, which should  
take place in about a month.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Named as Rumor Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sidney Blumenthal's lawyer was so determined  
to show the White House aide never leaked a rumor about Monica 
Lewinsky being a stalker that he released journalists from any pact 
of confidentiality and challenged them to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Now one has.  
</P>
<P>
	Journalist Christopher Hitchens has sworn an affidavit stating  
Blumenthal several times described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker'' 
and President Clinton as ``the victim'' of a predatory and unstable 
young woman, when they had lunch in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the affidavit were being circulated in the Capitol  
late Saturday and the document was a topic of informal conversation 
among a number of senators, as well as others who saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the Justice Department could  
investigate any false testimony given the Senate, but that the 
assertion by Hitchens was ``collateral at best'' to the overall 
question of whether the president should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel, took exception to the  
implication that Hitchens had any confidentiality agreement with 
Blumenthal, but declined to comment directly on the Hitchens 
assertions -- including whether the two had lunch last March 19 as 
Hitchens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said it was ``misleading if not false'' to imply that  
Blumenthal had such an agreement with Hitchens ``because he didn't 
talk to anybody as a source on a background basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Blumenthal's grand jury testimony was true and any  
implication or statement to the contrary is mistaken,'' McDaniel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens did not respond immediately to a telephoned request for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has repeatedly denied being the source of disparaging  
comments to the press about Ms. Lewinsky. Asked about that in a 
deposition taken Wednesday for the impeachment trial, he testified: 
``I have no idea how anything came to be attributed to a White 
House source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, McDaniel had asserted his client ``didn't peddle it, he  
didn't urge people to write about it, he didn't tell people about 
it, he wasn't the source for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel went on to say ``if anybody in their mind thinks they  
have a pledge of confidentiality to Sidney ... they're released; 
let them come forward and say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens, a freelance British journalist based in Washington who  
contributes to Vanity Fair and The Nation, said he had lunch with 
Blumenthal and someone else March 19, 1998, at the Occidental 
restaurant in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Report Criticizes Vinyl in Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sweet, smiling faces of some popular toys  
could contain a hidden chemical hazard, the environmental activist 
group Greenpeace warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many manufacturers continue to use a common vinyl additive  
despite fears that it could seep into children's mouths when they 
chew or suck on toys, according to Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that the things that our children are playing with,  
embracing, sleeping with ... and chewing on, gnawing on, could be 
toxic is frightening,'' said Tracy Shelton, a lawyer at the New 
York Public Interest Research Group, which joined Greenpeace at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The additive, from a class of chemicals called phthalates, is  
put into vinyl to make the otherwise brittle plastic soft and 
flexible. When children put some toys into their mouths, phthalates 
``will come out of the plastic similar to the way water will come 
out of a damp sponge,'' asserted Rick Hind of Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of an industry group criticized the report. ``This is  
just more of the usual Greenpeace scare tactics,'' said David 
Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers of America. ``Vinyl toys 
are absolutely safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission has said high doses of  
phthalates have been linked in laboratory studies to cancer in mice 
and rats. They also are a suspected source of liver and kidney 
damage in laboratory animals. But the commission said scientists 
disagree about whether the chemical poses a risk to people. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the safety commission asked manufacturers to stop  
selling certain baby rattlers and teething toys that contain 
phthalates, but said there is little chance they could harm 
children. It did not order the chemical banned outright. 
</P>
<P>
	Hind said there were several safer plastics that could be used  
in toys instead of vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace, which released the report along with the activist  
groups Generation Green and Mothers &AMP; Others, praised six 
manufacturers which it said had agreed to stop selling vinyl 
products: Lego Systems, Early Start, Little Tikes, Primetime 
Playthings, Sassy and Tiny Love. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report named other companies as not planning to  
eliminate phthalates or vinyl, even in toys meant to be put in 
children's mouths: Warner Brothers, Discovery Toys, Lamaze Infant 
Development, Manhattan Baby, Munchkin and Wimmer-Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Brothers and Lamaze defended the safety of their  
products. Manhattan Baby and Wimmer-Ferguson said they were 
replacing vinyl in some toys. Discovery Toys said it had eliminated 
phthalates in all teething products.

<HEADLINE> Filmmakers Sue Over Mulish Mule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This movie mule played its part too well.  
</P>
<P>
	Movie producers are suing an animal wrangler because the mule  
she brought onto the set allegedly was more than stubborn, it was 
unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
	Makers of the yet-to-be released film ``Morgan's Ferry'' are  
seeking $111,111 from Alicia Rudd of Wilmington, N.C., and her 
company Rudd Dogs Inc. The lawsuit claims a rented mule refused to 
sit on its haunches. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides refusing to sit, the mule got downright ornery,  
endangering the cast and crew, said Allison Hart, the lawyer 
representing Morgan's Ferry Productions. Extra costs included 
paying the unruly mule's owner and an assistant to come and tame 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd said she was awaiting court papers before giving her side  
of the story.

<HEADLINE> US, Europe Near Data Privacy Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and the European Union are  
making progress on how to protect the flow of personal data and 
avert a dispute that could seriously disrupt business transactions 
between the United States and Europe, a senior Clinton 
administration official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of Commerce William Daley said he was optimistic an  
agreement could be reached in time for the U.S.-EU summit in Berlin 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making progress,'' Daley said at a news conference.  
``The consultations are continuing and we're still optimistic. We 
don't expect an interruption in the flow of data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have been struggling to find a solution to the  
dispute over the EU's data protection directive since last summer 
but failed to do so before the measure went into effect in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The directive authorizes data regulators in each of the 15 EU  
nations to halt exports of personal data to countries they believe 
do not have adequate arrangements to protect the data. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU countries consider that the United States has a  
decentralized approach to data protection -- a mixture of law and 
self regulation -- that does not meet the standards of its new 
directive. 
</P>
<P>
	So far EU member states have not threatened to disrupt transfers  
of information. Some are still trying to decide how to implement 
the directive. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,  
said the two sides have agreed to the concept of ``safe harbors'' 
for U.S. companies that agree to follow a set of principles on data 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. businesses meet the standards outlined by the safe  
harbor principles they would be regarded as being in compliance 
with the EU privacy directive, Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the standards the two sides will discuss in further  
negotiations in March and April include notifying European 
customers that U.S. companies are collecting personal data about 
them, obtaining agreement that the information can be collected and 
passed on to third parties if this applies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, European customers would be given assurance that  
all information collected would kept secure and up to date and that 
European customers have the right to access the information and 
correct any errors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. companies have expressed concern to Commerce Department  
officials that they could be overwhelmed by requests from European 
customers for information the companies obtain about them.

<HEADLINE> Knicks, Heat Square Off Sunday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Knicks and Miami Heat both are a little angry going  
into Sunday's renewal of their bitter rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York opened the season with a 93-85 loss Friday at Orlando,  
while Miami was routed at home by Detroit, 95-81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat defeat followed lackluster showings by the defending  
Atlantic Division champions in a pair of preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be totally alarmed right now, but we've got to nip it  
in the bud before it gets worse,'' Heat center Alonzo Mourning 
said. ``It's just a small wound now. We don't want it to get any 
bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win at New York would give Miami a big boost, but Knicks fans  
have other plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a hostile environment,'' Mourning said.  
``It's to be expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bad blood between teams, fostered by bruising playoff  
showdowns the past two season, has a new element with the Knicks' 
acquisition of Latrell Sprewell, the controversial coach-choking 
guard. Sprewell could give New York the added scoring punch they 
need to overtake Miami in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization is all about winning -- not just having a  
mediocre season, but having a great season and winning the whole 
thing,'' Sprewell said following Friday's loss. ``I haven't had 
that, so to have that is definitely something positive for me. 
We're going to work toward that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks barely made the playoffs last year, then upset Miami  
in the first round in a series marked by a brawl and barbs between 
coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy. There were also punches 
thrown two years ago, and the Heat eliminated a Knicks team 
depleted by suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami and New York consider themselves title contenders this  
year, and Sunday's meeting is the first of four during the regular 
season. The Heat went out of their way to downplay the significance 
of the game, in part because they must also play Monday at 
Charlotte and Tuesday against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is tough, not just New York,'' Mourning said.  
``Everybody is hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are going to come fast and furious,'' Van Gundy  
said. ``We need to somehow improve in the short practice time that 
we have and play a very good Miami team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Heat start playing better, they'll be hard-pressed to  
beat anyone. Miami's 81 points Friday was a franchise low for a 
season opener. The Heat looked sluggish on offense and tentative on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's opening night, and you can't read too much into it,''  
Pistons center Bison Dele said. ``You think Miami is going to go 
0-50? Miami's not going to go 0-50. Miami is a team that could go 
40-10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a loss Sunday would put the Heat in a hole at the start of  
this shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel good about this team,'' Riley said. ``There are a  
lot of games to play. It's going to be a very competitive Eastern 
Conference. We'll sort it out.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Says `Dead' Taxpayers Are OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't worry: Anybody who got a W-2 form marked  
``deceased'' probably isn't. And the forms aren't dead, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service announced Friday that thousands of  
taxpayers who got the forms can send them in with their returns 
without correcting them. If they have been corrected, that is OK, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	But just to make sure people do not panic, the IRS said in a  
statement that companies should ``alert their employees to the 
error and reassure them'' that everything is all right. 
</P>
<P>
	The errors, which cropped up in places from Saratoga Springs,  
N.Y., to El Paso, Texas, appeared in Box 15 of the W-2 -- the form 
that describes annual earnings, how much taxes were paid and so on. 
Box 15 is used to indicate such items as deferred compensation, 
pension plan coverage, or a deceased person. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, according to the IRS, when the number of items in  
Box 15 was reduced from seven to five, some employment tax software 
developers overlooked this change or used printing specifications 
that gave incorrect spacing between the items. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is not related to the Year 2000 computer glitch, IRS  
spokesman Don Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports began to surface this week that thousands of employees  
around the country had an ``X'' printed in the box showing them as 
deceased. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the local funeral directors even called me up to offer  
a special group rate,'' said J. Michael O'Connell, mayor of 
Saratoga Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other places were the mistake was reported were Dickson, Okla.;  
Muscogee County, Ga.; New Mexico State University; and the North 
Dakota university system. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is not sure how many taxpayers have been affected, but  
officials say the errors will not affect the processing of the tax 
return or the amount of any refund. The IRS says it will not impose 
any penalties and employers do not have to notify the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the IRS later matches employers' W-2 data with employees'  
tax returns, it will take steps to avoid contacting taxpayers about 
this matter,'' the IRS statement said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Rapist's Sentence Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP)-- An appeals court has overturned a rapist's  
51-year prison sentence because a judge turned to the Bible while 
deciding his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals ruled Friday that James  
Arnett can return to court and seek a lesser sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, 33, pleaded guilty to raping and molesting the  
8-year-old daughter of his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	In handing down the 51-year sentence in January 1998, Hamilton  
County Common Pleas Judge Melba Marsh Marsh referred to a Bible 
verse that says anyone who offends a child would be better off if 
``a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned 
in the depth of the sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court concluded that Marsh acted outside Ohio's  
sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stress that this case is unusual in that a specific text in  
the Christian Bible was the determining factor in the judge's 
imposition of punishment,'' appellate Judge Mark Painter wrote in 
the court's 2-1 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mike Allen plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> VW Voluntarily Recalls Two Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Volkswagen is voluntarily recalling  
its 1999 Jetta and Golf four-door models due to sound-absorbing 
material in the doors that might have been improperly installed and 
could catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall involves about 11,585 Jettas and Golfs in the United  
States and 1,385 Jettas sold in Canada, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat belt tension system, designed to provide extra  
protection in severe collisions, creates heat and could potentially 
ignite the material if it has been damaged by improper 
installation, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	No accidents or injuries have resulted from the problem, and  
only one reported incident in a controlled test environment, the 
automaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail. Dealers  
will remove the material, which is designed to reduce sound at 
higher speeds, from the door pillars. All work will be completed at 
no cost to the customer.

<HEADLINE> Can Your Cholesterol Be Too Low? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- While off-the-chart cholesterol levels  
can trigger strokes, a new study raises the possibility that 
unusually low amounts may sometimes cause them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	High cholesterol is always portrayed in public health messages  
as an undivided evil. A study presented Saturday at the American 
Heart Association's annual stroke conference suggests that, in 
truth, the facts about cholesterol are a little more complicated, 
even though on balance low cholesterol is still far better than 
high cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, experts have been convinced that too much  
cholesterol, particularly the variety called low-density 
lipoprotein, or LDL, increases the risk of heart disease. But the 
link between cholesterol and strokes is less clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study attempted to sort this out by looking  
separately at the effects of cholesterol on the two kinds of 
strokes -- bleeding strokes and clot strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that very high cholesterol raises the risk of strokes  
that result from blood clots in the brain. But it also showed that 
low cholesterol increases the hazard of the less common but 
potentially devastating hemorrhagic strokes that result from burst 
blood vessels in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The study calculated that the perfect cholesterol level -- at  
least, for preventing strokes -- is about 200, which coincidentally 
is the target established by the federal government's National 
Cholesterol Education Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear I didn't plan it that way,'' said Dr. David L.  
Tirschwell of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts argued that the study does not change the  
overriding public health message. Even if low cholesterol carries a 
small risk, they said, the hazard is vastly overshadowed by its 
other benefits to the heart and the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	By preventing heart attacks and clot strokes, ``lowering  
cholesterol far, far outweighs the potential negatives of a 
hemorrhagic stroke,'' said Dr. Philip B. Gorelick of Rush 
Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the United  
States, while strokes are No. 3, striking about 600,000 Americans 
annually. About 80 percent of strokes -- what doctors call ischemic 
strokes -- occur when a blood clot blocks an artery, choking off 
oxygen and nutrients to a section of the brain. The rest are 
hemorrhagic strokes and result from ruptured blood vessels that 
flood the brain with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirschwell studied 587 victims of ischemic strokes and 137  
victims of hemorrhagic strokes and compared them to 3,743 healthy 
people. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
	--People with cholesterol over 280 were twice as likely as those  
at 230, the group's average, to have an ischemic stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	--People with cholesterol under 180 had double the risk of those  
at 230 for a hemorrhagic stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	--High cholesterol probably accounts for 10 percent to 15 percent  
of ischemic strokes. Low cholesterol is the cause of perhaps 7 
percent of hemorrhagic strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our data imply that for stroke, an optimal level may be around  
200,'' Tirschwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	While no one knows precisely how low cholesterol might  
contribute to hemorrhagic stroke, Tirschwell said one possibility 
is that cholesterol is needed to keep blood vessels strong to 
prevent rupture. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart association vice president Dr. Rodman Stark criticized the  
study for failing to break down people's cholesterol into the bad 
LDL and the good HDL, which protects the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you accept his conclusion is true, which I don't think  
was justified, you might still accept a slightly increased risk of 
hemorrhagic stroke in order to significantly reduce the risk of 
ischemic stroke, which is four-fifths of the stroke burden,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Remember Buddy Holly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEAR LAKE, Iowa (AP) -- Even after 40 years, the music keeps  
them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're celebrating rock 'n' roll,'' said Barbara Rau, a legal  
secretary from Hawthorne, N.J., who has made a tradition of 
spending early February at a northern Iowa dance hall made famous 
by fate. ``It's all the music, but mainly, of course, we come for 
Buddy Holly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rau was among more than 2,000 fans who packed into the Surf  
Ballroom in Clear Lake on Saturday to dance to '50 tunes and 
remember three rising rock 'n' roll stars who played their last 
concert there. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper''  
Richardson died Feb. 3, 1959, just after performing at the Surf. 
They took off from the Mason City airport in the middle of a 
snowstorm and their four-seater plane crashed in a cornfield about 
five miles north of Clear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, the Surf held a weekend tribute near the time of the  
crash. It has grown into an annual party capped by a concert that 
sells out months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rau, 50, said she has made friends at the tribute from as far  
away as Australia and they meet in Clear Lake every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, it's one big meeting point and we all get together  
and we all go out,'' she said. ``It's kind of like a family 
reunion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women who were teen-agers when the singers died may be  
grandmothers now, but they still wore poodle skirts and bobby socks 
Saturday. And scarves were all the rage for a group that makes an 
annual trip from England. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd danced and reminisced to the tunes of the Crickets,  
Holly's back-up band; Bobby Vee; and other '50s stars. 
</P>
<P>
	A line stretched out the door Saturday afternoon as people  
waited to get autographs from the performers. Cameras were 
everywhere, with Surf visitors preserving their memories of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear Lake Police Lt. Mike Cookman was a big draw out front of  
the ballroom with a restored 1958 police car. He good-naturedly 
pretended to frisk people as they posed for pictures beside the old 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been non-stop since I brought it down here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cookman, who has been a policeman for 27 years, lived in Clear  
Lake when the singers died, but did not get to go to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the seventh grade and I was grounded because I didn't  
get home on time the night before,'' Cookman said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Clive Harvey of North Hamptonshire, England, made it his 11th  
tribute concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey, 52, said he can still remember the whispers that spread  
through his school back in 1959, with word that Holly was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Buddy Holly fan,'' he said. ``Like a lot of  
people, I thought I was the only one. But now I'm coming across 
more and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey said that the Surf, with its kitschy, '50s-style interior  
and Holly memorabilia, makes people ``imagine what it was like back 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be doing this in another 10 years, we'll be coming here  
in our wheelchairs,'' he said. ``It keeps you young in the middle 
of winter. It gives you that buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted and Pat Pool, a retired couple from Abilene, Texas, were  
attending their second Holly reunion. They said the music is the 
big draw, but they also like the friendliness of a small, 
Midwestern town. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are realistic people here,'' Ted said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Rearranges Shuttle Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Problems with an X-ray telescope and  
Russia's inability to get a key piece of the international space 
station into orbit have forced NASA to rearrange its entire shuttle 
flight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's decision on Friday means five shuttle flights in  
1999 instead of six -- fewer than the seven or eight per year 
desired by NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also means a gap of nearly six months between  
shuttle launches, from last December until May, when the next 
mission is now targeted. That's the longest gap since the 2 1/2-year 
hiatus following the 1986 Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, NASA discovered faulty circuit boards in its  
$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope. What's more, the cash crunch 
in Russia has led to another delay in completing the crucial 
service module for the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-ray telescope was supposed to soar aboard space shuttle  
Columbia in April. But NASA on Friday postponed the launch until 
July because it will take weeks, and perhaps months, to replace the 
four bad circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful Chandra, named after a Nobel-winning  
astrophysicist, is intended to detect faint sources of cosmic 
X-rays, such as quasars, exploded stars and possibly black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said that instead of Columbia, Discovery will be the next  
shuttle to lift off, ferrying supplies to the international space 
station in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia will follow on July 9 with the first female shuttle  
commander, Eileen Collins, at the helm. That's nearly a year past 
the original launch date, a delay that already has cost NASA $39 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian service module, which contains all the life-support  
systems for the fledgling station, is expected to be launched no 
earlier than September. The Russians had promised to have it ready 
by July. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the delays, NASA on Friday bumped Atlantis' station  
ferry flight from August to October and Discovery's ferry flight 
from October to December. Those missions cannot be accomplished 
until the service module is in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other shuttle flight this year is a radar-mapping  
mission by Endeavour in September.

<HEADLINE> GOP Vows To Protect Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A member of Congress hopes he can protect  
today's retirees from future changes in Social Security with a bill 
that would guarantee no cuts in their current benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we must improve the system for working Americans, the  
benefits today's seniors have come to count on cannot and will not 
be changed in any way,'' Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said in the 
weekly Republican radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said House leaders have agreed to move on his legislation  
over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has talked to thousands of seniors in his home state  
who fear that expected Social Security reforms will end up costing 
them their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under President Clinton's plan, outlined in his State of the  
Union address, $2.7 trillion of $4.4 trillion in projected 
government surpluses over the next 15 years would be devoted to 
bolstering the Social Security system. The administration says 
these proposals would keep the system from running out of cash 
until 2055, instead of 2032 as now projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has cautioned that any  
solution almost certainly would require either benefit cuts or 
higher taxes, because the system is so underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has not proposed any change in benefits, but has said he  
and Congress must work together to see if other adjustments are 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said his aim was to ensure retired Americans would not lose  
as a result of any changes. ``No matter what other reforms need to 
be made to make the program solvent in the future, there will be no 
change in benefits to current or soon-to-be retirees.''

<HEADLINE> 2nd Man Dies From Ford Rouge Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A second person has died from injuries suffered  
in an explosion at an electrical power station for a Ford Motor Co. 
plant, four days after the accident injured at least 19 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Boatwright, 51, died Friday afternoon, University of  
Michigan Hospital spokeswoman Carol Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight others injured in the blast Monday remained in critical  
condition at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Three victims remained in critical condition at an Ohio hospital  
and three others were critical at a Detroit hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Pipe fitter Donald Harper, 58, died on the day of the explosion.  
</P>
<P>
	A state inspector said Thursday that the explosion was caused by  
a gas buildup inside a boiler at the power station. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker is pushing to resume production Monday at  
the complex, which makes Ford Mustangs as well as engines and a 
variety of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North 
American assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beefs Up Cyber-Patrols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- At a secret location somewhere in Tokyo, dozens of  
specialists in cryptography and electronic media will soon be hard 
at work patrolling cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to open by July, the new headquarters for the National  
Police Agency's ``cyber-cop'' squad signals growing concern about 
computer security as more and more Japanese join the global online 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	And while unauthorized computer snooping in Japan is less common  
than in the United States, a sharp jump in computer-related crimes 
in recent years has rattled authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is no surprise -- legally, Japan is a hacker's  
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking into a computer system isn't even a crime in Japan,  
which sets it apart from most other major industrialized nations. 
Hackers are free to peep at sensitive data stored in Japanese 
mainframes so long as they don't destroy or sell any of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have fallen behind other countries in this area,'' said Kei  
Hata, a member of Parliament who serves as deputy head of the 
ruling party's Internet policy committee. ``It's a problem which 
must be addressed quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worry about the potential for computer-generated chaos has  
prompted Tokyo to draft legislation to outlaw unauthorized access. 
A bill is expected to be submitted in the current session of 
Parliament, which ends in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes amid pressure from Washington to bolster  
international efforts to fight crime in cyberspace and dismay in 
Japan over abuses such as the widespread transmission of child 
pornography and even poison sales via suicide-related Websites. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is still relatively new to Japan.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the number of high-tech crimes known to Japanese police  
climbed to 263, up from 178 the previous year and just 32 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a recent NPA survey showed that only 4 percent of  
companies and colleges polled reported cases of unauthorized access 
serious enough to inflict damage on their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the San Francisco-based Computer Security  
Institute and the FBI found that 64 percent of 520 U.S. 
corporations, government agencies, financial institutions and 
universities responding to a 1998 survey had at least one computer 
security violation within the previous 12 months. More than 70 
percent suffered financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese police suspect the true number of computer crimes is  
much higher than the official figure, and note that many businesses 
keep security problems under wraps to avoid negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are particularly reluctant to disclose entanglements  
with organized crime syndicates, known as the yakuza. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yakuza have moved into this field,'' said Shunichi Kawabe,  
an official in the NPA's information technology bureau. ``They are 
very interested in making money in this type of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Internet-brokered gun trafficking, Web page-based  
pornography distribution and computer-generated financial fraud are 
among the areas suspected of being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrill-seekers are also stirring up trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	One hacker broke into a computer network used by the Hokkaido  
University of Education in northern Japan and gained access to 
login IDs and passwords used by about 1,000 employees and students. 
The university uncovered the security breach last month and shut 
down the entire network. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan plans to step up computer training programs for police,  
but authorities acknowledge they have a long way to go before 
catching up with their counterparts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the cops is that Japanese hackers also lag  
behind their cohorts overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestic cyber-criminals are still low-tech,'' said Kawabe.

<HEADLINE> 5 Boys Missing at Idaho Ski Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- Five teen-age boys were reported missing  
Saturday in blizzard conditions at Idaho's Schweitzer Mountain ski 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The ski patrol began a search for the boys at about 4:30 p.m,  
but called off the effort hours later because of an avalanche 
threat created by heavy snowfall and wind gusts up to 50 mph, 
Bonner County sheriff's Cpl. Bob Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ground search was expected to resume in the morning, weather  
permitting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the missing boys were brothers from Canada on a family  
ski outing. The three others were 15-year-old boys from Spokane, 
Wash., Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not know whether the boys, who had been skiing  
during the day, were carrying any food or emergency gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer is a popular resort located just outside Sandpoint in  
the Selkirk Mountains of northern Idaho. Peaks near the resort 
exceed 6,000 feet.

	Lewinsky Tape Shown on Senate Floor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parts of Monica Lewinsky's Feb. 1 videotaped  
deposition were played on the Senate floor today in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. TV networks broadcast Ms. Lewinsky's 
appearance nationwide. House prosecutors used segments of Ms. 
Lewinsky's deposition in an effort to bolster their case against 
the president. White House lawyer Nicole Seligman called the 
pick-and-choose clips ``terribly misleading.'' Sen. Barbara Boxer, 
D-Calif., said she saw no trial-altering impact. ``I don't think 
it's a bombshell to see her, to put the voice and the face 
together,'' Boxer said. The trial is set to resume Monday at 1 p.m. 
EST.

	Byrd Says He Might Vote To Convict

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just two weeks after offering a motion to  
dismiss the impeachment case, Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said today 
he might vote to convict President Clinton. In an ABC interview to 
be aired tomorrow, Byrd said there is ``no doubt about it in my 
mind'' that the charges against Clinton rise to ``high crime and 
misdemeanors.'' But he declined to say how he will vote on 
conviction. ``It will be very difficult to stand and say 'not 
guilty,' very difficult,'' Byrd said. ``Who is kidding who here? I 
have to live with myself. I have to live with my conscience, and I 
have to live with the Constitution.''

	Violence Hits Kosovo As Talks Begin

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- New violence rocked Kosovo even as  
peace negotiations between Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians 
opened here today. A bomb exploded outside an ethnic Albanian-owned 
vegetable market in Pristina today, killing three people, witnesses 
said. Under the threat of NATO guns, the two sides are faced with 
intense international pressure to make peace in just two weeks. 
Negotiators will be working on a framework plan that calls for a 
three-year period of autonomy for Kosovo, maintenance of Serb 
territorial integrity, protection of minorities and a police force 
that reflects the ethnic community.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The powers of the monarchy passed from the  
dying King Hussein to his oldest son today. The transfer of 
authority over the military and Cabinet closed nearly a 
half-century of rule by Hussein, who survived coup and 
assassination attempts and waged war against Israel but later made 
peace. Hussein had been under sedation since Wednesday, after a 
bone marrow transplant failed in the United States, a source said. 
Death was expected once cancer reached his heart, ``in a matter of 
hours or days,'' the source said.

	Clinton Urges Gun Show Checks

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton requested legislation today  
to require background checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows, 
which he says have become ``cash-and-carry convenience stores for 
weapons used to maim and kill.'' The new national policy, Clinton 
said, should be: ``No background check, no gun. No exceptions.'' 
The National Rifle Association called his proposal a ``public 
relations stunt'' and said the federal government is not enforcing 
existing gun control laws.

transporting a suspect in last year's deadly U.S. Embassy bombings 
to the United States for questioning, news reports said today. 
Justice Philip Waki in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa yesterday 
ordered immigration officials not to allow U.S. investigators to 
take Kenyan mechanic Ali Mahfoudh Salim out of the country, the 
Daily Nation and the East African Standard reported. The Aug. 7 
bombing in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, killed 213 people and

spokesman Tim Smith said airline officials are ``very disappointed 
in this situation and regret the inconvenience it caused for our

Orlando Magic 95-75 tonight night for their first 2-0 start since 
1990. Geiger, who signed a $52 million, six-year contract as a free

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Inger Miller and Sevatheda Fynes were all alone.  
Regina Jacobs and Suzy Hamilton might as well have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller joined her father as a Millrose Games champion Friday  
night, edging Fynes in a unique women's 60-meter match race, while 
Jacobs pulled away from Hamilton in the mile in another 
head-to-head battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, cheered on by father Lennox Miller, beat Fynes by 0.004  
seconds, finishing in 7.194 seconds. Miller and Fynes, who won 
their four-woman heats to reach the final, were officially timed in 
7.20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so close, I didn't know who won,'' Miller said. ``It  
was different with just the two of us out there all alone. But you 
don't think about it when you're running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made the Millers the first father-daughter winners  
in the meet's 92-year history. Lennox Miller won the 60-yard dash 
in 1968 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a thrill to be here and see her compete,'' Lennox Miller  
said. ``It brings back a lot of memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs outdueled Hamilton in the mile, taking the lead with two  
laps remaining on Madison Square Garden's banked wood track and 
pulling away in the final half-lap 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to discount the other competitors, but it was just me and  
her,'' said Jacobs, who beat Hamilton by about 14 yards in the 
11-lap race with a time of 4:31.65. Hamilton finished in 4:33.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivals shook hands, and took a victory lap together.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Suzy and I made the race, so why not take a lap  
together,'' said Jacobs, who finished second to Hamilton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say it's a love fest, but we're being more  
civil,'' Hamilton said. ``After the race, she said, `Suzy, do the 
lap with me.' That was the first time she ever said anything to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 60, Maurice Greene solidified his position as the  
world's top sprinter, overcoming a slow start to defend his title 
in 6.51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have control at the start,'' said Greene, the 1997  
world champion. ``I didn't rush it. I just stayed calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to match his 1998 time of 6.46, the fastest ever in  
the United States, and was far short of his world indoor record of 
6.39.

Boulet with less than a half-lap remaining and finishing in

	Reggie Torian won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.59. Larry Wade  
finished second in 7.72, and Olympic decathlon champion Dan O'Brien 
was third in 7.76. Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked hurdler, 
false-started twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole vaulter Melissa Mueller set an American record, clearing 14  
feet, 8 3/4 inches -- the highest ever indoors in the United States by 
a woman -- to break the mark of 14-8 1/4 set by Stacy Dragila in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the fourth time I jumped at it, so I knew it was  
coming,'' Mueller said. ``I was going to do it sooner or later. I'm 
glad it was sooner.'' 
</P>

<P>
	Jay McAffrey, a spokesman for TRW, said Saturday he could not  
comment because he was unaware of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile defense system is part of the Space-Based Infrared  
System, a key component in the missile shield the Defense 
Department wanted to deploy by 2005. That system would protect the 
United States from an attack or an accidental missile launch by 
Russia or China. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and Cleveland-based TRW had been competing to develop the  
satellite sensors that would detect a missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is rocket science. It's not easy,'' said John Pike of the  
Federation of American Scientists. ``Clearly the two companies bit 
off more than they could chew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TRW contract was for $683 million, while Boeing's contract  
was worth $148 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said it hopes to award new contracts by April for  
a redesigned system that will be effective and affordable.

<HEADLINE> Event of the Year Wins Strub Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Event of the Year held off a late charge  
by Dr Fong to capture the $500,000 Strub Stakes for 4-year-olds by 
2 3/4 lengths Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Corey Nakatani and carrying 119 pounds, Event of the  
Year covered 1 1-8 miles in 1:47.65 and paid $4, $2.40 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strub Stakes was Event of the Year's third race and first  
victory since fracturing his knee while training for last year's 
Kentucky Derby. He finished third in the Dec. 26 Malibu Stakes and 
second in the Jan. 16 San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse was green in the Malibu. In the San Fernando he  
showed a lot of improvement, but he ran into a really good horse 
who was better that day,'' Nakatani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr Fong, ridden by Gary Stevens and carrying 121 pounds, paid  
$3.20 and $3. Hanuman Highway, ridden by Garrett Gomez and carrying 
117 pounds, finished third and paid $4 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $300,000, increased Event of the Year's  
career earnings to $886,200 with five wins in seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unbeaten Exploit, an early favorite for this year's  
Kentucky Derby, won his first start as a 3-year-old in the $150,000 
San Vicente Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploit beat Aristotle by a neck, covering seven furlongs in  
1:22 and paid $3.20 to win. There was no place or show wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, worth $90,000, raised Exploit's career earnings to  
$346,254.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Change Dinars to Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Nervous about the change in leadership  
Saturday, some Jordanians rushed to trade their dinars for U.S. 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no firm figures on the volume of Jordanian currency  
sold Saturday, the first day of the business week, but money 
exchangers reported a shortage of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no dollars. People are buying,'' said Mazen Saleh,  
the owner of an Amman currency exchange bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rush to buy dollars, the dinar remained stable. One  
dinar sold for just under $1.40, down about a half-cent from 
Thursday. There were reports Jordan's Central Bank sold about $10 
million for dinars to bolster the value of the Jordanian currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamal Ahmed, another money changer, said his shop had quickly  
exceeded its usual daily trading volume of about $200,000 in 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are a little bit worried,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The government was quick to issue reassurances about Jordan's  
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is fine. There is no need to worry,''  
Information Minister Nassir Joudeh told reporters. ``This is a 
country of institutions, of continuity.''

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Named as Rumor Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sidney Blumenthal's lawyer was so determined  
to show the White House aide never leaked a rumor about Monica 
Lewinsky being a stalker that he released journalists from any pact 
of confidentiality and challenged them to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Now one has.  
</P>
<P>
	Journalist Christopher Hitchens has sworn an affidavit stating  
Blumenthal several times described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker'' 
and President Clinton as ``the victim'' of a predatory and unstable 
young woman, when they had lunch in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the affidavit were being circulated in the Capitol  
late Saturday and was a topic of informal conversation among a 
number of senators, as well as others who saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the Justice Department could  
investigate any false testimony given the Senate, but that the 
assertion by Hitchens was ``collateral at best'' to the overall 
question of whether the president should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Hitchens nor Blumenthal's lawyer responded immediately  
to telephoned requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has repeatedly denied being the source of disparaging  
comments to the press about Ms. Lewinsky. Asked about that in a 
deposition taken Wednesday for the impeachment trial, he testified: 
``I have no idea how anything came to be attributed to a White 
House source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, lawyer William McDaniel asserted his client ``didn't  
peddle it, he didn't urge people to write about it, he didn't tell 
people about it, he wasn't the source for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel went on to say ``if anybody in their mind thinks they  
have a pledge of confidentiality to Sidney ... they're released; 
let them come forward and say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens, a freelance British journalist based in Washington who  
contributes to Vanity Fair and The Nation, said he had lunch with 
Blumenthal and someone else March 19, 1998, at the Occidental 
restaurant in Washington.. 
</P>
<P>
	``Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Blumenthal used the word  
'stalker' several times,'' Hitchens swore. ``Mr. Blumenthal advised 
us that this version of the facts was not generally understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens also swore he knows of other journalists told the same  
story by Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton referred to Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation  
he had with Blumenthal shortly after the affair became the subject 
of news reports. Blumenthal said he never passed that story around. 
Republicans have suspected he talked to the press to try to 
discredit the former White House intern.

<HEADLINE> Breast-Feeding Causes Fight in Wyo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A ruckus over a woman breast-feeding her  
baby in a restaurant led to a battery conviction against the 
restaurant owner's wife, who had forced the mother into a bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Walsh said she was discreetly breast-feeding her  
4-month-old son, Connor, when Theresa Frausto approached the table 
and said ``we have a chair in the bathroom for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got to the bathroom they had a dinky chair in there and  
the atmosphere was disgusting,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh and a friend decided to leave, but before they did, the  
mother approached Frausto and told her she was going to make it 
known that the establishment was not a breast-feeding-friendly 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Frausto said the woman turned to leave and she pinched her coat  
to keep her attention. Walsh claims she stumbled and tried not to 
drop her baby as Frausto grabbed her arm and jerked her back. 
</P>
<P>
	A shouting match ensued.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I am just from the olden days, but I get uncomfortable  
when I see a woman breast feeding and she is not covered up,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frausto pleaded guilty Friday and was fined $170.

<HEADLINE> Key Conservative Seeks End of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The founder of the Christian Coalition,  
a group that had pushed for President Clinton's impeachment, said 
Saturday it's time to give up and ``turn away from the Bill 
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky axis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference before Republican presidential hopefuls  
addressed the Christian Coalition in this first-in-the-nation 
primary state, Pat Robertson said the party must end the Senate 
trial and get ready for 2000. ``In jury terms, they have a hung 
jury and the sooner they can wrap it up the better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson made similar comment last month, but quickly backed  
off as congressional Republicans sought a way to end the trial 
without angering their most conservative voters. His remarks 
Saturday may provide political cover for Senate Republicans who 
plan to end the trial in the coming week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made the best of a bad situation,'' Robertson said.  
</P>
<P>
	His sentiments also reflect the need for both parties to get  
ready for life after impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several activists attending the Christian Coalition gathering  
said they were resigned to the trial's outcome, though not 
satisfied with the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Johnson, a New Hampshire state senator, said the trial  
should not have ended prematurely for political reasons, but 
suggested the coming week will be long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky on TV today, that  
should be enough testimony for (senators) to make their decision,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing disgust with Clinton's actions, claiming he has  
``hollowed out the moral soul of this nation,'' Robertson said the 
Republican Party must start framing its case to win the White House 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my feeling we need to turn our eyes away from the Bill  
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky axis and begin looking at the future of 
America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said presidential candidates must articulate their vision for  
national defense, schools and moral values, an issue he predicted 
will resonate in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Robertson told several hundred Christian Coalition  
activists, ``We can have a new day in American where you don't have 
Bill Clinton, where you don't have his chosen successor, where 
we're not plagued by liberals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, in remarks taped for the  
evening event, declared: ``We need to acknowledge the role of faith 
in our national life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other likely presidential candidates, Gary Bauer and Steve  
Forbes, avoided the impeachment scandal during their late-night 
addresses but looked ahead to their campaign agendas. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what they say about me ... I will not abandon our  
children for political gain,'' said anti-abortion activist Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we want the future of this great city to remain in the  
hands of Washington politicians?'' asked Forbes, who hopes to 
capitalize on anti-Washington sentiments made worse by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	This night of political theater played out as Republicans  
struggled in Washington to manage political fallout from Clinton's 
impeachment trial. In a juxtaposition that has flabbergasted 
Clinton-bashing conservatives, the president's approval ratings are 
up, Republican ratings down. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of party leaders fear that conservatives are  
pushing the GOP over a political cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no market in Manchester for that argument.  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, in an interview previewing his speech, said many  
conservatives are disappointed with Senate actions to shorten 
Clinton's trial. ``That has contributed to the sort of depressed 
attitude that I run into around the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeble election results in 1998, Congress' failure to pass tax  
cuts and the party's inability to articulate conservative values 
also contribute to the funk, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he said it will soon be time to look beyond the trial and  
shake the party out of its doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that we need to rally Republicans and conservatives  
right now to show that we're going to be focused in 2000 on the 
governing vision of our party,'' he said. ``We have an (agenda), 
and we should, with confidence, present it to the people of New 
Hampshire and to America.''

<HEADLINE> Farewell to Maple Leaf Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Back in April 1933, from a radio booth perched  
high over the ice of Maple Leaf Gardens, broadcaster Foster Hewitt 
first uttered hockey's most enduring words: ``He shoots! He 
scores!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The booth was torn down in 1979 to make room for private boxes.  
And now the NHL is bidding farewell to the Gardens itself -- the 
last of the legendary arenas used by the league's Original Six 
before expansion changed the face of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Maple Leafs play the Chicago Blackhawks on Feb. 13  
in the final NHL game at the Gardens. The teams also played in the 
arena's first game in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs inaugurate the Air Canada Centre on Feb. 20 against  
the Montreal Canadiens, about a mile away near Toronto's lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the old arenas have been abandoned -- the old Madison  
Square Garden in 1968, Detroit's Olympia Stadium in 1979, Chicago 
Stadium in 1994, Boston Garden in 1995 and the Montreal Forum in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the Leafs leaving the Gardens, the oldest venue in the  
NHL will be Pittsburgh's Civic Arena, built in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't replace a Maple Leaf Gardens,'' said Wayne Gretzky,  
who grew up within a two-hour drive of Toronto. ``It's a special 
place, sacred. We'll never recapture the atmosphere we had in those 
places. We'll have to create new excitement, new history, I 
suppose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the Gardens is uncertain. It will accommodate junior  
hockey, concerts and other events for the next two years while the 
owners ponder its fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in just six months for a Depression-era bargain price of  
$1.5 million, the yellow-brick, 15,746-seat arena has been the 
no-frills venue for more than 2,300 Leafs games and 19 Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been rodeos, dog races and a 1957 concert by Elvis  
Presley. The Beatles played in the Gardens on each of their three 
North American tours. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, a sex scandal has tarnished the arena.  
Police determined that at least two Gardens workers had lured 
dozens of boys into sex with offers of free tickets and other 
enticements during the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, however, could not erase the countless great hockey  
memories at the Gardens, perhaps topped by the seventh game of the 
1942 Stanley Cup finals. Toronto became the first major league team 
in North America to rally from an 0-3 deficit in a championship 
series, coming from behind in the third period of Game 7 against 
Detroit to win only the second Stanley Cup for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the Leafs have won 11 Stanley Cups, but none since 1967,  
when they beat Montreal with the NHL's oldest-ever championship 
team -- average age 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The team went downhill thereafter under the ownership of Harold  
Ballard, who lived in the Gardens and was a notorious 
penny-pincher. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, he removed a prominent portrait of Queen  
Elizabeth, which the players used to face during the national 
anthem, to make room for extra seats. In 1977, when the league 
ordered teams to put players' names on the backs of their jerseys, 
Ballard objected because he feared program sales would decline and 
he briefly protested by having blue letters sewn on blue jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent lack of titles, the Leafs have sold out  
virtually every home game in the past half-century. Hardcore fans 
grew accustomed to the Gardens' narrow, unpadded seats and cramped 
restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Torontonians not at games and hockey fans across  
Canada imagined themselves inside the Gardens thanks to the radio 
play-by-play of Foster Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt broadcast the opening game at the Gardens in 1931, and  
first proclaimed ``He shoots! He scores!'' on April 4, 1933, when 
Ken Doraty scored in a sixth overtime period to give the Leafs a 
1-0 Stanley Cup semifinal victory over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watched games on radio,'' recalled Toronto Star  
sportswriter Frank Orr. ``Kids today can't understand that, but we 
could picture the plays in our imagination. We had pictures that we 
sent away for so we knew what the players looked like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs' owners have tried to ensure that ordinary fans had a  
crack at seeing the farewell game without paying scalper prices as 
high as $2,000 (U.S.) a ticket. The team set aside 1,000 tickets in 
the upper sections to be distributed in a lottery for the regular 
price of $17.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that if we put them on public sale, scalpers were  
going to get them,'' said president and general manager Ken Dryden. 
``We wanted to do as much as we could to see that the real fan has 
a chance of getting into the building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also invited to the finale are former Leafs -- anyone who played  
50 or more games for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Leafs sometimes lacked superstars, other big-name  
players loved playing at the Gardens, especially Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a specialty of ricochet passes off the rink's lively  
boards and had one of his best-ever performances when he amassed 
four points while leading Los Angeles to a 5-4 victory over the 
Leafs in Game 7 of the 1993 Stanley Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any youngster who has ever grown up in that area or any of us  
who have been fortunate to play there can understand that arena is 
so special,'' Gretzky said. ``The easiest thing in the world is to 
get up for a hockey game in Maple Leaf Gardens.''

<HEADLINE> Longtime Senate Clerk Is Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate clerk whose reading of the roll has  
become familiar to viewers of President Clinton's impeachment trial 
was struck and killed by a motorist on a suburban street. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Senate trial session began with prayers and a moment  
of silence for Raymond Scott Bates, 50, a legislative clerk who 
worked at the Senate for almost 30 years. His wife also was struck 
in the Friday night accident and was injured critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates' chair, below that of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was  
draped with a black ribbon. Flowers were placed on the desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who can forget that resonant voice? Who can forget the call of  
the roll? Who can forget the authority in which he articulated each 
of our names?'' asked Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, joining Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in eulogizing 
Bates before the session opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators come, and senators go, but Scott has been a fixture  
in this Senate for the last 30 years,'' Lott said. ``He was not 
just a co-worker; he was a friend and a great guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates and his wife, Ricki Ellison Bates, were hit by a  
22-year-old driver from Manassas, Va., as they crossed a street in 
Arlington, Va., about 6:30 p.m. EST. The two were flown to 
Washington Hospital Center, where Bates died a few hours later. 
Mrs. Bates was listed in critical condition this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, whose identity was not released, was admitted to  
Arlington Hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries. No charges 
have been filed, but police say they are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers of the impeachment trial have frequently heard the deep  
voice of Bates as he read out the names of senators during votes. 
``In the quietness we can hear his voice call the roll,'' the 
Senate chaplain, the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pine Bluff, Ark., native, son of a member of the Arkansas  
legislature, came to Washington as a summer intern for Sen. John 
McClellan in 1970. He started his career in his present job in the 
Bill Clerk's Office in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates developed the first automated record-keeping system in the  
Senate and established its current system for numbering amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bates works for the Arlington County, Va., public school  
system, neighbors said. Bates also is survived by three children, 
Lisa and Lori, both in college, and Paul, an eighth-grader.

<HEADLINE> Edwards' Injury Blamed on Sand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- New England safety Lawyer Milloy, shocked to  
hear that Patriots' teammate Robert Edwards badly injured his knee 
during a flag football game, thinks playing on the sand may have 
contributed to the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a rookie who rushed for 1,115 yards this season,  
underwent surgery on his dislocated left knee Friday, a couple of 
hours after being hurt in the five-on-five game on Waikiki Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury may force him to miss the entire 1999 season.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're doing something competitive like that, things  
can happen,'' Milloy, one of three Patriots in the Pro Bowl, said 
before Saturday's AFC practice. ``It's a very unfortunate 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played in that game my first year and it was tough playing  
in the sand. That may have had something to do with it. You see 
them playing and think it's nothing, but it's hard to get around in 
the sand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards went up for a pass with Oakland's Charles Woodson and  
San Francisco's R.W. McQuarters, then the Patriots' rookie fell to 
the sand in obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to take,'' New England cornerback Ty Law said.  
``It's a shame something like that had to happen when you've just 
come out here to have fun. It was really a freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk about what it might mean to the team and  
everything, he's our star running back, but the focal point now

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tops Germany in Soccer 3-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- With little on the line, the United  
States soccer team had no problem beating Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months after the European champions pummeled the Americans  
2-0 in the World Cup opener for both nations, the United States 
rebounded for a 3-0 victory Saturday in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovan Kirovski, Tony Sanneh and Claudio Reyna -- all three play  
for German clubs -- scored during a 10-minute span in the first half 
as the U.S. team beat Germany for the first time in four games 
between the nations. In addition to the World Cup, Germany won a 
pair of exhibition games played in the United States in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first victory for the United States under new coach  
Bruce Arena and its first in seven games since a 2-0 win over 
Kuwait last May 24. Steve Sampson quit as coach after the Americans 
went 0-3 at the World Cup and finished last in the 32-nation field. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena, the former coach of D.C. United, began with scoreless  
ties against Australia and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory continued a series of upsets against former World  
Cup champions by the United States, joining victories over England 
(1993), Argentina (1995) and Brazil (1998). But in the World Cup, 
soccer's biggest stage, the Americans have struggled, going 1-8-1 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Germans, a three-time World Cup champion, their two-game  
trip to Florida was their first action since the Bundesliga started 
its mid-winter break in December. The Germans were missing forward 
Oliver Bierhoff and two others but otherwise had their first-choice 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, who mixed young players and veterans, pushed  
forward and controlled from start. Kirovski, who plays for Cologne 
in Germany's second division, scored in the 16th minute when his 
shot from the top corner of the penalty area went into the upper 
corner past goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanneh, who joined Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin last month  
after three seasons in MLS, made it 2-0 in the 24th and Reyna, who 
plays for VfL Wolfsburg, scored two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans, who have struggled since their quarterfinal loss to  
Croatia at the World Cup, didn't generate a consistent attack and 
created few chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans were so dominant that goalkeeper Tony Meola didn't  
touch the ball for the first 10 minutes and didn't handle a shot 
off the foot of a German player for nearly the entire first half. 
Meola got his 29th shutout in 89 international appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The goals were the first for the United States since a 2-1 loss  
to Iran at the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty To Swindling $7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When it came to bilking investors, Arthur Good  
didn't discriminate, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``He defrauded the young, he defrauded the old, he defrauded the  
rich, he defrauded the poor,'' federal prosecutor Stephen Huggard 
said. ``Arthur Good has ruined an awful lot of people's lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the 51-year-old investment broker and his  
partners swindled $7 million from at least 100 victims by telling 
and retelling the same tale. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had met Bill Marriott, heir to the Marriott hotel  
fortune, on a plane. He claimed Marriott had taken a shine to him 
and offered him an investment opportunity for which he needed $3.5 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, a tall, impressive-looking man, told investors they could  
double or triple their money in six months at absolutely no risk. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, wearing a gray pinstriped suit, polished wingtips and  
a gold signet ring on his little finger, Good pleaded guilty in 
federal court to 43 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say it was a little lie he told investigators that  
led to Good's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Good explained that clients who had complained about him were  
such good friends, they attended his mother's funeral. But when a 
quick check on the attendance revealed it wasn't true, federal 
authorities launched an all-out investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy presents a great image, he has the appearance of  
being trustworthy and honest and an upright citizen,'' said Matthew 
Nestor, chief of enforcement for the Massachusetts Securities 
Division. ``You can see how this could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Good and his still-unidentified partners were  
actually paying off early investors with money from later 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ripping off money, is all it was,'' Huggard said.  
</P>
<P>
	One investor asked Good to introduce him to Marriott to ensure  
his investment would be safe. Good then had a friend impersonate 
Marriott at a meeting held in a fancy restaurant in New York, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Good spent the money on a home in an exclusive neighborhood in  
the Boston suburb of Quincy, as well as jewelry, office 
improvements, charitable donations and seven cars, including three 
1998 BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
	Those assets have been seized, but it is unlikely Good's victims  
will get anything more than pennies on the dollar, said U.S. 
Attorney Donald K. Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are asking he get six to eight years in prison at  
sentencing in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The world's richest man, Bill Gates, has given  
away $3.34 billion in new donations for charities that fund health 
and education projects worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The money from Gates and his wife, Melinda, is believed to be  
the largest charitable gift ever made, Fortune magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation includes $2.23 billion to the William H. Gates  
Foundation, named after and administered by Gates' father, and 
$1.11 billion to the Gates Learning Foundation, Gates spokeswoman 
Rose Berg-Fosnaugh said Friday. 
</P>

and wealthier ones in Internet access and computer training. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' Microsoft holdings are worth more than $82 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Sees Lewinsky on Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told her story in public at  
long last on Saturday, testifying in videotape snippets before 
President Clinton's impeachment trial and a nationwide television 
audience about a White House sexual affair and cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	First House prosecutors, then the president's defense team  
served up segments of her taped deposition to the Senate to 
buttress the case for and against Clinton's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In portions aired at the behest of prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky  
said Clinton had never instructed her to tell the truth when word 
of the affair began to leak, responding ``correct'' when asked if 
that were the case. ``I knew I would deny the relationship,'' she 
also said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in tape shown by the Clinton defense team, she testified  
Clinton did not suggest she use their cover story in an affidavit 
she was to file in the Paula Jones lawsuit. In addition, she said 
she never thought the affidavit was to be false. Had Clinton 
suggested that, she said, ``I would have remembered something like 
that, and I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's image, a young woman in a dark dress adorned by a  
single, strand of pearls, lit up four large video monitors in the 
Senate chamber. Viewers saw her flip her hair from her face 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication that her testimony had shaken the  
prospects for Clinton's expected acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment by the end of the week. Already, Democrats were angling 
for Republican votes for a plan to censure the president following 
his acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, told reporters after the day's trial  
session he thought a majority of senators might vote Clinton 
guilty, more on the charge of obstruction of justice than on 
perjury. But that would be far less than the two-thirds needed to 
convict him and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic support for Clinton is overwhelming, although West  
Virginia's Sen. Robert C. Byrd left open the possibility in an ABC 
interview that he might vote to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, who two weeks ago offered the motion asking senators to  
dismiss the case against Clinton, says in an interview to be aired 
Sunday there is ``no doubt about it in my mind'' that the charges 
against Clinton rise to ``high crime and misdemeanors.'' But he 
declined to say how he will vote on conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very difficult to stand and say 'not guilty,' very  
difficult,'' Byrd said. ``Who is kidding who here? I have to live 
with myself. I have to live with my conscience, and I have to live 
with the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said Ms. Lewinsky had helped Clinton's cause.  
``She says over and over he never talked to her about the contents 
of the affidavit,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.. 
</P>
<P>
	But Craig said the prosecutors' presentation, which included  
videotaped testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, was ``devastating to 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third Saturday out of four that the Senate has met,  
and Chief Justice William Rehnquist was eager to move the 
proceedings along. When Majority Leader Trent Lott suggested a 
brief break at one point during the afternoon, Rehnquist 
interrupted, ``Let's keep going.'' That prompted loud laughter in 
the chamber, and applause from some senators. ``I guess that 
settles that,'' said Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, signaling its eagerness to wrap up the trial,  
refused earlier this week to allow House prosecutors to call Ms. 
Lewinsky for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, senators gave the prosecutors, then White House  
lawyers, three hours each to present portions of videotape to 
buttress their cases for and against Clinton's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., was scathing. Disputing Clinton's  
claim that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky had begun as a 
friendship, the California Republican said, ``The president 
impulsively began using her for his gratification the very day he 
first spoke to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He juxtaposed the image of Ms. Lewinsky, swearing an oath to  
tell the truth, with the familiar footage of Clinton denying sexual 
relations with ``that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the  
offenses in the articles of impeachment,'' Rogan said. Ms. Lewinsky 
was granted immunity from prosecution by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr, and could face prosecution if her testimony turned 
out to be false. 
</P>
<P>
	In one videotaped segment, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., was heard  
asking Ms. Lewinsky at her deposition: ``The president did not in 
that conversation on December the 17th of 1997, or any other 
conversation for that matter, instruct you to tell the truth, is 
that correct?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's correct,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal was shown several times saying that Clinton had lied  
to him in denying he had ever had sexual relations with the former 
White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jordan was shown fielding questions about his efforts to  
find a New York job for Ms. Lewinsky at Clinton's request, 
evidence, the prosecutors maintain, of an obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Ms., Lewinsky's appearance that was the highlight of  
the day's trial session. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled the night Clinton called to say she might be  
subpoenaed as a witness in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
The president spoke of the earlier cover stories they had devised 
to hide the affair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I learned in that conversation, I thought to myself  
I knew I would deny the relationship,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	She also recalled a conversation with Jordan, close friend to  
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sort of jokingly said to me, 'You know what your problem  
is, don't deny it, you are in love with him.' It was sort of 
lighthearted nature,'' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably blushed or giggled or something.''  
</P>
<P>
	But no sooner had prosecutors completed their presentation than  
Nicole Seligman, a private attorney for the president, was on her 
feet to rebut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The snippets you have seen are terrible misleading,'' she told  
the trial. House prosecutors have ``created a profoundly erroneous 
impression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off the Senate floor, Democrats were eager for passage of a  
censure resolution. One draft would accuse the president of 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are adamantly opposed to any censure, and one,  
Ted Stevens of Alaska, dismissed the draft in circulation as far 
too weak. ``It's just like a pat on the butt,'' he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Pro Bowl May Be Last Game for Elway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The Pro Bowl could be the last NFL game for John  
Elway and Reggie White. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, had intended to retire after this season, but the  
prospect of an unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship 
might prove irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
	The MVP of Denver's 34-19 Super Bowl win over Atlanta a week  
ago, Elway said he'll make a final decision within a couple of 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who at 37 led the NFL with 16 sacks and was selected the  
league's defensive player of the year, said earlier this week that 
he planned to retire, but he seemed to leave a slight chance that 
he'll return. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Rhodes' hiring as Green Bay's coach gave White some second  
thoughts about ending his career, since he's close friends with 
Rhodes. White retired last April, then changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is the second-oldest player on either Pro Bowl team,  
younger only than 39-year-old Gary Anderson, the Minnesota kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	Symbolic of the NFL's 1998 season, when older quarterbacks stood  
out, Atlanta's Chris Chandler is the baby at the position at 
Sunday's all-star game -- and he's 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, expected to play sparingly, is joined on the AFC squad by  
a couple of comeback ``kids,'' Buffalo's Doug Flutie, 36, and the 
New York Jets' Vinny Testaverde, 36. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the old men in a young man's game,'' said Flutie, who  
returned to the NFL after playing in Canada for eight years. ``I 
guess you could call us survivors. I know I am. At the beginning of 
the year, if you said Flutie, Chandler and (Randall) Cunningham 
would be in the Pro Bowl, people would have thought you were 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their counterparts along with Chandler on the NFC are San  
Francisco's Steve Young, 37, and Minnesota's Cunningham, 36. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just getting started,'' said Young, voted the NFC  
starter. ``Look at Chris and Randall, they're just coming of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, who retired in 1996 but signed with the Vikings the  
following year, had no explanation for his late success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say why all the quarterbacks are along mature lines,''  
he said. ``We're just the seasoned vets of the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, voted to start for the AFC, plans to play only one or two  
series, saying, ``Anyway, Flutie's a lot younger than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFC has a Broncos' air about it, with nine Denver players in  
uniform. Running back Terrell Davis, however, pulled out of the 
game because of a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' Curtis Martin will fill in for Davis; the other AFC  
running backs are Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk and Tennessee's 
Eddie George. AFC wide receivers include Denver's Ed McCaffrey, the 
Jets' Keyshawn Johnson and Jacksonville's Jimmy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Broncos on defensive are linebacker Bill Romanowski  
and free safety Steve Atwater. Jason Elam is the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC running backs are Jamal Anderson of the Falcons, Emmitt  
Smith of Dallas, and Robert Smith of Minnesota. Robert Smith is a 
replacement for Detroit's Barry Sanders, who has injured ribs.

<HEADLINE> How Teddy Bear Became a Clue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The teddy bear sought by authorities in  
the JonBenet Ramsey case first emerged as a clue in an interview 
last summer with her mother, Patsy Ramsey, The Denver Rocky 
Mountain News reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted two investigators as saying that Mrs.  
Ramsey claimed the toy did not belong in her slain daughter's room 
when she was shown crime scene pictures by police in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``She stiffened,'' said one investigator, speaking on condition  
of anonymity. ``The way it was described she went white. ... She 
was saying, `Where did it come from? I've never seen that 
before.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter posted a  
photograph of a stuffed toy bear dressed in a Santa Claus suit on 
the Internet and asked for the public's help in finding information 
about the bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter refused to comment on how the toy might be connected to  
the investigation of the 1996 slaying of 6-year-old JonBenet. 
Investigators say they now know the manufacturer, distribution and 
sale points of the bear, but won't say why they need this 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The little girl's parents remain under suspicion as a grand jury  
investigates the crime. The Ramseys have proclaimed their 
innocence.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Video Depositions-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from video segments of depositions of Monica Lewinsky,  
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. Questioners Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.; Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark.; and James Rogan, R-Calif., impeachment 
managers: 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Did the President then give you his account of what  
happened between him and Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: As I recall, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: What did the President tell you?  
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: He spoke fairly rapidly as I recall at that point,  
and said that she had come on to him and made a demand for sex. 
That he had rebuffed her, turned her down, and that she threatened 
him. And he said that she said to him that she was called ``The 
Stalker'' by her peers and that she hated the term. And that she 
would claim that they had had an affair, whether they had or they 
hadn't. And that she would tell people. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Do you remember the President also saying that -- and I'm  
quoting -- ``I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain for a 
lot of people. I'm not going to do that again''? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes. He told me that.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: And that was in the same conversation that you had with  
the President? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Right, in -- in that sequence.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Can you describe for us the president's demeanor when he  
shared this information with you? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was a man  
in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: Now you mentioned that she had sent you a -- I guess  
some people refer to it -- a wish list, or a list of jobs that she 
...
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: Not jobs, companies.  
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: ... companies that she would be interested in  
seeking employment with. 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And you looked at that, and you determined that you  
wanted to go with your own list of friends and companies that you 
had better contacts with. 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: I'm sure, Congressman, that you, too, have been in this  
business, and you do know that you can only call people that you 
know, or if you're comfortable in calling. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: Absolutely. No question about it. And let me just  
comment and ask your response to this. But many times, I will be 
listed as a reference and that can take that to any company, you 
might be listed as a reference. And the name Vernon Jordan would be 
a good reference anywhere, would it not? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: I would hope so.  
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And so even though it was a company that you might  
not have the best contact with, you know, you could have been 
helpful in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Miss  
Lewinsky. And therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me, I knew where I would need to call. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did you express your frustration to Mr. Jordan with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I expressed that sometimes I had frustrations with  
him, yes. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: And what was his response to you about after you talked  
about the president? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: He sort of jokingly said to me you know what your  
problem is, and don't deny it -- you're in love with him. But it was 
sort of lighthearted nature. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did you have a response to that?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I probably blushed or giggled or something.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Now when he alluded to that cover story, was that  
instantly familiar to you? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: You knew what he was talking about?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: And why was this familiar to you?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Because it was part of the pattern of the  
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories  
were reiterated to you by the president that night on the 
telephone. ... 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Correct.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: ... after he told you you would be a witness or your  
name was on the witness list, I should say? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Correct.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: And did you understand that since your name was on the  
witness list that there would be a possibility that you could be 
subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and  
there was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I 
necessarily thought it was a subpoena to testify, but ... 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Were you, in fact, subpoenaed to testify?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And did you make any specific inquiry as to the  
nature of the relationship that she had with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: Yeah, at some point during that conversation, I asked  
her directly if she had had sexual relationships with the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And is this not an extraordinary question to ask a  
24-year-old intern: whether she had sexual relations with the 
president of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: Not if you had witnessed her emotional state and this  
thing, as I say. It was not. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And her emotional state and what she expressed to  
you about her feelings for the president is what prompted you to 
ask that question? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: That plus the question of whether or not the president  
at the end of his term, would leave the first lady. And that was 
alarming and stunning to me. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And she related that question to you in that meeting  
on Dec. 19? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: Now, going back to the question, in which you ask  
her if there -- if she had had a sexual relationship with the 
president. What was her response? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And I'm sure that that was not an idle question on  
your part. And I presume that you needed to the know the answer for 
some purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: I wanted to know the answer based on what I had seen in  
her expression, obviously based on the fact that this was a 
subpoena about her relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And so you felt like you needed to know the answer  
to that question, to determine how you were going to handle a 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: No, I thought it was factual data that I needed to know,  
and I asked the question. 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: And why did you need to know the answer to that  
question? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: I am referring this lady, Ms. Lewinsky, to various  
companies for jobs, and it seemed to me that it was important for 
me to know in that process whether or not there had been something 
going on with the president, based on what I saw and based on what 
I heard.

	Lewinsky Tape Aired on Senate Floor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time since America learned her  
name, Monica Lewinsky made her videotape debut today as senators 
watched parts of her testimony on the Senate floor of President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. House prosecutors aired snippets of 
Ms. Lewinsky's Feb. 1 deposition to stitch together their case that 
Clinton should be removed from office for perjury and obstruction 
of justice. Clinton lawyer Nicole Seligman called the 
pick-and-choose clips ``terribly misleading.'' In her defense 
presentation, she tried to pull the rug out from under any drama by 
airing a lengthy chunk of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, even playing 
several portions twice. The trial is set to resume Monday at 1 p.m. 
EST.

	Byrd Says He Might Vote To Convict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who two weeks  
ago offered the Senate a motion to dismiss the impeachment case, 
said today he might vote to convict President Clinton. Byrd said in 
an ABC interview to be aired tomorrow there is ``no doubt about it 
in my mind'' that the charges against Clinton rise to ``high crime 
and misdemeanors.'' But he declined to say how he will vote on 
conviction. ``It will be very difficult to stand and say 'not 
guilty,' very difficult,'' Byrd said. ``Who is kidding who here? I 
have to live with myself. I have to live with my conscience, and I 
have to live with the Constitution.''

	Key Conservative Seeks End of Trial  
</P>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Robertson, the founder of the  
Christian Coalition, said today it's time to give up and ``turn 
away from the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky axis.'' In a news 
conference before Republican presidential hopefuls addressed the 
Christian Coalition in this first-in-the-nation primary state, 
Robertson said the party must end the Senate trial and get ready 
for 2000. ``In jury terms, they have a hung jury and the sooner 
they can wrap it up the better,'' he said.

	Jordanians Keep Vigil for King

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Weeping crowds kept vigil outside King  
Hussein's hospital and people piled flowers under his pictures 
across Amman today. The transfer of authority over the military and 
Cabinet was given to his oldest son today, closing nearly a 
half-century of rule by Hussein, who is gravely ill from cancer. 
Hussein was on a respirator and his liver and single remaining 
kidney had failed, one of his physicians said in a statement. He 
said the king's heart and brain remained ``intact,'' but did not 
elaborate.

	Serbs, Albanians Begin Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Even as Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo  
Albanians opened peace talks here today, a bomb exploded outside an 
ethnic Albanian-owned vegetable market in Pristina, killing three 
people, witnesses said. The blast was the deadliest in a series of 
bombings -- mostly in cafes -- which have rocked Kosovo's capital. 
Negotiators will be working on a framework plan that calls for a 
three-year period of autonomy for Kosovo, maintenance of Serb 
territorial integrity, protection of minorities and a police force 
that reflects the ethnic community.

	Report: Kenya Bomb Suspect Blocked

<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A Kenyan judge has blocked the FBI from  
transporting a suspect in last year's deadly U.S. Embassy bombings 
to the United States for questioning, news reports said today. 
Justice Philip Waki in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa yesterday 
ordered immigration officials not to allow U.S. investigators to 
take Kenyan mechanic Ali Mahfoudh Salim out of the country, the 
Daily Nation and the East African Standard reported. The Aug. 7 
bombing in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, killed 213 people and 
injured 5,400.

	Chechnya May Adopt Islamic Law

<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Parliament defied a presidential order to  
disband and instead began debate today on whether to impose Islamic 
law in Chechnya. Legislators ignored President Aslan Maskhadov's 
order stripping them of power and imposing Islamic law, saying it 
violated the constitution in the breakaway Russian republic. The 
move was a victory for hard-liners, who have sought to establish an 
Islamic state since the republic won de-facto independence from 
Russia in a 1994-96 war.

	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Chris Porter, not in the starting lineup for  
the second straight game, scored 23 points today to lead No. 6 
Auburn to an 80-54 victory over LSU, tying a school record with its 
22nd win. Auburn (22-1, 10-1 Southeastern Conference), which won 22 
games in 1983-84 and 1984-85, took a two-game lead in the SEC 
standings over No. 5 Kentucky, a 62-58 loser to Alabama today. The 
Tigers also have a chance to move up as high as third in the AP Top 
25, following losses today by No 3. Cincinnati, No. 4 Stanford and 
Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Senate's Final Debate May Be Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proponents of a drive to let Americans see the  
Senate's final debate over whether to remove President Clinton from 
office were short Saturday of the 67 votes they will need to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is expected Monday night or Tuesday. Should the move be  
defeated, as appeared likely Saturday, it would mean the public 
would not see senators' climactic deliberations in the month-long 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be difficult,'' conceded Sen. Kay Bailey  
Hutchison, R-Texas, a leader of the open-debate effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sponsors, Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul  
Wellstone of Minnesota, predicted they would succeed. Harkin said 
all 45 Democrats and six or seven Republicans were supportive, and 
``I just have a sense that this momentum is building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing impeachment is hurting Republicans, political  
considerations clearly were coloring the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this would do is open the door to Democrats for two days  
to beat the heck out of Republicans and Ken Starr,'' said Sen. Rod 
Grams, R-Minn. Starr is the independent counsel who brought the 
impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds Senate majority, or 67 of the 100 senators, would  
be needed to overturn rules that specify closed deliberations. If 
all 45 Senate Democrats support the proponents, 22 Republican votes 
would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said rules governing federal impeachment trials have  
established closed deliberations since the 19th century. They also 
said with each senator allowed up to 15 minutes to speak, that 
could mean 25 hours of speeches for a Senate that seems eager to 
end the impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be 100 consecutive rhetorical addresses to the  
cameras, aimed at Hollywood instead of being effective debate to 
help us reach a verdict,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. He said he 
is leaning toward closed debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of opening the deliberations say televising the  
proceedings would provide an invaluable historical record. They 
also say the public deserves to know how lawmakers decide whether 
to leave the president in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate should not hang a `Members Only' sign on the door  
when deliberating removing a twice-elected president,'' Harkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far during the trial, the Senate has twice rejected motions  
by Harkin and Wellstone to open proceedings.

<HEADLINE> NASA's Launch to Comet Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An alarm went off just before a  
rocket was to blast off Saturday with NASA's comet-chasing Stardust 
spacecraft, delaying the launch by at least one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing Delta rocket was scheduled to lift off at 4:06 p.m.  
With less than two minutes remaining in the countdown, however, 
sporadic dips in current were detected from the rocket radar beacon 
and a red alarm went off. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacon is needed to track the rocket during flight.  
</P>
<P>
	NASA tentatively rescheduled the launch for Sunday afternoon.  
Engineers believe nothing is broken and that the use of more ground 
radar sites than usual may have upset the current, said launch 
manager Ray Lugo. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has only one second each day, through Feb. 25, to launch  
Stardust to Comet Wild-2. The spacecraft is supposed to meet up 
with the comet in 2004 and bring back samples of the comet in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first U.S. mission devoted to a comet.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Tech Names New Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTON, La. (AP) -- Louisiana Tech hired offensive line coach  
Jack Bicknell III as its new head coach Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicknell, the son of former Boston College coach Jack Bicknell  
II, fills a vacancy created when Gary Crowton left to become the 
Chicago Bears' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a lifelong dream come true for me,'' said  
Bicknell, who turns 36 Sunday. ``I've been preparing for this day 
since I was 10 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment awaits the usually routine approval by the Board  
of Supervisors for the University of Louisiana system. 
</P>
<P>
	During Bicknell's two-year tenure as offensive line coach, he  
helped lead the Bulldogs to a 15-6 record, including a 9-2 finish 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech's offensive line under Bicknell also has allowed opponents  
just 32 sacks in 1,096 pass attempts over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Tech, the native of Orono, Maine, spent time at  
both the University of New Hampshire and Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack is a perfect fit for Louisiana Tech,'' said athletic  
director Jim Oakes. ``He has been two seasons and knows the 
offensive system well. Jack is a talented coach and is ready for 
this assignment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bicknell began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at  
Boston College in 1985. In 1987, Bicknell headed to New Hampshire 
as the defensive line coach. While at UNH, he switched sides of the 
ball and also took responsibility of the offensive line in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While at Boston College, Bicknell was a four-year letterman on  
the offensive line and was the starting center during Doug Flutie's 
Heisman Trophy year in 1984. He also played in the 1982 Tangerine 
Bowl, the 1983 Liberty Bowl and the 1984 Cotton Bowl.

 *Norman Bluhm    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST WALLINGFORD, Vt. (AP) -- Norman Bluhm, an abstract  
expressionist painter, died Wednesday of heart failure. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluhm's large-scale works that have exhibited since the 1970s  
were often symmetrical compositions that packed swelling forms. The 
result suggested an ebullient, sometimes violence-tinged eroticism, 
drew on a wide range of art historical references. Bluhm named many 
of these paintings after goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
	His work is in many public collections, including those of the  
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney 
Museum of American Art. A 40-year retrospective of his paintings is 
scheduled to open March 7 at the Butler Institute of American Art 
in Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluhm was an Army Air Force veteran of World War II. He said  
later that the war, in which his younger brother was killed and he 
was wounded, had lasting psychological repercussions, giving 
abstract expressionism's life and death ethos a personal edge for 
him.

 *Ben Margolis    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ben Margolis, an activist lawyer whose  
clients included the blacklisted Hollywood 10 and suspects in the 
racially-tinged Sleepy Lagoon murder case, died of congestive heart 
failure on Jan. 27 in Oregon. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis already was a noted civil rights lawyer in 1947 when he  
was approached by a group of directors and screenwriters accused of 
being Communist Party members. They wanted advice on appearing 
before the House Un-American Activities Committee, created to root 
out supposedly subversive elements. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis' name ``just automatically came up if you were involved  
in a civil liberties case,'' said Ring Lardner Jr., who shared a 
1942 writing Oscar for ``Woman of the Year'' before spending 17 
years on the blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis told Lardner and the others that, when asked if they  
were or had ever been members of the Communist Party, ``the only 
possible answer was no answer. ... The answer was: `None of your 
business.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The tactic failed to keep the Hollywood 10 out of trouble.  
Lardner; directors Edward Dmytryk and Herbert Biberman; producer 
Adrian Scott and screenwriters Dalton Trumbo; John Howard Lawson; 
Albert Maltz; Samuel Ornitz; Lester Cole and Alvah Bessie were all 
cited for contempt of Congress. Each spent up to a year in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis was subpoenaed to appear for the committee in 1952 but  
vowed: ``I'll fry in hell before they get any information out of me 
about my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several years earlier, Margolis helped win a reversal of the  
convictions of a dozen Mexican-Americans in the ``Sleepy Lagoon'' 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which inspired the Luis Valdez play ``Zoot Suit,''  
involved the 1942 beating death of a 21-year-old man near a Los 
Angeles-area reservoir dubbed ``Sleepy Lagoon'' after a popular 
song. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicion was cast on Hispanic men known as ``pachucos,'' who  
wore the long coats, wide pants and long watch chains of the ``Zoot 
Suit.'' Hundreds were arrested in a sweep of the barrios, and the 
trial was marred by racism. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Margolis won a reversal after arguing the defendants  
were denied the right to consult with their attorneys during their 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Botha: Give Mike Tyson a Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The man Mike Tyson knocked out in his  
would-be comeback last month decried the former heavyweight 
champion's one-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did was wrong maybe, but I think the punishment he is  
receiving is really too hard,'' Francois Botha told the Orange 
County Register on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, was sentenced Friday in Maryland for assaulting two  
motorists after a traffic accident last summer. He pleaded no 
contest to the charges in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha said he sympathizes with the man who knocked him out on  
Jan. 16 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really think that Mike is an animal. They say, `Look at  
the way he acts, look at he way he talks.' But I think if you get 
to really know him, he's really not that bad. He's got a lot of 
wrong people around him,'' Botha said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Collectors Fear Clinton Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Collectors who wandered the aisles at an  
antique gun show on Saturday feared President Clinton's proposal to 
crack down on gun shows would put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a powerful weapon,'' Jonathan Peck, 86, of Avon, Conn.,  
said as potential buyers admired his gun collection. ``They're 
doing a lot of things to take the fun out of collecting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck and the hundreds of other collectors at the Las Vegas  
Antique Arms Show swapped opinions of Clinton's weekly radio 
address. Many said it was just another attempt to prevent people 
from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton requested legislation to require background checks on  
all firearms buyers at gun shows, which he said have become 
``cash-and-carry convenience stores for weapons used to maim and 
kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the 1994 Brady law's requirement for background  
checks -- meant to bar felons from owning guns -- now should include 
gun-show sales by unlicensed collectors and private hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are law-abiding collectors. This could put collectors out  
of business,'' Robert Lee, president of Hunting World, Inc., in 
Sparks, said, running his hand over a gun built in the 1500s. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 antique guns were on display at the show, some  
selling for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should someone like Bill Clinton tell me how to live my  
life?'' asked Ron Holden, a collector from Williamsburg, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Most collectors and those just browsing were offended by  
Clinton's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's less crime in that room than there is in Disneyland,''  
show director Wallace Beinfeld said, pointing inside the exhibit 
hall. ``He's part of the belief that the Second Amendment is 
garbage.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Gun Show Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton requested legislation  
Saturday to require background checks on all firearms buyers at gun 
shows, which he says have become ``cash-and-carry convenience 
stores for weapons used to maim and kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new national policy, Clinton said, should be: ``No  
background check, no gun. No exceptions.'' The National Rifle 
Association called his proposal a ``public relations stunt'' and 
said the federal government is not enforcing existing gun control 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the 1994 Brady law's  
requirement for background checks -- meant to bar felons from owning 
guns -- now should include gun-show sales by unlicensed collectors 
and private hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	Such sellers make up one-quarter or more of gun-show vendors,  
leaving the current exemption a loophole ``wide enough that 
criminals reach right through it, grabbing, collectively, thousands 
of firearms that disappear without a trace,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposed legislation, slated to be introduced by Rep. Rod R.  
Blagojevich, D-Ill., and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., would also 
broaden the legal definition of gun shows to include flea markets -- 
and any other venue -- where two or more people are engaged in the 
sale of at least 50 firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also called for federal registration  
of all gun show promoters and for extending federal record-keeping 
requirements to unlicensed firearms vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection of information from these vendors would be  
``strictly limited'' to data about the guns -- not the buyers or 
sellers -- so that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms could 
trace arms sold at gun shows if they turn up at a crime scene, said 
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Gun Show Calendar, a periodical, 4,442 gun  
shows were advertised around the country last year. The highest 
number, 472, were in Texas. The National Association of Arms Shows 
says these weekend markets draw up to 5,000 people per show with 
admission fees starting at $5. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for the legislation after recommendations by the  
Treasury and Justice departments, which jointly surveyed over 300 
recent ATF investigations involving 54,000 firearms linked somehow 
to gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of the show-related investigations involved felons  
buying or selling firearms, and in more than a third of the 
investigations, the firearms in question were known to have been 
used in subsequent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows conclusively that gun shows are a forum for gun  
traffickers, a cash-and-carry convenience store for weapons used to 
maim and kill,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA criticized Clinton's plan as just another whack at gun  
owners, and said the federal government is not prosecuting felons 
who are identified under the existing Brady bill provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is public relations masquerading as substance,'' said  
Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., NRA chief executive officer. ``It's hollow 
and it means nothing to felons on the streets. This is an attempt 
to put the federal government on the backs of more people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lobbyist James Baker said in the last two years there have  
been only four prosecutions of illegal dealings at gun shows. ``If 
they know about them, why aren't they arresting them?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to pass one more law that the Clinton  
administration has no intention of enforcing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Johnson, Treasury undersecretary for enforcement, countered  
that Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2000 includes nearly $24 
million for additional ATF enforcement, including the hiring of 120 
new ATF agents to support investigations at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Gone From Pollock Stamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jackson Pollock is going smokeless.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 1949 photograph used to make a new 33-cent stamp, the late  
artist known for his abstract paint-dripping technique, is show at 
work with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. On the stamp there 
is no cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not honoring a smoker who happened to be an artist;  
we're honoring a very good artist who happened to be a smoker,'' 
said Don Smeraldi, a Postal Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollock, who died in 1956, is part of the ``Celebrate the  
Century'' stamp series, which also includes Jackie Robinson, Howdy 
Doody and Rosie the Riveter. The stamp is to be unveiled Feb. 18 in 
celebration of the New York artist's contribution to Abstract 
Expressionism.

<HEADLINE> Internet Provider Closes Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The creator of an anti-abortion Web site found to  
be a threat to abortion providers says a decision to shut the site 
down is just a ``temporary setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Horsley said Friday that he would seek a new Internet  
service for his ``Nuremburg Files'' site, which was the focus of a 
federal court trial that led to a $107 million verdict this week in 
favor of abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley was not a defendant in the suit, in which the Portland,  
Ore., jury ruled that such sites constitute threats to abortion 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, which provided the Internet space for the site,  
closed it Thursday night for violating ``our appropriate use 
policies,'' spokesman Serge Clermont said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site included the names and addresses of abortion  
doctors and featured photos of mangled fetuses and drawings of 
dripping blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors whose names appeared on the list were  
killed, most recently last October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was 
gunned down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. His 
name on the Web site was crossed out that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathway Communications, which has maintained the site, said in a  
statement that ``The Nuremberg Files'' was knocked off-line without 
notice. The company said it was informed Friday that it violated 
MindSpring's policy on ``threatening and harassing language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley called the move a ``temporary setback.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We are presently searching for a bolder and more principled  
(Internet service provider) to host the Nuremburg Files,'' the 
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Edwards Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Robert Edwards isn't even a member of the AFC  
Pro Bowl team, but the New England Patriots rookie had to undergo 
surgery after injuring his left knee in a flag football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who rushed for 1,115 yards last season, reportedly  
could miss the entire 1999 season. The Boston Globe, citing 
Patriots officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 
reported today that the injury could keep Edwards out next season, 
and that he had dislocated his knee, injuring an artery. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a first-round draft pick by the Patriots, hurt his knee  
when he came down in a heap after trying to break up a pass in the 
five-on-five ``Rookie Beach Bowl'' on Waikiki Beach on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An NFL spokesman said Edwards underwent surgery at Straub Clinic  
and Hospital in Honolulu, where he was expected to remain for 
several days. The NFL, however, released no other specifics on the 
type of injury nor possible recuperation time. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots coach Pete Carroll said in a statement: ``Obviously, we  
are very concerned about Robert. We are anxious to bring him back 
to New England so our doctors can evaluate him and prepare him to 
begin his rehabilitation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots rookie jumped up for a pass with Oakland's Charles  
Woodson and San Francisco's R.W. McQuarters, the three tumbled to 
the sand, and Edwards remained down, in obvious pain. He was 
carried away in an ambulance and had surgery a few hours later.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Video Depositions-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from video segments of depositions of Monica Lewinsky,  
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. Questioners Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.; Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark.; and James Rogan, R-Calif., impeachment 
managers: 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: We were upstairs in the White House. Mrs. Jordan -- we  
came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the diplomatic entrance. 
We left the car there. I took the elevator up and Mrs. -- to the 
residence and Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. And the 
president was already upstairs. I had ascertained that from the 
usher. And I went up and I raised with him the whole question of 
Monica Lewinsky and asked him directly if he had had sexual 
relations with Monica Lewinsky, and the president said, ``No, 
never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON: All right.  
</P>
<P>
	Now during that conversation, did you tell the president again  
that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed? 
</P>
<P>
	JORDAN: Well, we had established that.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Mr. Blumenthal, specifically inviting your attention to  
Jan. 21, 1998. You testified before the grand jury that on that 
date you personally spoke to the president regarding the Monica 
Lewinsky matter, correct? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Thank you. You are familiar with The Washington Post  
story that broke that day? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I am.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: The story stated that the Office of Independent Counsel  
was investigating whether the president made false statements about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Right.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: And also that the Office of Independent Counsel was  
investigating whether the president obstructed justice in the Jones 
case. Is that your best recollection of what that story was about? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: And so you now remember that the president asked to speak  
with you? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Did you go to the Oval Office?  
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: During that conversation, were you alone with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I was.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Do you remember if the door was closed?  
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: It was.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: When you met with the president, did you relate to him a  
conversation you had with the first lady earlier that day? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: What did you tell the president the first lady told you  
earlier that day? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I believe that I told him that the first lady had  
called me earlier in the day and, in the light of the story in the 
Post, had told me that the president had helped troubled people in 
the past, and that he had done it many times, and that he was a 
compassionate person, and that he helped people also out of his 
religious conviction, and that this was part of his nature. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Do you also remember in that conversation saying to the  
president: ``You really need to not do that at this point, but you 
can't (go) near anybody who is even remotely crazy. You're 
president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes. I think that was a little later in the  
conversation, but I do recall saying that. 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: When you told the president that he should avoid contact  
with troubled people, what did the president say to you in 
response? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I'm trying to remember the sequence of it. He, he  
said that was very difficult for him. He said he, he felt a need to 
help troubled people, and it was hard for him to cut himself off 
from doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Do you remember him saying specifically ``it's very  
difficult for me to do that; given how I am, I want to help 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I recall, I recall that.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: And when the president referred to the trying to help  
people, did you understand him in that conversation to be referring 
to Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: I think it included Monica Lewinsky, but also many  
others. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Did the president then give you his account of what  
happened between him and Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: As I recall, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: What did the president tell you?  
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: He spoke fairly rapidly, as I recall, at that point  
and said that she had come on to him and had made a demand for sex, 
that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, and that she threatened 
him. And he said that she said to him that she was called ``The 
Stalker'' by her peers, and that she hated the term, and that she 
would claim that they had had an affair whether they had or they 
hadn't, and that she would tell people. 
</P>
<P>
	ROGAN: Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica  
Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't be 
known by her peers as ``The Stalker'' anymore? 
</P>
<P>
	BLUMENTHAL: Yes, that's right.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: He said that I could possibly file an affidavit -- if I  
were subpoenaed -- that I could possibly file an affidavit and avoid 
being deposed. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: How did he tell you, you would avoid being deposed by  
filing an affidavit? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I don't think he did.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: You just accepted that statement? Yes?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yes, yes. Sorry.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did he make any representation to you about what you  
could say in that affidavit? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: No.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: What did you understand you would be saying in that  
affidavit to avoid testifying? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I believe I testified to this in the grand jury. In  
the best of my recollection, it was to my mind -- it was a range of 
things. I mean, it could either be something innocuous, or it could 
go as far as having to deny the relationship. Not being a lawyer 
nor having gone to law school, it could be anything. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did he at that point suggest one version or the other  
version? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: No, I didn't even mention that. There wasn't a further  
discussion -- there was no discussion of what would be in an 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Well, based on prior relations with the president, the  
concocted stories and those things like that, did this come to 
mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come to your 
mind about these stories -- the cover stories? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Not in connection with the -- not in connection with  
the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: How would -- was there any discussion of how you would  
accomplish preparing or filing an affidavit at that point? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: No.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you -- why  
would you have wanted to avoid testifying? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: First of all, I thought it was nobody's business.  
Second of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula 
Jones or her case. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could  
file an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of filing a 
false affidavit with the court? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it  
would have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't -- I don't 
remember having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I would 
remember something like that, and I don't, but... 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did you know what an affidavit was?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: And of course, you're talking at that time by telephone  
to the president, and he's -- and he is a lawyer, and he taught law 
school -- I don't know -- did you know that? Did you know he was a 
lawyer? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I think I knew it, but it wasn't something that was  
present in my -- in my thoughts, as in ``he's a lawyer, he's telling 
me, you know, something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: Did the president ever tell you, caution you, that you  
had to tell the truth in an affidavit? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Not that I recall.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: It would have been against his interest in that lawsuit  
for you to have told the truth, would it not? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I'm not really comfortable -- I mean, I can tell you  
what would have been in my best interest, but I ... 
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: But you didn't file the affidavit for your best  
interest, did you? 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Actually, I did.  
</P>
<P>
	BRYANT: To avoid testifying.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yes.

<HEADLINE> Woman Drives Car Into Apartment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHUYLERVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- When Mary Stalls decided to drop in  
on her granddaughter for a surprise visit, she didn't mean to do it 
literally. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulty brakes sent the 66-year-old woman's 1985 Chrysler sedan  
out of control on Friday and she smashed right through the brick 
wall of her granddaughter's apartment into her living room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen cars crash into buildings before, but not completely  
through them,'' said state Trooper D.A. Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stalls was hospitalized to treat a broken nose, cuts and a  
bruised breast bone. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Outraged at Cop Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Justice Department and local prosecutors say  
they will investigate the death of a 22-year-old immigrant from 
Guinea whom police killed in a barrage of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Four officers fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo, who was struck 19  
times in the vestibule of his Bronx home, according to the medical 
examiner's report. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Friday her office would  
investigate the case along with the Bronx district attorney. Family 
and friends encouraged federal officials to review the shooting, 
which they called an execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a police murder, it was a police slaughter,''  
said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ``If a man was put in front of a firing 
squad, he would not expect to be shot at 41 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some have suggested race was a possible factor for the shooting  
that took place early Thursday -- Diallo was black, the four 
officers are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africans are murdered in this town every single month,'' said  
Sidique Wai, president of the United African Congress. ``And it's a 
fact now -- something we are sick and tired of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said officials still don't know  
exactly what happened because there were no civilian witnesses and 
investigators have not talked to the officers yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bronx DA's office has asked police not to interview the  
officers until their investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took what they felt to be, and feel to be, appropriate  
police action,'' said the officers' lawyer, Stephen Worth. ``I 
think it will likely develop that Mr. Diallo had a language barrier 
which prevented him from understanding and complying with the 
officers' orders and made him continue to act in an aggressive 
manner toward the police officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's roommates said he spoke English well but slowly, and  
had a stutter.

<HEADLINE>  Excerpts From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Saturday's proceedings in the impeachment trial  
against President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	``This is the first and only chance you will have in this  
historic impeachment trial to consider the evidence from a few of 
the actual witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``After weeks of proceedings, the day is finally arrived when  
the United States Senate will listen not just to lawyers talk about 
the evidence, but to witnesses with direct knowledge of the 
unlawful conduct of the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, in particular, you will have your only opportunity to  
hear from the one person whose testimony invariably leads to the 
conclusion that the president of the United States committed 
perjury and obstructed justice in a federal civil rights action. 
</P>
<P>
	``That person is Monica Lewinsky, a bright lady whose life has  
forever been marked by the most powerful man on the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the  
offenses alleged in the articles of impeachment.'' -- Rep. James 
Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Many different opinions have been informed about her over the  
last year. Nearly all of this has been fueled by spin and by 
propaganda rather than by truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the analysis and the speculation ends. There is only one  
judgment the Senate must make for history about Monica Lewinsky. Do 
you believe her?'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is this former intern who swore under oath to tell the  
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica Lewinsky is an intelligent, articulate young woman who  
until recently held untarnished hopes for tomorrow like any other 
recent college graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hope was drastically altered when she was subpoenaed in a  
lawsuit against the president of the United States.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The image of a young woman very much like a family member or  
friend that we might know is an image that the president did not 
want America to see when his indiscretions with her became 
public.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president used his aides as a conduit to impart false  
information to a federal grand jury in a criminal investigation, 
his behavior graduated from the unconscionable to the illegal.'' -- 
Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To justify a vote of not guilty for the president, you  
certainly have the right to reject Monica Lewinsky's testimony as 
untruthful. However, I trust your sense of fairness will dictate 
that you will listen to all of her testimony before you dismiss it 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe her, you will see this morning how the  
president wove a web of perjury and obstruction of justice. You 
will see why he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and 
you will see why a just and proper verdict in this body would be to 
replace him as president with Vice President Al Gore.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we proceed ... it is worth briefly recounting the  
circumstances that elevated the president's initial indiscretions 
to the level of impeachable offenses. The lesson is not complex. 
It's quite elementary. In all the things we do in life, life is 
about making choices. Parents teach children that bad choices bring 
sorrow and consequences. We do that because the failure to impose 
meaningful consequences for bad choices brings about more bad 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``That simple primer on life encapsulates the political and  
personal legacy of Bill Clinton. His is a continuing pattern of 
indulging all choices and accepting no consequences.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In November 1995, the president made another bad choice. He  
began a physical relationship with a 22-year-old White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``He chose to begin a physical relationship with her. This was  
not, as he told the grand jury, a relationship that began as a 
friendship, only to later blossom into intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president impulsively began using her for his  
gratification the very day he first spoke with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later he made the bad choice of continuing the relationship  
after Monica became a paid government employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``An important note -- as regrettable as his choice was here, any  
accountability for the private aspect for this should not be 
determined by the Congress of the United States. It should be 
determined by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the president's bad choice simply ended with this  
indiscretion, we would not be here today. Adultery may be a lot of 
things, but it is not an impeachable offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the president's bad choices only grew worse.''  
-- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``During the so-called discovery portion of Paula Jones' case,  
federal judge Susan Wright ordered the president to answer 
questions under oath about any intimate relationships he may have 
had with subordinate female government employees while he was 
governor or president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did Judge Susan Wright order him to answer these  
questions? She did it because sexual harassers in the workplace 
usually do not commit their offenses in the open. Typically, they 
get their victims alone and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Predators know that if they can do this, one of two things  
generally will happen. Out of fear and intimidation, the victim 
will submit. Or out of fear and intimidation, the victim will not 
submit, but the victim will not tell anybody about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There usually is no other way for a sexual harassment victim  
to learn if there is evidence of a pattern of similar conduct by a 
predator without being able to ask these sorts of questions in a 
sexual harassment case. Without this information, a harassment 
victim in the workplace generally would not be able to prove her 
case. This is why courts routinely order defendants to answer these 
kinds of questions in almost every sexual harassment case in the 
country.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout all of this, throughout this presentation, it is  
important to keep in mind that we seek no Congressional punishment 
for a man who chose to cheat on his wife. However, we have a legal 
obligation to expect constitutional accountability for a president 
who chooses to cheat the law.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As you hear their testimony, you will see that the president  
may have been the only individual who had the complete picture. He 
had all the facts and he did not always share those facts with 
others. He did not share those facts with Mr. Vernon Jordan. Nor 
did he share all the facts with Ms. Monica Lewinsky until he 
determines that the time is right to do so.'' -- Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan, the president's friend, testified that this was  
not a casual matter for the president. He was interested, he was 
directing the show, and, as will be clear, he was consumed with 
preventing the truth from coming out in a civil rights case.'' -- 
Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Well you can weigh his intentions, but his intentions are not  
the issue. Because regardless of your view of Mr. Jordan, and his 
motivations, they are irrelevant. His view as to whether there is a 
connection between the job and the testimony is not an issue. It is 
not an issue as to whether Ms. Lewinsky thought there was a 
connection between the job and the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an issue as to whether Revlon thought there was a  
connection between the job and the testimony. There is only one 
issue, and that is whether the president viewed that there was a 
connection between those two. And it is the president, who under 
the law, had to have the corrupt intent. And that is the question 
that you must -- have to answer. And I believe that the evidence 
will show that regardless of what anyone else believed, he knew the 
direct connection.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it important? Why was it important for Mr. Jordan to  
know whether she was under subpoena? Why was it important for Mr. 
Jordan to know whether there was a sexual relationship? Why was it 
important? Because those would be incredible, explosive ingredients 
in a circumstance that is fraught with danger and impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he knows that. And he asks the right questions, but he  
doesn't listen to the right answer, nor does he take the right 
steps, because he is acting at the direction of the president.'' -- 
Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to understand that we want you to know  
very clearly Ms. Lewinsky says that the president never told her to 
lie. There's no question about that. There's no dispute about that 
either. I think you have to look at all the context of this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now what the president did suggest to her was to use an  
affidavit to avoid truthful testimony, to stick with the cover 
stories under legal context. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the issue here whether Ms. Lewinsky believed the president  
was encouraging her to lie? ... Or is the issue what the president 
was trying to do? It is your determination. You have to make the 
decision whether the president, in talking to a 24-year-old 
ex-employee, whether he is encouraging her to come forward and to 
tell the truth, or in a legal context to use the old cover stories, 
to lie, to use false affidavits to avoid the truth from coming 
out.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president lied about statements he made to his top aides  
regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. This is 
significant, because the president admitted under oath that he knew 
these aides were potential witnesses before a criminal grand 
jury.'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's testimony that he said things that were  
misleading, but true, to his aides, was perjury. Just as the 
president predicted, several of his top aides later were called to 
testify before the grand jury as to what the president told them. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when they testified before the grand jury, they passed  
along the president's false account, just as the president 
intended.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In his deposition testimony taken just this week by authority  
of the United States Senate, Mr. Blumenthal shared in chilling 
detail the story of how the president responded to the public 
discovery of his long-standing relationship with a young woman who 
had shared tearful and emotional descriptions of her love for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton responded not in love, not in friendship, not even  
with a grain of concern for her well-being or emotional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead the president took the deep and apparently unrequited  
emotional attachment Monica Lewinsky had formed for him and 
prepared to summarily take her life and throw it on the ash heap.'' 
-- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``After denying to Mr. Blumenthal any wrongdoing with Monica  
Lewinsky, the president then struck the harshest of blows against 
her. He launched a pre-emptive strike against her name and her 
character to an aide that he expected would be -- and very shortly 
became -- a witness before a federal grand jury investigation.'' -- 
Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States used a special assistant,  
one of his aides, as a conduit to go before a federal grand jury 
and present false and misleading information and preclude the grand 
jury from being able to make an honest determination in their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obstructed justice when he did it. And when he denied that  
activity, he committed the offense of perjury. In response to a 
question from Mr. Manager Graham, Mr. Blumenthal candidly addressed 
the president's claim under oath that he was truthful with his 
aides that he knew would be future grand jury witnesses.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We have heard an awful lot, throughout this entire episode,  
about the idea of proportionality of punishment. We've also heard 
that lying about sex somehow minimizes the perjury, because 
everybody does it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in everyday life, under the stress of ordinary  
relations, may well lie about personal matters when confronted with 
embarrassing situations. But no, everybody doesn't commit perjury 
under oath in a court proceeding, having been ordered by a federal 
judge to answer questions. And if they do, they generally don't 
expect to keep their job or their liberty if they get caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dispensation this president wants for himself is not the  
same dispensation he grants, as head of the executive branch, to 
ordinary Americans when they lie about sex under oath. Bill Clinton 
wants it both ways. The question before this body is whether you 
are going to give it to him.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the  
House managers have suggested to you that the deposition of Ms. 
Lewinsky helped their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposite is true. Ms. Lewinsky undermined critical aspects  
of the House managers' obstruction case. As those of you who 
watched the entire video are well aware, the managers have cleverly 
snipped here and there in an effort to present their story, even if 
as a result the story they are telling you is not Ms. Lewinsky's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have distorted, and they have created a profoundly  
erroneous impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, let's look at the facts. In her deposition this week, Ms.  
Lewinsky reaffirmed her previous testimony and provided extremely 
useful supplements to that testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked her no questions. Why? Because there was no need. Her  
testimony exonerated the president.'' -- Nicole Seligman, 
presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The tape you will hear establishes beyond doubt that she and  
the president did not discuss the content of the affidavit in that 
call or ever. It establishes beyond doubt that what happened is not 
obstruction of justice.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, where does this leave us? Ms. Lewinsky described a brief  
conversation in which the president mentioned the possibility that 
an affidavit might enable her to avoid testifying, if the need for 
it arose, and they left the subject. No discussion of content, no 
discussion of logistics, no discussion of timing, virtually no 
discussion at all. And that very brief exchange is the heart of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the managers contend that, because Ms. Lewinsky also  
recalls a reference to cover stories in that call, it is clear 
beyond doubt that the president instructed her to file a false 
affidavit. But for at least two reasons, this claim fails also. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told Mr. Manager Bryant that  
the mention of cover stories in that call was not connected to the 
mention of a possible affidavit -- a position, I must note, that she 
had taken with the independent counsel for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``And second, Ms. Lewinsky has insisted for more than a year  
that the cover stories were not, in any event, false, a position 
she reasserted this week in explaining why an affidavit didn't 
necessarily have to be false.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the managers have indicated to you that Ms. Lewinsky  
provided testimony useful to their case with respect to the 
president's involvement in the transfer of gifts to Ms. Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must have attended a different deposition. In fact, Ms.  
Lewinsky's testimony provides powerful support for the position 
that Ms. Lewinsky decided on her own to keep from the Jones' 
lawyers the gifts she had received from the president.'' -- 
Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps most notably, her testimony also provides  
corroboration for the president's testimony that he told her she 
had to turn over to the Jones lawyers what gifts she had. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's new evidence, but it undermines the managers' case; it  
doesn't help it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one of the most extraordinary points in the deposition --  
and we'll get to this in a moment -- we learned that the Office of 
Independent Counsel failed to disclose to the House, to the Senate, 
to the president, Miss Lewinsky's exculpatory statement on this 
point. Since the OIC evidently had chosen not to share the 
information with us, with the House, or with this body, we owe the 
managers a small debt of gratitude for allowing us to learn of it 
here.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see from the video, (Hutchinson) told you last  
Thursday that he needed to have in evidence the videotape, and you 
admitted it into evidence. Because, and I quote, 'Mr. Jordan's 
testimony goes to the connection, the connection, between the job 
search, the benefit provided to a witness and the solicited folks' 
testimony from that witness.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Manager Hutchinson also asserted more than once last  
Thursday that Mr. Jordan's testimony will prove that the president 
was controlling the job search. There's only one problem with these 
assertions. When you actually look at the videotape and listen to 
what Mr. Jordan testified to, there's no support for these 
propositions. There's no direct evidence and there's no 
circumstantial evidence.'' -- David Kendall, presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a game. This is not a game to anyone here. There  
are extraordinary consequences to what we're doing, and what we've 
been doing, and what your decision will be. The stakes are very 
high, and we don't need to take a poll to do what we did.'' -- Rep. 
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here just to win. We're here to help the Senate in  
this constitutional process do the constitutional thing not only 
for the precedent of this Senate, but for the precedent of the 
future generations in terms of how the courts now and later will 
view obstruction of justice and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	And we believe this is a constitutional effort and not a game.  
The question about snippets -- that we just put some snippets on the 
air today. We wanted to call live witnesses. We wanted Ms. Lewinsky 
to be here and let everybody examine her fully and completely.'' -- 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No fair-minded person in my opinion could come to any other  
rational conclusion that our president obstructed justice, that our 
president committed perjury in front of a grand jury. You vote your 
conscience. I told you to do so. And if we disagree at the end of 
the day, that's America at its best.'' -- Rep. Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never suggested that there was any reasonable doubt  
that this president committed crimes. I will ask you at the 
conclusion of this to remove him with a clear conscience. You vote 
your conscience, and I know it will be clear.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I come from you call somebody at 2:30 in the morning,  
you're up to no good.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law -- what does it mean? It means that process and  
procedure wins out over politics and personality. That means that 
subpoenas have to be honored by the great and the small. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means when subpoenas come you can't as the president try  
to defeat them because you're nobody special in the eyes of the 
law, except that you're the guardian of the law.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants this over so bad you can taste it, including  
me, but let's don't leave a taste behind that history cannot stand. 
It was shouted in these chambers, 'For God's sake, vote!' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me quietly, if I can, for God's sake, get to the truth.  
For God's sake, figure out what kind of person we have here in the 
White House. For God's sake, spend some time to fulfill your 
constitutional duty, so that we can get it right, not for just our 
political moment, but for the future of this nation.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president redefined this relationship, he did so by  
telling a lie. He told a lie to a White House aide, who repeated 
that lie to a federal grand jury. In our system, ladies and 
gentlemen, that is a crime. That lie made it into the public 
domain. That lie was mean. That lie would have the effect to run 
this young lady over, and you can think what you want to think, 
too, about Ms. Tripp, and I agree she's not going to be in the hall 
of fame of friends, but let me tell you, the best advice she ever 
gave that young lady was to keep that blue dress.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We have alleged that with forewarning and knowledge on his  
part, that instead of clearing it up to make America a better 
place, instead of fulfilling his role as the chief law enforcement 
officer of the land to do honor to the law, instead of taking this 
burden off all Americans' back, he told a story that defies common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``That he played a butchery game with the English language, that  
is: Maybe is not is, and alone is not alone. And he told John 
Podesta, my relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was not sexual, 
including oral sex. He went on and told an elaborate farce to a 
federal grand jury that they just didn't ask the right question and 
really the sexual relationship did include one thing, but not 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he says he never lied to his aide. And he says he never  
lied to a grand jury. Well, God knows he lied to somebody. And he 
lied to that grand jury and this whole story is a fraud and a 
farce. And the last people in the United States to straighten it 
out, is the United States Senate. God bless you in your 
endeavors.'' -- Graham.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Saturday's proceedings in the impeachment trial  
against President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	``This is the first and only chance you will have in this  
historic impeachment trial to consider the evidence from a few of 
the actual witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``After weeks of proceedings, the day is finally arrived when  
the United States Senate will listen not just to lawyers talk about 
the evidence, but to witnesses with direct knowledge of the 
unlawful conduct of the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, in particular, you will have your only opportunity to  
hear from the one person whose testimony invariably leads to the 
conclusion that the president of the United States committed 
perjury and obstructed justice in a federal civil rights action. 
</P>
<P>
	``That person is Monica Lewinsky, a bright lady whose life has  
forever been marked by the most powerful man on the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the  
offenses alleged in the articles of impeachment.'' -- Rep. James 
Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Many different opinions have been informed about her over the  
last year. Nearly all of this has been fueled by spin and by 
propaganda rather than by truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the analysis and the speculation ends. There is only one  
judgment the Senate must make for history about Monica Lewinsky. Do 
you believe her?'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is this former intern who swore under oath to tell the  
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica Lewinsky is an intelligent, articulate young woman who  
until recently held untarnished hopes for tomorrow like any other 
recent college graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hope was drastically altered when she was subpoenaed in a  
lawsuit against the president of the United States.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The image of a young woman very much like a family member or  
friend that we might know is an image that the president did not 
want America to see when his indiscretions with her became 
public.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president used his aides as a conduit to impart false  
information to a federal grand jury in a criminal investigation, 
his behavior graduated from the unconscionable to the illegal.'' -- 
Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To justify a vote of not guilty for the president, you  
certainly have the right to reject Monica Lewinsky's testimony as 
untruthful. However, I trust your sense of fairness will dictate 
that you will listen to all of her testimony before you dismiss it 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe her, you will see this morning how the  
president wove a web of perjury and obstruction of justice. You 
will see why he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and 
you will see why a just and proper verdict in this body would be to 
replace him as president with Vice President Al Gore.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we proceed ... it is worth briefly recounting the  
circumstances that elevated the president's initial indiscretions 
to the level of impeachable offenses. The lesson is not complex. 
It's quite elementary. In all the things we do in life, life is 
about making choices. Parents teach children that bad choices bring 
sorrow and consequences. We do that because the failure to impose 
meaningful consequences for bad choices brings about more bad 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``That simple primer on life encapsulates the political and  
personal legacy of Bill Clinton. His is a continuing pattern of 
indulging all choices and accepting no consequences.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In November 1995, the president made another bad choice. He  
began a physical relationship with a 22-year-old White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``He chose to begin a physical relationship with her. This was  
not, as he told the grand jury, a relationship that began as a 
friendship, only to later blossom into intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president impulsively began using her for his  
gratification the very day he first spoke with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later he made the bad choice of continuing the relationship  
after Monica became a paid government employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``An important note -- as regrettable as his choice was here, any  
accountability for the private aspect for this should not be 
determined by the Congress of the United States. It should be 
determined by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the president's bad choice simply ended with this  
indiscretion, we would not be here today. Adultery may be a lot of 
things, but it is not an impeachable offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the president's bad choices only grew worse.''  
-- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``During the so-called discovery portion of Paula Jones' case,  
federal judge Susan Wright ordered the president to answer 
questions under oath about any intimate relationships he may have 
had with subordinate female government employees while he was 
governor or president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did Judge Susan Wright order him to answer these  
questions? She did it because sexual harassers in the workplace 
usually do not commit their offenses in the open. Typically, they 
get their victims alone and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Predators know that if they can do this, one of two things  
generally will happen. Out of fear and intimidation, the victim 
will submit. Or out of fear and intimidation, the victim will not 
submit, but the victim will not tell anybody about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There usually is no other way for a sexual harassment victim  
to learn if there is evidence of a pattern of similar conduct by a 
predator without being able to ask these sorts of questions in a 
sexual harassment case. Without this information, a harassment 
victim in the workplace generally would not be able to prove her 
case. This is why courts routinely order defendants to answer these 
kinds of questions in almost every sexual harassment case in the 
country.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout all of this, throughout this presentation, it is  
important to keep in mind that we seek no Congressional punishment 
for a man who chose to cheat on his wife. However, we have a legal 
obligation to expect constitutional accountability for a president 
who chooses to cheat the law.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As you hear their testimony, you will see that the president  
may have been the only individual who had the complete picture. He 
had all the facts and he did not always share those facts with 
others. He did not share those facts with Mr. Vernon Jordan. Nor 
did he share all the facts with Ms. Monica Lewinsky until he 
determines that the time is right to do so.'' -- Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan, the president's friend, testified that this was  
not a casual matter for the president. He was interested, he was 
directing the show, and, as will be clear, he was consumed with 
preventing the truth from coming out in a civil rights case.'' -- 
Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Well you can weigh his intentions, but his intentions are not  
the issue. Because regardless of your view of Mr. Jordan, and his 
motivations, they are irrelevant. His view as to whether there is a 
connection between the job and the testimony is not an issue. It is 
not an issue as to whether Ms. Lewinsky thought there was a 
connection between the job and the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an issue as to whether Revlon thought there was a  
connection between the job and the testimony. There is only one 
issue, and that is whether the president viewed that there was a 
connection between those two. And it is the president, who under 
the law, had to have the corrupt intent. And that is the question 
that you must -- have to answer. And I believe that the evidence 
will show that regardless of what anyone else believed, he knew the 
direct connection.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it important? Why was it important for Mr. Jordan to  
know whether she was under subpoena? Why was it important for Mr. 
Jordan to know whether there was a sexual relationship? Why was it 
important? Because those would be incredible, explosive ingredients 
in a circumstance that is fraught with danger and impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he knows that. And he asks the right questions, but he  
doesn't listen to the right answer, nor does he take the right 
steps, because he is acting at the direction of the president.'' -- 
Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to understand that we want you to know  
very clearly Ms. Lewinsky says that the president never told her to 
lie. There's no question about that. There's no dispute about that 
either. I think you have to look at all the context of this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now what the president did suggest to her was to use an  
affidavit to avoid truthful testimony, to stick with the cover 
stories under legal context. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the issue here whether Ms. Lewinsky believed the president  
was encouraging her to lie? ... Or is the issue what the president 
was trying to do? It is your determination. You have to make the 
decision whether the president, in talking to a 24-year-old 
ex-employee, whether he is encouraging her to come forward and to 
tell the truth, or in a legal context to use the old cover stories, 
to lie, to use false affidavits to avoid the truth from coming 
out.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president lied about statements he made to his top aides  
regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. This is 
significant, because the president admitted under oath that he knew 
these aides were potential witnesses before a criminal grand 
jury.'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's testimony that he said things that were  
misleading, but true, to his aides, was perjury. Just as the 
president predicted, several of his top aides later were called to 
testify before the grand jury as to what the president told them. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when they testified before the grand jury, they passed  
along the president's false account, just as the president 
intended.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In his deposition testimony taken just this week by authority  
of the United States Senate, Mr. Blumenthal shared in chilling 
detail the story of how the president responded to the public 
discovery of his long-standing relationship with a young woman who 
had shared tearful and emotional descriptions of her love for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton responded not in love, not in friendship, not even  
with a grain of concern for her well-being or emotional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead the president took the deep and apparently unrequited  
emotional attachment Monica Lewinsky had formed for him and 
prepared to summarily take her life and throw it on the ash heap.'' 
-- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``After denying to Mr. Blumenthal any wrongdoing with Monica  
Lewinsky, the president then struck the harshest of blows against 
her. He launched a pre-emptive strike against her name and her 
character to an aide that he expected would be -- and very shortly 
became -- a witness before a federal grand jury investigation.'' -- 
Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States used a special assistant,  
one of his aides, as a conduit to go before a federal grand jury 
and present false and misleading information and preclude the grand 
jury from being able to make an honest determination in their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obstructed justice when he did it. And when he denied that  
activity, he committed the offense of perjury. In response to a 
question from Mr. Manager Graham, Mr. Blumenthal candidly addressed 
the president's claim under oath that he was truthful with his 
aides that he knew would be future grand jury witnesses.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We have heard an awful lot, throughout this entire episode,  
about the idea of proportionality of punishment. We've also heard 
that lying about sex somehow minimizes the perjury, because 
everybody does it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in everyday life, under the stress of ordinary  
relations, may well lie about personal matters when confronted with 
embarrassing situations. But no, everybody doesn't commit perjury 
under oath in a court proceeding, having been ordered by a federal 
judge to answer questions. And if they do, they generally don't 
expect to keep their job or their liberty if they get caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dispensation this president wants for himself is not the  
same dispensation he grants, as head of the executive branch, to 
ordinary Americans when they lie about sex under oath. Bill Clinton 
wants it both ways. The question before this body is whether you 
are going to give it to him.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the  
House managers have suggested to you that the deposition of Ms. 
Lewinsky helped their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposite is true. Ms. Lewinsky undermined critical aspects  
of the House managers' obstruction case. As those of you who 
watched the entire video are well aware, the managers have cleverly 
snipped here and there in an effort to present their story, even if 
as a result the story they are telling you is not Ms. Lewinsky's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have distorted, and they have created a profoundly  
erroneous impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, let's look at the facts. In her deposition this week, Ms.  
Lewinsky reaffirmed her previous testimony and provided extremely 
useful supplements to that testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked her no questions. Why? Because there was no need. Her  
testimony exonerated the president.'' -- Nicole Seligman, 
presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The tape you will hear establishes beyond doubt that she and  
the president did not discuss the content of the affidavit in that 
call or ever. It establishes beyond doubt that what happened is not 
obstruction of justice.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, where does this leave us? Ms. Lewinsky described a brief  
conversation in which the president mentioned the possibility that 
an affidavit might enable her to avoid testifying, if the need for 
it arose, and they left the subject. No discussion of content, no 
discussion of logistics, no discussion of timing, virtually no 
discussion at all. And that very brief exchange is the heart of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the managers contend that, because Ms. Lewinsky also  
recalls a reference to cover stories in that call, it is clear 
beyond doubt that the president instructed her to file a false 
affidavit. But for at least two reasons, this claim fails also. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told Mr. Manager Bryant that  
the mention of cover stories in that call was not connected to the 
mention of a possible affidavit -- a position, I must note, that she 
had taken with the independent counsel for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``And second, Ms. Lewinsky has insisted for more than a year  
that the cover stories were not, in any event, false, a position 
she reasserted this week in explaining why an affidavit didn't 
necessarily have to be false.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the managers have indicated to you that Ms. Lewinsky  
provided testimony useful to their case with respect to the 
president's involvement in the transfer of gifts to Ms. Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must have attended a different deposition. In fact, Ms.  
Lewinsky's testimony provides powerful support for the position 
that Ms. Lewinsky decided on her own to keep from the Jones' 
lawyers the gifts she had received from the president.'' -- 
Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps most notably, her testimony also provides  
corroboration for the president's testimony that he told her she 
had to turn over to the Jones lawyers what gifts she had. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's new evidence, but it undermines the managers' case; it  
doesn't help it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one of the most extraordinary points in the deposition --  
and we'll get to this in a moment -- we learned that the Office of 
Independent Counsel failed to disclose to the House, to the Senate, 
to the president, Miss Lewinsky's exculpatory statement on this 
point. Since the OIC evidently had chosen not to share the 
information with us, with the House, or with this body, we owe the 
managers a small debt of gratitude for allowing us to learn of it 
here.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see from the video, (Hutchinson) told you last  
Thursday that he needed to have in evidence the videotape, and you 
admitted it into evidence. Because, and I quote, 'Mr. Jordan's 
testimony goes to the connection, the connection, between the job 
search, the benefit provided to a witness and the solicited folks' 
testimony from that witness.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Manager Hutchinson also asserted more than once last  
Thursday that Mr. Jordan's testimony will prove that the president 
was controlling the job search. There's only one problem with these 
assertions. When you actually look at the videotape and listen to 
what Mr. Jordan testified to, there's no support for these 
propositions. There's no direct evidence and there's no 
circumstantial evidence.'' -- David Kendall, presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a game. This is not a game to anyone here. There  
are extraordinary consequences to what we're doing, and what we've 
been doing, and what your decision will be. The stakes are very 
high, and we don't need to take a poll to do what we did.'' -- Rep. 
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here just to win. We're here to help the Senate in  
this constitutional process do the constitutional thing not only 
for the precedent of this Senate, but for the precedent of the 
future generations in terms of how the courts now and later will 
view obstruction of justice and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	And we believe this is a constitutional effort and not a game.  
The question about snippets -- that we just put some snippets on the 
air today. We wanted to call live witnesses. We wanted Ms. Lewinsky 
to be here and let everybody examine her fully and completely.'' -- 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No fair-minded person in my opinion could come to any other  
rational conclusion that our president obstructed justice, that our 
president committed perjury in front of a grand jury. You vote your 
conscience. I told you to do so. And if we disagree at the end of 
the day, that's America at its best.'' -- Rep. Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never suggested that there was any reasonable doubt  
that this president committed crimes. I will ask you at the 
conclusion of this to remove him with a clear conscience. You vote 
your conscience, and I know it will be clear.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I come from you call somebody at 2:30 in the morning,  
you're up to no good.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law -- what does it mean? It means that process and  
procedure wins out over politics and personality. That means that 
subpoenas have to be honored by the great and the small. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means when subpoenas come you can't as the president try  
to defeat them because you're nobody special in the eyes of the 
law, except that you're the guardian of the law.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants this over so bad you can taste it, including  
me, but let's don't leave a taste behind that history cannot stand. 
It was shouted in these chambers, 'For God's sake, vote!' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me quietly, if I can, for God's sake, get to the truth.  
For God's sake, figure out what kind of person we have here in the 
White House. For God's sake, spend some time to fulfill your 
constitutional duty, so that we can get it right, not for just our 
political moment, but for the future of this nation.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president redefined this relationship, he did so by  
telling a lie. He told a lie to a White House aide, who repeated 
that lie to a federal grand jury. In our system, ladies and 
gentlemen, that is a crime. That lie made it into the public 
domain. That lie was mean. That lie would have the effect to run 
this young lady over, and you can think what you want to think, 
too, about Ms. Tripp, and I agree she's not going to be in the hall 
of fame of friends, but let me tell you, the best advice she ever 
gave that young lady was to keep that blue dress.'' -- Graham.

<P>
	``We have alleged that with forewarning and knowledge on his  
part, that instead of clearing it up to make America a better 
place, instead of fulfilling his role as the chief law enforcement 
officer of the land to do honor to the law, instead of taking this 
burden off all Americans' back, he told a story that defies common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``That he played a butchery game with the English language, that  
is: Maybe is not is, and alone is not alone. And he told John 
Podesta, my relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was not sexual, 
including oral sex. He went on and told an elaborate farce to a 
federal grand jury that they just didn't ask the right question and 
really the sexual relationship did include one thing, but not 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he says he never lied to his aide. And he says he never  
lied to a grand jury. Well, God knows he lied to somebody. And he 
lied to that grand jury and this whole story is a fraud and a 
farce. And the last people in the United States to straighten it 
out, is the United States Senate. God bless you in your 
endeavors.'' -- Graham.

<HEADLINE> Some Lawyers Say Video 'Too Late' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Videotaped testimony by Monica Lewinsky and  
two presidential confidants finally put faces and voices to the 
case against President Clinton, but some lawyers say it came too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're now into the fourth edition of a book and for  
the first time it's illustrated,'' said Charles Geyh, an Indiana 
University law professor and director of the American Judicature 
Society's center for judicial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The presentation, while effective, was ``too little and too  
late'' with the president's impeachment trial nearing its final 
stages, said New York criminal defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of stuff would have been much more effective if it  
had been done in the House,'' where the Judiciary Committee held 
hearings on the impeachment charges, Lefcourt said. ``You've got to 
capture your jury early with strong stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro said the House prosecutors  
did a good job of using ``the critical words out of the critical 
witnesses' mouths at important time periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I admire them for putting on a case with a foregone  
conclusion,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel said both  
sides performed well but likely would change few minds this late in 
the trial. ``If we were learning some of this for the first time it 
would be riveting,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution and defense lawyers used numerous video excerpts of  
testimony by Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you believe Monica Lewinsky?'' prosecutor Asa Hutchinson,  
R-Ark., said at one point. ``I believe her testimony is credible. 
She is not trying to hammer the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawyers said Ms. Lewinsky created a favorable  
impression, appearing self-assured and perhaps less like a victim 
than House prosecutors portrayed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She comes off very well-prepared with a story that is not  
something that one could say for sure is not true,'' Lefcourt said. 
Nevertheless, he added, ``she doesn't want to do the knockout 
punch'' against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles lawyer Ira Reiner wondered why prosecutors showed  
one clip in which Ms. Lewinsky said she told Jordan in December 
1997 that she saw Clinton ``more as a man than as a president, and 
I treated him accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not the words of a victim,'' said Reiner, a former  
Los Angeles County district attorney. ``Monica with her pearls, 
self-assured, poised and saying 'I treated him accordingly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reiner said he considered the prosecutors' presentation  
anticlimactic because they used only short excerpts of Ms. 
Lewinsky's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is about is the drama ... of presenting Monica  
Lewinsky for whatever impact that will have on the public,'' Reiner 
said. ``Present it and let it build ... and you get caught up in it 
maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers used much more testimony from Ms. Lewinsky,  
including her descriptions of conversations with Clinton about her 
plan to file an affidavit in an effort to avoid testifying in Paula 
Jones' sex-harassment lawsuit against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I separate necessarily signing an affidavit and using  
misleading cover stories'' to hide their illicit relationship, Ms. 
Lewinsky said. ``They weren't linked for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers did not play these excerpts for you,'' said  
Clinton lawyer Nicole Seligman in arguing that prosecutors used her 
testimony ``carefully, only in snippets, only when it suits their 
purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seligman also used a clip of Ms. Lewinsky saying she told  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigators she thought she 
remembered Clinton saying when she was subpoenaed to turn over 
gifts he gave her. ``You have to turn over whatever you have,'' she 
quoted the president as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office ``never told us that that's what she'd said,''  
Seligman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geyh said he thought the prosecutors' video clips were more  
convincing when they ran longer. The House managers' presentation 
was ``not really testimony but a closing argument with audiovisual 
aids,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geyh said he thought both Lewinsky and Jordan presented  
themselves well, adding, ``They don't come across as evasive, they 
don't come across as defensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicastro, a former federal prosecutor, said prosecutors used the  
videos effectively in an effort to show senators ``exactly what 
this president has done to people who cared about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Blumenthal described how Clinton denied to him having an  
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, ``there was a sadness in how he said 
it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Vows To Protect Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are just as committed as President  
Clinton to maintaining a strong Social Security system, a GOP 
lawmaker said today, announcing plans to guarantee benefits are not 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said House leaders have pledged to  
move quickly on his measure, which would guarantee current benefits 
to all Social Security recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we must move improve the system for working Americans,  
the benefits today's seniors have come to count on cannot and will 
not be changed in any way,'' Ryan said in the weekly Republican 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he has talked to thousands of seniors in his home  
state who fear the promised Social Security reforms will end up 
costing them their benefits. ``We know that would not be fair,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's plan, outlined in his State of the Union  
address, $2.7 trillion of $4.4 trillion in projected government 
surpluses over the next 15 years would be devoted to bolstering the 
Social Security system. The administration says these proposals 
would stall the system from running out of cash until 2055, instead 
of 2032 as now projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has cautioned that any  
permanent solution to the problem almost certainly would require 
either benefit cuts or higher taxes, because the system is so 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan was chairman of the blue-ribbon commission that 16  
years ago recommended a combination of benefit cuts and higher 
taxes to meet an earlier Social Security funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has not proposed any change in benefits, but has said he  
and Congress must work together in a bipartisan way to see if other 
adjustments are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he would use his legislation to ensure that retired  
Americans would not lose out as a result of any alterations in the 
system. ``No matter what other reforms need to be made to make the 
program solvent in the future, there will be no change in benefits 
to current or soon-to-be retirees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to introduce the legislation Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress also will fight to prevent any Social Security payroll  
taxes from being diverted to fund other federal government 
programs, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expressed concern about Clinton's proposal to invest  
about a quarter of the Social Security surplus money in the stock 
market in hopes of increasing its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics undoubtedly would color the decisions of a government  
board investing the money, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A far better idea would be to allow individuals and families  
to make those decisions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Man Freed From Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Anthony Porter sat in prison for 17 years,  
insisting that he was innocent of the crimes that sent him to death 
row. One person never doubted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, walked out of the Cook County Jail and went home to  
his mother on Friday after a journalism professor and his class 
gathered evidence that he was wrongly convicted of two 1982 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so glad to have my son,'' said Clara Porter, hugging him  
as they sat together on her living room sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter came within two days of execution last September before  
the Illinois Supreme Court decided that his case required another 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, key witnesses have recanted their testimony and, on  
Wednesday, another man said on videotape that he had shot Jerry 
Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon, of Milwaukee, made the admission under  
questioning by Chicago private investigator Paul Ciolino, who 
worked on the case with journalism students from Northwestern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald freed Porter on a $10,000  
recognizance bond Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald cited ``news reports of significant evidentiary  
developments that would put into question whether Mr. Porter 
actually committed the crime that he was convicted of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter walked out of the jail clad in a black jacket and  
turtleneck, a slight figure with a deeply creviced face and 
scraggly looking prison dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw his arms around journalism professor David Protess,  
whose investigative reporting class gathered the evidence in his 
favor. Porter then clamped a bearhug around several students, 
lifting two of them joyously into the air as they stood in the 
jail's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said he was relieved to get out, but that his release  
came much too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``They waited too damn long,'' he said. ``They had me locked up  
for 17 years for something I didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first stop after jail was McDonald's.  
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at his mother's home in a gritty and battered  
tenement next to an elevated train track carrying a milkshake in a 
paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daddy! Daddy!'' squealed his 21-year-old daughter, Thelma,  
racing into his arms. ``Glory be to God, Daddy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he hugged his mother and turned to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is my mama, and I love her. This is Ms. Clara Porter,''  
he said, holding her tighter. ``C'mere, girl. She had faith in me 
the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter still is charged with two murders, pending further  
investigation. If his conviction is overturned, he would be the 
10th death row inmate exonerated in Illinois since capital 
punishment was reinstated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to say if they plan to charge Simon, whose  
attorney, Jack Rimland, would not disclose his client's 
whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Casinos Sponsor Gambling Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging the dangers of addiction, the  
casino industry has entered into an unusual alliance with 
therapists and researchers to fight compulsive gambling even as it 
defends legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling opponents say the alliance undermines rather than  
promotes impartial study. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 experts gathered Friday at a conference focusing on  
biological causes and possible treatments for compulsive gambling. 
Few seemed bothered that the event sponsor, the National Center for 
Responsible Gaming, is a creation of the casino industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not going to make the mistake the tobacco industry  
made in denying'' the problem of addiction, said Frank J. 
Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, which 
lobbies on behalf of casinos and formed the center in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the conference focused a new and welcome degree  
of medical attention on gambling addiction, long considered a 
stepchild of more commonly discussed disorders such as drug and 
alcohol dependency. Estimates vary widely, but a 1997 study 
concluded that more than 2 million adults and 4 million youths 
suffer from problem gambling each year. 
</P>
<P>
	On another level, the conference showed how the gambling  
industry has turned problem gambling from a political liability 
into a pet cause. That could pay off beginning next week, when a 
federally appointed gambling panel begins work on a report due in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics aren't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Horn, spokesman for the National Coalition Against  
Legalized Gambling, said the industry and the center are steering 
research toward genetic causes and biological mechanics of 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's lovely,'' he said. ``The problem is that the gambling  
industry will not research the prevalence of gambling addiction, 
the cost of gambling addiction and the percentage that gambling 
addicts contribute to the revenues of gambling establishments. 
These are the questions that policy-makers need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Kansas City, where it is affiliated with the University  
of Missouri, the National Center for Responsible Gaming has 
distributed $1.5 million in grants since 1997 for research into 
compulsive gambling. Executive director Christine Reilly said the 
center's governing board will soon award a new round of grants 
totaling $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really creating this field,'' Reilly said. ``There  
hasn't been a field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luncheon speaker Howard Shaffer, director of the Division on  
Addictions at Harvard Medical School, said the conference 
``represents a turning point'' for a field of study that until now 
has gotten minimal attention. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged it was unusual to be at a compulsive gambling  
conference sponsored by the gambling industry. But he said the 
industry has exerted no undue influence on the research its center 
is funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were questions, I'd walk away,'' Shaffer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Compulsive gambling is one of the major issues under  
consideration by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, 
which meets in Virginia Beach, Va., next week to begin putting 
together its much-anticipated report. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf, who will address the commission on Tuesday on behalf  
of casinos, said he will highlight the work of the National Center 
for Responsible Gaming and ask that Indian casinos, state lotteries 
and the pari-mutuel horse-racing industry contribute money for 
further research into compulsive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn, who will represent the National Coalition Against  
Legalized Gambling, said he will ask the commission to recommend 
that governments fund the research to make sure the studies are not 
biased.

<HEADLINE> Hallucinogen Study Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal agency has suspended controversial  
psychosis studies after it came under fire for using a powerful 
hallucinogen on healthy volunteers and mentally ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven E. Hyman, head of the National Institute of Mental  
Health in Bethesda, Md., has suspended tests on ketamine, known on 
the streets as ``Special K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use  
as an anesthetic, but is sold on the streets as a hallucinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to be funding research that will produce  
harm,'' Hyman said at a meeting of the National Advisory Mental 
Health Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have given ketamine to people with mental illness  
and healthy volunteers to study the biology of psychoses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those (studies) on our campus have stopped,'' Hyman told The  
Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman also won approval Friday for a more stringent review of  
proposed studies that would induce psychosis or withhold medication 
from mentally ill volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Institute officials said their ketamine studies were suspended  
for lack of scientific merit after a review last month, but said no 
patients had been harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical ethicists have criticized the studies, saying they  
are full of unknown risks pending further research into ketamine's 
long-term effects.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Hear Story After 13 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Prosecutors have been calling Charles  
Ng a sex murderer and worse for 13 years, so he decided it was time 
to give his version of what went on in the Sierra Nevada foothills 
when a dozen men, women and children were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't do it, he said. It was his friend, a man ``like a  
bigger brother,'' the man who committed suicide with cyanide while 
Ng fled to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's lawyers never wanted him talking to the jury about the  
slayings that occurred back in 1984 and '85, fearing he could be 
his own worst witness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, they couldn't stop him.  
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Hong Kong native insisted on taking the stand,  
trying to fire his lawyer and forcing a restart of the trial's 
closing arguments. After his more than three days of testimony 
ending this past week, the trial could now go to the jury as early 
as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng told jurors he could ``explain away'' the gruesome cartoons  
that he drew in a Canadian prison and that were entered as evidence 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	One showed him frying a baby in a wok and was captioned ``Daddy  
died, momma cried, baby fried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a ridicule, a satire'' against the ``outrageous''  
accusations that he killed babies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, the jury never would have seen the cartoon if Ng  
hadn't taken the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The best evidence against Ng, according to prosecutors, is a  
videotape made in April 1985, when he and paunchy survivalist pal 
Leonard Lake kidnapped two young women and threatened to kill them 
unless they became sex slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and stuff like the rest of them, but it won't do  
you no good,'' the videotape shows Ng telling Brenda O'Connor, last 
of his alleged victims. ``We are pretty, ha, cold-hearted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had just sliced away O'Connor's shirt and bra as she sat  
handcuffed in an armchair. She had been pleading for her boyfriend 
and their 1-year-old son, though both were already dead, according 
to prosecutors. O'Connor, 19, disappeared shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng said on the stand that his videotaped cruelty was a  
performance meant to impress Lake and intimidate the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	From the first day of trial on Oct. 26, jurors had repeatedly  
seen the brief, brutal video. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Jan. 27, Ng told Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan that  
he wanted to take the stand and tell his side, and to dismiss chief 
defender William Kelley, who was preparing to deliver his closing 
summation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed, extending the protracted case for another week  
or so, but he refused to dismiss the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng is accused of killing two baby boys, three women and seven  
men in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers blame all the killings on Lake, who had  
befriended Ng while the younger man was AWOL from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look up to him more like a bigger brother or maybe uncle,''  
said Ng. But he said he wouldn't kill for Lake and denied knowledge 
of any murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake built a bunker at his house in Wilseyville, about 150 miles  
east of San Francisco, with a cell for keeping prisoners. 
Prosecutor accuse Ng of helping Lake lure people to the hamlet with 
promises of free marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake swallowed cyanide after police found him with a car  
belonging to one of the alleged victims. Bone fragments and 
victims' belongings were dug up around Lake's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng took off on foot and went to Canada, where he was arrested on  
a fugitive warrant. He fought extradition for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	While being held at Canada's Edmonton Penitentiary, Ng slid  
notes and drawings under his cell door to fellow inmate Maurice 
Laberge. Some cartoons showed women being raped and strangled, 
babies being smashed, drowned, fried or put in a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ng's extradition hearing, Laberge testified that Ng had told  
him details of killings that only the murderer could know. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng told his California jury that Laberge made up most of it. Ng  
swore that he never discussed killing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	However, by reopening his defense Ng allowed prosecutor Sharlene  
Honnaka to introduce new evidence, including the ``baby fried'' 
cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was goading me on this,'' Ng said of Laberge, who died in a  
traffic accident in Canada last year. The cartoon had no basis in 
reality and was meant ``to deflect the ridicule, the accusations,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Honnaka had scored a point: Ng apparently had discussed  
killing babies with the informant after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't like Charles Ng, folks. That's impossible,'' Kelley  
told the jury, ``but you have to set that aside and say, 'Did he 
murder?'''

<HEADLINE> School Acknowledges Recruit Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Washington has acknowledged  
that eight football recruits, instead of the four originally 
reported, were visited a week ago in violation of NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, of those visited on Jan. 31, the five who signed letters  
of intent with the Huskies have been ruled ineligible by the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	University sports spokesman Jim Daves said Friday that new coach  
Rick Neuheisel had forgotten to mention Jerome Stevens of Oxnard, 
Calif., at a news conference earlier this week, when Neuheisel said 
that four players had been improperly visited by Husky recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four players declared ineligible were kicker John  
Anderson, of Boynton Beach, Fla.; cornerback Chris Massey, of 
Moreno Valley, Calif.; cornerback Domynic Shaw, of Oakland, Calif., 
and safety Clayton Hawthorne, of Victoria, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Washington compliance director Ralph Bayard said  
Friday that three other players were contacted Jan. 31, during the 
quiet period for recruiting before the announcement of letters of 
intent. Bayard said they were Adam Wade of Moreno Valley, Calif., 
who signed with Colorado State; Kevin Mack of Oxnard, who signed 
with Oregon; and Daniel Waldrop of Los Angeles, who signed with 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel was lured away from Colorado on Jan. 9 with a  
seven-year contract worth $1 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, national letter of intent signing day, Neuheisel  
admitted he broke an NCAA rule by having assistant coaches in the 
homes of four recruits on Jan. 31. He said he was unaware of the 
rule prohibiting coaches from having off-campus visits with 
recruits on the Sunday before signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel also was accused of tampering, another NCAA rules  
violation, by his successor at Colorado, Gary Barnett. Neuheisel 
said he called his former Colorado players -- without that school's 
permission -- only to bid them goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel had a 33-14 record in his four years at Colorado, but  
had to forfeit all his team's victories in 1997 for using an 
ineligible player.

<HEADLINE> Chicken Burritos Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A company that makes airline food recalled 78,000  
chicken burritos after one meal was found to be contaminated with a 
potentially deadly bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Culinary Foods Inc. of Chicago, a subsidiary of giant Tyson  
Foods, recalled the burritos in December after tests showed the one 
meal was tainted with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture posted a notice about the  
burrito recall on its Internet site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The burritos were made exclusively for American Airlines, which  
stopped using Culinary Foods products in December. No illnesses 
were reported, said Arkansas-based Tyson spokesman Archie Schaffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria-related recalls have leaped in recent months, including  
the December recall of 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other 
packaged meats produced at a Zeeland, Mich. plant operated by Bil 
Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp. Eleven deaths have 
been linked to that contamination.

	Senate Sees Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told her story in public at  
long last today, testifying in videotape snippets before President 
Clinton's impeachment trial and a nationwide television audience 
about a White House sexual affair and cover-up. Ms. Lewinsky said 
Clinton had never instructed her to tell the truth when word of the 
affair began to leak, responding ``correct'' when asked if that 
were the case. ``I knew I would deny the relationship,'' she also 
said. But she also testified Clinton did not suggest she use their 
cover story in an affidavit she was to file in the Paula Jones 
lawsuit. The trial has adjourned until Monday at 1 p.m. EST.

<P>
	Senate's Final Debate May Be Closed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proponents of a drive to let Americans see the  
Senate's final debate over whether to remove President Clinton from 
office were short today of the 67 votes they will need to prevail. 
The vote is expected Monday night or Tuesday. Should the move be 
defeated, as appeared likely today, it would mean the public would 
not see senators' climactic deliberations in the month-long 
impeachment trial.

	Jordan Puts King's Son in Charge  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The powers of the monarchy passed from the  
dying King Hussein to his oldest son today. The transfer of 
authority over the military and Cabinet closed nearly a 
half-century of rule by Hussein, who survived coup and 
assassination attempts and waged war against Israel but later made 
peace. Hussein had been under sedation since Wednesday, after a 
bone marrow transplant failed in the United States, a source said. 
Death was expected once cancer reached his heart, ``in a matter of 
hours or days,'' the source said.

<P>
	Kosovo Peace Talks Under Way  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Under the threat of NATO guns,  
Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians sat down at the negotiating 
table today, faced with intense international pressure to make 
peace in just two weeks. Serb officials delayed the ethnic 
Albanians' departure from Kosovo and let it be known they would not 
negotiate with ``terrorists,'' as they call the Kosovo Liberation 
Army rebels. In the end, all parties turned up -- at least for the 
opening speeches and the brief administrative session that 
followed. The real negotiating was to start tomorrow, sources said.

<P>
	NASA Delays Rocket Launch  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An alarm went off just before a  
rocket was to blast off today with NASA's comet-chasing Stardust 
spacecraft, delaying the launch by at least one day. The Boeing 
Delta rocket was scheduled to lift off at 4:06 p.m. With less than 
two minutes remaining, however, a dip in current was detected from 
a rocket radar beacon and a red alarm went off. Launch managers 
tentatively rescheduled the launch for tomorrow afternoon. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Wants Gun Show Crackdown  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton requested legislation today  
to require background checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows, 
which he says have become ``cash-and-carry convenience stores for 
weapons used to maim and kill.'' The new national policy, Clinton 
said, should be: ``No background check, no gun. No exceptions.'' 
The National Rifle Association called his proposal a ``public 
relations stunt'' and said the federal government is not enforcing 
existing gun control laws.

	Hamas Presses Arafat on Detainees  
</P>
<P>
	NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- More than 1,000 supporters of a  
militant Islamic group burned tires and blocked a main road in the 
West Bank city of Nablus today, demanding that the Palestinian 
Authority release hunger-striking prisoners. It was the second 
straight day of demonstrations in the West Bank city, where for the 
past two weeks 44 members of Hamas have been fasting in the city's 
prison. Some of them have been held without trial for more than a 
year. 

</P>
<P>
	Biosafety Pact Could Hit U.S. Trade  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international agreement over genetically  
engineered products being negotiated in Colombia this week could 
have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade. Negotiating teams 
are drafting the Biosafety Protocol, a United Nations-initiated 
agreement that aims to reduce risks from shipment and international 
movement of living modified organisms, or genetically engineered 
plants. Exports could be hit in a range of products including blue 
jeans, soda pop, disease-fighting vaccines, potato chips and many 
more.

	No. 1 UConn Beats No. 4 Stanford  
</P>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin had 23 points and No. 1  
Connecticut, rebounding from its only loss of the season and again 
playing without leading scorer Richard Hamilton, never trailed in a 
70-59 victory over No. 4 Stanford today. The Huskies forced 16 
turnovers and held the Cardinal to 35 percent shooting. Mark Madsen 
had 13 points for Stanford, which fell behind by 18 points early.

<HEADLINE> Nancy Lopez To Play in Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Nancy Lopez will get another chance to  
end more than 20 years of heartache in the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, a runner-up four times, and 1986 champion Jane Geddes  
were offered special exemptions to this year's Open on Saturday by 
the women's committee of the U.S. Golf Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 23rd try at the Open for Lopez, who has won 48  
times in a Hall of Fame career but never the biggest event in 
women's golf. She was runner-up in 1975, 1977, 1989 and again in 
1997, when she narrowly missed a 20-foot birdie putt on the 72nd 
hole that would have forced a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Open will be played June 3-6 at Old Waverly Golf  
Club in West Point, Miss., where Lopez played the grand opening 
with Ben Crenshaw and Jerry Pate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the golf course,'' she said last month. ``I'm hoping  
that's going to be a good week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other announcements at the USGA's annual meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	-- F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor was re-elected to another one-year  
term as president. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Prize money for the U.S. Open will increase by $500,000 to  
$3.5 million, while the U.S. Senior Open and U.S. Women's Open 
purses were raised by $250,000 to $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The executive committee approved a multiple-hole playoff  
format for the U.S. Senior Open. The playoff would be three or four 
holes, depending on the layout of the course. The U.S. Open and 
Women's Open will continue to use 18-hole playoffs, followed by 
sudden death if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The new ball test, which was schedule to be introduced in the  
spring, has been delayed until later this year because of 
construction at the USGA Research and Test Center in Far Hills, 
N.J.

<HEADLINE> Miss New York Crowned Miss USA 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old international business student  
from the University of Buffalo has been crowned Miss USA 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss New York, Kimberly Ann Pressler, broke up the audience  
Friday night when host Shemar Moore, from the soap opera ``The 
Young and the Restless,'' asked whether she would leave her 
boyfriend behind to wear the Miss USA crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh definitely I would,'' she quickly replied as she waved to  
her boyfriend in the audience. ``I think if true love is there it 
will be there afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tennessee, Morgan Tandy High, was named first runner-up.  
Miss California, Angelique Breaux, was the second runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pressler, who is considering a career as an actress, became  
the 48th Miss USA. Afterward she proclaimed it the most wonderful 
experience of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you guys tell I'm happy?'' she asked a crowd of reporters.  
``I feel my smile is filling up my whole face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another night, before another set of judges, Miss Pressler  
said, she might have lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to be in the right place at the right time with  
the right personality,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She now heads to Trinidad and Tobago, where she'll compete in  
the Miss Universe pageant on May 26.

	HAMAR, Norway (AP) -- Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany skated  
the second fastest 3,000-meter race ever and took the overall lead 
Saturday in the World All-Around Speedskating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing in the Olympic Viking Ship hall, Niemann-Stirnemann  
finished in 4 minutes, 2.1 seconds, only 0.35 off her own world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands took the lead among the men,  
with Japan's Hiroyuki Noake in second. 
</P>
<P>
	Niemann-Stirnemann, winner of a total of 13 World Championship  
titles in her career, earlier finished seventh in the opening 500 
meters. After two of four races, she leads the overall standings 
with 80,675 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Annamarie Thomas of the Netherlands won the 500 in 39.82, just  
four hundredths of a second ahead of Jennifer Rodriguez of Miami.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Suspends Sophomore Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Sophomore forward Tyron Manlove,  
Colorado's second-leading scorer, has been suspended indefinitely, 
Buffaloes coach Ricardo Patton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton said Manlove was suspended ``for an attitude unbecoming a  
CU basketball player.'' He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Manlove missed Colorado's first 10 games because he was  
ineligible after transferring from Oregon. He scored 14 points in 
his first game with the Buffs (11-11, 2-7 Big 12) and averaged 11.8 
points in 12 games -- eight as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost his starting job after Patton criticized his defensive  
effort in Colorado's 76-52 loss at Kansas State on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Manlove had a season-high 21 points against Boston University  
and matched that against Texas five days later.

<HEADLINE> Bobek Withdraws From Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Nicole Bobek's topsy-turvy career has  
taken another spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobek withdrew from the upcoming U.S. Figure Skating  
Championships this weekend because she's undergoing treatment for 
endometriosis, which causes pelvic pain and is related to the 
presence of ovarian cysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Her publicist, Ana Suslovsky, confirmed the condition of the  
1995 champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationals begin Sunday, with the ladies competition starting  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am regretful that I will not be competing in this year's  
championships,'' Bobek said in a written statement. ``Although I 
was really looking forward to a chance to regaining my title and 
preparing myself mentally and physically for this competition, my 
health must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford to take the risk of jeopardizing my health and  
going out there knowing I will not be in the physical condition to 
do my best and achieve the goal I set out to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A strong showing at nationals would have gone a long way toward  
redeeming Bobek's disastrous performance at the Nagano Olympics. 
She went to Japan as part of the strongest U.S. team ever, and she, 
Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski were favored for a 1-2-3 sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bobek, still feeling the effects of bronchitis and a hip  
injury, fell apart -- literally -- in the short program. She fell on 
her very first jump, made mistakes on every jump she tried and was 
crying before she even left the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished 17th, and then withdrew from the world  
championships because of the lingering hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many expected her to give up her Olympic eligibility,  
Bobek reunited with Richard Callaghan, the coach who guided her to 
the 1995 title, and was determined to make yet another comeback. 
She finished second at Trophy Lalique, and was poised to challenge 
Kwan this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like if I turned pro, it would be such an easy way  
out,'' she said last month. ``I felt like I still needed to do more 
out there. I felt I didn't fulfill what I've been brought on the 
ice to do. I felt I had so much more to offer the world and myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to finish on a note like (Nagano), a down  
note,'' she added. ``You want to finish with your head held high.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Scandals Cast Shadow on Nagano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGANO, Japan (AP) -- Olympic souvenirs stands once again lined  
the snowy streets of Nagano. The Snowlets, the games' owl mascots, 
were out in force. 
</P>
<P>
	And, yes, there were pins -- thousands and thousands of them -- to  
be bought or sold. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no escaping the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	As Nagano began a weekend of festivities to commemorate the  
one-year anniversary since the opening of the 1998 Winter Olympics, 
questions swirled over whether this central Japan city and other 
Olympic hosts went too far in wooing the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano's anniversary festivities began Saturday with a day-long  
concert in Olympic Square, the downtown plaza where most of the 
medals were awarded during the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the concert drew only a few hundred. And when it was over,  
the square reverted back to its current function -- as a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at a nearby hotel, Japan Olympic Committee officials  
met to look into questions about Nagano's bidding activities. They 
were scheduled to continue meeting through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC thing has really taken the fun out of it all,'' said  
Katsuyuki Yamazaki, who was selling Olympic pins from a street 
corner stall near Olympic Square. ``We'd like to have more fun with 
our anniversary, but with the scandal and all, we just can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is in a crisis over allegations that several cities --  
including Nagano, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Sydney and even Sapporo, 
site of the 1972 Winter Games -- went too far in their efforts to 
get the games, and may have crossed the line into bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Though embattled IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is staying  
away from Nagano, several senior IOC officials arrived Saturday for 
the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the city was executive board member Marc Hodler,  
who helped set off the investigations by claiming that prospective 
hosts regularly offered extravagant favors to IOC members in hopes 
of swaying their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in an interview with Japanese national broadcaster NHK,  
Hodler said: ``The people of Nagano, they were very keen to get the 
games. The cities have been in a very awkward position, and the 
mistake was done by certain members of the IOC to allow that kind 
of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler, head the international ski federation, is well known to  
Japanese Olympic fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Nagano Games began, he repeatedly said the course for  
the men's downhill was sub-standard, and threatened to have the 
competition moved elsewhere if the course was not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the games started, I really wondered if it was going to  
work,'' said Kazuo Kainuma, who runs a sporting goods store in 
downtown Nagano. ``Now, just when we are trying to celebrate our 
anniversary, we've got this scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that he is glad the Olympics came to Nagano.  
</P>
<P>
	``It put us on the map,'' he said. ``I guess it was a good  
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Maureen Reagan Criticizes Hinckley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's elder daughter said she will  
try to ensure her father's would-be assassin is not released from a 
mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the eve of her father's 88th birthday, Maureen  
Reagan criticized a recent federal court decision that could grant 
new freedoms to attempted assassin John W. Hinckley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the liberal judges in the District of Columbia  
-- that he will be the first assassin ever to be released from 
prison because I think there is that much animus on the left of the 
political system toward my father,'' Ms. Reagan said Friday in a 
taped interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in a live exchange on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Ms.  
Reagan said she ``will be watching to see that this is not the 
first presidential assassin in history to ever be released.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, the attempted assassin, is considered a patient, not a  
prisoner, because he was found innocent by reason of insanity of 
the 1981 shooting that wounded Reagan, aide James Brady and two law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, 43, said he was hoping to impress actress Jodie  
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court panel recently cleared the way for  
Hinckley to leave St. Elizabeths Hospital for brief, supervised 
visits with friends or family. Hinckley has been confined at the 
Washington hospital since 1982. The divided appeals panel said the 
hospital, not the court, should make such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley could make his first trip off hospital grounds as soon  
as next month. Hinckley's doctors support such trips as part of 
treatment that could eventually make Hinckley well enough for 
permanent release, Hinckley's lawyer has said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ABC interview, Ms. Reagan said she is irate that Hinckley  
could win even limited freedom. Hers is apparently the first Reagan 
family comment on the Jan. 15 decision from the U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent court history of the Hinckley case shows that neither  
Democrats nor Republicans have taken clear sides. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic appointee to the federal bench, U.S. District Court  
Judge June L. Green, intervened last year to prevent a planned 
off-campus visit between Hinckley, his parents and his girlfriend. 
The judge was acting at the behest of the local federal prosecutor, 
a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge appeals court panel that ruled last month  
included two judges appointed to the federal bench by Ronald 
Reagan. The third was a Democrat appointed by former President 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans split -- one voted with the Democrat to clear the  
way for Hinckley's supervised release and one Republican dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, who argue Hinckley still may be dangerous,  
have not decided whether to ask the full court to hear the case, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reagan's comments about Hinckley were part of a longer  
interview about Alzheimer's disease. Her father was diagnosed with 
the incurable, degenerative disease more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease has silenced the former president, and he no longer  
appears in public. He was expected to celebrate his birthday today 
at home in California.

<HEADLINE> Americans Crash in Downhill Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Hermann Maier showed what it takes to  
win a downhill. Daron Rahlves and Casey Puckett showed what a 
downhill can do to a skier. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier, the powerful and fearless Austrian, streaked to a  
gold medal in the men's downhill on Saturday, Rahlves and Puckett 
suffered horrendous crashes in this most dangerous of ski 
disciplines. That each managed more or less to walk away was as 
surprising as Maier's victory was thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to put on a show down here, but that's not what I had  
in mind,'' Puckett, of Crested Butte, Colo., said while swallowing 
aspirin moments after he crashed on the finishing face of the Birds 
of Prey downhill course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to slide through the finish for a second  
there. I was reaching out with my hand to see if I could do it. Oh, 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one shattered ski still attached, Puckett picked himself up  
and hopped across the finish line to a roaring reception from the 
crowd estimated at some 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt perfect when I stood up and was playing to the crowd  
but about two minutes later, I got this pounding headache,'' 
Puckett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett's crash was eerily similar to that of Canada's Cary  
Mullen in the debut race on this course in 1997. Mullen, however, 
was knocked unconscious and has been unable since to get back into 
racing form. He was home in Canada on Saturday, forced to watch the 
race on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was upside down, I was thinking `Cary Mullen,' because  
it's not too much different than what happened to him. But luckily 
I got up from it,'' Puckett said. ``Flying through the air upside 
down looking at the ground going by under you at about 70, the 
anticipation of what's going to happen is pretty frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahlves was nearing the finish when he caught an edge, beginning  
a spectacular 360-degree turn into a somersault that threw him into 
the safety fence. Except for some pain in his knee, not apparently 
caused by any structural damage, he managed to walk away on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't see the landing and when I landed I thought I had  
more to go,'' Rahlves, of Truckee, Calif., said. ``I landed sooner 
than I thought and the ski kind of edged. At that speed, you open 
up and get twisted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two oldest pros among the North Americans, Canada's Brian  
Stemmle and Vail, Colo.'s Chad Fleischer, managed to make it down 
in one piece. Stemmle, skiing only two weeks after a shoulder 
injury severe enough that he thought it would end his season, 
finished 16th in 1 minute, 43.69 seconds, 3.09 behind Maier. 
Teammate Darin McBeath was 20th in 1:44.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer was 23rd in 1:45.33, Canada's Kevin Wert was 27th in  
1:46.13, Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., was 28th in 1:46.48 
and Puckett made it across the finish line to take 34th in 1:54.88.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Denies Clemency to Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis denied clemency Saturday to  
a convicted double murderer who once trained as a Buddhist monk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaturun Siripongs, 43, is scheduled to be executed by injection  
at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday for the December 1981 murders of two people 
during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first clemency request to be considered by Davis, a  
Democrat who campaigned as an ardent supporter of the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the fact that Siripongs has been a model prisoner is  
irrelevant. ``Model behavior cannot bring back the lives of the two 
innocent murder victims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge blocked Siripongs' execution last November,  
saying the state may have misled defense lawyers about the evidence 
former Gov. Pete Wilson would consider when he denied clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Siripongs' native Thailand has asked that his  
life be spared and offered to take him off California's hands to 
serve a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings occurred at a Garden Grove market where Siripongs  
had worked part-time. He was convicted of strangling the manager, 
Packovan Wattanaporn, and stabbing an employee, Quach Nguyen. 
Siripongs was caught trying to use Mrs. Wattanaporn's credit card, 
and most of her stolen jewelry was also traced to him. 
</P>
<P>
	He has admitted taking part in the robbery but insisted the  
killer was an accomplice, whom he has refused to identify.

<HEADLINE> Florida St. AD Unhappy With Auburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State athletic director Dave  
Hart said Saturday he would seek recourse from Auburn after the 
Tigers canceled this year's opener with the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will deal with the specific elements of Auburn's untenable  
actions through the appropriate persons and channels over the 
course of the next several weeks,'' Hart said in a statement. ``For 
now, our focus has to be on finding an 11th game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Auburn chose to pay Florida State $500,000 rather  
than face the team coached by Bobby Bowden, father of ousted Tigers 
coach Terry Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huntsville (Ala.) Times reported Sunday that Auburn will now  
open against Appalachian State, a Division I-AA team from the 
Southern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State is still looking for an opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	Hart had refused comment Friday until he had an opportunity to  
talk to Auburn athletic director David Housel. When he did, it 
apparently wasn't very amicable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We prioritize class and integrity,'' Hart said Saturday. ``My  
remarks to David about how unacceptable I deem this action to be 
are best left in the private arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 2 Auburn-Florida State opener was to be televised on  
ESPN. It was to have been college football's first father-son 
coaching matchup, but Terry Bowden's bizarre departure from Auburn 
threatened to cast a long shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden will coach against one of his other sons, Tommy,  
when the Seminoles play Clemson later next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The controversy would become bigger than the game, and that  
would be unfair to the players and coaches on both sides,'' Housel 
had said upon announcing the Auburn decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, who won his first 20 games after taking the reigns at  
Auburn in 1993, resigned after the Tigers started the season with a 
1-5 record. He has said that he was ``fired,'' but Housel and other 
university officials have said he was not forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn reached a financial settlement with Terry Bowden on  
Monday, which bans the former Tigers coach and his wife from 
criticizing the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the contract, Auburn could buy out the game by paying  
$500,000 to Florida State. Housel said Auburn could recoup the 
payment by scheduling a seventh home game at Jordan-Hare Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Dennis Martinez Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Saying ``there is nothing more to  
do,'' pitcher Dennis Martinez is retiring after 22 seasons in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 44, finishes with a 245-193 career record, the most  
wins ever by a Latin American pitcher. Last Aug. 9, he led Atlanta 
over San Francisco to break the previous mark of 243, set by Juan 
Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who also retired midway through the 1997 only to come  
back with Atlanta last year, said Friday night that he may remain 
with the Braves as a pitching coach. He was 4-6 with a 4.45 ERA and 
two saves last year in five starts and 48 relief appearances with 
Atlanta. He also won Game 4 of the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman last year renamed Managua's national  
stadium for Martinez, the first Nicaraguan to play in the major 
leagues, calling him ``the maximum glory of national sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star broke in with Baltimore in 1976 and spent  
11 seasons with the Orioles. He then spent seven seasons with the 
Montreal Expos, three with Cleveland and half a year with the 
Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	With Montreal in 1991, he pitched a perfect game against the Los  
Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is the seventh pitcher ever to win 100 games in both  
the American and National leagues, and pitched a perfect game for 
Montreal against Los Angeles on July 28, 1991.

<HEADLINE> Fed Took Hands-Off Approach in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. monetary authorities followed a hands-off  
approach in currency markets during the last quarter of 1998, 
refusing to prop up the dollar even as it tumbled 17.4 percent 
against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York disclosed its  
non-intervention strategy in a quarterly report to Congress on 
Friday. The New York Fed acts as the agent for the U.S. Treasury 
and the entire Federal Reserve system in executing U.S. foreign 
exchange policy by buying and selling dollars in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the October-December quarter, the dollar had  
slipped from 136.50 yen to 112.80. The Fed, which rarely intervenes 
in currency markets, allowed the dollar to fall without 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent U.S.-led intervention occurred last June, when  
the Fed joined Japan's central bank in selling dollars to lift the 
yen from an eight-year low against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was virtually unchanged against the German mark,  
which became part of the euro currency on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's steep drop against the yen occurred as hedge funds  
and other investors sold off dollars to cover trading losses in 
other markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Those losses were sparked by the near-collapse of Long-Term  
Capital Management, a giant hedge fund for which the New York Fed 
led a $3.6 billion rescue in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 7, the dollar fell 6.7 percent against the yen, the  
largest daily percentage change between these two currencies since 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also moved erratically against the mark, starting the  
quarter at 1.61 marks. The dollar rose as the Fed eased interest 
rates three times during the quarter and investors anticipated rate 
reductions in Europe due to weak economic data there. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar peaked at 1.71 marks on November 27, but the mark  
rebounded when European monetary officials voiced doubts about 
cutting European interest rates. The dollar ended the quarter at 
1.68 marks after 11 European nations simultaneously lowered rates.

<HEADLINE> Payton Concentrates on Recuperating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Before crying at the end of his announcement that  
he needed a liver transplant, Walter Payton had cried only once 
after learning of his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was standing in the house and I'm putting on my clothes and  
my clothes didn't fit and my chest and stomach started to hurt and 
I just felt sorry for myself and broke down in tears because of the 
way I looked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton now no longer feels sorry for himself because it's a  
waste of time. He now is concentrating on recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he returned from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,  
where he went on the transplant list for a liver replacement, which 
has been damaged by a disease of the bile ducts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did preliminary work and came up positive, so I'm OK,''  
he told the Chicago Tribune. ``They did a biopsy of the ducts and 
came up with no cancers or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears Hall of Famer's blood type is O-positive, the  
most common, which improves his chance of getting a liver donor. It 
also means the type is shared by more of the 12,000 people already 
on the transplant list. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton has known since October that he needed a transplant, but  
told only his immediate family and former teammate Matt Suhey. He 
didn't want to tell anyone else until it was time for the 
operation, but his 35-pound weight loss to 185 pounds betrayed him, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the announcement, there has been a flood of mail to his  
offices, which he says he will try to answer personally. He also 
noted an increase in the awareness of the need for organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for playing despite pain and injury, Payton knows his  
current challenge is one he cannot overcome alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to stay positive,'' he said. ``Nobody else can make me  
stay positive. I have to do that. Then whatever happens, happens.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants To End Landing Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to end limits  
on how many planes can land each hour at airports in New York and 
Chicago, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in policy at New York's Kennedy International and La  
Guardia Airports and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport would 
make it easier for start-up airlines to compete with more 
established carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, citing people briefed on the plan, said the  
Transportation Department will present a request to Congress on 
Monday asking that the ``high density'' rule be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current regulations, the agency has created an advantage  
for ``incumbent'' carriers, and landing slots are bought and sold 
for as much as $3 million, the Times said. Without access to the 
slots, airlines cannot land at the airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Past debates on similar proposals have pitted lawmakers favoring  
increased air service against those concerned about local noise 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	La Guardia Airport currently limits arrivals to 68 an hour;  
Kennedy limits landings to between 75 and 95 an hour during the 
evening; and the O'Hare limit is 155 an hour.

<HEADLINE>  Maier Claims World Downhill Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Austria's bombastic Hermann Maier  
powered his way to victory in the men's downhill Saturday at the 
World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, 26, captured his second gold medal in as many events at  
these championships. He shared a gold medal with Norway's Lasse 
Kjus when they tied in the super-G on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Maier edged Kjus by .31 seconds on the steep,  
treacherous Birds of Prey course. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending World Cup overall, super-G and giant slalom  
champion, attacked from the start, clipping several gates as he 
sought the fastest line down the icy course. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, sixth out of the start house, took  
the early lead with a time of 1 minute, 41.17 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who won a World Cup downhill on this  
course last season, couldn't better Aamodt's time, but Maier could. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing eighth, ``The Herminator'' was faster than Aamodt at  
every intermediate clocking and finished in 1:40.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who won the super-G and giant slalom at the 1998  
Olympics, then waited anxiously in the finish area as Kjus, racing 
next, threatened his time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kjus, a dominating downhiller this season who has won four  
of the seven downhill races on the World Cup circuit and who leads 
both the downhill and overall standings, came up just short at 
1:40.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Then three other members of the powerful and deep Austrian team  
-- Werner Franz, Hans Knauss and Stephan Eberharter -- fell short as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt hung on for the bronze medal. Knauss, Eberharter and  
Franz finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively, in 1:41.19, 
1:41.40 and 1:41.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, the defending world downhill  
champion, was seventh in 1:41.98, and Norway's Audun Groenvold was 
eighth in 1:42.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghedina took ninth in 1:42.79, and Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn was  
10th in 1:42.94. 
</P>
<P>
	A light snowfall reduced visibility in the hours before the  
race. Skies cleared for the first 20 racers, but snow resumed for 
the next half-dozen racers. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian veteran Brian Stemmle was the top North American, tying  
for 16th in 1:43.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Fleischer of Vail, Colo., who placed fourth in a downhill  
training run, was the top American, finishing an unofficial 24th in 
1:45.33, nearly five seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Americans fell.  
</P>
<P>
	Daron Rahlves, nearly out of control twice but able to recover  
early in his run, crashed near the finish. Rahlves, of Truckee, 
Calif., lay motionless on the snow for several seconds, but soon 
was standing without assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Puckett of Crested Butte, Colo., who finished fifth in a  
training run, was well off the pace when he fell just shy of the 
finish, losing a ski. But he hopped on one ski the final 10 yards 
across the finish line to the delight of the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Pebble Beach Pro-Am Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Jack Lemmon will have to wait  
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lovable Oscar winner tried -- and failed -- to make the cut at  
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am for the estimated 25th time. 
Even Lemmon isn't sure of the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances looked good after Thursday's first round, when  
Lemmon and longtime pro partner Peter Jacobsen shot a combined 
10-under 62. But the duo's hopes dimmed on Friday with a 71. On 
Saturday they fell two strokes short of the cut with a 69 at the 
seaside Pebble Beach course in windy and rainy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	After hugging Jacobsen, Lemmon quietly left after the final  
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack played well,'' Jacobsen said. ``It's tough in the  
weather. It takes stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemmon, wearing a pale yellow sweater, clearly had the crowd on  
his side, even though weather was not. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend in the gallery Saturday on the No. 3 hole held out her  
hand and Lemmon grasped it tightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your touch,'' he said, giving the friend a warm hug.  
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work. On the new coastside No. 5 hole, Lemmon hit his  
ball on the beach from the tee. The real beach at Stillwater Cove. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK, Jack,'' a fan yelled, ``You'll get the next one.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jacobsen called Lemmon, 73, the ``godfather'' of the Pro-Am.  
</P>
<P>
	``People get the wrong opinion of Lemmon,'' he said. ``You know,  
how many guys make the cut here, 25 teams? How many start, 180? 
160? So he has come close, he is not a bad player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemmon, who has a tournament-high 21 handicap, came close last  
year, but El Nino's downpours put an end to the Pro-Am part of the 
tournament.

make the cut, then it rained out.''

	 *RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY:* Crosby Weather has returned to Pebble  
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of cold but dry conditions, the skies darkened  
over the Monterey Peninsula on Saturday and a light rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
	On the three courses used in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National  
Pro-Am, pin flags flapped in gusty winds up to 25 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pebble Beach course, exposed on many holes to the westerly  
winds off the Pacific, was especially treacherous for golfers -- and 
golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Peter Jacobsen watched as his tee shot from the No. 4 hole  
was carried by the wind. He gestured his hands in a furtive effort 
to right the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain was expected to continue Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The tournament, founded by Bing Crosby, has a long history of  
inclement weather. Last year, the final round was postponed until 
August because of El Nino's wrath. In 1996, the rain was so bad the 
Pro-Am was canceled because of unplayable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Pro-Am contestant Johnny Weissmuller, a world-class  
swimmer and Hollywood's Tarzan, commented: ``I've never been so wet 
in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in 1953, Ed ``Porky'' Oliver needed 16 shots on the  
over-the-water No. 16 at Cypress Point in 50 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like walking into a wall,'' actor Jack Lemmon said  
Saturday about the wind. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAFETY CONCERNS:* After Tiger Woods' brush with an armed man at  
the Phoenix Open last week, the frequent talk at the AT&AMP;T Pebble 
Beach National Pro-Am was security. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson said he has never experienced any security  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``No I haven't. But ever since that Monica Seles thing, it's  
been in the back of everyone's mind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Murphy had a loaded semiautomatic weapon when he was  
wrestled to the ground just yards from Woods in Phoenix, where 
carrying a gun with a permit is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson said Woods' experience was of special concern because  
of the weapon involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``A gun is so scary because you are out in the middle of  
nowhere, there is nothing you can do out in the middle of the 
fairway,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart, who had the lead at 10-under after three rounds  
on Saturday, said tighter security was likely a ``necessary evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that things like that would occur at a golf  
tournament, you know?'' he said. ``I just thought that the people 
that came out to watch golf, and the whole ambiance of a golf 
event, doesn't create that kind of mentality. But the way our 
society is today, obviously it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said at a players' meeting earlier this week, the issue  
of metal detectors was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't see that in golf,'' Stewart said. ``Hopefully it  
will never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Tiger Woods has committed to play the Buick Open next  
week in San Diego. Assuming Woods plays the Nissan Open in Los 
Angeles -- which he has never missed -- and then the Match Play 
Championship, it would be the first time in his career he has 
played five straight weeks. ... Cy Young winner Roger Clemens had a 
hole-in-one on the 17th hole at Poppy Hills. ... Dave Stockton Sr. 
was the only player to make the cut from the Senior PGA tour. His 
son, Dave Stockton Jr., missed the cut. ... Ty Armstong, who shot 
41 on the front at Spyglass on Saturday, was disqualified from the 
tournament when he failed to sign his scorecard.

<HEADLINE> Daytona 500 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rusty Wallace's litany of failure at  
Daytona International Speedway has been all but forgotten in the 
wake of his first victory on the 2 1/2-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
	His win last year in the non-points Bud Shootout, the  
made-for-TV race laden with pole winners from the previous season, 
convinced many that he could win at the track. Add a fifth-place 
finish in the 1998 Daytona 500, and Wallace now is looked upon as a 
genuine contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good that we're on the pole,'' said Wallace, who  
starts there Sunday, the result of a draw for the grid in the 
Shootout, the first event this year for Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But that came not as a result of the fast speeds he has posted  
in practice this month and in January testing. Call it the luck of 
the draw -- far better than the racing kind he knew for more than a 
decade at the Speedway -- but Wallace will take it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat there and said, `Now, where would somebody put No. 1 in  
this whole pile of frogs?' '' Wallace said of the blind draw in 
which he had the first shot at the rubber critters. ``I decided to 
take one which was up high and out of the way, so I grabbed it and 
it turned out to be the No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wallace, despite 48 career victories and the 1989 Winston  
Cup championship, is winless in 31 points races at the Speedway. 
Counting his victory last year in the Bud Shootout and a 1-for-6 
showing in IROC competition, Wallace is 2-for-66 in stock cars at 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace has been the fastest Ford since the track opened for  
testing last month. He's been so consistent that few suggestions 
have been made that 1998 was a fluke of good fortune for Wallace at 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of the bad days on the big track -- particularly a  
frightening crash six years ago -- and Wallace commits them to the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daytona has not been courteous to me in the past, but of late  
it's been pretty good,'' he said. ``The barrel rolls are things 
they're still talking about, but I don't want to talk about that 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a new car, and it's been flying.''  
</P>
<P>
	He proved that Saturday in qualifying for the Daytona 500, going  
194.187 mph -- the sixth-fastest time behind Jeff Gordon's 195.067. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COACH MARTIN:* Mark Martin is coming off a career year that  
added to his stature as one of the stars on the Winston Cup 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't consider himself much of a crew chief for his  
7-year-old son, Matt, a budding quarter-midget driver. Although the 
younger Martin did well in his introduction to competition last 
month, it might have been better had his father stayed out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month -- when Mark's NASCAR season is in full swing -- Matt  
will have to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate that I won't be able to go with him very much, but he  
may be better off without all my coaching,'' Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IRVAN'S WAIT:* It's been eight years since Ernie Irvan won the  
Daytona 500, and he has learned a valuable lesson about that. 
</P>
<P>
	He realizes that one victory in stock car racing's premier event  
does not ensure a second no matter how formidable a driver he is on 
superspeedways. And he says a driver can't sit back and think about 
the glory of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the only thing winning the Daytona 500 in 1991 means for  
me now is that I can say that I've done it,'' said Irvan, who will 
try to win the race for the second time Feb. 14. ``But on the other 
hand, not many people can say they've won the Daytona 500, so it is 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POLE SITTER HUTTER:* Matt Hutter has the speed -- as  
demonstrated by his pole-winning run for the FirstPlus Financial 
200, the season-opening event for the ARCA series. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wonders if he has the experience to hold on Sunday over  
200 miles at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys have a lot more experience than I have,'' said  
Hutter, whose speed of 188.869 mph put his Chevrolet on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bobby Gerhart, who has the outside of the front row, Joe  
Ruttman, Ron Barfield and two-time winner Andy Hillenburg will be 
extremely tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big deal at a track like this where drafting is such a  
factor is that if we do get shuffled back a little, to just be 
patient and not make any stupid moves and we'll end up back in the 
front,'' Hutter said.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Makes Video Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky dipped her head, ebony hair  
falling over her face. Vernon Jordan once teased her about being in 
love with the president, she recalled. A smile of fond reminiscence 
lifted her glossed lips. ``I probably blushed or giggled or 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since America learned her name, memorized her  
face and scrutinized her voice on those phone tapes by Linda Tripp, 
the entire Monica Samille Lewinsky made her videotape debut -- with 
a youthful, wide-eyed earnestness -- from the Senate floor Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor James Rogan, aiming to showcase Ms. Lewinsky,  
25, as ``a young woman very much like a family member or friend we 
might know,'' opened the witness phase of President Clinton's 
impeachment trial with a clip of her swearing to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Raised in oath, her short-fingered hand looked like that of a  
child and seemed to emphasize her youth. Rogan, R-Calif., called 
the former White House intern's testimony ``an image that the 
president did not want America to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other House trial managers aired snippets of Ms.  
Lewinsky's Feb. 1 deposition to stitch together their case that 
Clinton should be removed from office for perjury and obstruction 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Nicole Seligman called the pick-and-choose clips  
``terribly misleading.'' In her defense presentation, she tried to 
pull the rug out from under any drama by airing a lengthy chunk of 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, even playing several portions twice. 
</P>
<P>
	From four televisions -- normally contraband in the hallowed  
Senate chamber -- senators and a phalanx of White House attorneys 
watched Ms. Lewinsky testify with crisp nods and a rehearsed 
brevity about the coverup of her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Many responses were in one word: ``Correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did she know what Clinton meant when, in a 2 a.m. phone call  
after the Paula Jones case began to close in on them, he talked of 
cover stories? ``Yes. ... Because it was part of the pattern of the 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small microphone clipped to her tidy black jacket, Ms.  
Lewinsky telegraphed the focus and composure of a TV news anchor -- 
a vivid contrast to her shrieking sobs so often heard on the Tripp 
phone tapes, and to the otherworldly impassiveness she showed to 
the TV cameras that staked out her every move this past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither siren nor victim, Ms. Lewinsky appeared in muted makeup  
with pearls at her throat and her dark hair primly framing her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting, a drab gray screen identical to the backdrop used  
for video depositions by Jordan and White House adviser Sydney 
Blumenthal, suggested nothing of the lavish Mayflower Hotel 
presidential suite where Ms. Lewinsky was questioned before dozens 
of lawyers and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once, near the start, was she seen taking a small,  
steadying breath. About 2 1/2 hours into it, as she waited for another 
question, her naturally downturned mouth and round eyes had the 
look of an alarmed child trying not to cry. 
</P>
<P>
	Her head slightly tilted through almost all four hours of  
questioning, Ms. Lewinsky followed Rep. Ed Bryant's often redundant 
queries. ``As I've testified numerously ... ,'' she began at one 
point, an exasperated laugh in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
	She leaned forward and punctuated each word with an emphatic nod  
when she testified that, after speaking to Clinton about her 
subpoena from Mrs. Jones' lawyers, ``I knew I would deny the 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks broadcast Ms. Lewinsky's appearance nationwide but  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., saw no trial-altering impact. ``She 
comes across as a nice young woman from California,'' said Boxer, a 
Clinton defender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a bombshell to see her, to put the voice  
and the face together.''

<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old international business student  
from the University of Buffalo has been crowned Miss USA 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss New York, Kimberly Ann Pressler, broke up the audience  
Friday night when host Shemar Moore, from the soap opera ``The 
Young and the Restless,'' asked whether she would leave her 
boyfriend behind to wear the Miss USA crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh definitely I would,'' she quickly replied as she waved to  
her boyfriend in the audience. ``I think if true love is there it 
will be there afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tennessee, Morgan Tandy High, was named first runner-up.  
Miss California, Angelique Breaux, was the second runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pressler, who is considering a career as an actress, became

experience of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you guys tell I'm happy?'' she asked a crowd of reporters.  
``I feel my smile is filling up my whole face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another night, before another set of judges, Miss Pressler  
said, she might have lost. 
</P>

	``You just have to be in the right place at the right time with

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tells Party to Start Fresh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Two successful elections do not a revived  
party make, former Sen. Bill Bradley cautioned Virginia Democrats 
Saturday in a speech designed to set an agenda for his upstart 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaken not long ago by the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress,  
the Democratic Party rebounded with President Clinton's re-election 
in 1996 and with history-defying gains in Congress in the off-year 
election of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley said the party remains in need of a ``fresh start.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Our party has competed handsomely in recent years on the  
mechanics,'' said the former star basketball player and three-term 
senator from New Jersey in an advance copy of the speech. ``We are 
not to be outdone in fund-raising or constant polling or effective 
'spin.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he added, ``This is not enough to make us a great party  
which can attract again, as it did earlier this century, the 
loyalties or respect or affections of millions of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the only challenger thus far to Vice President Al Gore  
for the Democratic nomination in 2000, said the party has to regain 
the confidence and conviction that made him a Democrat in the 1960s 
after growing up in a Republican home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's staff described the speech at the annual  
Jefferson-Jackson fund-raising dinner, as the first major policy 
exposition of his young campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiding by his plan not to run explicitly against Gore, Bradley  
made no mention of the vice president or of President Clinton. But 
in several passages, Bradley implicitly criticized the Clinton-Gore 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compromise that offends no one and gives everyone something  
might help us win in the short term,'' he said, ``but our party 
will cease to have any long-term meaning or content at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another passage, Bradley took a swipe at ``rhetorical  
flourishes followed by tiny demonstration projects,'' adding: ``We 
need an honest conversation with the American people, even if it 
endangers our poll standing for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Bradley can offer his voice as the only alternative for  
dissenting Democrats. Last week, House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt joined a growing list of prominent Democrats choosing to 
bypass the presidential campaign. Gephardt will try instead to 
become speaker of the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's supporters are portraying him as the logical successor to  
preside over the booming economy and popular Clinton initiatives 
like worker retraining. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley offered a four-point plan ``not only to win again, but  
lead again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said voting should be made easier, through same-day  
registration, voting by mail, even voting on the Internet someday. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for campaign finance reform, an issue he has embraced  
by declaring he will not accept money from political action 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	He said public service must be incorporated into party  
activities, suggesting that members of a Democratic club read to 
the elderly or tutor children on computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to mentor a child, care for a senior, clean up  
your local environment, and you have six hours a week, a citizen 
ought to be able to call Democratic headquarters and find out where 
he or she can go.''

<HEADLINE> Alfonzo, Mets Agree to $18.4M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The way the New York Mets view it, if Edgardo  
Alfonzo keeps producing the way he did last year, his new $18.4 
million, four-year contract will be a steal for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good we were able to lock in place what we feel will  
be one of the best infields in baseball this year,'' Mets general 
manager Steve Phillips said after agreeing to the deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, being moved from third base to second this year to make  
way for Robin Ventura, hit .278 last season and set career highs 
with 17 homers and 78 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who made $1.75 million last year, asked for $3.85  
million in arbitration and was offered $2.5 million. The deal calls 
for a $500,000 signing bonus -- $300,000 payable now and $200,000 in 
January 2000 -- and salaries of $2,675,000 this year, $4 million in 
2000, $5.5 million in 2001 and $5,725,000 in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains escalators and bonus clauses that could raise  
its total value to $24.8 million if Alfonzo becomes a four-time 
All-Star and wins four Gold Gloves and Silver Sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 25 years old and improving, and showed some power  
potential later in the year,'' Phillips said, referring to 
Alfonzo's seven home runs in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who would have been eligible for free agency after the  
2000 season, was out of the country and unavailable for comment, 
``attending to his cows and building a house in Venezuela,'' 
according to the player's agent, Peter Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard cows mooing in the back when I've talked to him,''  
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo played third base during the winter league, not wanting  
to displace Houston's Carlos Hernandez at second. But Greenberg 
said Alfonzo worked out at second before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have any concern about it at all,'' Phillips said.  
``Edgardo is cautious and humble in talking about it. I know inside 
he's confident about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, with a payroll more than $60 million, thought about  
negotiating a one-year contract and an extension after opening day, 
or even putting together a tentative multiyear deal and announcing 
it after the opener. That way, the later years wouldn't count 
toward the luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in doing a deal and holding it,'' Phillips  
said. ``One, it's against the rules. Two, there are so many assumed 
risks, both on the player's part and the club's part, that it's not 
worth it.''
