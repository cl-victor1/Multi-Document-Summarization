<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Craig Shipley hit an RBI single in the 10th
inning and the Anaheim Angels, after rallying for three runs in the
ninth, beat the Minnesota Twins 6-5 Thursday.
	   The Angels trailed 5-2 in the ninth before coming back against
Rick Aguilera, who has blown eight of 30 save chances. Tim Salmon
hit an RBI single and Jim Edmonds tied it with a two-out, two-run
single.
	   Anaheim loaded the bases with one out in the 10th against Hector
Carrasco (3-2) on a single by Cecil Fielder, a double by Salmon and
an intentional walk to Garret Anderson. Shipley followed with a
bloop single to center.
	   Pep Harris (2-0) got one out for the win. Troy Percival pitched
the 10th for his 29th save.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Indians 2 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Damion Easley extended his hitting streak to 19
games with a single in the sixth inning and scored the go-ahead run
on Bobby Higginson's single.
	   Easley, who also had a 19-game hitting streak earlier this
season, became the first Tigers player to have two streaks that
long in the same season since 1953, when the team began keeping
such records.
	   Frank Castillo (3-6) shut down Cleveland for 5 2-3 innings
despite entering the game with an 8.07 ERA. Outdueling Jaret Wright
(9-6), Castillo allowed two runs and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings.
	   Sean Runyan, in his major league-leading 57th appearance, got
Kenny Lofton to ground out with the bases loaded to end the sixth.
Doug Brocail pitched 1 1-3 innings, striking out Lofton with
runners at first and third and two outs in the eighth.
	   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his 18th save.
	   Jim Thome hit his 28th homer for Cleveland.
 &UR; Red Sox 8, Blue Jays 7, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Boston, Jason Varitek's pinch-hit single in the 10th inning
capped Boston's comeback from a five-run deficit.
	   Trailing 6-1, Damon Buford's grand slam in the eighth cut it to
6-5. Mike Stanley's RBI single in the ninth put Toronto up 7-5, but
Randy Myers, who had converted 59 of his previous 62 save
opportunities, couldn't get one this time as the Red Sox tied it in
the ninth on John Valentin's RBI double and Troy O'Leary's
run-scoring single.
	   Tom Gordon (5-3) held Toronto scoreless in the 10th. Myers (3-3)
retired the first two batters in the bottom of the inning. But
Darren Lewis singled and stole second. Valentin then was walked
intentionally.
	   With Gordon due up after numerous lineup changes, Varitek
pinch-hit and dumped a soft hit into short right field as Lewis
scored easily.
 &UR; Rangers 8, Royals 4 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Rusty Greer went 3-for-5 and drove in
three runs for Texas.
	   Juan Gonzalez drove in a run for his major league-leading 114th
RBI and Bill Haselman homered and drove in two runs. Ivan
Rodriguez, who had been in an 0-for-12 slump, and Mark McLemore
each had three hits for Texas.
	   Jose Offerman went 4-for-4 for Kansas City.
	   Greer, Gonzalez and Roberto Kelly each hit RBI singles in the
third. Greer added a two-out, two-run single in the fourth for a
5-0 lead.
	   Reliever Xavier Hernandez (5-1) defused two Kansas City rallies
in the middle innings. He took over for starter Darren Oliver with
two outs and three runs across in the Royals' four-run fifth.
	   Kansas City loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth, but
Hernandez got Jeff King to ground into a force.
	   Glendon Rusch (6-12) was tagged for 13 hits in four-plus
innings.

Speak up on human rights, protesters tell ASEAN ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Carrying portraits of Burmese
dissident Aung San Suu Kyi and East Timor independence leader
Xanana Gusmao, about 50 people rallied Friday urging Southeast
Asian governments to speak up on human rights issues.
	   The protesters marched to the Manila Hotel, where foreign
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were
holding their annual meeting. Hotel guards locked the gates, so the
protesters lined both sides of the driveway.
	   ``We just want to tell the world what is happening in Burma!'' a
protest leader, Edgar Bilayon of the Philippine Railway Workers
Union, shouted to an officer as the protesters were kept back.
	   The protesters want more pressure exerted on Myanmar where a
military government that crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 1988
has been blamed for widespread human rights abuses and suppression
of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. They also want
Indonesia to give independence to the island of East Timor, where
the Indonesian military has been accused of atrocities.
	   Myanmar and Indonesia are members of ASEAN. On Thursday, the
association's ministers agreed that while they would maintain the
policy of not interfering in each other's domestic affairs, they
would speak more openly and frankly when events in one country
caused problems in others.
	   The first test case of this new policy, the protesters said,
should be Myanmar, particularly as tensions are rising over Suu
Kyi's demand that the military allow the Parliament elected in 1990
to convene.
	   ``If the military refuse to recognize our call for dialogue,
there will be more confrontation,'' said one protester, Aung Nain,
chairman of a group exiled in Thailand, the All Burma Students
Democratic Front.

Five women found dead in apparent suicide pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The decomposing bodies of three women and two
teenage girls who apparently died in a suicide pact were found in
an empty Hong Kong flat, police said Friday.
	   Police said in a statement that there were no signs of struggle.
However, a pair of black scissors tied to a wok with red strings
was found hanging from a window, a cult variant of a traditional
Chinese symbol to avert evil spirits.
	   The three women were identified only by their surnames as Choi,
44 years old; Lam, 49; and Chui, 40. The two girls, 13 and 17 years
old, were daughters of the woman named Chui.
	   Police said three suicide notes apparently written by one of the
women were found along with the bodies on Thursday afternoon.
	   The five may have been dead for nearly 46 hours, police said.
They did not say how they might have died.
	   ``There were also no signs the women had been sexually
attacked,'' the Hong Kong Standard quoted police Superintendent
Cheung Yuk-fung as saying.
	   Husbands of two of the women reported their wives missing on
July 21, the statement said.
	   One of them found the decomposing bodies by calling his wife's
friends and leading police to the flat in Hong Kong's Kowloon Bay
district, near old Kai Tak airport.

Moody's downgrades bonds, predicts worse recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An influential bond ratings agency
rattled Malaysia on Friday by predicting the economy would shrink
by up to 5 percent this year.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the country's
long-term bond ratings to a medium grade just two notches above
junk-bond status. Moody's also downgraded Malaysia's short-term
foreign currency bonds.
	   Moody's assessment came one day after Malaysia announced an
ambitious plan to revitalize an economy sinking into recession.
Thursday's government forecasts said the economic contraction would
be checked at 2 percent this year and it would begin to recover in
1999.
	   The plan charted ways to fund banks weighed down by bad debts,
revive sinking companies and maintain a stable currency rate.
	   Malaysia's newly industrialized economy grew at a galloping pace
in the last decade. In 1997, it posted gross domestic product
growth of 7.8 percent
	   The Malaysian ringgit dipped in morning trading after the
Moody's announcement. It slid to 4.16 ringgit per U.S. dollar from
4.11 ringgit to a dollar.
	   The rating agency said the downgrade reflected ``the rapid
deterioration in Malaysia's economy this year and the expected
effects on the banking system and on government finance.''
	   Moody's also criticized Malaysia's policy response to the Asian
economic crisis as lacking in direction.
	   ``This has been demonstrated by, among other things, a public
debate over monetary policy among top political leaders,'' Moody's
said in a statement faxed by its New York office.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has often differed in public
with the central bank's tight monetary policy and high interest
rate regime. The policy, until recently, had been backed by Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, fueling speculation of a rift in the top
echelons of power.
	   ``As the economic downturn deepens, economic policy could be
further affected by rising social tensions,'' Moody's said.

Indians trade Jose Mesa to Giants in five-player deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Jose Mesa, the troubled Cleveland reliever who
could not close out Game 7 of last year's World Series, was traded
by the Indians to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher Steve Reed
in a five-player deal Thursday night.
	   The AL Central-leading Indians also sent infielder Shawon
Dunston and pitcher Al Morman to the Giants, contending for the NL
wild-card spot. Cleveland got outfielder Jacob Cruz along with
Reed.
	   Earlier in the day, the Indians acquired reliever Doug Jones _
their career saves leader _ from Milwaukee for pitcher Eric Plunk.
	   The Indians addressed their biggest need by bolstering their
bullpen. They also traded away some bad karma in dealing Mesa.
	   Mesa, whose 1997 season began in court answering rape charges,
had a chance to give Cleveland its first World Series since 1948
last year. He relieved with a one-run lead in the ninth inning of
Game 7, but allowed Florida to tie it. The Marlins went on to win
in the 11th inning.
	   Mesa, 32, was 3-4 with one save and a 5.17 ERA in 44 games. He
was pitching as a setup man to Mike Jackson, the Indians' current
closer.
	   In 1995, Mesa led the majors with 46 saves and finished fourth
in the AL MVP voting and second in the Cy Young race.
	   Morman, 29, was 0-1 with a 5.32 ERA. Dunston, 35, who previously
played for the Giants, was hitting .237 with three homers and 12
RBIs as a backup infielder.
	   Reed, 32, was 2-1 with one save and a 1.48 ERA in 50 games. He
held opponents to a .160 batting average.
	   Cruz, 25, was hitting .298 with 18 homers and 62 RBIs for
Triple-A Fresno.

Analysts: Two Singapore banks likely to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A merger is likely between Development Bank of
Singapore Ltd. and POSBank, as bank officials and the government
called press conferences for later Friday, analysts said.
	   A merger of the two banks, both already linked to the
government, would benefit DBS, one of the island republic's `big
four' banks, by improving DBS' asset quality and capitalization,
analysts told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   DBS shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore were suspended
from trading Friday.
	   DBS has scheduled a press briefing at 0700 GMT Friday, and the
Ministry of Finance has also called a press conference, to begin an
hour earlier.
	   Lim Beng Eu, an analyst at Vickers Ballas, said such a merger
would boost DBS' capitalization, allowing it to realize its goal of
becoming a major regional player.
	   ``It would provide DBS Bank with the necessary cash to expand in
the region,'' he said, adding: ``If DBS announces a merger, it will
improve its position as Singapore's strongest and largest bank.''
	   Singapore's four major banks made substantial provisions last
year for their regional exposure and are expected to make further
provisions when they announce their half year interim results.
	   Analysts said other possible announcements that could be made by
DBS are the acquisition of a small regional bank or a tie-up with a
major foreign bank.

Malaysia signs nuclear test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has joined a growing list
of countries by signing a global nuclear test ban treaty, the
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed by Malaysia's
permanent representative to the United Nations, Hasmy Agam, in New
York on Thursday, a ministry statement said.
	   Malaysia will soon take the necessary steps to ratify the
treaty, it said.
	   ``The signing of the CTBT is in consonance with Malaysia's firm
commitment to the goals of general and complete disarmament,'' it
said.
	   ``It is also a reaffirmation of Malaysia's consistent support
towards all international efforts aimed at nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.''
	   Visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer welcomed
the step, ``particularly in light of the challenges to the global
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime posed by the
recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan.''
	   The CTBT, hammered out at a 1996 international conference in
Geneva, has been signed by 150 countries. Fifteen countries have
ratified the treaty, which will be enforced only after all 44
countries which have nuclear facilities have ratified it.
	   The treaty bans all nuclear test explosions and provides for a
verification regime that consists of an international monitoring
system, a consultation mechanism, on-site inspections and
confidence-building measures.

War-era bombs self-detonate in Vietnam heat wave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A weeklong heat wave caused four war-era
bombs to self-detonate in central Vietnam, including a napalm
device that destroyed 30 hectares (74 acres) of forests, police
said Friday.
	   Police officer Vo Van Thai said from Quang Tri province that
temperatures were nearly 40 C (104 F) when the napalm bomb went off
around noon Monday in the Cam Lo district. Firefighters battled the
ensuing blaze for more than four hours.
	   Three other bombs self-detonated Tuesday in fields in the
provincial town of Dong Ha, police said. No casualties were
reported.
	   Quang Tri was the site of fierce fighting during the Vietnam
War. The Demilitarized Zone ran through the province.
	   Millions of war-era bombs and other ordnance remain scattered
about the Vietnamese countryside. There are reports of casualties
almost every week in Quang Tri as many poor farmers risk their
lives to collect scrap iron to make a little money.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While NBA players are locked out this summer, a
team of U.S. college kids is on a roll at Madison Square Garden.
	   The United States defeated Lithuania 89-76 Thursday night to
advance to the Goodwill Games' gold-medal basketball game.
	   They will play Friday night against Australia, which beat
defending champion Puerto Rico 86-74. And in this case, there will
be more NBA experience on the Australian team than among the
Americans.
	   While NBA stars from the United States never were scheduled to
play in this tournament, even before the current labor dispute,
this U.S. team was still a young college squad.
	   And it started the Goodwill tournament by taking a 19-point lead
over Puerto Rico, then losing by eight. Undaunted, the Americans
came back to defeat Brazil and China to reach the medal round.
	   A 3-pointer by Wally Szczerbiak of Miami-Ohio, who led a
balanced U.S. offense with 20 points, gave the Americans a 19-point
lead over Lithuania with 14 1/2 minutes left.
	   That was about the time the U.S. folded against Puerto Rico. But
this time, the Americans held steady, and seven points in a 2
1/2-minute span by Keith Carter of Mississippi made it 76-51 with
9:09 to go.
	   Duke's Elton Brand scored 15 points, Carter had 12, Andre Miller
of Utah 11 and Jumaine Jones of Georgia 10 for the United States.
	   Danius Adomaitis led Lithuania with 21 points.
	   Szczerbiak had three 3-pointers and 13 points in the first half
for the United States, carrying it to a 51-35 lead. Lithuania,
which will play Puerto Rico in the bronze-medal game Friday night,
got no closer than the final margin in the second half.
	   Shane Heal, who played one season for the Minnesota
Timberwolves, led Australia with 21 points, and Tony Ronaldson had
20, including two 3-pointers during a 14-0 burst at the start of
the second half that extended a three-point lead to 58-41.
	   Andrew Gaze, who led Seton Hall to the U.S. collegiate
championship game in 1989, scored 15 points and Chris Antsey of the
Dallas Mavericks had 14.
	   ``The Goodwill Games are no longer a tuneup,'' Gaze said. ``We
were out there to win a medal. The Goodwill Games are earning a
fair amount of prestige, and to come away with a medal is
important.
	   ``It's not the Olympics or the World Championships, but it means
a lot to us and the Australian public. No matter where we play, we
represent Australia because we wear the green and gold.''
	   Jose Ortiz, formerly of the Utah Stars, led Puerto Rico with 23
points.
	   Trent Wells of Keizer, Oregon, thought he had a silver medal in
the men's parallel bars but wound up with no medal at all. Judges
twice changed scores after reviewing routines and dropped Wells
from a tie for second to fourth, behind Xu Huang of China, Ivan
Ivankov of Belarus and Aleksei Bondarenko of Russia.
	   Ivankov then won the high bar, holding off Russia's Alexei
Nemov. It was the fourth medal for Ivankov, including the
all-around gold. Bondarenko finished with three silvers and two
bronze.
	   In rhythmic gymnastics, Alina Kabayeva of Russia won the
all-around gold, leading each of the four disciplines.
	   Diving began, with world champion Irina Lashko of Russia winning
the 1-meter (-yard) springboard over China's Guo Jingjing. The
Chinese pair of Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei won the men's
synchronized platform gold, posting the day's only perfect scores.
	   Beach volleyball's grand old man, 41-year-old Sinjin Smith,
injured his left calf as he and U.S. teammate Ricci Luyties lost
15-5 to Canada's John Child and Mark Heese. Smith returned to the
match after a 5-minute timeout and said he would play Friday
against the top U.S. team, Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson, which
lost to Brazil's Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira 15-3. Brazil
scored the first three points and then ran off seven in a row for a
10-1 lead.
	   In other matches on the Central Park sand, Martin Conde and
Esteban Martinez of Argentina took 1 hour, 19 minutes and 135
serves to defeat defending champions Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn
Maaseide of Norway 16-14, and Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia beat Martin and Paul Laciga of Switzerland 15-13.

North Korea returns remains of U.S. soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with details, quote &QL;

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday returned three
sets of skeletal remains believed to be those of U.S. soldiers
killed in the Korean War.
	   Three gray metal coffins were handed across the border in a
simple but solemn ceremony at this hamlet inside the demilitarized
zone separating the two Koreas.
	   Found in northwestern North Korea, the remains were believed to
be those of soldiers of the 24th Infantry Regiment who died during
battles in 1952, U.S. military officials said.
	   ``Their repatriation is an example of the U.S. government's
efforts to find and bring home its fallen soldiers, going wherever
they are believed to be lying,'' said Alan Liotta, deputy director
of the Defense Department's office for prisoners of war and
soldiers missing in action.
	   Each coffin was received by a five-member U.N. honor guard,
draped in a light blue U.N. flag and saluted by dozens of U.S. and
South Korean military officers, including Gen. John H. Tilelli, the
U.S. military commander in South Korea.
	   The ceremony ended in 20 minutes with a prayer by a U.S.
military chaplain. The remains were later flown to the U.S. Army's
Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for forensic tests and
identification.
	   It was the second repatriation of U.S. remains since May, when
two sets were returned. All of the remains have been excavated by
joint American-North Korean teams.
	   Since 1990, 221 sets of remains have been returned but less than
a dozen have been positively identified.
	   It is the third year that Pentagon teams have conducted joint
recovery operations with the North Koreans. In 1996 and 1997, the
remains of seven servicemen were recovered. One has been identified
and returned to his family for burial.
	   North Korea has agreed to allow five U.S. excavation operations
in its territory this year, for which Washington has agreed to pay
dlrs 600,000 to cover basic expenses.
	   A third operation will begin in 10 days, with the last scheduled
to conclude in October, Liotta said.
	   More than 8,000 U.S. servicemen are listed as unaccounted for
from the Korean War. Pentagon officials estimate that the remains
of 3,000-4,000 might be recoverable.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea. The U.S. and 15
other Western countries formed a U.N. command to fight on South
Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   South Korea and North Korea remain technically in a state of
war, because the Korean conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty.

Chang continues Washington success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Not even a rainstorm could cool Michael Chang
on Thursday in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   The top-seeded Chang cruised to his 14th straight victory at the
FitzGerald Tennis Center with a 6-4, 6-1 third-round victory over
Martin Damm of the Czech Republic.
	   Second-seed Andre Agassi, a three-time Legg Mason champion, also
advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Christophe Van Garsse of
Belgium.
	   It was the second victory for Agassi over Van Garsse in less
than a week. The two met last weekend in Indianapolis in Davis Cup
action.
	   A two-time Legg Mason defending champion, Chang also won two
singles matches here last September in a Davis Cup semifinal
against Australia.
	   Washington, Chang said, has been ``a good place for me. I feel
comfortable with the courts, the setting and the crowd support.''
	   Chang was serving for the first set at 5-3 when a flash of
lightning caught the players attention. Damm broke Chang as play
continued to the sound of not-so-distant thunder.
	   ``It took my mind off the situation a little bit. You hear
thunder and you start looking up to the sky. Nobody wants to get
hurt,'' Chang said.
	   During the changeover at 5-4 the storm hit and play was delayed
for almost 90 minutes. Chang broke Damm's service after the delay
to win the first set and then cruised to victory in the second set.
	   Playing in much cooler conditions after the storm, unseeded
Sebastian Lareau of Canada, sixth-seed Vincent Spadea and
seventh-seed Jim Courier advanced with third-round victories.
	   Courier took care of Davis Cup teammate Justin Gimelstob 6-3,
6-4 and will face Chang in a quarterfinal Friday.
	   Advancing earlier Thursday were third-seed Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa, fifth-seed Filip DeWulf of Belgium and 14th-seed
Scott Draper of Australia.
	   Draper beat fourth-seed Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-4. The
left-hander from Brisbane had bounced Byron's brother, Wayne, out
of the tournament in the second round.
	   Ferreira took care of his second straight crowd-pleaser. On
Tuesday Ferreira stopped the comeback of Jimmy Arias and on
Wednesday he ended the run of qualifier David Caldwell.
	   Caldwell couldn't handle Ferreira's serve, which clocked 123 mph
(198 kph). Caldwell, 0-5 on the tour before his two victories this
week, fell 7-5, 6-3.

Tension, hope as Cambodian election campaign enters final day
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The violence-strewn campaign for
Cambodia's second election in the post-Khmer Rouge era entered a
final day of hope and tension Friday, as monks led thousands of
people in a march for peace and a main opposition candidate set up
a challenge to strongman Hun Sen.
	   Buddhist monks and nuns concluded a week-long march from the
countryside and entered the capital, their numbers swelling from
150 to 3,000 as lay people joined near the Angkor-style
Independence Monument. Banners read: ``The more we fight, the more
we lose,'' and ``We want a non-violent election.''
	   Hun Sen has been widely accused of using violence and fear to
ensure he wins Sunday's vote. It comes a year after he deposed his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in fighting in the capital
with tanks, mortars and rockets. The campaign officially ends
Friday, followed by a cooling-off day.
	   Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister and dissident with wide
support in Phnom Penh, planned to close his campaign by
highlighting what he calls a choice between communist-era
dictatorship and democracy.
	   Sam Rainsy was to lead supporters in a convoy of trucks for a
rally at a park near the National Assembly, where on March 30,
1997, grenades were hurled into a protest he was leading. Sixteen
people died. Sam Rainsy was among more than 100 injured.
	   The attack has widely been blamed on Hun Sen but, like the
killings of some 100 Ranariddh supporters after last year's coup
and more than 20 pre-election murders believed to be political, no
one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.
	   Afterward, Sam Rainsy plans to take the trucks into Takhmau, the
town outside Phnom Penh where Hun Sen lives. Roads to Hun Sen's
house _ known as the ``Tiger's Lair'' _ were likely to be blocked
by security forces. Hun Sen has been recovering at home from an
appendectomy.
	   The Cambodian capital has been calm, but an under-current of
tension remains. Many fear that if Hun Sen loses the vote he would
call out the army to retain power.
	   The human-rights group Amnesty International issued a statement
condemning on-going violence and intimidation and said that
``near-silence'' from the international community was helping
perpetuate it.
	   The march by the Buddhist monks amounted to a pre-election vote
for peace.
	   ``Our aim is to calm things down before election day,'' said
Kong Vuthy, assistant to Maha Ghosananda, Cambodia's supreme
Buddhist patriarch and frequent nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize
for leading peace marches through war-torn, mine-laden territory.
	   Shielded from the blazing morning sun by saffron parasols, the
monks and their followers, some holding single lotus flowers, filed
silently thorugh the streets. They planned to converge on the Royal
Palace.
	   Opposition leaders acknowledge the campaign has been relatively
peaceful compared to 1993, when the Khmer Rouge guerrillas remained
a deadly force and launched attacks against towns and ethnic
Vietnamese villages.
	   The United Nations deployed 20,000 peacekeepers and spent dlrs 3
billion organizing that election, meant to bring peace and
democracy after decades of civil war and the Khmer Rouge regime of
the late 1970s that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people.
	   The result was imperfect. Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party
won. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the harsh
Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge regime, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   This time, Cambodia is organizing the election and the U.N. role
is limited largely to coordinating some 678 foreign observers. Hun
Sen-linked organizations have tried to dominate the Cambodian
component of the observation missions. His government needs the
vote to restore international legitimacy and aid lost after the
coup.
	   The Khmer Rouge are no longer a significant factor after mass
defections over the past two years. A few hundred die-hard rebels
have vowed to disrupt the polls and attacked an election convoy
last week, killing two people, but thousands of their ex-comrades
have made peace and will vote for the first time in their lives.
	   Overall, some 5.4 million people are registered to vote for 122
National Assembly seats.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A group of college kids is proving the critics
wrong in the Goodwill Games.
	   Seemingly too inexperienced to match up against veteran
international opponents, the U.S. basketball team dominated its
third straight game after a disheartening opener, and now finds
itself in the gold-medal game.
	   ``The best basketball talent obviously has gone on to the NBA,''
coach Clem Haskins said after the United States defeated Lithuania
89-76 Thursday night in the semifinals. ``We could have guys like
Kevin Garnett on this team, but these guys are very coachable and I
wouldn't trade them for anyone else. But we have a tough task ahead
against a team with three NBA-quality players.''
	   The Americans will play Friday night against Australia, which
beat defending champion Puerto Rico 86-74. Shane Heal, on the
Minnesota Timberwolves roster two seasons ago; Chris Antsey of the
Dallas Mavericks; and Andrew Gaze, a Seton Hall star in 1989 who
had short NBA tryouts, are three of Australia's top players.
	   NBA stars from the United States never were scheduled to play in
this tournament, even before the current labor dispute. So this
U.S. team is a young college squad.
	   It started the Goodwill tournament by taking a 19-point lead
over Puerto Rico, then losing by eight. Undaunted, the Americans
came back to defeat Brazil and China to reach the medal round.
	   ``I was down a little bit on Monday after we lost Sunday night,
but the guys bounced back and have played extremely well,'' Haskins
said. Referring to the team's 10-for-17 3-point shooting Thursday
night, he added, ``We're starting to shoot the ball extremely
well.''
	   A 3-pointer by Wally Szczerbiak of Miami-Ohio, who led a
balanced U.S. offense with 20 points, gave the Americans a 19-point
lead over Lithuania with 14 1/2 minutes left.
	   That was about the time the U.S. folded against Puerto Rico. But
this time, the Americans held steady, and seven points in a 2
1/2-minute span by Keith Carter of Mississippi made it 76-51 with
9:09 to go.
	   ``At that point, we knew what we had to do to bury this team,''
Carter said. ``On Sunday, we didn't do that.''
	   Duke's Elton Brand scored 15 points, Carter had 12, Andre Miller
of Utah 11 and Jumaine Jones of Georgia 10 for the United States.
	   Danius Adomaitis led Lithuania with 21 points.
	   Szczerbiak had three 3-pointers and 13 points in the first half
for the United States, carrying it to a 51-35 lead. Lithuania,
which will play Puerto Rico in the bronze-medal game Friday night,
got no closer than the final margin in the second half.
	   Asked how the team recovered mentally from losing a big lead
against Puerto Rico, Szczerbiak credited Haskins.
	   ``He took the positives from the game,'' Szczerbiak said.
``Obviously, we did something right to lead by 19, so we took that
and built on it.''
	   Lithuania assistant Donnie Nelson said the Americans jelled
quickly after the Puerto Rico loss.
	   ``I think the key for them is athleticism,'' Nelson said. ``Now
that they've had some time to play together, they're going to be
hard to beat.''
	   Heal led Australia with 21 points, and Tony Ronaldson had 20,
including two 3-pointers during a 14-0 burst at the start of the
second half that extended a three-point lead to 58-41.
	   Gaze, who led Seton Hall to the U.S. collegiate championship
game in 1989, scored 15 points and Antsey had 14.
	   ``The Goodwill Games are no longer a tuneup,'' Gaze said. ``We
were out there to win a medal. The Goodwill Games are earning a
fair amount of prestige, and to come away with a medal is
important.
	   ``It's not the Olympics or the World Championships, but it means
a lot to us and the Australian public. No matter where we play, we
represent Australia because we wear the green and gold.''
	   Jose Ortiz, formerly of the Utah Stars, led Puerto Rico with 23
points.
	   Trent Wells of Keizer, Oregon, thought he had a silver medal in
the men's parallel bars but wound up with no medal at all. Judges
twice changed scores after reviewing routines and dropped Wells
from a tie for second to fourth, behind Xu Huang of China, Ivan
Ivankov of Belarus and Aleksei Bondarenko of Russia.
	   Ivankov then won the high bar, holding off Russia's Alexei
Nemov. It was the fourth medal for Ivankov, including the
all-around gold. Bondarenko finished with three silvers and two
bronze.
	   In rhythmic gymnastics, Alina Kabayeva of Russia won the
all-around gold, leading each of the four disciplines.
	   Diving began, with world champion Irina Lashko of Russia winning
the 1-meter springboard over China's Guo Jingjing. The Chinese pair
of Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei won the men's synchronized platform
gold, posting the day's only perfect scores.
	   Beach volleyball's grand old man, 41-year-old Sinjin Smith,
injured his left calf as he and U.S. teammate Ricci Luyties lost
15-5 to Canada's John Child and Mark Heese. Smith returned to the
match after a 5-minute timeout and said he would play Friday
against the top U.S. team, Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson, which
lost to Brazil's Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira 15-3. Brazil
scored the first three points and then ran off seven in a row for a
10-1 lead.
	   In other matches on the Central Park sand, Martin Conde and
Esteban Martinez of Argentina took 1 hour, 19 minutes and 135
serves to defeat defending champions Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn
Maaseide of Norway 16-14, and Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia beat Martin and Paul Laciga of Switzerland 15-13.

Moody's downgrades Japan Sega Enterprises to junk bond status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing intense competition and weak consumer
spending, Moody's Investors Service on Friday downgraded its
long-term debt rating of Japanese home video game and arcade
machine producer Sega Enterprises Ltd. to junk bond status.
	   The downgrade _ from Baa2 status to Ba1 status _ affects 120
billion yen (dlrs 857 million) of the company's outstanding bonds.
	   Moody's said the agency was concerned that ``Sega's earnings
will continue to be pressured by intense competition from
financially stronger competitors, which have substantial market
positions in the home video game business.''
	   Adding to this concern, Moody's said, is Japan's weak consumer
spending, which will adversely affect Sega's arcade machine
business and amusement facility operations. Japan is now struggling
with its worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   The rating outlook is stable, Moody's said. And, despite the
downgrade, Moody's said it expects the company to restore its
market position with a new 128-bit game hardware system.
	   Sega Enterprise is one of the leading companies in the amusement
industry and has a solid market position in arcade games, amusement
facility operations, and home video game products, Moody's said.
	   ``The company has a firm track record in technological
development and a loyal core user base. Moody's expects that Sega
will remain a strong industry competitor over the long term and
that its credit profile should benefit from the diversity of
revenue sources connected with the amusement industry,'' it said.
	   But intensifying competition is weighing on Sega's market share
and product price, Moody's said.
	   The 32-bit game hardware, ``SEGA SATURN'' boasts a following by
core users, yet ranks second to Sony Computer Entertainment's
``PlayStation'' in the Japanese domestic market, the rating agency
said.
	   SEGA SATURN lost its U.S. market share, and as a result wrote
off losses related to its overseas subsidiaries in the last fiscal
year ended March 1998, and posted 35.6 billion yen (dlrs 254
million) in net losses, Moody's said.
	   Moody's said that Sega's ratings continue to reflect the
inherent volatility of the industry resulting from the need to
consistently deliver new products to its user base.
	   The arcade game and home video game product development process
requires, among other things, an ability to adjust rapidly to
changes in technology and the need to get hot new games to the
market quickly in order to achieve industry leadership and better
profit margins.

Banker free to leave Mexico despite two-year extradition fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico fought for two years to have banker
Angel Rodriguez extradited from Spain to face charges of tax
evasion and fraud, but a judge has given him permission to leave
the country again.
	   The move is likely to heighten outrage at the relatively soft
treatment afforded suspects in white-collar crimes and the ease
with which well-heeled suspects can stay out of jail here.
	   The judge's decision specified that Rodriguez must still show up
for weekly sign-ins at a Mexico City court as a condition of bail
while awaiting trial on those charges, the government news agency
Notimex reported Thursday.
	   Rodriguez, whose nickname is ``El Divino'' _ the Divine One _
has obtained constitutional restraining orders that have kept him
out of jail since he was extradited from Spain in June.
	   Authorities seized Rodriguez' Banpais bank in 1995 and have
accused him of swindling the bank out of dlrs 4 million. Spanish
police arrested Rodriguez in July 1996 after he dived off his yacht
into the Mediterranean Sea to try to elude authorities.

Explosion kills two government soldiers in Jammu-Kashmir state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ An explosion shook a military transit camp
in contested Jammu-Kashmir state, killing at least two Indian
soldiers and wounding a pair of others, the military said Friday.
	   The blast occurred Thursday night at the camp where nearly 100
soldiers were waiting to board a train at Bari Brahmana railroad
station, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Jammu, the winter
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. A senior
military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
explosion could have been caused by a hand grenade, a land mine or
even ammunition stored in the camp, The military was investigating.
	   Muslim separatists have been battling government forces in
India's only Muslim-majority state since 1989. Nearly a dozen rebel
groups demand independence for Kashmir or want it to become part of
neighboring Pakistan, which is officially Islamic. More than 15,500
people have been killed in the fighting.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the militants, a
charge Islamabad denies.

Chavalit Yongchaiyudh predicts he will return as Thai premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The man whom many blame for wrecking
Thailand's economy and setting off the Asian financial crisis, is
predicting he will win the next election in a landslide and return
as Thailand's prime minister.
	   Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who was driven from office last November
by angry street protests, said he has learned from his mistakes and
is certain his party will emerge the winner in the next election,
according to Friday's Bangkok Post newspaper.
	   He said that 231 of his party's candidates are ``sure bets'' to
win seats in Parliament next time around, providing his New
Aspiration Party with enough lawmakers to rule without having to
form a coalition government.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's term of office isn't scheduled to
end until the year 2000, but Chavalit said Chuan and his Democrat
Party had failed to repair the economy and so would be forced to
call early elections, perhaps by next year.
	   In July 1997, two days after a nationally-televised speech in
which he pledged never to devalue the country's currency, Chavalit
floated the baht. It has fallen in value ever since. The move
triggered attacks on other Asian currencies.
	   Thailand was forced to seek and accept a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout package supervised by the International Monetary Fund in
Aug. 1997.
	   Chuan's government has been praised by the IMF, the World Bank
and several Western governments for instituting tough measures to
save Thailand from economic ruin, although the country has a long
way to go before its economy rebounds.
	   By contrast, Chavalit was unable to attract top technocrats to
join his government because of its reputation for corruption and
incompetence.
	   Nonetheless, Chavalit and his party have strong support among
the rural poor of Thailand's northeast, where poll monitoring
groups have recorded the highest levels of vote buying during past
elections.

Chinese man executed for trafficking in fake money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Chinese man has been executed in the
northern province of Cao Bang for trafficking in counterfeit money,
a court official said Friday.
	   Dinh Thi Ha, chief of the office of Cao Bang provincial People's
Court, said it was believed to be the first execution carried out
for counterfeiting in Vietnam.
	   Huang Jifeng, from China's Guangxi province, was arrested in
1996 for trafficking in more than 100 million dong (dlrs 7,700) in
fake 50,000-dong (dlrs 3.85) notes and sentenced to death.
	   An appeals court upheld the sentence last year, and Huang was
put before a firing squad last week, Ha said.
	   Counterfeit currency, mostly in 50,000-dong (dlrs 3.85) and
10,000-dong (77-cent) notes, is common in Vietnam, where a number
of offenses _ including drug trafficking and corruption _ are
punishable by death.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Backed by Japan's ruling party powerbrokers,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi held a commanding lead ahead of
Friday's vote for party president in the race to succeed the
resigning prime minister and take the helm of the country's
troubled economy.
	   A survey of Liberal Democratic Party members released by the
Yomiuri newspaper Friday showed Obuchi, 61, with about 200 of the
208 votes needed to win a majority on a first ballot, well ahead of
rivals former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, and
Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56.
	   Analysts, however, said the race _ to be determined in a secret
ballot _ was still up for grabs. If no candidate wins a majority of
the 414 voting LDP members in the first ballot, the two top
vote-getters will hold an immediate run-off.
	   The party convened Friday at 2 p.m. to begin voting. Resigning
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto opened the procedings at LDP
headquarters and urged party unity.
	   ``I hope that at the moment the new prime minister is decided,
our party will be even more united and ... contribute to the future
of our country,'' Hashimoto said.
	   The winner of Friday's vote is virtually certain to win the
election for prime minister in Parliament, expected sometime next
week, because the LDP has a comfortable majority in the powerful
lower house. Hashimoto announced last week he would resign.
	   A win for Obuchi _ seen as an LDP stalwart but not a brilliant
innovator _ would mark a triumph of the party's long-time
leadership over younger rebels who have called for more dynamic
leadership and discontented voters looking for a zealous reformer.
	   The three thanked their supporters hours before the vote Friday.
	   ``I think I did my best,'' said Obuchi, promising to serve if
elected ``with all my zeal.''
	   The three candidates fleshed out their ideas for restoring
Japan's recession-bound economy to health Thursday in nationally
televised speeches. Obuchi protrayed himself as the only choice
with the know-how and political backing to get the job done.
	   Obuchi reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in
new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging
consumption.
	   Kajiyama, the favorite of the markets for his backing of
extensive economic reform, said his administration would aim for 3
percent annual growth _ a turnaround for an economy that shrank for
the first time in two decades in the fiscal year that ended in
March.
	   The outspoken Koizumi _ a maverick backed by younger dissident
lawmakers _ vowed to implement drastic reforms of the political
system, including cutting by almost half the number of Parliament
members and government bureaucrats.
	   The three are battling to take over from Hashimoto, who
announced last week he was quitting after the LDP was trounced in
July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament. His successor
will finish out his term as party president, which ends September
1999.
	   The winner will also take over a nation in turmoil _ both
financial and political.
	   Japan's most glaring problems are economic. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are mounting at their
fastest rate since the end of World War II. Japanese banks' are
saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans. U.S.
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced Thursday
it will review its rating for Japan's government debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy _ and fear among
ruling party lawmakers that they had better change their image in a
hurry. Younger lawmakers forced the party to hold a more open race
for president instead of choosing a successor behind closed doors.
	   The candidates fell over each other to take the banner of reform
and openly appealed to voters in a string of news conferences,
speeches and a TV debate last weekend. Still, a poll by a major
newspaper Thursday showed public support for the party at an
all-time low.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two well-diggers suffocated and five
others were injured while trying to rescue them, local police said
Friday.
	   The men suffered from lack of oxygen when they tried to climb
down the well in the northern province of Yen Bai to repair a
gasoline-run water pump on Sunday, police officer Nguyen Duc Cap
said.
	   Cap said the workers had been hired to deepen the 12-meter
(40-foot) well to supply water for a construction project. An
electric pump failed, so they substituted a gasoline-powered pump
that apparently stopped after burning up all the oxygen.
	   Suffocation deaths are common in Vietnam, particularly among
well-diggers who encounter toxic gases in their work.

Two men narrowly avoid lynching in dispute over pigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A fracas triggered by the disappearance of
eight pigs while in police custody escalated Thursday into
rebellion and a threatened lynching in the central state of
Hidalgo.
	   The porkers were marched off to a police station after farmers
in Yahualica, Hidalgo, found them rooting up crops. But by the time
their owner appeared to claim them, they had disappeared from the
station house.
	   The enraged owner gathered about 50 of his friends and seized
the town hall in Yahualica, about 110 miles north (175 kilometers)
of Mexico City, holding the facilities until the town's mayor
agreed to pay him dlrs 225 in compensation.
	   It all could have ended there.
	   But local police, apparently fearing repercussions from the
pigs' disappearance, reportedly gathered allies from a nearby town
and encouraged the crowd to attack the pigs' owner, Humberto
Castaneda, as he left Yahualica.
	   Castenada and his driver were threatened and beaten, their
pickup truck was rolled off a steep cliff and both men were marched
off and tied to a tree in the nearby town of Mecatlan.
	   Hidalgo state officials had to fly into the town in a helicopter
to free the two men.

As China primes economic pump, scholars warn of waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As China increases spending on public works to
stimulate a sagging economy, scholars have warned the government
that wasteful projects could undermine future growth.
	   In a research report submitted to the State Council, China's
Cabinet, the group of engineers and planners cited the waste from
previous spending sprees, the official China Daily reported Friday.
	   Nine large ports dot a 300-kilometer (180-mile) stretch of the
Yangtze river, too many for available business, the newspaper said.
The Changzhou harbor with a cargo capacity of 2.48 million tons
handled just 60,000 tons of business last year.
	   In southern Guangdong province, five airports have been built
with the farthest distance between them less than 250 kilometers
(150 miles) apart.
	   ``Five airports within such a short distance is nothing but a
waste of money,'' the newspaper quoted Chen Weibang, chief engineer
of the Ministry of Construction, as saying. He added that Zhuhai's
international airport is already losing 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200) a
day.
	   ``The blind investments and duplicated construction have
obviously revealed a weak sense of overall planning,'' Chen was
quoted as saying.
	   The criticisms come as Beijing injects more funds into building
roads, bridges, power plants and other infrastructure projects to
revive the economy. Growth rose 7 percent in the first half of the
year, below the 8 percent target set by the government.
	   The threshold is seen as crucial for creating jobs for millions
of workers being laid off from state industries.
	   Vice Premier Li Lanqing called earlier this week for increased
infrastructure spending. He previously said investment on
infrastructure over the next three years could top dlrs 750
billion.

Mazda shuts down Thai car factory because of economic slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In another blow to Thailand's battered
economy, Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and its Thai subsidiary shut
down one of their assembly plants in Thailand on Friday, citing
slumping sales because of the country's economic crisis.
	   About 550 of the company's 600 employees were laid off
immediately with the remainder staying on for the next few months
to participate in a phased shut down of the plant, the company said
in a press release.
	   Mazda is still operating one more factory in Thailand in
conjunction with Ford Motor Co. of the United States and two Thai
partners to produce Ford and Mazda pickup trucks.
	   Mazda is 33.4 percent owned by Ford.
	   The factory that closed Friday had been operating since 1975.
	   ``The closure is the result of the sharp downturn in the Thai
automotive market caused by the economic slump. The plant has been
operating far below capacity since last year,'' the company said.
	   Mazda explored various alternatives to closing the plant, but
none proved feasible, the company said.
	   A Ministry of Labor official said the company had agreed to pay
laid off workers more than three months severance. The company said
it will help employees with outplacement counseling.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic slump in modern
times. The crisis began when the country floated its currency, the
baht, in July 1997. Since then, it has received a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Thailand has the largest automobile market in Southeast Asia,
and its automotive industry has long been regarded as a key sector
in the economy.
	   The crisis has taken a heavy toll on the industry, however, with
sales plummeting.
	   Thailand's car market is dominated by Japanese companies which
have captured more than 90 percent of total sales.

 &UR; Facts and figures on Cambodia's parliamentary elections Sunday:
 &UR; ---(

<TEXT>
	   The Election:
	   _ Voters will choose a 122-member constituent assembly and a new
government will be formed.
	   _ They are the first multi-party elections since 1993, when U.N.
peacekeeping troops were part of a dlrs 3 billion effort to usher
in a new era of peace and democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide
of the late 1970s, followed by a decade of Vietnamese occupation.
	   _ The Khmer Rouge boycotted the 1993 elections. Then still a
significant guerrilla force, they are today virtually extinct due
to mass defections. Apart from a handful of die-hard rebels,
thousands of ex-guerrillas will cast ballots for the first time in
their lives.
	   _ The elections come a year after Cambodian leader Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whose party won the 1993 polls, as
his co-prime minister. Critics fear that Hun Sen has rigged the
process in his favor.
	   _ The international community hopes that new polls will return
political stability following last year's violence, though critics
have accused them of turning a blind eye to abuses. The United
Nations and donor countries have given dlrs 28 million in aid.
	   _ The Cambodian government is officially organizing the election
for the first time.
 &UR; ---(
	   Voting:
	   _ Balloting takes place at 11,699 polling stations throughout 21
provinces and the capital, Phnom Penh. Initial results are expected
Aug. 1.
	   _ 678 international observers have been deployed to oversee the
voting, along with thousands of national observers. Hun Sen-linked
organizations have been accused of trying to dominate the Cambodian
component.
	   _ Some 5.4 million people _ about 98 percent of all eligible
voters and about half of the total population of 10 million _ are
registered to vote. The chance of disruption is low, despite an
attack on an election convoy last week by die-hard Khmer Rouge
rebels.
 &UR; ---(
	   Parties:
	   _ The three contenders are Hun Sen's formerly communist
Cambodian People's Party, the royalist FUNCINPEC led by Ranariddh,
son of King Norodom Sihanouk, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy's
party, named after himself.

 &UR; Major developments in Cambodia's recent history &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   _ 1970: Prince Norodom Sihanouk is deposed in a U.S.-backed
coup, fueling civil war between the new military government and
hitherto insignificant Khmer Rouge rebels. A massive U.S. bombing
campaign against North Vietnamese sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia
kills hundreds of thousands of civilians and feeds support for the
Khmer Rouge.
	   _ 1975: The Maoist-inspired guerrillas seize power in Phnom Penh
and implement a doomed experiment in agrarian communism. More than
2 million Cambodians _ about one in five _ die in the next four
years from overwork, illness, starvation and systematic execution.
	   _ 1979: Vietnam topples the Khmer Rouge regime in a two-week
military invasion. Distrusted by many Cambodians as the country's
historic enemy, Vietnam installs a new government supported by a
harsh, decade-long military occupation.
	   _ 1982: Sihanouk heads an anti-Vietnamese coalition dominated by
the Khmer Rouge and including a royalist faction headed by his son,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   _ 1985: Former Khmer Rouge cadre Hun Sen is named prime minister
of the Hanoi-backed government.
	   _ 1989: Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia, clearing the
way for peace talks in Paris. Two years later, all Cambodian
factions sign a peace agreement.
	   _ May 1993: The United Nations supervises the first multiparty
elections in 20 years. Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC wins, but
agrees to share power after Hun Sen threatens renewed fighting. The
Khmer Rouge, who boycotted the polls, return to the battlefield.
	   _ 1993-96: Election euphoria gives way to long-standing
hostility between Hun Sen and Ranariddh. Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party takes the upper hand.
	   _ 1996-97: Khmer Rouge disintegrates. Senior figure Ieng Sary
defects with 10,000 guerrillas, isolating loyalists under his
brother-in-law, Pol Pot. The coalition suffers as Ranariddh and Hun
Sen dispute their power-sharing agreement and compete for the
loyalty of former Khmer Rouge to bolster their respective military
strengths.
	   _ July 5-6, 1997: Hun Sen ousts Ranariddh as co-premier, using
tanks, mortars and rockets in Phnom Penh. Over 100 of Ranariddh's
supporters are killed. The prince spends the next nine months in
exile, but with international backing is allowed to return to
participate in new elections.
	   _ July 26, 1998: Cambodians vote in elections organized by Hun
Sen in a bid to win back international legitimacy and aid.

Amnesty International blasts intimidation, violence ahead of
</HEADLINE>
Cambodian polls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International denounced the
human rights climate in Cambodia as campaigning for parliamentary
elections drew to a close Friday and urged the international
community to wake up to intimidation and violence against the
opposition.
	   Demelza Stobbings of the London-based human rights group said
that political killings and threats have soared since Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier
in a coup a year ago, but that on an international level ``many
people are not prepared to say what is happening here.''
	   Killings and attacks on members of the opposition have continued
during the one-month election campaign, she said, and human rights
workers are inundated with reports of threats or other forms of
intimidation against those who oppose Hun Sen or his ruling party.
	   ``Activists have been intimidated, politicians have been
threatened, party agents have been shot and killed, and prisoners
have been illegally arrested and badly beaten by policemen while
held in detention,'' Amnesty said in a statement.
	   ``Much of the international community plays down the level of
violence, sanitizes the trauma of victims and ignores the impact of
human rights violence on freedom of association and expression,''
the statement said.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to try to win back legitimacy
and aid lost after his violent takeover, but has been accused by
his critics of rigging the electoral machinery in his favor and
using fear, murder and intimidation to ensure his Cambodian
People's Party wins.
	   Unlike the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, which were
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Sunday's polls are being organized
by Cambodia. But the U.N. and foreign countries have donated the
bulk of the dlrs 34 million price tag and have sent 678 observers
to assess whether they are credible.
	   The United States, which has called the process fundamentally
flawed, is at odds with other entities, particularly the European
Union, which find the elections the best way of returning a degree
of political stability even if the elections are troubled.
	   Amnesty International blamed ``near silence'' from the
international community for perpetuating the cycle of violence.

Infected leg forces late change to South African lineup

 &UR; EDs: adds record between teams in New Zealand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Flanker Johan Erasmus was forced
to withdraw Friday from the South African team for Saturday's Tri
Nations rugby union test against New Zealand at Athletic Park.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett said Erasmus suffered a slight
cut while training in Wellington on Wednesday and the wound became
infected.
	   Erasmus skipped Thursday's training session and was finding it
difficult to stretch his infected left leg Friday. Mallett decided
to slot 30-year-old loose forward Andrew Aitken into the team to
avoid a major disruption to the side.
	   Aitkin's place on the bench has been filled by newcomer
Selbourne Boome, a 23-year-old from Western Province.
	   England's Ed Morrison will referee the match.
	   South Africa's big motivation in the 50th test between the two
countries is the Tri Nations title and the possibility of their
first test victory in New Zealand since 1981.
	   An away-win over Australia last week _ 14-13 in Perth _ has put
the Springboks in the box seat for the Tri Nations title.
	   The teams:
	   NEW ZEALAND: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler,
Jonah Lomu, Walter Little, Carlos Spencer, Justin Marshall, Taine
Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Michael
Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd; Reserves: Joeli Vidiri,
Scott McLeod, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u, Isitolo Maka, Royce
Willis, Carl Hoeft, Mark Hammett (one to be omitted).
	   SOUTH AFRICA: Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre Snyman,
Pieter Rossouw, Pieter Muller, Henry Honiball, Joost van der
Westhuizen, Gary Teichmann (captain), Andre Venter, Mark Andrews,
Krynauw Otto, Andrew Aitken, Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie
Kempson; Reserves: Chester Williams, Franco Smith, Werner
Swanepoel, Selbourne Boome, Bobby Skinstad, Ollie le Roux, Naka
Drotske.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 jet fighter overshot the runway at an
airport in northern Japan on Friday and burst into flames, injuring
an American pilot, the U.S. military said.
	   The pilot, 1st Lt. Melvin B. Simpson from the 35th Fighter Wing
at Misawa, suffered burns in the accident, which occurred at around
9:05 a.m. (0005 GMT), Misawa Air Base's public affairs office said
in a release.
	   Simpson was first taken to a base hospital for treatment and
then transferred to a hospital in Hachinohe, a city near Misawa,
the release said.
	   The extent of the pilot's burns and his hometown were not
immediately available, base spokeswomen said.
	   The accident occurred during take-off as part of flight training
on the runway of the airport, the release said.
	   Koji Mori, spokesman of the local Japanese Air Self-Defense
Force base, said airport fire fighters quickly extinguished the
flames.
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation, the release
said.
	   The Misawa airport, which is jointly used by the U.S. Air Force,
Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and Japan Air Systems, a Japanese
commercial airline, was closed after the mishap, Mori said.
	   The airport, located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, has a single runway.

	   Obuchi, 61, overcame a revolt by younger lawmakers and
lackluster showings in public opinion polls to grab 225 of the 411
votes cast in the first ballot, defeating rivals former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, and Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, 56.
	   The senior Liberal Democratic Party stalwart is virtually
certain to win the election for prime minister in Parliament,

	   Obuchi would take over from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
who announced last week he would resign after the party's dismal

Obuchi also inherits Japan's economy, now in its worst recession
since the end of World War II.
	   The vote signalled a triumph of the party's long-time
powerbrokers over younger rebels who have called for more dynamic
leadership. The victory also defied public opinion polls that

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Protesters marched to the Indonesian consulate
on Friday to demand protection for the Southeast Asian country's
ethnic Chinese.
	   Led by legislator Emily Lau of the Frontier political movement,
the group of about 30 protesters carried banners calling on the
government to stop civil rights abuses and sexual assaults on
Chinese, who often are a scapegoat in Indonesia in times of unrest.
	   Lau called on the mainland Chinese government, which regained
sovereignty over Hong Kong last year, to take up the matter.
	   ``We certainly hope that the central people's government in
Beijing would take concrete action, maybe have a diplomatic
dialogue with Jakarta, to try to stop all this senseless racial
violence,'' Lau said.
	   Ethnic Chinese were targeted in unrest that wracked Indonesia in
May, which culminated in the resignation of its long-time
president, Suharto.
	   Women's groups say gangs committed at least 168 rapes, and that
most of the victims were ethnic Chinese women and girls.
	   Chinese make up only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people, but some indigenous Indonesians resent their control of
much of the economy.

Ford, three South Korean conglomerates willing to buy Kia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. of the United States
and three South Korean auto firms have formally offered to buy
bankrupt Kia Motors Co., Kia officials said Friday.
	   Announcing an international auction for Kia earlier this month,
its creditor banks asked potential buyers to express in writing
whether they intended to participate in the auction.
	   By the Thursday deadline, Ford and all three major South Korean
car makers _ Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung _ submitted their letters
of intent, Kia officials said.
	   The bidding battle will go into full swing next Monday when Kia
explains to the four potential buyers details of its auction plan,
including how much of its dlrs 6.7 billion debt will be written off
by creditor banks.
	   The successful bidder will be announced Sept. 1.
	   To make the bankrupt company more attractive, the creditor banks
have already said they will reduce the value of Kia's total of dlrs
290 million in outstanding shares by 90 percent, then issue new
shares to bring total capitalization to dlrs 1.1 billion.
	   Kia remains under court receivership after going bankrupt a year
ago. The company had dlrs 6.7 billion in debt and dlrs 5.9 billion
in assets.
	   The move to sell South Korea's third largest car maker is part
of the government's effort to restructure the nation's economy
under the terms of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Ford already owns l6.9 percent of Kia.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Backed by Japan's top powerbrokers, Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi won the nomination of the ruling party for
prime minister Friday, snaring a majority in a first ballot and
taking a major step toward assuming the helm of the country's
slumping economy.
	   Obuchi, 61, overcame a revolt by younger lawmakers and
lackluster showings in public opinion polls to grab 225 of the 411
votes cast in the first ballot, defeating rivals former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, and Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, 56.
	   The senior Liberal Democratic Party stalwart is virtually
certain to win the election for prime minister in Parliament,
expected sometime next week, because the LDP has a comfortable
majority in the powerful lower house.
	   Obuchi would take over from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
who announced last week he would resign after the party's dismal
showing in July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament.
Obuchi also inherits Japan's economy, now in its worst recession
since the end of World War II.
	   The vote signalled a triumph of the party's long-time
powerbrokers over younger rebels who have called for more dynamic
leadership. The victory also defied public opinion polls that
showed Obuchi's rivals more popular among voters.
	   Kajiyama came in second with 102 votes and Koizumi took 84.
	   The three thanked their supporters hours before the vote Friday.
	   ``I think I did my best,'' said Obuchi, promising to serve if
elected ``with all my zeal.''
	   The three candidates fleshed out their ideas for restoring
Japan's recession-bound economy to health late Thursday in
nationally televised speeches. Obuchi protrayed himself as the only
choice with the know-how and political backing to get the job done.
	   Obuchi reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in
new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging
consumption.
	   Kajiyama, the favorite of the markets for his backing of
extensive economic reform, said his administration would aim for 3
percent annual growth _ a turnaround for an economy that shrank for
the first time in two decades in the fiscal year that ended in
March.
	   The outspoken Koizumi _ a maverick backed by younger dissident
lawmakers _ vowed to implement drastic reforms of the political
system, including cutting by almost half the number of Parliament
members and government bureaucrats.
	   The next prime minister will take over a nation in turmoil _
both financial and political.
	   Japan's most glaring problems are economic. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are mounting at their
fastest rate since the end of World War II. Japanese banks' are
saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans. U.S.
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced Thursday
it will review its rating for Japan's government debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy _ and fear among
ruling party lawmakers that they had better change their image in a
hurry. Younger lawmakers forced the party to hold a more open race
for president instead of choosing a successor behind closed doors.
	   The candidates fell over each other to take the banner of reform
and openly appealed to voters in a string of news conferences,
speeches and a TV debate last weekend. Still, a poll by a major
newspaper Thursday showed public support for the party at an
all-time low.

Hingis leads heavily favored Swiss against France in Fed Cup semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World number one Martina Hingis will
lead the strongly favored Swiss on home clay against defending
champion France on Saturday in a Federation Cup world group
semifinal.
	   But the Swiss teenager will get plenty of help from
up-and-coming Patty Schnyder, who has actually outshone her
teammate so far this season winning five titles.
	   ``The bar is very high,'' said French captain Yannick Noah, who
guided France to the title last year. ``We are facing a team that
has the world No. 1 and a player who just won two tournaments
back-to-back. The team will also benefit from the support of 8,000
spectators.''
	   The Swiss are the first to admit they have the upper hand.
	   ``We're the favorites,'' said Hingis, who trails Schnyder with
just four titles to her name this year. ``I'm No. 1 and Patty just
won her fifth title of the year. For us it's this year or never.''
	   France's task has been made even tougher in the absence of its
two best clay-court players _ world No. 13 Sandrine Testud and No.
14 Mary Pierce.
	   Disliking Pierce's attitude in previous Fed Cup ties, Noah
refused to retain the former Australian Open champion. Team veteran
Testud, who won France's decisive match in its final against the
Dutch last year, is nursing the ankle she sprained in Palermo last
week.
	   Instead, France will lean heavily world No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat,
who lost to Jana Novotna in the final at Wimbledon this year.
	   Notoriously weak on clay, Tauziat is unlikely to inspire fear
among the Swiss. Each of Switzerand's players has beaten the
30-year-old this year, including Swiss No. 3 Emmanuelle Gagliardi.
	   Noah, who refused to reveal the rest of his line-up until the
last possible moment on Friday, will likely chose to fill out his
team with world No. 34 Amelie Mauresmo, No.36 Julie Halard-Decugis,
seriously plagued by injury the last two years, and doubles
specialist Alexandra Fusai, ranked 40 in both singles and doubles.
	   The only slight concerns on the Swiss side are Hingis' scanty
tennis schedule these past weeks and Schnyder's heavily loaded one.
	   ``When you're winning, fatigue doesn't exist,'' said world No.
11 Schnyder, who just played 14 matches over the past two weeks.
``In Austria as in Sicily, I never had to exceed my limits.''
	   Hingis, on the other hand, has not played since she was
eliminated in the semifinals of Wimbledon by Novotna. Taking a week
off to follow the World Cup finals in Paris, the 17-year-old
returned to Zurich only last week to resume training.
	   ``It won't be anything like the tie against Argentina last year
in Zurich,'' Hingis predicted. ``I don't think the load on our
shoulders is exactly crushing.''
	   However slim the odds might be for his team, Noah is still
optimistic.
	   ``It's my fifth tie in the Fed Cup and it's the first time we're
facing an opponent stronger than us on paper'' said Noah, who also
led two French men's teams to Davis Cup triumphs.
	   ``I don't need to motivate my players for this tie.
	   ``They know that victory here would be more than delicious.''
	   In the final on September 19-20, the winners will take on either
the United States or Spain playing in the other semifinal in
Madrid.

knowledge and ability,'' Obuchi said. ``I feel a serious
responsibility to be taking over during such a tough period.''

Philippine president urges ASEAN to take lead in reshaping world
</HEADLINE>
financial system

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In his debut Friday on the
international stage, new Philippine President Joseph Estrada urged
Southeast Asian nations to take the lead in reshaping the world
financial system to ensure that Asian-style currency crises are not
repeated.
	   Estrada, speaking at the opening of the annual meeting of
foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
said the nine-nation group also needs to strengthen its ties to win
back the confidence of investors and recover from the devastating
regional financial crisis.
	   Only a few countries in ASEAN _ once the world's most rapidly
developing region _ are expected to escape recessions this year.
	   ``As we have gone through this storm together, we have acquired
a deeper realization that we need to bind ourselves to one another
even more tightly,'' Estrada said. ``After all, the world treats us
as one; we get rewarded and we get penalized as one.''
	   The speech was Estrada's first on foreign affairs since his
inauguration June 30. During his campaign, the former action movie
star pledged to focus on domestic concerns and limit his overseas
travel, particularly to poor countries, which he said was a waste
of time.
	   He told the ASEAN ministers, however, that Philippine foreign
policy would be anchored on Southeast Asian solidarity. Close
relations within ASEAN, he said, should be forged through greater
frankness.
	   ``Let us be open to one another and freely and candidly exchange
views no matter how controversial the issue,'' he said. ``Only by
talking freely and candidly can we rise and build and prosper
together.''
	   In an unprecedented discussion over dinner Thursday night, the
foreign ministers took the more cautious step of agreeing to
support more frank expressions of views within ASEAN about events
in member nations when they affect other members. But they decided
to maintain the group's cardinal principle of non-interference in
each country's domestic affairs.
	   ASEAN's willingness to discuss such a critical change comes as
Southeast Asian countries are becoming more aware that problems in
one nation _ such as currency devaluations, political unrest or
environmental degradation _ often affect its neighbors.
	   Human rights groups were dissatisfied with the change and said
ASEAN should speak out openly to encourage human rights and
democracy in member countries such as Myanmar.
	   Estrada urged ASEAN to actively study ways to avoid dangers from
the globalization of the world economy and reshape the
international financial system.
	   The Asian currency crisis, he said, pointed out the danger of
rapid movements of massive amounts of capital by investors and
currency speculators, ``bloating economies into fragile bubbles as
they rush in and shaking economies to their foundations as they are
withdrawn.''
	   If ASEAN does not take the lead, he said, ``others will once
again shape our destiny for us.''
	   He said a lasting peace and true community is only possible in
Asia if animosities from World War II are finally put to rest.
	   ``It is time for Japan, China and Korea to talk and put the past
behind them,'' he said.
	   ``Then, maybe, bigger dreams can beckon _ one market, one
currency, one community.''

Singapore official: Restored confidence will boost investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Lee
Yock Suan on Friday told Southeast Asian investment agency
officials that confidence must be restored to the region before
foreign investment can be reignited.
	   ``The biggest challenge ASEAN (the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) faces today is that of restoring confidence,'' Lee
said. He was addressing a meeting of investment agency officials
from the region.
	   He added that ``the turning point will only come when confidence
returns.''
	   Lee said the fundamentals that brought investors to the region
in the first place _ high savings rates, a hard-working population,
pro-growth policies and a well-trained workforce _ haven't been
swept away by the crisis and there is still investment interest in
the region.
	   ``Potential investors are watching to see how we pull ourselves
out of the current difficulties, and they will return once
confidence has been restored,'' he said.
	   There have been fears that the regional economic crisis would be
used by businesses or governments as an excuse to renege on
commitments to freer trade.
	   But Lee urged countries in the region to reject protectionism.
``To succeed, we need to remain committed to liberalizing trade,
investment and capital flows within ASEAN.''

Prince Ranariddh &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PH
 &UR; With NOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Profiles of the main party leaders
in Cambodia's parliamentary elections Sunday:
 &UR; ----
	   HUN SEN: Supremely self-confident, Hun Sen, 47 joked with
reporters that he is not just the ``dictator'' they describe him
as, but a ``superman.'' Few dispute he is one of Cambodia's most
astute politicians and an able administrator.
	   Hun Sen has been Cambodia's unrivaled top leader since deposing
his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent
takeover last year that devastated Phnom Penh with fighting and
looting by his victorious soldiers.
	   As ruthless as he is clever, Hun Sen is also widely believed to
be behind a string of human rights abuses, including the killings
of dozens of Ranariddh's supporters in the aftermath of the coup
and a score of opposition activists in the run-up to Sunday's
polls.
	   In 1970, as Cambodia started down the road that led to the
disastrous rule of the communist Khmer Rouge and decades of civil
war, the peasant's son joined the guerrillas at age 19.
	   Hun Sen was wounded five times in the bitter struggle against a
U.S.-backed military regime and lost his left eye to an artillery
shell April 16, 1975, the day before the Khmer Rouge marched into
the capital.
	   After taking power, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many
as 2 million Cambodians in a crazed attempt to build a communist
agrarian paradise. One Cambodian in five perished of overwork,
illness, starvation and systematic executions.
	   Though he attained the rank of regimental commander, there is no
reason to believe Hun Sen played a part in Khmer Rouge atrocities.
His June 1977 escape to neighboring Vietnam made him one of the
earliest high-ranking guerrilla defectors.
	   They became the nucleus of a government installed by the
Vietnamese after Hanoi's army drove the Khmer Rouge from power in
1979. At age 27, Hun Sen was named foreign minister of a
single-party, Soviet-style regime which hosted a Vietnamese
occupying army until 1989.
	   In 1985, Hun Sen became the world's youngest prime minister, a
post he held alone until the U.N.-supervised election of 1993. The
results of the poll brought him into a coalition government with
Ranariddh, a leader of the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition.
	   Hun Sen made sure his Cambodian People's Party retained control
of the security forces and other levers of power. From that
position of strength he was able to launch his coup.
 &UR; ----
	   PRINCE NORODOM RANARIDDH: Seeking to regain the prime minister's
post he lost last year to co-premier Hun Sen in a coup, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's main asset is his bloodline.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party represents Cambodia's royalists and
adoring crowds pay obeisance they would never give an ordinary
politician, though he maintains a strained relationship with his
father, King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In appearance and speech, 54-year-old Ranariddh resembles his
father. But while Sihanouk remains one of the great _ if
controversial _ political figures of 20th-century Asia, his son
often appears as someone who wields power reluctantly.
	   His previous career as a lecturer in law and politics in France
often seems more suitable to his temperament. He entered real
politics only in 1983, when his father called on him to head the
resistance movement against what was then a Vietnamese client
regime in Phnom Penh.
	   Ranariddh fled Cambodia just before last year's coup, forewarned
that something might be brewing. His first statements from exile
were conciliatory in tone, a contrast to the sharp violence of the
takeover.
	   FUNCINPEC won the most parliamentary seats in 1993's
U.N.-supervised election, but to avoid a confrontation with Hun
Sen's incumbent Cambodian People's Party he agreed to form a
co-premiership. By retaining control over the police and military,
however, Hun Sen ensured he was first among equals.
	   Neither was Ranariddh able to hold the moral high ground. After
years of fighting a resistance war, many of Ranariddh's followers
were happy to siphon the spoils from even a partial share of power.
Ranariddh countenanced widespread corruption.
	   His seeming diffidence is not totally a liability. By enduring _
in absentia _ the humiliation of a show trial staged earlier this
year, Ranariddh was able to set the stage for his comeback to the
active political scene.
 &UR; ----
	   SAM RAINSY: Running at the head of a party named for himself,
French-educated economist Sam Rainsy is lucky to be alive.
	   On March 30, 1997, the maverick politician was leading a
demonstration opposite the National Assembly when several grenades
were tossed into the crowd. Sixteen people were killed and more
than 100 wounded. He escaped serious injury when one of his
bodyguards threw himself in front of him, absorbing the shrapnel.
	   Showing the media savvy that is his hallmark, Sam Rainsy
presented himself in front of foreign television crews even before
he could replace his shattered eyeglasses. He blamed co-premier Hun
Sen for the attack.
	   Articulate and skilled at self-promotion, the 49-year-old Sam
Rainsy has kept himself in the spotlight as the would-be voice of
clean government and friend of the working man.
	   Critics accuse him of demagoguery, and _ usually out of earshot
of the Westerners whose support he cultivates _ he engages in
anti-Vietnamese rhetoric common to Cambodian politics.
	   Appointed finance minister after 1993's U.N.-supervised
election, he was forced out of his job after 15 months for

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Profiles of the main party leaders
in Cambodia's parliamentary elections Sunday:
 &UR; ----
	   HUN SEN: Supremely self-confident, Hun Sen, 47 joked with
reporters that he is not just the ``dictator'' they describe him
as, but a ``superman.'' Few dispute he is one of Cambodia's most
astute politicians and an able administrator.
	   Hun Sen has been Cambodia's unrivaled top leader since deposing
his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent
takeover last year that devastated Phnom Penh with fighting and
looting by his victorious soldiers.
	   As ruthless as he is clever, Hun Sen is also widely believed to
be behind a string of human rights abuses, including the killings
of dozens of Ranariddh's supporters in the aftermath of the coup
and a score of opposition activists in the run-up to Sunday's
polls.
	   In 1970, as Cambodia started down the road that led to the
disastrous rule of the communist Khmer Rouge and decades of civil
war, the peasant's son joined the guerrillas at age 19.
	   Hun Sen was wounded five times in the bitter struggle against a
U.S.-backed military regime and lost his left eye to an artillery
shell April 16, 1975, the day before the Khmer Rouge marched into
the capital.
	   After taking power, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many
as 2 million Cambodians in a crazed attempt to build a communist
agrarian paradise. One Cambodian in five perished of overwork,
illness, starvation and systematic executions.
	   Though he attained the rank of regimental commander, there is no
reason to believe Hun Sen played a part in Khmer Rouge atrocities.
His June 1977 escape to neighboring Vietnam made him one of the
earliest high-ranking guerrilla defectors.
	   They became the nucleus of a government installed by the
Vietnamese after Hanoi's army drove the Khmer Rouge from power in
1979. At age 27, Hun Sen was named foreign minister of a
single-party, Soviet-style regime which hosted a Vietnamese
occupying army until 1989.
	   In 1985, Hun Sen became the world's youngest prime minister, a
post he held alone until the U.N.-supervised election of 1993. The
results of the poll brought him into a coalition government with
Ranariddh, a leader of the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition.
	   Hun Sen made sure his Cambodian People's Party retained control
of the security forces and other levers of power. From that
position of strength he was able to launch his coup.
 &UR; ----
	   PRINCE NORODOM RANARIDDH: Seeking to regain the prime minister's
post he lost last year to co-premier Hun Sen in a coup, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's main asset is his bloodline.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party represents Cambodia's royalists and
adoring crowds pay obeisance they would never give an ordinary
politician, though he maintains a strained relationship with his
father, King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In appearance and speech, 54-year-old Ranariddh resembles his
father. But while Sihanouk remains one of the great _ if
controversial _ political figures of 20th-century Asia, his son
often appears as someone who wields power reluctantly.
	   His previous career as a lecturer in law and politics in France
often seems more suitable to his temperament. He entered real
politics only in 1983, when his father called on him to head the
resistance movement against what was then a Vietnamese client
regime in Phnom Penh.
	   Ranariddh fled Cambodia just before last year's coup, forewarned
that something might be brewing. His first statements from exile
were conciliatory in tone, a contrast to the sharp violence of the
takeover.
	   FUNCINPEC won the most parliamentary seats in 1993's
U.N.-supervised election, but to avoid a confrontation with Hun
Sen's incumbent Cambodian People's Party he agreed to form a
co-premiership. By retaining control over the police and military,
however, Hun Sen ensured he was first among equals.
	   Neither was Ranariddh able to hold the moral high ground. After
years of fighting a resistance war, many of Ranariddh's followers
were happy to siphon the spoils from even a partial share of power.
Ranariddh countenanced widespread corruption.
	   His seeming diffidence is not totally a liability. By enduring _
in absentia _ the humiliation of a show trial staged earlier this
year, Ranariddh was able to set the stage for his comeback to the
active political scene.
 &UR; ----
	   SAM RAINSY: Running at the head of a party named for himself,
French-educated economist Sam Rainsy is lucky to be alive.
	   On March 30, 1997, the maverick politician was leading a
demonstration opposite the National Assembly when several grenades
were tossed into the crowd. Sixteen people were killed and more
than 100 wounded. He escaped serious injury when one of his
bodyguards threw himself in front of him, absorbing the shrapnel.
	   Showing the media savvy that is his hallmark, Sam Rainsy
presented himself in front of foreign television crews even before
he could replace his shattered eyeglasses. He blamed co-premier Hun
Sen for the attack.
	   Articulate and skilled at self-promotion, the 49-year-old Sam
Rainsy has kept himself in the spotlight as the would-be voice of
clean government and friend of the working man.
	   Critics accuse him of demagoguery, and _ usually out of earshot
of the Westerners whose support he cultivates _ he engages in
anti-Vietnamese rhetoric common to Cambodian politics.
	   Appointed finance minister after 1993's U.N.-supervised
election, he was forced out of his job after 15 months for
denouncing corruption in his own FUNCINPEC party, headed by Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, and Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy's expulsion from the post was a rare matter on which
the co-prime minister agreed. He was also booted out of FUNCINPEC
and expelled from the National Assembly. But his prominent gadfly
stance has inspired loyalty from Cambodians sick of misrule and
graft.
	   Sam Rainsy formed his own party in 1995 and has tried to build a
constituency among exploited factory workers.
	   One of the keys to his political survival has been his
relationship with King Norodom Sihanouk, who has often treated Sam
Rainsy more warmly than his own son, Ranariddh. Sam Rainsy's father
had been an adviser to Sihanouk who later turned enemy and
disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Backed by Japan's top powerbrokers, Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi won the nomination of the ruling party for
prime minister Friday, overcoming a revolt by dissident lawmakers
and lackluster public support to take a major step toward assuming
the helm of the country's slumping economy.
	   Obuchi grabbed 225 of the 411 votes cast in a first ballot _ an
overwhelming victory over rivals former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Kajiyama
came in second with 102 votes and Koizumi took 84.
	   The senior Liberal Democratic Party stalwart is virtually
certain to win the election for prime minister in Parliament,
expected on July 30, because the LDP has a comfortable majority in
the powerful lower house.
	   Obuchi, 61, would take over from Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who announced last week he would resign after the
party's dismal showing in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament. Obuchi also inherits Japan's economy, now in its worst
recession since the end of World War II.
	   The vote signalled a triumph of the party's long-time
powerbrokers over younger rebels who have called for more dynamic
leadership. The victory also defied public opinion polls that
showed Obuchi's rivals more popular among voters.
	   Obuchi said after the vote that he would continue Hashimoto's
policies and called on lawmakers to work together with him to
repair Japan's troubled economy.
	   ``In order get over these difficult times, I will use all my
knowledge and ability,'' Obuchi said. ``I feel a serious
responsibility to be taking over during such a tough period.''
	   The three candidates and other party officials _ including
Hashimoto _ then joined hands and gave a series of cries of
``banzai,'' a traditional Japanese cheer that means ``10,000
years.''
	   Not all LDP members were happy with the outcome.
	   ``The result didn't take into consideration the people's
voice,'' said lawmaker Seiichi Eto. ``I'm disappointed.''
	   A top opposition leader said Obuchi's emergence would not lead
to a change in Japan's direction.
	   ``Without changes in the LDP's politics and its systems, there
is little hope that they can live up to the public's expections,''
said Kunio Hatoyama, vice president of the largest opposition
group, the Liberal Party.
	   The three candidates fleshed out their ideas for restoring
Japan's recession-bound economy to health late Thursday in
nationally televised speeches. Obuchi protrayed himself as the only
choice with the know-how and political backing to get the job done.
	   Obuchi reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in
new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging
consumption.
	   Kajiyama, 72, the favorite of the markets for his backing of
extensive economic reform, said he would aim for 3 percent annual
growth _ a turnaround for an economy that shrank for the first time
in two decades in the fiscal year that ended in March.
	   The outspoken Koizumi, 56 _ a maverick backed by younger
dissident lawmakers _ vowed to implement drastic reforms of the
political system, including cutting by almost half the number of
Parliament members and government bureaucrats.
	   The next prime minister will take over a nation in turmoil _
both financial and political.
	   Japan's most glaring problems are economic. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are mounting at their
fastest rate since the end of World War II. Japanese banks' are
saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans. U.S.
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced Thursday
it will review its rating for Japan's government debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy _ and fear among
ruling party lawmakers that they had better change their image in a
hurry. Younger lawmakers forced the party to hold a more open race
for president instead of choosing a successor behind closed doors.
	   The candidates fell over each other to take the banner of reform
and openly appealed to voters in a string of news conferences,
speeches and a TV debate last weekend. Still, a poll by a major
newspaper Thursday showed public support for the party at an
all-time low.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stocks finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices, Obuchi winning election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday ahead
of the election of a new leader for Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party. Japanese stock prices closed higher in light
trading, ending four straight days of losses.
	   The dollar bought 140.94 yen in mid-afternoon, down 0.74 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.88 points, or 1.07
percent, closing the week at 16,361.89 points. On Thursday, the
Nikkei closed down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   After the stock market was closed, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
won the nomination of Japan's ruling party for prime minister, as
widely expected.
	   The LDP leader is virtually assured of becoming prime minister
as the party controls Parliament's powerful lower house. The
election to decide a new premier is scheduled for July 30.
	   Traders said the currency market had already factored in a
victory by Obuchi, adding that a win by the veteran politician
would be positive for the Japanese currency as he was believed to
have the most support among key LDP leaders.
	   Obuchi has said he will carry out the reforms necessary to jump
start the country's sagging economy.
	   Friday's election to choose the new LDP head was held after
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned after his party suffered
a stunning setback in upper house parliamentary elections July 12.
	   On Friday, the yen recovered much of the ground it lost
Thursday, when Moody's Investors Service placed Japan's sovereign
debt rating on review for possible downgrade.
	   On the stock market, buying by pension funds and foreign
brokerages in the afternoon wiped out early losses following an
overnight sharp drop on Wall Street and continued worries about the
move by Moody's.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,258.01. The
TOPIX had closed down 7.98 points, or 0.63 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.360 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.335 percent,
driving its price down to 110.68 yen from 110.86 yen.

Unpaid workers protest at China military-owned factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Workers at a money-losing factory belonging to
China's military used trucks to block the plant's entrance to
demand months of unpaid wages, a lawyer and worker said Friday.
	   About 200 workers at the No. 2 Machinery Factory in the Inner
Mongolian city of Baotou blocked the plant's main gate for several
hours on July 17, said a woman in the factory's administrative
office who declined to give her name.
	   Although the protest ended peacefully and there were no arrests,
local television has since broadcast nightly warnings against
further demonstrations, said Xu Jian, a lawyer hired by the 200
workers to sue for their back pay.
	   Unpaid and laid-off workers have staged sporadic protests
throughout China as the government ends subsidies and forces
insolvent state industries to compete in the market.
	   The People's Liberation Army's vast commercial network _ ranging
from manufacturers like the No. 2 Machinery Factory to arms and
property conglomerates like Poly Technologies _ suffers from many
of the same afflictions as the inefficient state sector.
	   Larger, nationally known PLA companies like Poly or the 999
Enterprise Group, maker of a popular stomach pain remedy, are
believed to be profitable, while a myriad of companies like the
Baotou factory lose money and cannot afford to pay wages.
	   The PLA's business ties were spotlighted this week following an
order from Chinese President Jiang Zemin and senior PLA commanders
for the military to sever links with its commercial holdings.
	   But the protest in Baotou, 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of
Beijing, illustrates that disposing of such businesses won't be
easy or painless.
	   The No. 2 Machinery Factory employs 26,400 workers and most have
not been paid in four months, said the administrative office
employee. Neither she nor lawyer Xu Jian would say what the factory
produces.
	   Several protests have been staged, but the one on the 17th was
``a bit more serious,'' she said. ``Everybody is very worried, very
tense.''
	   Police in Baotou said they were not aware of the protest.
	   President Jiang and a coterie of career officers he has promoted
hope that getting the PLA out of business will help the 2.9
million-member army focus on modernization.
	   ``The military increasingly sees itself as a fighting force.
They have been saying it is not the military's role to engage in
such economic activities. The mission should be to improve combat
capabilities and combat readiness,'' said Tai Ming Cheung, a
specialist on the Chinese military in Hong Kong.
	   Ultimately, getting the PLA to curb its business interests will
force the government to increase defense budgets. ``This has always
been the ultimate aim for the military,'' Cheung said.

British Telecom buys stake in big Malaysian company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ British Telecommunications has
acquired a 33 percent stake in Malaysia's leading private
telecommunications company, according to news reports Friday.
	   Financial executives close to the transaction told Dow Jones
Newswires that the acquisition into Binariang for about 1.7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 425,000) was completed late Thursday. An announcement
was expected later Friday.
	   The deal is part of a larger plan by Binariang to raise roughly
4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) through links with overseas
groups and debt securities, executives said.
	   Eighty percent of the Malaysian telecommunications company is
currently controlled by Malaysian groups. The remainder is held by
U.S. West International, a unit of the Denver-based telephone
holding company U.S. West Inc.
	   Apart from British Telecommunications, Binariang has been linked
to other companies recently, among them Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Cable
and Wireless PLC.

<TEXT>
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette and Larry Walker each hit two-run
homers as Colorado swept Cincinnati in a soggy day-night
doubleheader.
	   Walker had his seventh three-hit game of the season and scored
twice to help the Rockies win the opener.
	   Colorado had to endure a 1-hour, 31-minute rain delay in the
nightcap before sending Cincinnati to its seventh straight loss
following a 10-game winning streak.
	   Bichette's 15th homer off Pete Harnisch (7-5) in the first
inning of Game 2 gave the Rockies a 2-0 lead before rain forced the
grounds crew to cover the field after the second.
	   When play resumed, Walker followed a single by with his 11th
homer.
	   Bobby Jones (4-4) allowed three runs and six hits in seven
innings.
	   In the opener, Pedro Astacio (8-10) extended Colorado's
scoreless innings streak to a team-record 16 before surrendering a
three-run homer to Paul Konerko in the eighth.
	   Mike Remlinger (6-11) took the loss.
 &UR; Astros 8, Dodgers 6, 10 innings
	   In Los Angeles, Mark Guthrie walked Ricky Gutierrez on four
pitches with the bases loaded in the 10th to force in the go-ahead
run as Houston overcame an early six-run deficit.
	   The Astros trailed 6-0 after the first inning but came back
against Los Angeles' bullpen, scoring five runs in the eighth,
highlighted by Moises Alou's two-run homer.
	   In the 10th, Darren Hall (0-2) walked Carl Everett leading off
and walked Brad Ausmus with one out. Pinch-hitter Bill Spiers,
batting for Doug Henry (7-2), advanced the runners with a
groundout.
	   Craig Biggio was intentionally walked to load the bases and
Guthrie walked Gutierrez to bring in Everett. Derek Bell drove in
another run with an infield single when Guthrie was late covering
first.

U.S. vice president, Russian premier plan for presidential summit

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a U.S.-Russian presidential summit just over
a month away, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Premier
Sergei Kiriyenko held a series of talks Friday to lay the
groundwork for the meeting.
	   Gore has been holding regular discussions with Russia's prime
minister in recent years, but this marked his first session with
Kiriyenko since he became premier in March, replacing Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``It's good to see so many long-time friends on your side of the
table,'' Gore said as he shook hands with the Russian delegation
Friday morning at the President Hotel. ``I want you to know that
President (Bill) Clinton and I are absolutely committed to
deepening these relationships.''
	   Gore and Kiriyenko planned to discuss trade issues and
scientific cooperation, but no major announcements were expected.
Much of their work was likely to focus on a Moscow summit between
Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, planned for the end of
August or early September.
	   U.S.-Russian relations are generally good, though there are
several areas where differences remain.
	   Russia is still wary of NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe,
while the United States wants Russia to join Washington in
ratifying the 1993 START II treaty, which would cut the nuclear
arsenals in both countries in half.
	   The Americans have also expressed concerns about the spread of
Russian weapons technology to countries such as Iran. In other
world hot spots, such as Iraq and Kosovo, Russia and the United
States have at times favored different approaches.
	   Still, Gore and Kiriyenko both described the U.S.-Russian
relationship in grand terms and said it would grow stronger.
	   ``The U.S.-Russian relationship will play a key role, indeed the
decisive role, in determining what kind of a world we create for
our children and our grandchildren,'' Gore said.
	   ``We hope that by the 21st century we will have resolved all
outstanding issues and eliminated the negative consequences of the
past,'' Kiriyenko added.
	   The two men gave no indication they would hold detailed
discussions on Russia's financial crisis, which has eased in recent
days following an agreement with the international lenders to
provide dlrs 17 billion in new loans to Russia.
	   Kiriyenko was named prime minister in March with a mandate to
speed up the country's economic reforms, but he has been battling
with the financial crisis since shortly after he assumed the post.
	   Gore, meanwhile, spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in
Moscow on Thursday evening.
	   The vice president toured the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear
reactor Thursday, peering from the open door of a black military
helicopter at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Gore is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Chernobyl,
which exploded in 1986 and spewed radiation over a large swath of
Europe.

	   GOLD HILL, Panama (AP) _ Backhoes chip away at this rocky hill
24 hours a day, sending boulders tumbling down for mammoth dump
trucks to haul away. Below, a ship dredges rock from water and a
towering crane on the bank scoops out sediment.
	   The Panama Canal is getting bigger.
	   But no matter how much workers carve out from the path between
the Atlantic and the Pacific, experts say the canal will reach
capacity sometime between 2010 and 2015, depending on the global
economy and shipping patterns.
	   And so a team of 25 engineers, financiers and environmentalists
is trying to figure out how to make the 84-year-old canal carry
more ships. They say they can accomplish the feat _ for a price.
	   The problem is that the Panama Canal isn't really a canal. It's
a freshwater channel 85 feet (25 meters) above sea level, with
locks on either side to lift and lower the massive ships that move
much of the world's commerce.
	   Workers are now carving out the narrowest stretch of the canal,
the 8-mile (12 kilometers) Gaillard Cut, broadening it so bigger
ships can pass each other and deepening it so heavier vessels can
make the trip.
	   They'll finish their project in 2002, when ``Panamax'' ships _
those built to be the maximum size allowed to cross the canal _
will for the first time be able to move in both directions along
the canal at the same time.
	   But the locks that raise the Goliaths up and down _ two lanes
side by side on either end of the canal _ aren't quick, and even
with the improvements only about 50 ships will be able to cross a
day. Soon, that won't be enough.
	   That is why the Panama Canal Commission _ a U.S. government
agency that will come under Panamanian authority on Dec. 31, 1999 _
set up a team in March to design a way to move more ships through
the waterway.
	   One of the 30 proposals being studied, according to project
manager Agustin Arias, is to build a third lane in the locks
system. But there, the problem is water.
	   The system works with gravity _ water pours into the locks from
the canal to raise the ships to canal level, and is emptied into
the sea to lower the ships. Each crossing takes 52 million gallons
(197 million liters) of water.
	   Scientists say there isn't enough water to go around, especially
after a drought year that forced the canal to cut back operations.
	   That leaves the scientists with two options: they can increase
the size of the lake, by building bigger dams or digging a deeper
floor; or they can use a different technology to raise and lower
the ships, maybe even something like an elevator.
	   Whichever they pick, it won't come cheaply.
	   The Canal Commission says a third set of locks is estimated to
cost between dlrs 3 billion and dlrs 6 billion. With the canal in
the hands of a small Central American country struggling with
poverty and unemployment, it's unclear where that money would come
from. The Canal Commission says only that an expanded canal would
eventually pay for itself.
	   ``It would have to earn enough revenue to pay for the
investment,'' Arias said.
	   In addition to the tolls, Panama could bring in revenue with
side projects. For example, more dams could generate electricity,
Arias said.
	   Panama will probably have to issue bonds _ billions of dollars
worth _ to pay for the expansion.
	   The initial plans won't be completed for another three years,
and financial studies and government approval would have to follow,
so design and construction won't start in earnest until 2003 at the
earliest.
	   ``In 2012 we'll reach our saturation point,'' said Canal
Commission spokeswoman Mercedes Morris Garcia. ``And we have to do
something.''

NLRB getting involved in NBA lockout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA lockout is starting to look a little
more like the last North American baseball strike.
	   The U.S. National Labor Relations Board entered the mix Thursday
after the players' union filed an unfair labor practice complaint,
alleging that the league imposed the lockout without bargaining to
an impasse as required under federal labor law.
	   When a strike was nearly destroying baseball four years ago, it
was a union NLRB filing that ended up deciding the issue. The
baseball players argued that owners weren't bargaining in good
faith, and the NLRB agreed. The agency asked a federal court to
grant an injunction restoring the old work rules, and Judge Sonia
Sotomayer issued the order.
	   In the case of basketball, the union even claims that the word
``lockout'' is a misnomer. The players termed it a unilateral
change in conditions of employment and cited seven factors:
refusing to negotiate contracts, violating anti-collusion rules,
ceasing health benefits, refusing treatment for injuries sustained
since July 1, failing to set a salary cap, disregarding grievance
guidelines and refusing to allow sanctioned summer leagues.
	   ``The board will determine, on as prompt a basis as possible,
whether the rights of the basketball players, as employees, have
been violated,'' said Daniel Silverman, regional director of the
NLRB's New York office.
	   Silverman said his office will conduct an investigation over the
next few weeks, then determine what to do next.
	   If the board agrees with the union, it can ask a federal judge
to issue an injunction restoring terms of the old collective
bargaining agreement that expired June 30.
	   ``Arbitration, charges of unfair labor practices and threats of
decertification will not end this lockout. That will occur only if
there is good faith negotiations leading to a new collective
bargaining agreement,'' NBA chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin
said.
	   ``The NBA owners have made multiple proposals to the players,
while the players have refused to budge from their first offer. The
only refusal to bargain here is by the players association.''
	   Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter are
scheduled to speak Friday to set the date for a new round of formal
talks. The last session was held June 22 and broke off after 30
minutes.

 &UR; ASEAN unlikely to change Myanmar policy

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ While Southeast Asian countries have
decided to respond more actively to conflicts in the region,
officials said Friday they are unlikely to increase pressure on
Myanmar's military government to reconcile with pro-democracy
forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Holding their annual meeting in Manila, foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed they will speak more
frankly and openly about issues in which ill effects spill across
borders.
	   Questioned by reporters, however, they would not specify what
change, if any, this would mean in policies toward two of the
region's most troubled states: Myanmar and Cambodia.
	   ``Why should we take a different approach?'' Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said Friday when asked about Myanmar.
	   ASEAN has followed a policy of ``constructive engagement''
toward Myanmar, believing that closer relations and quiet
encouragement are the most effective means for achieving reforms.
	   Human rights groups and officials of some Western nations,
however, have criticized ``constructive engagement'' as merely
business-as-usual with the Myanmar government, which has been
blamed for widespread human rights abuses. Of the nine ASEAN
members, only Thailand and the Philippines have openly urged the
Myanmar government to show restraint and open dialogue with Mrs.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
	   Mrs. Suu Kyi has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
convene the Parliament that was elected in 1990 but never allowed
to take office. She has urged ASEAN to support her ultimatum.
	   But Malaysian Foreign Minister Ahmad Badawi said it would be
very difficult for ASEAN to do this because it would violate
ASEAN's principle of avoiding interference in the domestic affairs
of its members.
	   ``There must be other ways,'' he said.

Hingis leads heavily favored Swiss against France in Fed Cup semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World number one Martina Hingis will
lead the strongly favored Swiss on home clay against defending
champion France on Saturday in a Federation Cup world group
semifinal.
	   But the Swiss teen-ager will get plenty of help from
up-and-coming Patty Schnyder, who has actually outshone her
teammate so far this season winning five titles.
	   ``The bar is very high,'' said French captain Yannick Noah, who
guided France to the title last year. ``We are facing a team that
has the world No. 1 and a player who just won two tournaments
back-to-back. The team will also benefit from the support of 8,000
spectators.''
	   The Swiss are the first to admit they have the upper hand.
	   ``We're the favorites,'' said Hingis, who trails Schnyder with
just four titles to her name this year. ``I'm No. 1 and Patty just
won her fifth title of the year. For us it's this year or never.''
	   France's task has been made even tougher in the absence of its
two best clay-court players _ world No. 13 Sandrine Testud and No.
14 Mary Pierce.
	   Disliking Pierce's attitude in previous Fed Cup ties, Noah
refused to retain the former Australian Open champion. Team veteran
Testud, who won France's decisive match in its final against the
Dutch last year, is nursing the ankle she sprained in Palermo last
week.
	   Instead, France will lean heavily world No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat,
who lost to Jana Novotna in the final at Wimbledon this year.
	   Notoriously weak on clay, Tauziat is unlikely to inspire fear
among the Swiss. Each of Switzerand's players has beaten the
30-year-old this year, including Swiss No. 3 Emmanuelle Gagliardi.
	   Noah, who refused to reveal the rest of his line-up until the
last possible moment on Friday, will likely chose to fill out his
team with world No. 34 Amelie Mauresmo, No.36 Julie Halard-Decugis,
seriously plagued by injury the last two years, and doubles
specialist Alexandra Fusai, ranked 40 in both singles and doubles.
	   The only slight concerns on the Swiss side are Hingis' scanty
tennis schedule these past weeks and Schnyder's heavily loaded one.
	   ``When you're winning, fatigue doesn't exist,'' said world No.
11 Schnyder, who just played 14 matches over the past two weeks.
``In Austria as in Sicily, I never had to exceed my limits.''
	   Hingis, on the other hand, has not played since she was
eliminated in the semifinals of Wimbledon by Novotna. Taking a week
off to follow the World Cup finals in Paris, the 17-year-old
returned to Zurich only last week to resume training.
	   ``It won't be anything like the tie against Argentina last year
in Zurich,'' Hingis predicted. ``I don't think the load on our
shoulders is exactly crushing.''
	   However slim the odds might be for his team, Noah is still
optimistic.
	   ``It's my fifth tie in the Fed Cup and it's the first time we're
facing an opponent stronger than us on paper'' said Noah, who also
led two French men's teams to Davis Cup triumphs.
	   ``I don't need to motivate my players for this tie.
	   ``They know that victory here would be more than delicious.''
	   In the final on September 19-20, the winners will take on either
the United States or Spain playing in the other semifinal in
Madrid.

Analysts: Two Singapore banks likely to merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Finance Minister confirming merger, other
details, RECASTS throughout

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Development Bank of Singapore Ltd., one of the
country's `big four' banks, will acquire POSBank by issuing new
shares, Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu said Friday.
	   The merger has been anticipated by the markets.
	   Trading in DBS shares was suspended Friday on the Stock Exchange
of Singapore pending the announcement, and DBS officials have
scheduled a press conference to follow the minister's briefing.
	   In preparation for the merger, POSBank will be privatized, Hu
said, adding that the new bank will have an asset base of 93
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 54 billion) and 9.4 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 5.5 billion) in shareholder funds.
	   DBS will issue non-voting preference shares equivalent to 18
percent of the enlarged bank's capital to pay for the acquisition
of POSBank, the minister said.
	   ``The purpose is to establish a large bank,'' Hu said. ``Size
has become a very important factor in the banking sector.''
	   The purchase must still be approved by an extraordinary meeting
of DBS' shareholders, Hu said. He didn't say when it might be
completed.
	   After the acquisition is complete, the government will own a 53
percent stake in the new bank, Hu said, adding that the 40 percent
cap on foreign ownership of DBS shares will remain in place for the
moment.
	   As part of the deal to acquire POSBank, DBS has agreed not to
sell any of its POSBank shares until at least the end of 2001, Hu
said.
	   This is the second major bank merger in Singapore this year. In
January, Keppel Bank Ltd. and Tat Lee Bank Ltd. announced they
would merge.
	   As part of its effort to reform Singapore's financial sector,
the government has been encouraging banks to consolidate and merge
since at least the beginning of the year.
	   Singapore's four major banks made substantial provisions last
year for their regional exposure and are expected to make further
provisions when they announce their half year interim results.
	   A merger of the two banks, both already linked to the
government, would benefit DBS by improving DBS' asset quality and
capitalization, analysts told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Lim Beng Eu, an analyst at Vickers Ballas, said earlier that
such a merger would boost DBS' capitalization, allowing it to
realize its goal of becoming a major regional player.
	   ``It would provide DBS Bank with the necessary cash to expand in
the region,'' Lim said, adding: ``If DBS announces a merger, it
will improve its position as Singapore's strongest and largest
bank.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ British Telecommunications has
acquired a 33 percent stake in Malaysia's leading private
telecommunications company, according to news reports Friday.
	   Financial executives close to the transaction told Dow Jones
Newswires that the acquisition into Binariang for about 1.7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 425,000) was completed late Thursday. An announcement
was expected later Friday.
	   The deal is part of a larger plan by Binariang to raise roughly
4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) through links with overseas
groups and debt securities, executives said.
	   Eighty percent of the Malaysian telecommunications company is
currently controlled by Malaysian groups. The remainder is held by
U.S. West International, a unit of the Denver-based telephone
holding company U.S. West Inc.
	   Apart from British Telecommunications, Binariang has been linked
to other companies recently, among them Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Cable
and Wireless PLC.

Japanese completes swim to Korea to promote World Cup soccer

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Cheered by a brass band and roaring
crowds, a 58-year-old Japanese man completed a swim to South Korea
Friday to promote soccer's 2002 World Cup.
	   Tomoshige Hirose swam into Pusan port on the southeast coast, 10
days after he had left Japan's southern main island of Kyushu on
July 15.
	   He swam 125 kilometers (77 miles) and ran the same distance on
his route, which included stops on several islands in the straits
separating the two countries.
	   ``I hope the World Cup will bring Japan and South Korea closer
together,'' an interpreter quoted Hirose as saying.
	   The 2002 World Cup will be soccer's first premier event to be
staged in Asia, and the first with co-hosts _ Japan and South
Korea.
	   A municipal brass band greeted Hirose as he came ashore. About
100 school children and city officials showed up with flower
bouquets.
	   Hirose, an avid diver and owner of a sporting goods store, swam
or ran 12 hours a day to achieve the feat. He arrived outside Pusan
port Thursday evening and spent the night aboard an escorting boat.
	   He swam the last 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) Friday.
	   Hirose was to meet with Pusan Mayor Ahn Sang-young Saturday to
donate 375,000 yen (dlrs 2,660) to help 75 South Korean orphans buy
2002 World Cup tickets for matches to be held in South Korea.
	   Japan ruled Korea as a colony in 1910-45, and anti-Japanese
sentiments remain deep among many Koreans.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ A portrait of Princess Diana in her
wedding dress, never before seen in public, is among the items that
Prince Charles has lent for an historic exhibition of art amassed
by the princes of Wales.
	   So, too, is a sketch of the Spice Girls.
	   Until now, only members of the royal family and their servants
had seen all of the works, some of which date back to the 16th
century.
	   From the poetic to the prosaic, more than 300 paintings,
drawings and other artworks and crafts collected by Charles, the
current Prince of Wales, and four of his ancestors now fill several
rooms at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff.
	   ``Works from the royal collection are always on view somewhere
at home and abroad, but this is the first time the collections of
the princes of Wales have been selected for display,'' said Dickie
Arbiter, director of media affairs at Buckingham Palace, speaking
at a preview on Thursday.
	   The collection includes drawings of the Tudor court by Hans
Holbein, paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn and Sir Anthony van Dyck,
a Sevres porcelain service made for the guillotined King Louis XVI
of France and a couple of modern garden seats in teak designed by
Leon Krier, Charles' favorite architect.
	   At one end of the display is an engraved and gilded suit of
tournament armor fashioned for Prince Henry, who died in 1610 of
typhoid at age 16 and never reached the throne.
	   At the opposite end is a portrait of Princess Diana, who posed
at Kensington Palace in her wedding dress in 1984, three years
after her wedding, for artist John Ward. The picture has never been
shown before in public.
	   A Carl Faberge cigarette case in old enamel, adorned with a
snake made of rose diamonds, recalls a notorious adulterous affair
by another prince of Wales.
	   Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII, was given the
Russian-made case 1895 by a mistress, Alice Keppel. (Camilla Parker
Bowles, longtime companion of Prince Charles, is a
great-granddaughter of Mrs. Keppel).
	   When Edward died in 1910, his widow, Queen Alexandra _ much
admired for tolerating his dalliances_ gave the case back to Mrs.
Keppel as a memento.
	   In 1936, Mrs. Keppel returned it to the royal family, who have
kept it ever since. For the past 100 years, the royals have
collected Faberge items, out of an interest sparked by that
original gift.
	   The ``Princes as Patrons'' exhibition is on public view from
Saturday through Nov. 8 and won't be shown anywhere else. Prince
Charles was scheduled to open it Friday night.
	   The exhibition covers just five princes of Wales although nearly
a score have held the title since the last prince of Welsh blood,
Llewelyn ap Griffith, was slain after a battle in 1282 that
completed England's conquest of Wales.
	   The earlier princes never collected art, and not all the later
ones were keen on it. For example, there is nothing owned by
Charles' predecessor as Prince of Wales, the late Duke of Windsor,
who abdicated in 1936 within a year of acceding to the throne as
King Edward VIII.
	   Prince Charles explains in the catalogue that he chose only the
four other princes who were ``most active as patrons and
collectors.''
	   He said his personal collection can't compete with theirs but
adds: ``I do share with my four predecessors the passion and
excitement of discovering the work of artists and craftsmen.''
	   Besides Henry, Edward and Charles, the show includes works owned
by the eldest son of King George II, Frederick Louis, whose parents
detested him for supporting opposition politicians and banished him
from court. The other royal figuring in the show is Frederick's
grandson, George Augustus, who became King George IV and is revered
as the greatest of the princely collectors.
	   The show includes many of the contemporary paintings, drawings
and sculptures that Charles enjoys. A keen watercolorist himself,
he often takes artists with him on his travels.
	   One exhibit with a tantalizing title is ``The Spice Girls in
Concert in aid of the Nations Trust, Johannesburg 1997.''
	   But it's a letdown _ just a small sketch by Robert Wraith in
which the famous five divas, before they were four, appear as mere
squiggles on a distant stage.

Chavalit Yongchaiyudh predicts he will return as Thai premier

response graf 5, background graf 6 and at bottom

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The man whom many blame for wrecking
Thailand's economy and setting off the Asian financial crisis, is
predicting he will win the next election in a landslide and return
as Thailand's prime minister.
	   Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who was driven from office last November
by angry street protests, said he has learned from his mistakes and
is certain his party will emerge the winner in the next election,
according to Friday's Bangkok Post newspaper.
	   He said that 231 of his party's candidates are ``sure bets'' to
win seats in Parliament next time around, providing his New
Aspiration Party with enough lawmakers to rule without having to
form a coalition government.
	   Chavalit said his party would win because it had been
``completely overhauled,'' and ``planned to field capable
candidates including recognized economic experts.''
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's term of office isn't scheduled to
end until the year 2000, but Chavalit said Chuan and his Democrat
Party had failed to repair the economy and so would be forced to
call early elections, perhaps by next year.
	   Chuan and his ministers did not respond to Chavalit's
prediction, but have said in the past there is no timetable for
early elections.
	   In most opinion polls, Chuan has received a favorable job rating
from the Thai public, while Chavalit consistently scores low in
terms of popularity.
	   In July 1997, two days after a nationally-televised speech in
which he pledged never to devalue the country's currency, Chavalit
floated the baht. It has fallen in value ever since. The move
triggered attacks on other Asian currencies.
	   Thailand was forced to seek and accept a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout package supervised by the International Monetary Fund in
Aug. 1997.
	   Chuan's government has been praised by the IMF, the World Bank
and several Western governments for instituting tough measures to
save Thailand from economic ruin, although the country has a long
way to go before its economy rebounds.
	   By contrast, Chavalit was unable to attract top technocrats to
join his government because of its reputation for corruption and
incompetence.
	   Nonetheless, Chavalit and his party have strong support among
the rural poor of Thailand's northeast, where poll monitoring
groups have recorded the highest levels of vote buying during past
elections.
	   The Northeast has the highest concentration of voters in
Thailand, and his party's showing there in a 1996 election allowed
him to narrowly defeat Chuan and the Democrats and become prime
minister.
	   He cited his support in the northeast as another reason he would
win the next election.

Japan's foreign minister wins ruling party nomination for prime

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a victory for Japan's political old guard over
dissident lawmakers, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi won the vote for
ruling party president Friday, virtually sewing up his quest for
prime minister but dimming hopes of drastic action to fix the
troubled economy.
	   Obuchi, a party stalwart with a long but conventional career in
government, snared 225 of the 411 votes cast in a first ballot_ far
ahead of rivals former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and
Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Kajiyama came in second with 102
votes and Koizumi took 84.
	   The new Liberal Democratic Party president automatically becomes
the party's candidate for prime minister when the Parliament
convenes for a vote, expected on July 30. Obuchi is nearly certain
to win because the LDP has a comfortable majority in the powerful
lower house, which can overrule opposition from the upper house.
	   Obuchi, 61, would take over from Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto _ who announced last week he would resign after the
party's stunning reversal in July 12 elections for the upper house.
He also would assume stewardship of Japan's economy, now in its
worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   The new LDP standard-bearer vowed Friday to straighten out
Japan's financial mess.
	   ``The key issue at the moment is to repair Japan's economy,
fulfill our expected role in the international community and ease
the public's uncertainty about the future,'' Obuchi told reporters
in a news conference after the vote.
	   ``Because the economic slump in our country has a big impact on
Asia and the rest of the world, we have to pull Japan out of
recession as soon as we can,'' he said.
	   It was uncertain, however, if Obuchi _ backed by the largest and
most traditional wing of the party _ was up to the tough task of
the major changes analysts say are needed to solve the myriad
problems his country faces.
	   So far, he has prescribed an income tax cut worth 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging consumption,
moves that economists say are needed by might not be enough.
	   ``There will be a new face, but no big policy changes,'' said
Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg Japan Ltd.,
pointing out that Obuchi is supported by the same party cliques
that were behind Hashimoto.
	   The vote followed what was by Japanese standards a
rough-and-tumble campaign for party president, an open race that
was forced by a boisterous band of younger dissidents who argued
the staid ruling party had to abandon backroom politics and appeal
directly to voters to enhance its popular support.
	   Kajiyama, 72, jumped into the race after establishing himself in
recent months as an economic reformer, at one point declaring that
more than half of Japan's debt-laden banks should be allowed to
fail. Koizumi, 56, who has proposed privatizing Japan's massive
postal-savings system, was the favorite of party rebels.
	   As the second-place finisher with appeal both inside and beyond
the party, Kajiyama, who served for a time under Hashimoto, could
be in line for a prominent spot in an Obuchi cabinet.
	   ``Today is a new start for me,'' he told reporters, vowing to
work inside the party to make it more appealing to voters.
	   Party dissidents were disappointed. There were rumblings in the
party that some of the more disaffected members could defect or
abstain from the Parliament vote, but the numbers were small enough
that the threats were unlikely to block an Obuchi premiership.
	   Still, critics attacked the party for being resistant to change.
	   ``I was surprised. I thought I would be the runner-up,'' said
Koizumi. ``I guess the LDP has not developed enough flexibility to
approve me.''
	   A top opposition leader said Obuchi's emergence would not lead
to a change in Japan's direction.
	   ``Without changes in the LDP's politics and its systems, there
is little hope that they can live up to the public's
expectations,'' said Kunio Hatoyama, vice president of the largest
opposition group, the Liberal Party.
	   Should he become prime minister, Obuchi's job will not be
simple.
	   Unemployment is at a record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies
are mounting at their fastest rate since the end of World War II.
Japanese banks' are saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion)
in bad loans. U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
announced Thursday it will review its rating for Japan's government
debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The party's attempt to remake its image as open to change,
however, apparently did not make much of an impact on voters. A
poll by a major newspaper, the Yomiuri, showed the LDP with its
lowest approval ratings ever.
	   The could mean more political turmoil down the road for Obuchi.
	   ``Unless he finds a new coalition partner, there is a serious
risk he will be forced to resign or call a snap election,'' said
Okazaki.

Critics say proposed U.S.-Philippine military agreement could
</HEADLINE>
revive anti-American sentiment

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An agreement that would allow the
resumption of joint U.S.-Philippine military exercises would
violate Philippine sovereignty and revive anti-American sentiment,
opponents said Friday.
	   About 100 members of the left-wing Movement for National
Democracy rallied at the U.S. Embassy to denounce the accord,
called the Visiting Forces Agreement.
	   The agreement, which provides certain legal protections for U.S.
troops while in the Philippines, was signed early this year and is
awaiting approval by the Philippine Senate.
	   Opponents claim the agreement shields American soldiers who
commit offenses from criminal prosecution in Philippine courts
because of various loopholes.
	   The agreement generally gives the United States jurisdiction
over soldiers who commit crimes while on duty, while the
Philippines has jurisdiction over crimes committed while off-duty.
	   However, the critics say the Philippines is likely to waive its
jurisdiction if requested by the Americans, except in cases ``of
particular importance'' to the Philippines.
	   American authorities can also issue an ``official duty
certificate,'' which would show that an offense by a U.S. soldier
was committed while on duty, justifying their jurisdiction and
custody over the offender, they added.
	   ``This agreement is a big step backward, a return to the past,''
said Rep. Wigberto Tanada. ``It's going to open old wounds that we
thought had already healed. It will revive anti-American feelings
which I thought had largely receded.''
	   Tanada was one of the senators who voted against a treaty
renewing the lease of the last U.S. military base in the
Philippines in 1991. The rejection of the treaty led to a cooling
of ties between the two countries.
	   The base closed a year later, ending nearly a century of U.S.
military presence in this former American colony.
	   President Joseph Estrada and Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado,
two other former senators who helped defeat the treaty, are now
pushing for approval of the new agreement, which was crafted under
Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   Addressing foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations Friday, Estrada said his government ``will strengthen
or normalize our bilateral security arrangement, particularly with
the United States, our ASEAN partners and other Asian nations.''
	   Earlier this month, Mercado said his support for the new
agreement ``was not a change of heart'' because it would not mean
the permanent basing of U.S. troops.
	   ``As a small armed force, we need these exercises,'' Mercado
said. ``We need to be able to upgrade our capability and our
readiness.''
	   The two countries used to conduct between six and eight military
exercises a year, involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine
territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when
the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S.
military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   Similar pacts have been widely criticized in several Asian
countries because of difficulties local officials have had in
prosecuting U.S. soldiers who committed serious crimes.

Russian plan to light northern cities from space foiled by money
</HEADLINE>
shortage &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An ambitious plan to put a huge mirror in space to
illuminate Russia's sun-starved northern cities has been thwarted
by the lack of funds, space officials said Friday.
	   The experiment was to be launched in November and envisaged
unfolding a space mirror made of membrane covered by a metal layer.
In theory, the mirror was to work like the moon _ it would reflect
sunlight onto some northern parts of Russia during the long nights.
	   The mirror, a little less than 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter,
would have served as a test for even larger models that were to go
up later.
	   According to the plan, called Znamya (Banner) 2.5, the membrane
was to be attached to a Progress cargo ship and released after the
cargo ship had finished docking with the Mir space station.
	   However, the experiment has been postponed indefinitely because
a lack of money has reduced the number of cargo ships sent to Mir.
	   ``There is no place for that mirror aboard the cargo ships
because we can only ferry the most vital supplies to the station,''
Sergei Gorbunov, a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, said in
a telephone interview.
	   Space officials initially planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir in
orbit through the end of 1999, but the last crew is now expected to
depart next June.
	   ``We are struggling to raise funds to send regular supplies to
the station, let alone the Znamya,'' Gorbunov said.
	   In February 1993, Russia ran a similar experiment called Znamya
2, but the mirror was barely visible on Earth, said Vera
Medvedkova, a spokeswoman for the Mission Control.
	   The new Znamya also would be visible only to those who knew its
precise position in orbit, and would have resembled a shooting
star, not a large object such as the moon, Gorbunov said.

Myanmar opposition leaders attempts another trip outside Yangon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar democracy campaigner Aung San
Suu Kyi attempted once again to travel outside the capital Yangon
on Friday but it was not known if the military government had
stopped her as it had during previous attempts, opposition sources
said.
	   Suu Kyi was attempting to travel by car to the city of Bassein,
160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon. Bassein is in the
Irrawaddy delta, where the local authorities have a reputation of
being more repressive than in many other parts of Myanmar.
	   On previous trips, Suu Kyi was attempting to meet members of her
party to tell them not to comply with restrictions placed on them
by the military government that her party's leadership regards as
illegal.
	   The military government stopped Suu Kyi during two previous
journeys earlier in July _ on one occasion ordering 30 soldiers to
lift her car with her inside and turn it towards Yangon _ but
compromised by bringing the party members she wanted to meet to her
car.
	   The military has claimed that Suu Kyi is not under house arrest
or restrictions, but it prevents her from traveling outside the
capital or meeting with supporters anywhere outside her home.
	   It also prevents many supporters from visiting her at her home.
	   Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party are
objecting to the military government's recent order that elected
members of parliament from the NLD report to local authorities
twice a day.
	   The military has required the NLD members to do this under a law
called ``the Habitual Offenders Act.''
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament during
a 1990 election the military refused to honor despite promising
before the polls it would hand over power to the victors.
	   Of the 392 NLD members of parliament 181 are either in jail,
exile, been disqualified by the military-run election commission,
been forced under pressure to resign from the party or have died.
	   The NLD has said the rest are living under constant harassment
by the military.
	   The military denies the charges of harassment and says it never
intended to hand over power to the election winners.

Suspected remains of Japanese, Chinese climbers found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The suspected remains of a group of Japanese and
Chinese climbers who went missing seven years ago have been found
high on a glacier in southwest China, state media reported.
	   Farmers found the bodies last weekend on Mt. Meili, a
6,740-meter-high (22,242-foot-high) peak on Yunnan province's
border with Tibet where 17 members of the joint Chinese-Japanese
expedition died on Jan. 3, 1991, the Xinhua News Agency reported
Thursday.
	   Xinhua did not say how many bodies were found. China's
Mountaineering Association and the Yunnan Provincial Sports
Commission ordered that the bodies be left where they were found,
on a glacier 4,000 meters (13,200 feet) up, for identification.
	   Snow-covered Mt. Meili has never been successfully climbed,
Xinhua said. Chinese and Japanese mountaineers tried and failed to
scale the peak in 1989, 1991 and 1996.
	   Xinhua said the 17 mountaineers team died at a camp 5,100 meters
(16,830 feet) above sea level. Reports at the time said they were
buried by avalanches. Bad weather prevented rescue workers from
recovering the bodies.
	   Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, said one of its reporters,
Yukio Munemori, then aged 32, was among the 11 mountaineers from
Japan's Kyoto University and the six Chinese who died.

Sri Lanka signs dlrs 1 billion deal for port privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The government and a group of local
and foreign investors have signed a dlrs 1 billion agreement for
privatizing the port of Colombo, an official said Friday.
	   Under the agreement signed Thursday, the investor consortium led
by Britain's Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. will
build and operate the Queen Elizabeth quay, a main port area, for
30 years. The P and O will have a 26-percent stake in the project.
	   Sri Lanka's John Keells Holdings Ltd. will also hold a
26-percent stake. The other partners are the Sri Lankan government,
the International Finance Corp. _ a unit of the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and the Commonwealth Development Corp.
	   Labor unions representing more than 12,000 workers oppose the
project because it will lead to layoffs and a revenue loss for the
state-run Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

Japan's new leader faces serious challenges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; WITH: BC-Japan-Politics
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The campaign speeches are over. The ballots have
been cast. A new leader has been chosen.
	   Now comes the hard part.
	   Keizo Obuchi emerged from a three-way race Friday to win the
vote to head Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and was
nearly certain to become the next prime minister in a vote next
week.
	   But he has daunting tasks ahead of him.
	   The 61-year-old political veteran must move quickly to fix an
economy that's now in such a mess that U.S. rating agency Moody's
Investors Services said Thursday it may downgrade its appraisal of
the country's creditworthiness.
	   Obuchi also must see his party through one of its toughest
crises by regaining voter confidence and stemming defections by
discontented young lawmakers.
	   If Obuchi fails, his party could lose power for only the second
time since its founding in 1955. The LDP was pushed out of the
premiership in 1993, but rose again to win back the prime
minister's spot in 1996.
	   But some are optimistic that Obuchi and his backers feel the
pressure _ and will rise to the occasion.
	   ``The LDP can act decisively. It can't afford not to,'' said
Pelham Smithers, a strategist for ING Baring Securities (Japan)
Ltd.
	   Obuchi's first task will be reviving the economy, which is mired
in its worst recession since World War II.
	   He has already promised income tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 43 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71 billion) in new
public works spending to kick start economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   Even if these work, difficult problems remain.
	   One is Japan's ballooning national debt. Another is the 84
trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans at Japan's banks,
which have undermined confidence in the financial system and
absorbed badly needed funds from being more productively spent on
new investment.
	   And Obuchi has pledged to rein in the country's powerful
bureaucrats, freeing business from stifling regulations.
	   The LDP's new standard-bearer must also reverse the popular
perception that his party's bungling sunk Japan into recession in
the first place.
	   Voters handed the party a stunning loss in upper house elections
July 12, in what analysts call a rebuke of outgoing Hashimoto's
decision to raise the sales tax last year even as the economy
sputtered.
	   On Thursday, Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri, reported
that the LDP's approval rating has sunk to an all-time low of 20.8
percent _ a steep drop from 28.7 percent in June.
	   Obuchi himself suffers from a lack of popularity. Opinion polls
going into Friday's party vote showed him lagging far behind his
opponents.
	   That has sparked criticism from younger lawmakers within his own
party that his choice was the product of backroom politicking by
party powerbrokers _ exactly the sort of image the LDP needs to
shed to survive, they say.
	   Thirty-six young lawmakers held an ``anti-Obuchi'' meeting
Thursday evening to discuss what to do if Obuchi wins. Some have
even threatened to quit the LDP and form a reform party, though the
small group was unlikely to derail his march to the premiership.
	   In a press conference Friday, Obuchi called for party unity and
said his victory was a vote of support for his policies.
	   ``This election was conducted in a completely different way from
the factional politics of the past,'' Obuchi said.
	   Some analysts agreed, however, that the vote showed Obuchi
enjoys the support of other party leaders, who will help keep the
party together.
	   ``Obuchi is the best chance for party unity at a time when party
unity is most needed,'' said ING Baring's Smithers.

Mayor: Jaffna residents fear 600 missing are buried in mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - The new mayor of Jaffna urged the
government on Friday to publicize the results of its inquiry into a
claim that the military killed hundreds of ethnic Tamil civilians
and buried them in a mass grave on the outskirts of his town.
	   ``Since the issue of the mass graves came up, many of the
relatives have met me and they fear that their dear ones are indeed
buried there,'' Ponnuthurai Sivapalan said in a telephone
interview. ``I wish the government keeps to its word and makes
public all its findings.''
	   The government ordered an inquiry Wednesday into a soldier's
claim that he helped bury hundreds of Tamil prisoners in Jaffna,
the largest city in the Tamil heartland of northern Sri Lanka.
	   He was one of five soldiers and a policeman who were sentenced
to death on July 3 for the rape and murder of a Tamil schoolgirl
and the slayings of members of her family. The men pleaded
innocent, claiming they merely buried the victims and could show
authorities the graves of other civilians killed by security
forces.
	   Between 500 to 600 Tamil civilians have disappeared in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula since the military drove out Tamil rebels
and took control of the area in May 1996. The rebels are fighting
for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority, which they
claim suffers discrimination by the majority Sinhalese.
	   Sivapalan, who took office June 29 after his predecessor was
assassinated, said he has told Jaffna's military commander that
unless the question of the missing civilians is settled soon, it
will damage efforts to restore Tamils' faith in the national
government.
	   ``The very fact that the government has ordered an inquiry by
the Criminal Investigation Department points to its sincerity,''
Major General Lionel Balagalle said when reached by the telephone.
``We are aware of the fact that families who have missing people
are eagerly waiting for the outcome.''

Volcano in Russia's Far East begins spewing ash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A volcano in Russia's Far East has begun spewing
columns of ash 500 meters (1,600 feet) into the air, a news report
said Friday.
	   The Klyuchevskoy volcano, on the Kamchatka peninsula, began
releasing clouds of ash roughly every 20 minutes on Thursday. It
presently does not threaten the nearest town, 30 kilometers (18
miles) away, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The volcano last erupted in 1994. At that time it spewed lava
and plumes of ash 15 kilometers (nine miles) above sea level.
	   Though the volcano's activity is difficult to predict, experts
do not think it has gathered enough strength this time for an
explosion of similar power, Interfax said.

Forest fires in Russian Far East approach towns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires that have been raging across Russia's
Far East for weeks are getting close to towns in the region, a news
report said Friday.
	   Some major fires are within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of small
towns on the Kamchatka peninsula and in the Khabarovsk region, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Less than two kilometers separates the Trudovoye settlement on
Sakhalin Island from one burning forest.
	   The fires, which have engulfed more than 70,000 hectares
(170,000 acres) across the region so far, have sent up vast plumes
of smoke which keep firefighting planes and helicopters grounded.
	   Almost 1,500 people are now fighting the blazes, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Far East has been ravaged by forest fires this summer
because of an unusually dry winter and spring. Fire specialists now
say that fires may continue burning until winter snowfalls if the
drought continues.

Military prosecutor indicts 14 in smuggling scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The military prosecutor has indicted
14 people, including senior state officials, involved in smuggling
cigarettes worth over one million dollars, his office said Friday.
	   They were arrested in April and will be tried on a charge of
smuggling which is punishable by up to 15 years in jail under
Romanian law.
	   On April 16, a Ukrainian IL 76 aircraft operated by Air Sofia
landed at Otopeni Military Airport loaded with 3,000 crates of
cigarettes.
	   According to police, the crew did not declare the cargo, and the
military airport commander did not log the landing. The cigarettes
were subsequently found and confiscated by police.
	   Among those indicted are Ioan Suciu, the head of Otopeni
Military Airport, and Col. Gheorghe Trutulescu, from the state
security service, who reportedly coordinated the smuggling.
	   No trial date has been set.

Indonesian military to reduce troop numbers in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia will begin withdrawing
troops from the troubled territory of East Timor next week, the
armed forces announced Friday.
	   The decision comes amid renewed diplomatic efforts to secure
peace for the troubled former Portuguese colony, which has endured
two decades of guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses.
	   ``There is a plan to reduce the troop numbers in East Timor,''
said Maj. Gen. Abdul Wahab Mokodongan, a member of a military think
tank in Jakarta.
	   He declined to say how many troops would leave next week.
	   President B.J. Habibie last month promised a gradual reduction
in troop numbers to help ease tensions in East Timor, invaded by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed in 1976 _ an act not recognized by
the United Nations.
	   About 12,000 Indonesian soldiers are currently deployed in East
Timor, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The planned reduction comes ahead of talks on Aug. 4-5 in New
York with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal.
	   It will also take place just days before a scheduled visit to
Indonesia by U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
	   Since the invasion Indonesian troops have fought a small band of
rebel fighters who have demanded independence for the territory,
which has a population of about 800,000.
	   Human rights groups have accused the military of a wide rang of
abuses over the years including torture and killings.
	   In 1991 scores of pro-independence protesters were shot to death
when Indonesian troops opened fire to break up a demonstration.
	   During a visit to Indonesia earlier this week, U.N. special
envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, said the proposed partial
withdrawal of Indonesian troops would build confidence in the
troubled territory, but that some soldiers would have to stay to
maintain security.
	   Marker has been trying for years to broker a peace deal for East
Timor, ruled by Portugal for centuries before Indonesia invaded.
	   Hopes of reaching a settlement have increased since Indonesia
changed presidents two months ago.
	   Habibie became president in May when Indonesia's former
authoritarian leader Suharto stepped down. Suharto ordered the 1975
invasion and later steadfastly refused to make compromises despite
the prolonged conflict.
	   Habibie has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and to
release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of East Timor as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   Habibie has rejected demands by separatists for a referendum on
outright independence.
	   Marker said he was hopeful the meeting will move the peace
process forward.

<TEXT>
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Relief workers sealed off the
most devastated areas of Papua New Guinea on Friday and evacuated
from the same location those fortunate enough to survive a series
of tidal waves a week ago.
	   Lt.-Col. Rod West, commander of the Australian army relief
efforts, said the worst-affected areas would be turned into
permanent graveyards _ allowing hundreds and perhaps thousands of
unrecovered bodies to decompose.
	   The evacuations will also help prevent the spread of disease to
survivors and rescue workers.
	   ``Some of these bodies are very much deteriorated,'' West said.
``The plan is to seal the areas and let nature takes its course _
the natural flushing of the lagoon and the crocodiles and sharks.''
	   Thwarted by impenetrable mangrove swamps, authorities decided to
abandon the attempt to retrieve bodies and will seal off the area
around Sissano lagoon. The decision means the true death toll from
the July 17 tsunami disaster may never be known.
	   The official death count stands at more than 1,300, but 6,000
people are missing and feared dead, while 2,500 to 3,500 survivors
have been accounted for.
	   Col. Takam Kanene, a disaster relief official with the Papua New
Guinean government, said Friday that no survivors had been found
since Tuesday.
	   ``In normal circumstances, someone would survive for about four,
five, six days without food, but after that they would die of
starvation,'' Kanene said.
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the three
tidal waves Friday further added to the worries of residents of the
northwest coast. Seismologists warned Friday that there is a 50
percent chance of more tremor activity.
	   The seas off Papua New Guinea's north coast are usually calm,
but boats Friday reported swells of up to 4 meters (14 feet).
	   Andrew Kumbakor, a Papua New Guinean legislator, said the area
around the Sissano lagoon would be declared a ``contaminated,
restricted area'' because of the threat of disease from decomposing
bodies.
	   ``The government will have to go with that decision and just
abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay, allow
the bodies to just rot off,'' said Kumbakor.
	   ``I would think that the government should never allow the
people to ever come back. Only for special occasions like
fishing.''
	   Surgical teams in a tent hospital continued the task Friday of
trying to save the battered survivors, many of them affected by
gangrene. Nearly 200 operations had been performed since Monday.
	   Most injuries happened when the tsunami flung people against
trees or debris, fracturing bones and tearing open skin. Many
people died instantly; others died in the jungle before medical
help could reach them.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured now is infection.
Coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   Lt. Brad Slater, an Australian army officer at the emergency
field hospital in Vanimo, said the facility had also treated many
pneumonia cases brought on by breathing seawater.
	   At least 30 bodies were found Thursday washed up on a beach in
the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40
kilometers) west of the disaster zone, local police said, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Those victims were believed to have been sucked out to sea by
the back surge from the waves and dragged along the coast.
	   West said one of the top priorities in the next several days
would be to reunite families separated in the confusion following
the disaster.
	   ``At the moment we have families spread between Aitape, Vanimo
and Wewak,'' said West. ``We're going to try to get those people
back together again.''
	   Church workers at hospitals in those villages have started the
slow task of compiling lists of patients, the names of their
villages and details of their families.
	   Relief agency program officer Peter Zwart said Friday that so
many people had died or were missing that only a process of
elimination could reveal the extent of the tragedy.
	   ``The church workers of Aitape and surrounding districts have
turned to this task to try to reunite families, where possible, and
to build a true picture of the tragedy,'' Zwart said.
	   ``It is like putting together the remaining pieces of a puzzle.
The blank spaces are lost children, mothers, fathers, relatives _
whole families.''

Opposition lawmakers to resign to press early elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Facing growing unrest within her party,
the leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalists Party has told
its lawmakers to resign from Parliament as part of an effort to
press for an early election, the party said Friday.
	   Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia decided on the move Thursday
night after nearly one-third of the BNP's 111 lawmakers threatened
to walk out unless Zia and other party leaders agreed to quit the
2-year-old Parliament.
	   Elections are not due until 2001, but the opposition accuses the
ruling Awami League of incompetence and of harassing opposition
activists. It is seeking an early vote.
	   It was not clear when the legislators would submit their
collective resignations. A meeting of the BNP's National Standing
Committee authorized Mrs. Zia to collect the resignation letters
but did not set a deadline for submitting them to the speaker of
the 330-seat legislature.
	   Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina has rejected the demands for an
early election, saying she will resign only three months before the
2001 elections.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Relief workers sealed off the
most devastated areas of Papua New Guinea on Friday and evacuated
from the same location those fortunate enough to survive a tsunami
a week ago.
	   Lt.-Col. Rod West, commander of the Australian army relief
efforts, said the worst-affected areas would be turned into
permanent graveyards _ allowing hundreds and perhaps thousands of
unrecovered bodies to decompose.
	   The evacuations will also help prevent the spread of disease to
survivors and rescue workers.
	   ``Some of these bodies are very much deteriorated,'' West said.
``The plan is to seal the areas and let nature takes its course _
the natural flushing of the lagoon and the crocodiles and sharks.''
	   Thwarted by impenetrable mangrove swamps, authorities decided to
abandon the attempt to retrieve bodies and will seal off the area
around Sissano lagoon. The decision means the true death toll from
the July 17 tsunami disaster may never be known.
	   The official death count stands at more than 1,300, but 6,000
people are missing and feared dead, while 2,500 to 3,500 survivors
have been accounted for.
	   Col. Takam Kanene, a disaster relief official with the Papua New
Guinean government, said Friday that no survivors had been found
since Tuesday.
	   ``In normal circumstances, someone would survive for about four,
five, six days without food, but after that they would die of
starvation,'' Kanene said.
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the tsunami
Friday further added to the worries of residents of the northwest
coast. Seismologists warned Friday that there is a 50 percent
chance of more tremor activity.
	   The seas off Papua New Guinea's north coast are usually calm,
but boats Friday reported swells of up to 4 meters (14 feet).
	   Andrew Kumbakor, a Papua New Guinean legislator, said the area
around the Sissano lagoon would be declared a ``contaminated,
restricted area'' because of the threat of disease from decomposing
bodies.
	   ``The government will have to go with that decision and just
abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay, allow
the bodies to just rot off,'' said Kumbakor.
	   ``I would think that the government should never allow the
people to ever come back. Only for special occasions like
fishing.''
	   Surgical teams in a tent hospital continued the task Friday of
trying to save the battered survivors, many of them affected by
gangrene. Nearly 200 operations had been performed since Monday.
	   Most injuries happened when the tsunami flung people against
trees or debris, fracturing bones and tearing open skin. Many
people died instantly; others died in the jungle before medical
help could reach them.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured now is infection.
Coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   Lt. Brad Slater, an Australian army officer at the emergency
field hospital in Vanimo, said the facility had also treated many
pneumonia cases brought on by breathing seawater.
	   At least 30 bodies were found Thursday washed up on a beach in
the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40
kilometers) west of the disaster zone, local police said, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Those victims were believed to have been sucked out to sea by
the back surge from the waves and dragged along the coast.
	   West said one of the top priorities in the next several days
would be to reunite families separated in the confusion following
the disaster.
	   ``At the moment we have families spread between Aitape, Vanimo
and Wewak,'' said West. ``We're going to try to get those people
back together again.''
	   Church workers at hospitals in those villages have started the
slow task of compiling lists of patients, the names of their
villages and details of their families.
	   Relief agency program officer Peter Zwart said Friday that so
many people had died or were missing that only a process of
elimination could reveal the extent of the tragedy.
	   ``The church workers of Aitape and surrounding districts have
turned to this task to try to reunite families, where possible, and
to build a true picture of the tragedy,'' Zwart said.
	   ``It is like putting together the remaining pieces of a puzzle.
The blank spaces are lost children, mothers, fathers, relatives _
whole families.''

Thailand ready to evacuate election observers from Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Prime Minister has ordered
the military on Friday to be prepared to evacuate foreign observers
of Cambodia's July 26 election if the need arises because of
violence.
	   Chuan was responding to a request by the Electoral Assistance
Secretariat, an international organization that has sent about 460
foreign observers from 26 countries to monitor the poll.
	   The Prime Minister ordered the Defense Ministry to have the
military keep transport planes on standby to evacuate any observers
should it be needed until July 28.
	   So far, there has been no need for any emergency flights, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
	   Cambodia's election campaign has been marred by violence and
intimidation.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh is leading an opposition challenge to
Hun Sen, who ousted him as his co-Prime Minister in a bloody coup
d'etat last July.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
began talks with Ukrainian leaders Friday, meeting President Leonid
Kuchma in preparation for a French-Ukrainian summit in September.
	   Vedrine, who arrived late on Thursday for a one-day visit, also
was to meet Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign
Minister Borys Tarasyuk.
	   Apart from preparations for French President Jacques Chirac's
visit to Ukraine in September, Vedrine was to discuss bilateral
trade, political, military and economic cooperation, officials
said.
	   Vedrine's talks with Kuchma covered a wide range of subjects,
ranging from plans to repair the leaky sarcophagus over the ruined
Chernobyl nuclear reactor, to European security issues and Kiev's
cooperation with NATO. They even discussed France's victory in the
World Cup soccer tournament, said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr
Maidannyk.
	   The sides agreed that bilateral trade and French investments in
Ukraine were at a low level and could be increased.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a victory for Japan's political old guard over
dissident lawmakers, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi won the vote for
ruling party president Friday, virtually sewing up his quest for
prime minister but dimming hopes of drastic action to fix the
troubled economy.
	   Obuchi, a party stalwart with a long but conventional career in
government, snared 225 of the 411 votes cast in a first ballot _
far more than rivals former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Kajiyama came in
second with 102 votes and Koizumi took 84.
	   The new Liberal Democratic Party president automatically becomes
the party's candidate for prime minister when the Parliament
convenes for a vote, expected on July 30. Obuchi is nearly certain
to win because the LDP has a comfortable majority in the powerful
lower house, which can overrule opposition from the upper house.
	   Obuchi, 61, would take over from Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto _ who announced last week he would resign after the
party's stunning reversal in July 12 elections for the upper house.
He also would assume stewardship of Japan's economy, now in its
worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   The new LDP standard-bearer vowed Friday to straighten out
Japan's financial mess.
	   ``The key issue at the moment is to repair Japan's economy,
fulfill our expected role in the international community and ease
the public's uncertainty about the future,'' Obuchi told reporters
in a news conference after the vote.
	   ``Because the economic slump in our country has a big impact on
Asia and the rest of the world, we have to pull Japan out of
recession as soon as we can,'' he said.
	   It was uncertain, however, if Obuchi _ backed by the largest and
most traditional wing of the party _ was up to the tough task of
the major changes analysts say are needed to solve the myriad
problems his country faces.
	   So far, he has prescribed an income tax cut worth 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging consumption,
moves that economists say are needed by might not be enough.
	   ``There will be a new face, but no big policy changes,'' said
Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg Japan Ltd.,
pointing out that Obuchi is supported by the same party cliques
that were behind Hashimoto.
	   People in Tokyo expressed resigned displeasure at the LDP's
choice of staid party-insider Obuchi, who had the least popular
support among the candidates.
	   ``I'm beyond disappointment,'' said 28-year-old trading company
employee Yuko Imamura. ``This way, there was no point in having the
upper house elections.''
	   The vote followed what was by Japanese standards a
rough-and-tumble campaign for party president, an open race that
was forced by a boisterous band of younger dissidents who argued
the staid ruling party had to abandon backroom politics and appeal
directly to voters to enhance its popular support.
	   Kajiyama, 72, jumped into the race after establishing himself in
recent months as an economic reformer, at one point declaring that
more than half of Japan's debt-laden banks should be allowed to
fail. Koizumi, 56, who has proposed privatizing Japan's massive
postal-savings system, was the favorite of party rebels.
	   As the second-place finisher with appeal both inside and beyond
the party, Kajiyama, who served for a time under Hashimoto, could
be in line for a prominent spot in an Obuchi cabinet.
	   ``Today is a new start for me,'' he told reporters, vowing to
work inside the party to make it more appealing to voters.
	   Party dissidents were disappointed. There were rumblings in the
party that some of the more disaffected members could defect or
abstain from the Parliament vote, but the numbers were small enough
that the threats were unlikely to block an Obuchi premiership.
	   Still, critics attacked the party for being resistant to change.
	   ``I was surprised. I thought I would be the runner-up,'' said
Koizumi. ``I guess the LDP has not developed enough flexibility to
approve me.''
	   A top opposition leader said Obuchi's emergence would not lead
to a change in Japan's direction.
	   ``Without changes in the LDP's politics and its systems, there
is little hope that they can live up to the public's
expectations,'' said Kunio Hatoyama, vice president of the largest
opposition group, the Liberal Party.
	   Should he become prime minister, Obuchi's job will not be
simple.
	   Unemployment is at a record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies
are mounting at their fastest rate since the end of World War II.
Japanese banks' are saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion)
in bad loans. U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
announced Thursday it will review its rating for Japan's government
debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The party's attempt to remake its image as open to change,
however, apparently did not make much of an impact on voters. A
poll by a major newspaper, the Yomiuri, showed the LDP with its
lowest approval ratings ever.
	   The could mean more political turmoil down the road for Obuchi.
	   ``Unless he finds a new coalition partner, there is a serious
risk he will be forced to resign or call a snap election,'' said
Okazaki.

Japanese naval ships arrive in Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three Japanese warships arrived in Russia's
Pacific port city of Vladivostok on Friday to take part in the
first joint naval exercises between the two countries, a news
report said.
	   Two Russian ships and two helicopters will join the Japanese
vessels in a mock search and rescue operation 390 kilometers (240
miles) from Vladivostok in the Sea of Japan on July 29, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Relations between Japan and Russia are still strained because of
a border dispute over the Kuril Islands, which Russia has seized at
the end of World War II but Japan still claims. The two countries
have never signed a treaty officially ending the war.
	   Recent summits between President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto have improved relations,
though there has been no breakthrough on the Kuril Islands.
	   Ships from Japan's navy visited Vladivostok in July 1996, and
Russian naval ships visited Tokyo in June 1997, for joint
communications training.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In another blow to Thailand's battered
economy, Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and its Thai subsidiary shut
down one of their assembly plants Friday, citing slumping sales
because of the country's economic crisis.
	   About 550 of the company's 600 employees were laid off
immediately with the remainder staying on for the next few months
to participate in a phased shut down of the plant, the company said
in a press release.
	   Mazda is still operating one more factory in Thailand in
conjunction with Ford Motor Co. of the United States and two Thai
partners to produce Ford and Mazda pickup trucks.
	   Mazda is 33.4 percent owned by Ford.
	   The factory that closed Friday had been operating since 1975.
	   ``The closure is the result of the sharp downturn in the Thai
automotive market caused by the economic slump. The plant has been
operating far below capacity since last year,'' the company said.
	   Mazda explored various alternatives to closing the plant, but
none proved feasible, the company said.
	   A Ministry of Labor official said the company had agreed to pay
laid off workers more than three months severance. The company said
it will help employees with outplacement counseling.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An influential bond ratings agency
rattled Malaysia on Friday by predicting the economy would shrink
by up to 5 percent this year.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the country's
long-term bond ratings to a medium grade just two notches above
junk-bond ratings. Moody's also downgraded Malaysia's short-term
foreign currency bonds.
	   Moody's assessment came one day after Malaysia announced an
ambitious plan to revitalize an economy sinking into recession.
Thursday's government forecasts said the economic contraction would
be checked at 2 percent this year and it would begin to recover in
1999.
	   The rating agency said the downgrade reflected ``the rapid
deterioration in Malaysia's economy this year and the expected
effects on the banking system and on government finance.''
	   Moody's also criticized Malaysia's policy response to the Asian
economic crisis as lacking in direction.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Development Bank of Singapore Ltd., one of the
country's `big four' banks, will acquire POSBank by issuing new
shares, Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu said Friday.
	   The merger has been anticipated by the markets.
	   Trading in DBS shares was suspended Friday on the Stock Exchange
of Singapore pending the announcement, and DBS officials have
scheduled a press conference to follow the minister's briefing.
	   In preparation for the merger, POSBank will be privatized, Hu
said, adding that the new bank will have an asset base of 93
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 54 billion) and 9.4 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 5.5 billion) in shareholder funds.
	   DBS will issue non-voting preference shares equivalent to 18
percent of the enlarged bank's capital to pay for the acquisition
of POSBank, the minister said.
	   ``The purpose is to establish a large bank,'' Hu said. ``Size
has become a very important factor in the banking sector.''
	   The purchase must still be approved by an extraordinary meeting
of DBS' shareholders, Hu said. He didn't say when it might be
completed.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - American computer giant IBM Corp. has
temporarily dropped plans to build a joint-venture, dlrs 1-billion
wafer fabrication plant in the Philippines, its local partner has
announced.
	   Lawrence Qua, president of Philippine electronics concern Ionics
Circuits Inc., said Thursday a glut of computer wafers worldwide
has forced the project to be put on hold.
	   A wafer fabrication plan is considered the backbone of the
semiconductor industry because it produces the basic material for
the production of microchips.
	   Qua said the oversupply was the result of a slowdown in sales of
computers, especially in Asia which has been hit by a currency
crisis, he said.
	   ``We'll have to wait until the market is right for us to build a
wafer plant here and (see) if government is ready to live up to its
commitment on the project,'' he added.
	   Ionics and IBM were expecting to get Philippine government
incentives to make the project viable. But the government, running
a budget deficit, isn't keen on giving tax incentives at the
moment.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said
Friday he ``can't understand'' why U.S. credit rating agency
Moody's Investors Service placed Japan's government debt under a
rating review.
	   Moody's announcement on Thursday, a blow to Japan's struggling
economy, signaled doubts about Japan's ability to repay its debts.
A downgrade would raise borrowing rates for the country's
government and companies.
	   Matsunaga said Japan has plenty of money to pay its debts.
	   ``Japan's foreign exchange reserves have, if anything, increased
recently, and the amount of our foreign asset holdings is huge,''
Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   ``I can't understand why it (Moody's) is reviewing,'' he said.
	   Moody's said Thursday it had placed on review for a possible
downgrade the triple-A sovereign ratings of Japan's foreign
currency-denominated debt and yen-denominated debt.
	   The rating agency said the review was prompted by deep
structural problems in the Japanese economy and lack of any
government consensus on how to bring the country's finances back to
health.

Better ties with U.S. boosts China's trade prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Improving ties with the United States is helping
China offset flagging trade and investment from Asia's financial
turmoil, a senior Chinese trade official said Friday.
	   Visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Washington last fall
and U.S. President Bill Clinton to Beijing a few weeks ago
``offered a very strong impetus ... to the realization of tangible
results in economic and trade,'' said Hu Zhaoqing, a spokesman for
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
	   During the first half of the year, Chinese exports to the United
States rose 18.1 percent, compared with overall export growth of
just 7.6 percent.
	   Pledged investment by U.S. businesses for the first six months
jumped 81 percent, while overall contracted investment rose 5.5
percent to dlrs 24.2 billion, Hu said.
	   Higher exports to the United States, Europe, Africa and Latin
America helped China record a half-year trade surplus of dlrs 22.6
billion, a sign its economy has so far withstood the deepening
Asian financial crisis, Hu said.
	   But the foreign trade ministry spokesman said the government
faced ``grave challenges and severe difficulties'' boosting trade
in the face of weaker regional currencies and negative growth
rates. The 7.6 percent growth in exports for the first six months
paled next to the 21 percent rate for all last year.
	   Japan's weakening yen and economic torpor have sliced into
China's exports and caused Japanese companies to scale back
investments, Hu said.
	   Despite warmer political ties, U.S. officials have criticized
Beijing for reaping a nearly dlrs 50 billion trade surplus last
year. U.S. insistence that China do more to open its domestic
markets has held up Beijing's entry to the World Trade
Organization.

Floods kill 13 in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Floods from heavy rain have killed at
least 13 people in recent days, police said Friday.
	   At least eight sand miners were killed Thursday when a flood
washed tons of hardened lava down the slopes of the Mount Kelud
volcano.
	   Police said the men were swept into the Supit Urang River, about
630 kilometers (390 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   On Wednesday five people drowned in a flood in the eastern most
province of Irian Jaya.
	   Weeklong rain also triggered a landslide near Serui, about 3,200
kilometers (2,000 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   Flooding in the town damaged at least 23 houses.

Japanese stocks close higher, dollar falls in Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with late bond and currency prices;
ADDS trader quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose Friday, buoyed by
short-covering from public pension funds, ahead of the ruling
party's selection of a new head to replace outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. The dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.88 points,
or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 16,361.89. On Thursday, the
Nikkei lost 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   Just after the end of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was elected leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party. As the new party head, Obuchi is virtually
assured of succeeding Prime Minister Hashimoto in a Parliamentary
vote expected next week.
	   As chief of the LDP's largest faction, Obuchi was widely
expected by investors to win the three-way race for party president
and to take over as Japan's next leader, traders said. But his
policy options are limited, they added.
	   ``A new government has no choice but take active fiscal stimulus
measures and prompt steps to stabilize the financial industry,''
said Shoji Hirakawa, chief manager of the equity research
department at Kokusai Securities Co.
	   In early trading, stocks fell amid worries over the
credit-worthiness of Japanese firms following Moody's Investors
Service's announcement Thursday that was considering downgrading
the rating of Japan's national debt.
	   But the market shook off these concerns, allowing the broader
Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange to climb 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent,
to 1,258.01. The TOPIX had closed down 7.98 points, or 0.63
percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 400 million shares were traded on the first section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 423 million issues the
previous day. Advancing stocks exceeded decliners 648 to 453, with
184 shares closing unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 140.54 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 1.14 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York rate of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   The win by Obuchi in the contest to replace Hashimoto _ who had
announced his intention to resign last week _ failed to trigger a
massive sell-off of the yen that some had predicted.
	   Still, few traders said they expect the dollar to drift much
lower against the yen due to concern Obuchi will be unable to
provide the type of strong leadership needed to implement economic
recovery measures.
	   The dollar fell as low as 140.35 yen in Tokyo trading and rose
as high as 141.70 yen.
	   In the fixed-income market, the yield on the benchmark No. 182
10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.370 percent from
Thursday's finish of 1.335 percent, driving its price down to
110.68 yen from 110.86 yen.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko drew up plans Friday for a summit between
their presidents that's likely to take place in just over a month's
time.
	   Gore has been holding regular discussions with Russia's prime
minister in recent years, but this marked his first session with
Kiriyenko since he became premier in March, replacing Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``It's good to see so many long-time friends on your side of the
table,'' Gore said after shaking hands with the Russian delegation
Friday morning at the President Hotel. ``I want you to know that
President (Bill) Clinton and I are absolutely committed to
deepening these relationships.''
	   Their work was expected to focus on a Moscow summit between
Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, planned for the end of
August or early September.
	   However, several secondary topics were also addressed. For
instance, Russian officials complained to Gore that the Soviet-era
Jackson-Vanik law which ties trade privileges for Russia to levels
of emigration, is still in effect.
	   Although the amendment has been waived annually, Gore pledged to
work to repeal it altogether.
	   Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov also said Gore
agreed to permit Russia to convert some of its stockpile of
plutonium into fuel for nuclear power plants.
	   Under an agreement expected to be signed later Friday, the
United States had previously opposed converting Russian plutonium
into civilian nuclear fuel, Adamov said after morning meetings
between the two sides.
	   The American side expressed concern over funding for joint space
programs, and won a promise from the Russians to find the money to
fulfill its obligations to the international space station, said
Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency. Russian funding
problems have repeatedly pushed back the project's launch date, now
set for November.
	   Other issues that may be addressed include the START II arms
control treaty, which has still not been ratified by the Russian
parliament, and American concerns over the possible sale of Russian
weapons technology to Iran.
	   In opening remarks, Gore and Kiriyenko both described the
U.S.-Russian relationship in grand terms, saying tackling such
problems will help it grow stronger.
	   ``The U.S.-Russian relationship will play a key role, indeed the
decisive role, in determining what kind of a world we create for
our children and our grandchildren,'' Gore said.
	   ``We hope that by the 21st century we will have resolved all
outstanding issues and eliminated the negative consequences of the
past,'' Kiriyenko added.
	   The two men gave no indication they would hold detailed
discussions on Russia's financial crisis, which has eased in recent
days following an agreement with the international lenders to
provide dlrs 17 billion in new loans to Russia.
	   Kiriyenko was named prime minister in March with a mandate to
speed up the country's economic reforms, but he has been battling
the financial crisis since shortly after he assumed the post.
	   Gore, meanwhile, spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in
Moscow on Thursday evening.
	   The vice president toured the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear
reactor Thursday, peering from the open door of a black military
helicopter at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Gore is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Chernobyl,
which exploded in 1986 and spewed radiation over a large swath of
Europe.

Swiss man appeals to Thai government over hospital negligence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A retired Swiss banker appeared before
the Thai Parliament's Human Rights Committee and the Medical
Council claiming negligent treatment by doctors at a Bangkok
hospital left him paralyzed, a committee member said Friday.
	   Shaking and unable to walk without help from his Thai wife
Penpak, Earnst Wynistorf, 54, limped into the committee room
Thursday to ask for the government's help.
	   Wynistorf's troubles began when he was involved in a motorcycle
accident in the resort town of Pattaya, 110 kilometers (68 miles)
south of Bangkok, in December 1997. He went to Samitivej Hospital
in Bangkok in January when his nose began bleeding.
	   ``He went into shock while receiving an injection by Samitivej
doctors and has been paralyzed since then,'' said Surapong
Tovichakchaikul, a Democrat party member who filed the complaint on
behalf of the couple to the Human Rights Committee.
	   Wynistorf wants to be flown to Switzerland and treated in a
hospital there, and he wants Samitivej to pay for it. He has
already paid Samitivej 600,000 baht (dlrs 15,000) for treatment.
	   Samitivej director, Dr. Pornthep Premyothin, refused to comment
on the case.
	   Wynistorf's wife said they had decided not to sue the hospital
because Thai law makes winning negligence cases difficult and time
consuming. She said her husband would probably be dead before the
case would reach its conclusion.
	   Surapong said he would ask the committee to draft a bill that
would streamline negligence cases and force doctors and hospitals
to buy malpractice insurance. He vowed to push Parliament to pass
such a bill.
	   Samitivej is one of Thailand's leading hospitals. It was sued
earlier by a Thai businessman for causing the death of his wife
during childbirth. That case has not yet been decided.

German court orders new trial for Lebanese acquitted of asylum home
</HEADLINE>
arson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A German court ordered a retrial
Friday for a Lebanese man acquitted last year of setting a fire at
an asylum shelter that killed 10 people.
	   The Federal Court of Justice overturned the lower court's
verdict based on an appeal by the family of one of the victims.
	   They argued that the court should have considered as evidence
conversations that prosecutors had secretly recorded between the
defendant, Safwan Aid, and relatives while he was in prison.
	   Aid, 22, was acquitted on June 30, 1997. Prosecutors had
admitted that they had insufficient evidence to convict him of
setting the Jan. 18, 1996, fire, which killed 10 people and injured
38 others in Luebeck, in northern Germany.
	   Aid, who lived in the house as well, was arrested two days after
the fire, then freed on bail after six months in investigative
custody. The main witness against him was a rescue team medic who
testified he heard Aid say, ``It was us.''
	   However, the state court found the witness may have
misunderstood Aid and that the suspect himself may have been in a
state of shock when he spoke to the medic.
	   Prosecutors had contended Aid set the fire to get revenge on
another occupant over a disagreement.
	   But Aid denied the charges and other residents testified there
had been no fights in the building.
	   Prosecutors had secretly recorded conversations Aid had with
relatives while he was in jail, but the court refused to accept the
tapes as evidence, ruling that the way they were made was
unconstitutional.
	   The federal court, however, said the lower court was wrong not
to consider the tapes and overturned its verdict.
	   It's not clear what value the tapes will be in a new trial,
however.
	   Prosecutors themselves did not challenge the lower court's
ruling, saying it was pointless since the tapes did not seem to
prove Aid's involvement.

A profile of the man expected to become Japan's next prime minister
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mr. Ordinary. A soft-spoken master of consensus. In
his own words, ``a noodle shop between two skyscrapers.''
	   Despite cries at home and abroad for bold leadership to tackle
Japan's problems, the ruling party on Friday turned to Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi as its nominee for prime minister, picking an
ultimate party insider who has worked steadily _ and
inconspicuously _ up the ladder of power.
	   The vote Friday put Obuchi, 61, on the brink of becoming premier
of the world's second-largest economy _ a heady promotion for a
politician whose claim to fame until now was announcing the name of
Emperor Akihito's reign when he assumed the throne in 1989.
	   But while other members of the Liberal Democratic Party have
grabbed headlines _ like resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who cultured an image as a tough negotiator _ Obuchi has
worked behind the scenes and by the book.
	   A graduate of Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University, Obuchi won
election to Japan's powerful lower house of Parliament in 1963 at
the age of 26 _ inheriting, in common Japanese fashion, the seat
held previously by his father. He's been elected to the seat 12
times since then.
	   Working his way quickly up the rungs of Japan's power structure,
Obuchi first served as a Cabinet official in 1979, when he was
selected to jointly head the Management and Coordination Agency and
Okinawa Development Agency.
	   In 1993, he became the Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, one
of the three key party posts, under Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. A
year later Obuchi took control of the biggest of several rival
factions in the LDP, succeeding former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
	   He became foreign minister last year. The post is considered a
stepping stone to the premiership.
	   During his rise, Obuchi was never one to stand out.
	   He has even poked fun at his own image, comparing himself to a
small noodle restaurant beside the two towering political figures _
former prime ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and the late Takeo Fukuda
_ from his home prefecture, Gunma, according to the Asahi
newspaper.
	   Though Obuchi's self-effacement and low-key nature as a team
player has paid off in the labyrinth-like power structure of the
LDP, many fear he lacks the forcefulness and innovative talents
needed to tackle Japan's mounting problems.
	   In recent days, he has tried to shake that perception by
attacking bureaucrats' stranglehold on the levers of government and
trumpeting a 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42.7 billion) tax-cut plan.
	   And on Friday, he pointed out that while Hashimoto won headlines
with his friendship with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, it was
Obuchi who was a prime mover in the improved relations with Moscow.
	   Still, he also showed himself the master of the Japanese art of
modesty.
	   ``Just because Keizo Obuchi appears on the stage, it won't
immediately change society,'' he said.

Philippine peso slips slightly after Japanese election; stocks end
</HEADLINE>
mixed

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed slightly
lower against the U.S. dollar Friday, with the local currency
strengthening somewhat in late trading after dips triggered by the
election of Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi as head of Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The dollar averaged 42.124 pesos for the day, up from 42.045
pesos on Thursday.
	   Dealers said expectations that Obuchi would become prime
minister muted the market's initial negative response to the news,
which carried the dollar to its day-high of 42.180 pesos.
	   Later trading, however, saw the yen leading regional currencies
_ including the peso _ slightly higher.
	   The dollar was last traded at 42.105 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said Obuchi's win had already been
largely factored into the market.
	   Comments on prospects for the Philippine economy expected to be
included in next Monday's state-of-the-nation address by newly
elected President Joseph Estrada could also affect the peso.
	   In stock trading, shares ended mixed as some bargain-hunters
picked up a few issues sold down in past sessions while others
continued to unload holdings in the absence of improvements in
regional economic fundamentals, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 2.72 points to
1,680.88, following a 33.59-point, or nearly 2 percent, loss on
Thursday.
	   Gainers, however, lagged behind decliners 25 to 59 while 39
issues were unchanged.
	   The main index had given up a total of 64.49 points over the
previous two trading days following an exodus of foreign portfolio
managers who cleared out their holdings, fearful that it may take
some time before the region's economic prospects improve.
	   ``Surprisingly, we didn't collapse as badly as Wall Street did
overnight. Anyway we've been battered in past trading days
already,'' said Russell Ong, senior analyst for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2.2 percent Thursday in
its fourth straight loss.
	   A one-hour delay in the market's opening Friday because of
computer problems helped cushion what could have been another
free-fall for the market following Wall Street's dismal performance
overnight, Ong said.

Confusion over resumption of talks after Arafat announcement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced Friday that his deputy would hold a series of talks with
an Israeli Cabinet minister, starting next week, and that the two
sides would discuss ``all issues'' on the table.
	   However, Arafat's aides denied that these meetings between
Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani constituted a return to negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   ``I don't know what the president (Arafat) meant by this,'' said
the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. Abbas ``will meet
with Mr. Kahalani. It is not a negotiating meeting on the U.S.
proposals'' for an Israeli troop pullback.
	   ``Mr. Kahalani is not part of the negotiating team and he told
us this,'' Erekat told reporters after Arafat and Kahalani held a
two-hour meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

Mellon Bank takes control of British fund manager Newton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Pounds rate of dlrs 1.63 as used in Mellon's announcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mellon Bank Corp. of Pittsburgh has acquired
control of Newton Management Ltd. in a deal that values the
investment fund manager at 170 million pounds (dlrs 277 million),
the companies announced Friday.
	   Mellon is paying 127.5 million pounds (dlrs 208 million) cash to
the Royal Bank of Scotland and Newton mangers and staff for a 75
percent stake in Newton. The Royal Bank had 33 percent, and the
Newton managers and staff will keep a 25 percent stake.
	   Newton controls funds worth more than 12.5 billion pounds (dlrs
20.4 billion). Mellon will hold its stake in the company through
its subsidiary Dreyfus Inc., a fund manager handling about dlrs 350
billion in assets.
	   Stewart Newton, who founded the company in 1977, will continue
as chairman.
	   ``This acquisition unites Mellon with a leading U.K. investment
management house with a strong reputation and international
investment expertise,'' said Frank Cahouet, Mellon's chairman and
chief executive.
	   ``Mellon's strategy is to seek the highest quality partners
around the world to satisfy investors' rapidly growing demands for
diversifying their investments internationally. Newton is the
cornerstone of this strategy.''

Report: Davis agrees to nine-year, dlrs 56 million contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Terrell Davis, the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player
for the Denver Broncos, has agreed to a nine-year, dlrs 56.1
million contract that will make him the NFL's highest paid running
back, according to a published report.
	   The Denver Post said Friday that Davis will sign the contract
this weekend. The deal includes a dlrs 11 million signing bonus.
	   ``The only thing I can do to celebrate this is go out there and
have a great 1998,'' Davis said Thursday. ``For this deal, that's
the only celebration I want to have.
	   ``This ensures I'm in Denver for the rest of my playing days,
and I've always wanted to be here. I don't want to play for 8
million teams. I want to be on one team, establish myself with one
team, and that's it.
	   ``I'm in Denver. I've enjoyed my stay here and hopefully I'm
going to have another nine years here. One day I want to have my
jersey retired here. When people come to Denver, I want them to
think of me.''
	   Davis, 25, a sixth-round draft pick out of Georgia in 1995, led
the American Football Conference in rushing the last two seasons,
gaining 1,538 yards in 1996 and 1,750 last season. He rushed for
157 yards and three touchdowns in the Broncos' 31-24 Super Bowl
victory over Green Bay.
	   Denver coach Mike Shanahan and Davis' agent, Neil Schwartz,
completed the deal Thursday, with the Broncos tearing up the final
three years of Davis' existing deal. They gave him a 532 percent
pay raise, boosting his annual salary from dlrs 1.17 million to
dlrs 6.34 million.
	   ``It's amazing that there are players like Jim Brown, who made
something like dlrs 85,000 a year and now here it is in 1998 and
you have players making dlrs 5 million or dlrs 6 million a year,''
Davis said. ``It just shows the sign of the times. But these days
there's more money coming into the league, and my deal might be
pretty big right now, but I can assure you in another two or three
years, my deal will just be another pea in the pod.''
	   He said the money won't change his drive to succeed.
	   ``Did Michael Jordan work less hard when he got that dlrs 30
million contract?'' Davis said. `I don't think so. And neither will
I.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The violence-marred campaign for
Cambodia's second election in the post-Khmer Rouge era drew to a
close Friday amid tension and hope, with a main opposition
candidate setting up a confrontation with strongman Hun Sen and
Buddhist monks leading thousands of people in a march for peace.
	   About 100 trucks and hundreds of motorcycles brought 7,000
partisans of dissident Sam Rainsy to a park opposite the National
Assembly for a highly symbolic final campaign rally _ on March 30,
1997, 16 of his supporters were killed and more than 100 were
injured there in a grenade attack widely blamed on Hun Sen.
	   Carried on the shoulders of his bodyguards, Sam Rainsy led a
moment of silence at the rally and threw jasmine petals to his
supporters.
	   They then headed in a convoy out of town toward Takhmau, a
stronghold of the ruling Cambodian People's Party where Hun Sen
lives and is recuperating from an appendectomy. Security forces
were expected to block roads to his home, known as the ``Tiger's
Lair.''
	   Hun Sen has been widely accused of using violence and fear to
ensure he wins Sunday's vote. It comes just over a year after he
deposed his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in fighting in
the capital with tanks, mortars and rockets. The campaign
officially ends Friday, followed by a cooling-off day.
	   ``If the election is reasonably free and fair, the will of the
people will be translated into ballots,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If the
ballots are counted properly, the Sam Rainsy Party will definitely
win. If the CPP wins in a landslide victory, I don't think the will
of the people will have been expressed.''
	   Earlier, Buddhist monks and nuns ended a week-long march from
the countryside, their numbers swelling from 150 to 3,000 as
bystanders joined in Phnom Penh. Banners read: ``The more we fight,
the more we lose,'' and ``We want a non-violent election.''
	   Ranariddh, appearing before about 1,000 people in the port of
Sihanoukville, said he expected his royalist FUNCINPEC party would
carry the country. The prince spoke, sang and danced on the podium
in a festive atmosphere. Then he went swimming in the Gulf of
Thailand. There were no signs of trouble or security forces.
	   ``Within three days, FUNCINPEC will again win all the country,''
Ranariddh said. ``I have no doubt about the outcome.''
	   Phnom Penh has been calm, but an under-current of tension
remains. Many fear that if Hun Sen loses the vote he will use the
army to retain power. Some 95,000 security forces personnel are to
be deployed nationwide Sunday, but many Cambodians may find their
presence more intimidating than comforting.
	   The human-rights group Amnesty International issued a statement
condemning violence and intimidation and said that ``near-silence''
from the international community was perpetuating it.
	   Opposition leaders acknowledge the campaign has been relatively
peaceful compared to 1993, when the Khmer Rouge guerrillas remained
a deadly force and launched attacks against towns and ethnic
Vietnamese villages.
	   The United Nations deployed 20,000 peacekeepers and spent dlrs 3
billion organizing that election, meant to bring peace and
democracy after decades of civil war and the Khmer Rouge regime of
the late 1970s that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people.
	   Ranariddh's party won. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge
regime, forced his way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   This time, Cambodia is organizing the election and the U.N. role
is limited largely to coordinating 678 foreign observers. Hun
Sen-linked organizations have tried to dominate the Cambodian
component of the observation missions. The Cambodian leader has
called the vote in a bid to win back international legitimacy and
aid lost since his coup.
	   The Khmer Rouge are virtually extinct after mass defections over
the past two years. A few hundred die-hard rebels have vowed to
disrupt the polls and attacked an election convoy last week,
killing two people, but thousands more have made peace and will
vote for the first time in their lives.
	   Overall, some 5.4 million people are registered to vote for 122
National Assembly seats.

Vietnam bans import of piranha
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Ministry of Fisheries has put the bite
on piranha, fearing that the sharp-toothed fish could get loose and
wreak havoc in its waterways.
	   A ministry official said Friday that a ban on the import,
breeding and sale of piranha took effect a week ago.
	   ``The ban is necessary, and we don't want to repeat the mistakes
of golden snails,'' the official said, referring to illegal imports
from Taiwan in late 1994 that caused huge damage to rice paddies.
	   Though small in size, with an average weight of 500-600 grams
(about one pound), a school of piranha can attack animals and even
humans.
	   Nguyen Manh Hung, an official at the Ho Chi Minh City-based
Research Institute of Aquaculture No. 2, said the fish was first
brought into the country in late 1996 by travelers who evaded
quarantine and customs officials.
	   They have yet to be sold openly, Hung said, although some
ornamental fish shop owners have been raising them, meaning it
wouldn't be long before they were available.
	   The fish could find their way into the waterway network, Hung
said, adding that the dense river and canal network of the southern
Mekong Delta, the country's main rice-growing region, would be an
ideal habitat.
	   Hung said his institute is coordinating with other departments
to seize the fish, but that has proven to be difficult so far.
	   Piranha are native to South America, especially the Amazon
Valley. Researchers have taken videos showing a large school
stripping a cow to bare bones in a matter of minutes.

	   Earlier this week, Israel and the Palestinians had held three
negotiating sessions at the prodding of the United States which
announced earlier this month that it had exhausted its role as
mediator.
	   After those sessions, the Palestinians said they saw no point in
returning to the table until Israel accepted a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
scope of such a pullback and has demanded stronger guarantees that
the Palestinian will crack down on Islamic militants.
	   However, Netanyahu sent several emissaries to Arafat in the past
three days in hopes of bringing the Palestinians back to the table.
	   On Friday, Arafat received Kahalani, leader of the centrist
Third Way party which has threatened to bolt the coalition and
bring down Netanyahu's government unless agreement was reached soon
on a troop withdrawal.
	   After the meeting, Arafat said: ``We shall resume meeting,
beginning next week, with Abu Mazen (Abbas) and Mr. Kahalani.''
Arafat also said the two sides would discuss ``all issues.''
	   However, Erekat said those meetings would not deal with an
Israeli troop withdrawal, but rather with issues in Kahalani's
jurisdiction, such as free passage of Palestinian workers into
Israel.

	   TARASCON, France (AP) _ Riders refused to start Friday's 12th
stage of the Tour de France, saying the investigation into the use
of performance enhancing drugs was wrecking the sport.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' France's top cyclist Laurent Jalabert told
Radio Tour, the station that follows the race.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone. We won't cycle
and that's the end of it.''
	   Tournament director Jean-Marie Leblanc immediately asked the
sporting directors of competing teams to meet to resolve the
crisis.

Stuttgart orchestra opens Baalbek festival in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ With the panache of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony, the Baalbek festival has opened in eastern Lebanon,
drawing an audience of 2,000 to the country's premier cultural
event.
	   Playing in front of the ancient Roman Temple of Jupiter, the
Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra performed the symphony Thursday
night, under the baton of French conductor Georges Pretre, to
launch what is only the second festival since the end of Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war.
	   Before the war, the annual Baalbek festivals were without
parallel in the Near East, drawing top-flight talent such as the
dancer Rudolf Nureyev, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Paris and
Bolshoi operas, Ella Fitzgerald and the Egyptian singer Umm
Khalthoum.
	   Last year's attempt to revive the festival after 23 years was a
success, but one that lasted only four nights. This festival is
scheduled to play for 14 nights through Aug. 29 and has stirred
memories of Baalbek's former prestige.
	   ``Jupiter revives yesterday's dreams,'' said a headline above a
picture of Stuttgart's 106-musician orchestra in Lebanon's leading
newspaper, An-Nahar, on Friday.
	   In a sign that Lebanon would not allow the violence of the civil
war years to interrupt the festival again, military vehicles and
troops patrolled the streets of Baalbek on Thursday night. The
town, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of the capital Beirut, has
become a stronghold of Muslim fundamentalist parties whose
militants continue to fight Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.
	   Leading performers this year include American jazz pianist
Herbie Hancock, the U.S. jazz singer Nina Simone, and the Lebanese
singer Fairouz _ an enduring symbol of Baalbek's golden years.
	   On Saturday, the American Carl St. Claire is due to conduct the
Stuttgart orchestra through pieces by Gershwin, Stravinsky and
Ravel.
	   On its last two nights, the festival will stage a multi-media
spectacle by Urban Sax and Fire Organ with dancers flitting across
the temple's paving stones and climbers scaling the columns.

Chechens search for bombers who tried to kill president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen authorities hunted for the bombers who
tried to kill the republic's president, and one former Chechen
leader cleared his name Friday after appearing in the territory's
Islamic courts.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov, who survived a car bombing Thursday
with only minor bruises, said the Russian secret services or
Chechen warlords were responsible for the bombing that left two
presidential bodyguards dead.
	   Maskhadov also called on former Chechen leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev and two other opponents to swear an oath on the Muslim
holy book, the Koran, that they had nothing to do with the attack.
	   Yandarbiyev showed up Friday in the Islamic law court,
accompanied by bodyguards, and said he was ready to proclaim his
innocence ``one thousand times.''
	   Maskhadov's representatives said they were satisfied, and the
court cleared Yandarbiyev without requiring him to take the actual
oath, Russian news agencies reported.
	   However, two warlords associated with Islamic fundamentalists
failed to heed the president's call and did not show up in court.
	   Yandarbiyev said he was convinced that the Russian special
services were behind the bombing and accused them of fomenting
tension between Maskhadov and his opponents in Chechnya.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service on Thursday denied that they
were involved.
	   Chechnya remains unstable despite the end of the 1994-6 war with
Russia, and tensions have been rising in recent weeks as Maskhadov
cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists linked to the Wahhabi
movement.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday sent Maskhadov a
telegram expressing ``deep concern and outrage'' over the attempt
on his life.
	   Following the attack, Chechen officials banned the broadcast of
Russian television channels in the republic, accusing them of
distorted coverage.
	   Earlier this week, Maskhadov suspended broadcasts of Chechnya's
numerous private television channels, some of which are controlled
by rivals.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory last year, but has
been unable to contain the soaring crime or improve the republic's
economy, which was ruined by the war.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew at the end of 1996, but no one has recognized its
independence bid and Moscow insists that the territory remains part
of Russia.

Thailand presses for more open, human-oriented ASEAN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-112
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ If Southeast Asian nations do not
speak more frankly about social unrest, human rights, and
environmental issues, they will lose credibility with the
international community, Thailand's foreign minister said Friday,
urging his regional colleagues to adopt a new vision for a more
complex world.
	   Supported only by the Philippines, which is hosting the annual
meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan challenged the
group's 31-year-old policy of never publicly criticizing member
states' internal politics.
	   ``Like it or not, the issues of democracy and human rights are
those that we have to increasingly deal with in our engagement with
the outside world,'' Surin said. ``The only way we can respond to
the critics and prove them wrong is by moving ASEAN into a higher
gear of regionalism on a higher plane of regional cooperation.''
	   Formed in 1967 as a bulwark against communism, ASEAN has had
remarkable success in preventing armed conflict among most of its
members. Staunch supporters of the group's policies of consensus
and non-interference credit the hands-off approach with maintaining
the peace and helping the group grow into a cooperative trade
association.
	   But Surin argued that war is no longer Southeast Asia's main
security threat. ``Instead of armed aggression and conflict,
pressing challenges in the form of economic disruptions and
transnational problems such as illicit drugs, international crime
and environmental degradation will become more prominent,'' he said
to a roomful of government officials, many from states ruled by one
party.
	   Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon said
ASEAN should be able to speak more freely on issues in one member
country that affect others. ``For a stronger ASEAN, we need to
think, talk and act regionally, even and particularly, on thorny
issues,'' he said.
	   Thai and Philippine officials said the discussion itself will
lead to more openness. But it may not get much of a push next year
when Singapore, ruled by an authoritarian party for 34 years, takes
over the ASEAN chairmanship.
	   Singapore's foreign minister, Shanmugam Jayakumar, opposed more
public outspokenness. Because of vast differences in culture, race,
religion, language and forms of government among the nine ASEAN
nations, ``internal political developments will remain a
particularly sensitive area that could set off centrifugal forces
that could pull ASEAN apart,'' Jayakumar said.
	   While opposing a change in the non-interference policy,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters that because
of growing awareness that the region's economic crisis and
pollution problems extend across borders, the foreign ministers had
agreed to ``enhance their interaction.''
	   The group, which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, began to
stretch its non-intervention policy last year when it postponed
Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup led by co-premier
Hun Sen.
	   Since then ASEAN has urged the Cambodian government to normalize
politics by holding elections which are scheduled for July 26 _
during the ASEAN meetings.

Asian stock markets close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, with both share prices and the Japanese currency
rebounding in Tokyo.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 173.88 points, or
1.07 percent, closing the week at 16,361.89 points. On Thursday,
the Nikkei closed down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   Buying by pension funds and foreign brokerages in the afternoon
wiped out early losses following an overnight sharp drop on Wall
Street and continued worries over Moody's Investors Service's
announcement Thursday that it was considering downgrading the
rating of Japan's national debt.
	   After the stock market was closed, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
won the nomination of Japan's ruling party for prime minister, as
widely expected.
	   The LDP leader is virtually assured of becoming prime minister
as the party controls Parliament's powerful lower house. The
election to decide a new premier is scheduled for July 30.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 140.54 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 1.14 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York rate of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   Hong Kong share prices closed generally higher, boosted by the
easing of political uncertainty in Japan after the naming of a new
ruling party leader.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 81.21 points, or 1.0 percent, closing at 8,257.46.
On Thursday, the index had slumped 244.47 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower, but rebounded in the
afternoon following news from Japan that Obuchi won the vote as
president of the ruling party.
	   Obuchi has promised to boost Japan's faltering economy.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher, boosted by stronger
regional markets. The Composite Index rose 5.758 points, or 1.2
percent, to 479.563.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher following an announcement
that government-backed banks Development Bank of Singapore and
POSBank would merge, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index rose 8.10 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,070.36.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares prices closed slightly higher.
The key Composite Index rose 3.00 points, or 0.7 percent, to
418.40.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) index fell 0.76 point to close at 275.44.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher after four days of
declines. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 22.51
points, or 0.28 percent, to 7,902.40.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 20.20 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,113.55.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected issues rose 2.72 points, or 0.1
percent, to 1,680.88.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 3.2 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,745.5.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed, with the key index rising on
selective bargain-hunting. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 2.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 343.79.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced Friday that his deputy would hold a series of talks with
an Israeli Cabinet minister, starting next week, and that the two
sides would discuss ``all issues'' on the table.
	   However, Arafat's aides denied that these meetings between
Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani constituted a return to negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   ``I don't know what the president (Arafat) meant by this,'' said
the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. Abbas ``will meet
with Mr. Kahalani. It is not a negotiating meeting on the U.S.
proposals'' for an Israeli troop pullback.
	   ``Mr. Kahalani is not part of the negotiating team and he told
us this,'' Erekat told reporters after Arafat and Kahalani held a
two-hour meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced Friday that his deputy would hold a series of talks with
an Israeli Cabinet minister, starting next week, and that the two
sides would discuss ``all issues'' on the table.
	   However, Arafat's aides denied that these meetings between
Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani constituted a return to negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the occupied West Bank.
	   ``I don't know what the president (Arafat) meant by this,'' said
the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. Abbas ``will meet
with Mr. Kahalani. It is not a negotiating meeting on the U.S.
proposals'' for an Israeli troop pullback.
	   ``Mr. Kahalani is not part of the negotiating team, and he told
us this,'' Erekat told reporters after Arafat and Kahalani held a
two-hour meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Earlier this week, Israel and the Palestinians held three
negotiating sessions at the prodding of the United States, which
announced earlier this month that it had exhausted its role as
mediator.
	   After those sessions, the Palestinians said they saw no point in
returning to the table until Israel accepted a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
scope of such a pullback and has demanded stronger guarantees that
the Palestinians will crack down on Islamic militants.
	   However, Netanyahu sent several emissaries to Arafat during the
past three days in hopes of bringing the Palestinians back to the
table.
	   On Friday, Arafat received Kahalani, leader of the centrist
Third Way party, which has threatened to bolt the coalition and
bring down Netanyahu's government unless agreement was reached soon
on a troop withdrawal.
	   After the meeting, Arafat said: ``We shall resume meeting,
beginning next week, with Abu Mazen (Abbas) and Mr. Kahalani.''
Arafat also said the two sides would discuss ``all issues.''
	   However, Erekat said those meetings would not deal with an
Israeli troop withdrawal, but rather with issues in Kahalani's
jurisdiction, such as free passage of Palestinian workers into
Israel.

British Telecom buys stake in big Malaysian company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new figures, quotes and details.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ British Telecommunications Friday
signed an agreement to buy a 33-percent stake in Malaysia's leading
private telecommunications company.
	   The agreement formalizing the partnership and the acquisition
into Binariang for about 1.8 billion ringgit (dlrs 450,000) was
signed by Jamaludin Ibrahim, chief executive of the Malaysian
company, Asia-Pacific head of British Telecom, Richard Slogrove and
two other officials.
	   ``This is the largest equity investment we have made in Asia to
date,'' Slogrove said. He expressed hope that BT's commitment would
encourage other companies to invest more in Asia.
	   Binariang operates subsidiary companies that provide fixed,
mobile and international gateway services in Malaysia under the
brand name MAXIS. The mobile phone company has 450,000 customers, a
company statement said.
	   British Telecom's investment would help Binariang upgrade its
telecommunications technology, Jamaludin said.
	   The agreement was signed in the presence of Malaysia's Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The deal is part of a larger plan by Binariang to raise roughly
4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) through links with overseas
groups and debt securities, executives said.
	   The economic crisis that is pushing Malaysia into recession has
made it difficult for companies to raise money by issuing public
shares.
	   Eighty percent of the Malaysian telecommunications company is
currently controlled by Malaysian groups. The remainder is held by
U.S. West International, a unit of the Denver-based telephone
holding company U.S. West Inc.
	   Apart from British Telecommunications, Binariang has been linked
to other companies recently, among them Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd., NTT and Cable and Wireless PLC.

Nokia's profit, net sales continue to surge in first half
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish telecommunications group Nokia
on Friday reported a pretax profit of 5.55 billion markkaa (dlrs
1.02 billion) for the first six months of the year, up 66 percent
compared with the same period in 1997.
	   Net sales were also up, by more than 36 percent, to 33.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 6.16 billion), the company said.
	   ``In our network business, strong growth of sales and the
healthy order inflow development continued,'' said Nokia's
president Jorma Ollila.
	   ``We were able to win several new customers, but equally
importantly, many existing customers were conducting sizeable
network expansion investments,'' Ollila said. ``In addition, the
rapid digitalization of markets in the Americas, especially in the
United States, strengthened our market position.''
	   The mobile phones division, which had disappointing growth
during the last quarter of 1997, increased its sales the most
during this year's second quarter, by about 50 percent, the company
said.
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. Its
total sales encompass 130 countries.
	   Nokia's main market is the United States, followed by Britain,
Germany and China. It employs 41,000 people worldwide.
	   Nokia's total pretax profit last year more than doubled to a
record 8.37 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion).

Heat wave kills five people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Five people have died in a heat wave
in northwestern Transylvania and dozens have been hospitalized
after fainting in the streets, Romanian newspapers reported Friday.
	   ``Until now, we have hospitalized old people, but more and more
young people are brought in here,'' Nicolae Rosioru, a hospital
doctor in the town of Slobozia told the daily Adevarul.
	   Temperatures have reached up to 30 degrees centigrade (102 F).
	   Five people suffered heart attacks this week in the city of Satu
Mare, 425 kilometers (266 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   In Bucharest, around 20 people were sent to hospital Thursday
after fainting, the Rompres news agency reported.
	   Authorities urged people in TV broadcasts and in newspapers to
drink sufficiently and told elderly people to remain indoors.
	   Cornel Pop, the head of the National Institute of Meteorology,
said by telephone that there would be no letup in the heat wave
over the next few days.

President bars tax authorities from unscheduled inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a decree
barring tax authorities from arbitrary inspections of private
businesses, a news report said Friday.
	   The decree, issued Thursday, permits tax authorities and other
government agencies to inspect a private enterprise only once a
year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Entrepreneurs are to be notified about an upcoming inspection at
least 10 days in advance.
	   At present, tax authorities and other agencies may arbitrarily
decide when to check private businesses, and do not have to notify
businessmen in advance.
	   Many businessmen complain that such inspections are used as a
method of pressuring them into paying bribes. Kuchma's decree takes
effect in 30 days, unless overturned by parliament.

	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France (AP) _ Riders refused to start
Friday's 12th stage of the Tour de France, saying the investigation
into the use of performance enhancing drugs was wrecking the sport.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' the world's No. 1 cyclist Laurent Jalabert
told Radio Tour, the station that follows the race.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone. We won't cycle
and that's the end of it.''
	   However, Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc indicated the riders
would do the stage, 222 kms (138 miles) from Tarascon to Le Cap
d'Agde, but start late.
	   Leblanc called an urgent meeting with the sporting directors of
competing teams to resolve the crisis, which grew out of the
mounting doping scandal that has haunted the Tour since its July 11
in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Three members of the Festina team, expelled from the Tour last
week, admitted to police that they took drugs to improve their
performances, according to LCI news television.
	   ``Yes, I said I took EPO, how I took it, why I took it and all
that,'' said Swiss rider for Festina, Armin Meier, in an interview
with France Info radio.
	   Most Festina riders were still being held for questioning, as
three of the team officials met Friday before a judge in Lyon.
	   And in a new chapter to the unfolding drama, officials from the
Dutch TVM team were called on the carpet on Thursday for alleged
doping within the team.
	   The influential daily Le Monde called on Friday for an end to
this year's race, contending authorities need to get to the bottom
of their investigation.
	   ``Who, from now on, could rejoice in seeing the rest of a
compromised pack enter Paris on Sunday, Aug. 2? Who would have the
heart to applaud the winner of a race without faith or law?,'' the
paper said in a commentary.
	   Jan Ullrich held a 71-second lead over American Bobby Julich
heading into Friday's stage. The Tour is slowly making its way
across southern France before hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   The German held onto the yellow jersey. He began the race July
11 as the defending champion but lost it for a week before gaining
it back after Saturday's time trial and the first mountain stage on
Tuesday.
	   TVM entered the spotlight earlier this week when it emerged that
the substance EPO had been found in the car of one of its officials
in March.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 jet fighter overshot the runway at an
airport in northern Japan on Friday and burst into flames, injuring
an American pilot, the U.S. military said.
	   The pilot, 1st Lt. Melvin B. Simpson from the 35th Fighter Wing
at Misawa, suffered burns in the accident, which occurred at around
9:05 a.m. (0005 GMT), Misawa Air Base's public affairs office said
in a release.
	   Simpson was first taken to a base hospital for treatment and
then transferred to a hospital in Hachinohe, a city near Misawa,
the release said.
	   The extent of the pilot's burns and his hometown were not
immediately available, a base spokeswomen said.
	   The accident occurred during take-off as part of flight
training, the release said.
	   Koji Mori, spokesman of the local Japanese Air Self-Defense
Force base, said airport fire fighters quickly extinguished the
flames.
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation, the release
said.
	   The Misawa airport, which is jointly used by the U.S. Air Force,
Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and Japan Air Systems, a Japanese
commercial airline, was closed after the mishap, Mori said.
	   The airport, located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, has a single runway.
	   In a separate incident, at least one Marine was injured in a
failed helicopter landing at a U.S. Marine Corps base Thursday on
Japan's southern island of Okinawa, Japanese defense officials said
Friday.
	   The UH1N helicopter was destroyed after failing to land on a
helipad at Camp Hansen at around noon Thursday, the Naha Defense
Facilities Agency said.
	   It was not until five hours after the accident that the U.S.
Marine Corps notified the Japanese defense officials, an agency
spokesman said, adding Japanese officials were given no further
details from the U.S. side.
	   Marine Corps officials were not immediately available for
comment.

Charles exhibits art of over 400 years of princes of Wales

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ A portrait of Princess Diana in her
wedding dress, never before seen in public, is among the items that
Prince Charles has lent for an historic exhibition of art amassed
by the princes of Wales.
	   So, too, is a sketch of the Spice Girls.
	   Until now, only members of the royal family and their servants
had seen all of the works, some of which date back to the 16th
century.
	   From the poetic to the prosaic, more than 300 paintings,
drawings and other artworks and crafts collected by Charles, the
current Prince of Wales, and four of his ancestors now fill several
rooms at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff.
	   ``Works from the royal collection are always on view somewhere
at home and abroad, but this is the first time the collections of
the princes of Wales have been selected for display,'' said Dickie
Arbiter, director of media affairs at Buckingham Palace, speaking
at a preview on Thursday.
	   The collection includes drawings of the Tudor court by Hans
Holbein, paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn and Sir Anthony van Dyck,
a Sevres porcelain service made for the guillotined King Louis XVI
of France and a couple of modern garden seats in teak designed by
Leon Krier, Charles' favorite architect.
	   At one end of the display is an engraved and gilded suit of
tournament armor fashioned for Prince Henry, who died in 1610 of
typhoid at age 16 and never reached the throne.
	   At the opposite end is a portrait of Princess Diana, who posed
at Kensington Palace in her wedding dress in 1984, three years
after her wedding, for artist John Ward. The picture has never been
shown before in public.
	   A Carl Faberge cigarette case in old enamel, adorned with a
snake made of rose diamonds, recalls a notorious adulterous affair
by another prince of Wales.
	   Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII, was given the
Russian-made case 1895 by a mistress, Alice Keppel. (Camilla Parker
Bowles, longtime companion of Prince Charles, is a
great-granddaughter of Mrs. Keppel).
	   When Edward died in 1910, his widow, Queen Alexandra _ much
admired for tolerating his dalliances_ gave the case back to Mrs.
Keppel as a memento.
	   In 1936, Mrs. Keppel returned it to the royal family, who have
kept it ever since. For the past 100 years, the royals have
collected Faberge items, out of an interest sparked by that
original gift.
	   The ``Princes as Patrons'' exhibition is on public view from
Saturday through Nov. 8 and won't be shown anywhere else. Prince
Charles was scheduled to open it Friday night.
	   The exhibition covers just five princes of Wales although nearly
a score have held the title since the last prince of Welsh blood,
Llewelyn ap Griffith, was slain after a battle in 1282 that
completed England's conquest of Wales.
	   The earlier princes never collected art, and not all the later
ones were keen on it. For example, there is nothing owned by
Charles' predecessor as Prince of Wales, the late Duke of Windsor,
who abdicated in 1936 within a year of acceding to the throne as
King Edward VIII.
	   Prince Charles explains in the catalogue that he chose only the
four other princes who were ``most active as patrons and
collectors.''
	   He said his personal collection can't compete with theirs but
adds: ``I do share with my four predecessors the passion and
excitement of discovering the work of artists and craftsmen.''
	   Besides Henry, Edward and Charles, the show includes works owned
by the eldest son of King George II, Frederick Louis, whose parents
detested him for supporting opposition politicians and banished him
from court. The other royal figuring in the show is Frederick's
grandson, George Augustus, who became King George IV and is revered
as the greatest of the princely collectors.
	   The show includes many of the contemporary paintings, drawings
and sculptures that Charles enjoys. A keen watercolorist himself,
he often takes artists with him on his travels.
	   One exhibit with a tantalizing title is ``The Spice Girls in
Concert in aid of the Nations Trust, Johannesburg 1997.''
	   But it's a letdown _ just a small sketch by Robert Wraith in
which the famous five divas, before they were four, appear as mere
squiggles on a distant stage.

New government may raise some taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The newly appointed Social
Democratic government is thinking of a tax hike just a day after
being sworn in.
	   The move runs counter to campaign statements before last month's
elections, when the Social Democrats said they would consider
running a budget deficit to pay for increased social spending and
public works projects.
	   Now the government says the budget must be balanced and tax
increases are the way to do it.
	   ``My goal is to work out ... a balanced budget if possible,''
the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes on Friday quoted Finance Minister Ivo
Svoboda as saying.
	   Svoboda said that to reach that goal some consumer taxes and
social insurance _ pension and unemployment insurance payments _
will have to be raised. He did not name figures. But Labor Minister
Vladimir Spidla told the Hospodarske Noviny daily that social
insurance could be raised by as much as 1.5 percent.
	   He did not say how the increase would be split between employers
and employees. The employer now pays the equivalent of 26 percent
of an employee's gross salary in social insurance, and the employee
8 percent.
	   It is expected that consumer taxes would be raised on cigarettes
and gasoline.

Confusion over resumption of talks after Arafat announcement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
announced Friday that his deputy would hold a series of talks with
an Israeli Cabinet minister, starting next week, and that the two
sides would discuss ``all issues'' on the table.
	   However, Arafat's aides denied that these meetings between
Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani constituted a return to negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   ``I don't know what the president (Arafat) meant by this,'' said
the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. Abbas ``will meet
with Mr. Kahalani. It is not a negotiating meeting on the U.S.
proposals'' for an Israeli troop pullback.
	   ``Mr. Kahalani is not part of the negotiating team and he told
us this,'' Erekat told reporters after Arafat and Kahalani held a
two-hour meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Earlier this week, Israel and the Palestinians had held three
negotiating sessions at the prodding of the United States which
announced earlier this month that it had exhausted its role as
mediator.
	   After those sessions, the Palestinians said they saw no point in
returning to the table until Israel accepted a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
scope of such a pullback and has demanded stronger guarantees that
the Palestinian will crack down on Islamic militants.
	   However, Netanyahu sent several emissaries to Arafat in the past
three days in hopes of bringing the Palestinians back to the table.
	   On Friday, Arafat received Kahalani, leader of the centrist
Third Way party which has threatened to bolt the coalition and
bring down Netanyahu's government unless agreement was reached soon
on a troop withdrawal.
	   After the meeting, Arafat said: ``We shall resume meeting,
beginning next week, with Abu Mazen (Abbas) and Mr. Kahalani.''
Arafat also said the two sides would discuss ``all issues.''
	   However, Erekat said those meetings would not deal with an
Israeli troop withdrawal, but rather with issues in Kahalani's
jurisdiction, such as free passage of Palestinian workers into
Israel.

Rwanda's Army says it killed top rebel commanders

	   GICIYE, Rwanda (AP) _ In a blow to an insurgency in Rwanda, the
army said it has killed two top rebel commanders believed
responsible for organizing attacks in which thousands of civilians
died.
	   The bloody body of Lt. Col. Leonard Nkundiye, a one-time
military advisor to former Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, was
placed on public display in Giciye, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Kigali, after he was shot to death in a battle early
Thursday.
	   ``He's a big fish,'' army commander Lt. Col. Mushyo Kamanzi
said. ``Getting him was a big achievement.''
	   Army officials said troops also killed Nkundiye's aide, Lt. Col.
Rwarakabije and at least 200 rebels. Both officers were described
as leaders of the Hutu rebel movement.
	   An undetermined number of fighters surrendered, officials said.
	   Nkundiye, a bearded man in his mid-40s and dressed in civilian
clothes, was shot in the neck. His bodyguard, who was wounded in
the leg, shot himself to death to avoid being captured, officials
said.
	   About 300 army troops battled Nkundiye's group in the hills
bordering the Congo, where rebels easily cross in and out of
Rwanda, said Kamanzi.
	   Nkundiye was believed to be a spokesman for the shadowy rebel
group which calls itself ALIR, or the Rwandan Liberation Army, and
claims to be fighting against what they say is the Tutsi occupation
of Rwanda.
	   His death is a serious blow to the two-year rebellion, Kamanzi
said. It also marks a rare occasion that a rebel leader has been
identified.
	   Little is publicly known about the rebel organization.
	   Nkundiye once served as Habyarimana's military aide and head of
his Presidential Guard, which was responsible for some of the worst
atrocities during a 1994 genocide, when Hutu soldiers and
militiamen hacked to death or shot more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killings ended when Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994. Nkundiye fled to neighboring Zaire, since
renamed Congo, along with more than 1 million defeated Hutu
soldiers, officers and militiamen mixed in with ordinary civilians.
	   The rebels used the refugee camps to launch attacks against
Rwanda's new government until November 1996, when the
Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels destroyed the camps and sent most
of refugees _ and the rebels _ back to Rwanda.
	   Since then, thousands of people _ Hutus and Tutsis _ have died
in rebel attacks on schools, bars, buses and homes.
	   Kamanzi, speaking in his hilltop army camp, said his troops had
been monitoring Nkundiye's movement in the northwestern forests,
which was also the rebel chief's home area.

Farmers in Laos province facing severe drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Farmers in the Saysettha district of
Attopeu province in Laos are facing a drought that is expected to
become severe, Laos government radio said Friday.
	   Saysettha is a rice farming area, but farmers have been able to
cultivate only about 20 percent of their land because of water
shortages, the government said.
	   Rice seedling plots have been drying up and plants have withered
and died.
	   District authorities are attempting to find solutions to the
problems and are urging farmers to grow dry season crops where
possible.
	   Meanwhile, the Vice Minister of Agriculture Sitaheng Rassaphon
told a seminar in Vientiane that although the agricultural sector
has made significant gains it needs to do more to solve problems in
food stuff production and alleviating poverty in the country,
government radio said.
	   He said there were weaknesses in translating government policy
into detailed programs and projects in agricultural areas.
	   He said that slash and burn farming should be terminated.
	   At least 80 percent of Laotians are farmers.

Senior Chinese negotiator visits Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A senior Chinese official arrived Friday
to arrange for the first meeting in five years between the two
sides' top negotiators, a sign of warming relations across the
Taiwan Strait.
	   Li Yafei, deputy secretary general of the Association of
Relations across the Taiwan Strait, said he will meet his Taiwanese
counterpart, Jan Jyh-horng, for ``informal discussions'' on
resuming dialogue to end a three-year deadlock.
	   Li said the two also will discuss the planned visit to China by
Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation.
	   The two semi-official groups handle exchanges in the absence of
official ties.
	   Koo has said he hopes to visit China in September to meet his
counterpart, Wang Daohan. The two men last met in Singapore in 1993
in the first open dialogue between Taiwan and China since they
split politically in 1949.
	   Koo has said the planned meeting is intended to help usher in a
second summit, and nothing substantive will be discussed.
	   Regular dialogue has been suspended since 1995 because of
China's anger over a Taiwanese campaign to raise its international
profile. China considers Taiwan a rebel province with no right to
its own foreign relations.
	   The two sides have moved slowly to resume dialogue because of
lingering disputes over whether sensitive political issues should
be discussed.
	   Taiwan wants the dialogue to pick up where it left off by
focusing on practical matters such as trade and fishing disputes.
But officials have also indicated Taiwan is prepared for gradually
moving toward political dialogue.
	   Li arrived as a member of a delegation of high school tutors
from Beijing. During the eight-day visit, he also will meet with
Liang Su-jung, head of the Association for the Promotion of
Peaceful Reunification, a private group of retired officials and
politicians.

Protesters demand convicted mayor's execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian militants called for the execution
of Tehran's mayor Friday, a day after he was sentenced to five
years in prison for corruption.
	   About 100 members of the Ansar'e Hezbollah, a Muslim
fundamentalist group allied to hard-liners in the ruling hierarchy,
chanted slogans against the popular mayor outside Tehran
University.
	   ``Death to the plundering mayor! Death to the traitor,'' the
protesters chanted, led by a van mounted with loudspeakers.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi was convicted of corruption Thursday
after a month-long trial that was viewed as part of power struggle
between hard-liners and a reformist camp around President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   Karbaschi was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, fined the
equivalent of dlrs 330,000 and barred from holding public office
for 20 years.
	   His lawyer says he will appeal the verdict.
	   Karbaschi, who denied stealing city council money, had denounced
the trial as politically motivated. He was a close ally of Khatami
and manager of the moderate president's 1997 election campaign.
	   As mayor for eight years, he was widely respected for his
efforts to improve the city, building roads and parks and reducing
pollution.
	   Before Friday's protest, a senior hard-line cleric told
congregants at the university's prayer service that it was time to
put the trial to behind them.
	   ``I'm gratified that this court case, which had started with
such controversy, ended calmly,'' said Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati,
head of the Guardian Council, which monitors parliament.
	   The arrest of Karbaschi in April sparked riots in Tehran. The
court proceedings were closely reported in the media and widely
discussed.
	   ``Everyone, the people and officials, should avoid creating
tensions now that this trial is over,'' Jannati said.
	   Most people leaving the campus after the prayers ignored the
chanting protesters outside.

FINA suspends four Chinese swimmers for two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The governing body of world
swimming Friday handed four Chinese swimmers two-year suspensions
after they tested positive for banned substances in the World
Swimming Championships in January.
	   The FINA doping panel, in a brief statement, said the
suspensions went into force immediately. A temporary suspension
period, which was in force from Jan. 14 until April 25, will be
deducted from the two-year total, FINA said.
	   At the worlds in Perth, Australia, the three Chinese women _
Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _ and male teammate Wang Wei
tested positive for triamterene, a banned diuretic which can be
used to mask the use of anabolic steroids.
	   The decision came on a day when the doping panel was also
expected to rule on the case of Irish triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith.
	   Smith faced a possible life ban on charges of tampering with a
urine sample. She was charged with manipulating an
out-of-competition drug test on Jan. 10 by adulterating her sample
with alcohol.

Five regions in northeastern Somalia form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Delegates from five regions in
northeastern Somalia have agreed to form a joint administration and
elected a president and a vice president, a spokesman said Friday.
	   The decision was taken Thursday at the end of a conference that
began May 15 and was attended by 448 delegates, said Awad A.
Ashara, who chaired the talks.
	   Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was elected president and Mohamed Abdi
Hashi vice president of what they called the Puntland State of
Somalia, Ashara said by satellite telephone from Garoe, capital of
Nugaal region, 720 kilometers (446 miles) north of Mogadishu.
	   Ashara said Hashi was mandated by the delegates to form a
nine-member Cabinet.
	   Punt is the name ancient Egyptians and Greeks gave to the land
along the southern coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that
is a major source of frankinsense.
	   Ashara said the five regions making up the new administration
group are Bari, Nugaal, Sanaag, Mudug and Galguduud.
	   Ashara said Puntland State was not seceding from Somalia and
would wait for the southern region to establish an administration
``and then we can discuss forming a Federal Republic of Somalia.''
	   Somalia has had no government since clan-based faction leaders
joined to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.
	   But the leaders then turned on each other, and the country
disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by clan militia.
	   Northwestern Somalia seceded months after Siad Barre's ouster
and proclaimed itself the Republic of Somaliland. Although it has
not been internationally recognized, Somaliland has shown no desire
to rejoin the rest of Somalia.
	   It was immediately impossible to ascertain what effect the
creation of the Puntland administration would have on a December
agreement by 24 Somali factions to name a government of transition
and hold a national reconciliation conference.
	   Originally scheduled for mid-February in the western town of
Baidoa, the conference has been postponed several times.
	   And after what appeared to be a promising start at reunification
of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and the re-opening of the city's
port and airport, renewed factional fighting has broken out as
dissidents in the northern half of the city fight warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohamed for a share of the spoils.

Thai prime minister tightens leash on military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
tightened his leash on the Thai military by unveiling a
restructuring plan for the armed forces that gives more control to
a civilian, local media reported Friday.
	   The plan cuts the number of generals by 25 percent, increases
the number of reservists as opposed to active troops and transfers
some work done by the military to the private sector, the Bangkok
Post reported.
	   More importantly, it changes the power structure of the
military. Instead of reporting directly to the defense minister,
the supreme commander will report to the ministry's permanent
secretary, a civilian bureaucrat, who will also have more
responsibility for arms procurement and budgets, widely regarded as
areas where graft and corruption are rife.
	   Chuan also holds the post of defense minister, the first
civilian to do so in more than 20 years. Any moves to rein in
Thailand's military have always been regarded as dangerous because
the armed forces have staged more than a dozen coups since the end
of World War II.
	   Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro has pledged to
make Thailand's military more professional and has said the days of
coups are over. Nonetheless, he and other armed forces leaders
appeared grim as Chuan announced the plan at a press conference on
Thursday.
	   Chetta is set to retire later this year and behind-the-scenes
maneuverings over who will succeed him have also raised tensions
between Chuan and the top brass, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   Among the possible candidates is Gen. Chainarong Noonpakdi, who
allegedly was the field commander who ordered troops to fire on
unarmed democracy demonstrators in Bangkok in May 1992, killing at
least 40 and wounding more than a hundred.
	   Chainarong would be an unacceptable candidate to Chuan.
	   The top generals usually decide on promotions and choose their
successors. Occasionally, a defense minister will alter their
choices, but that is rare.
	   Supreme Commander Mongkol Amornpisit has already been quoted in
local papers saying he hopes Chuan won't interfere in the military
reshuffle.
	   But a general on Chuan's staff was quoted in the Post as saying
``Prime Minister Chuan is not a rubber stamp.''
	   Under repeated questioning by a reporter at Thursday's press
conference about whether or not he would alter the reshuffle list
if it displeased him, Chuan insisted that approving or changing the
list if need be is, and always has been, part of the defense
minister's job.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a victory for Japan's political old guard over
dissident lawmakers, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi won the vote for
ruling party president Friday. The win all but clinches Obuchi's
campaign for prime minister but dims hopes of drastic action to fix
Japan's troubled economy. Obuchi, a party stalwart with a long and
conventional career in government, snared 225 of the 411 votes cast
in a first ballot. Parliament is expected to make it official with
a vote Thursday. Obuchi tried to reassure both the Japanese and
international community after Friday's vote. ``The key issue at the
moment is to repair Japan's economy, fulfill our expected role in
the international community and ease the public's uncertainty about
the future,'' Obuchi told reporters. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)_ A sometimes-violent campaign in
Cambodia's second election of the post-Khmer Rouge era ended
tensely Friday, with Buddhist monks leading thousands in a march
imploring Cambodians for a peaceful vote Sunday. Strongman Hun Sen
has been widely accused of using violence and fear to ensure he
wins. The vote comes just over a year after he deposed his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in fighting in the capital
with tanks, mortars and rockets. Hun Sen, Ranariddh and dissident
leader Sam Rainsy are competing for control of the country. If Hun
Sen's party claims a landslide victory, Rainsey said, ``I don't
think the will of the people will have been expressed.''
(CAMBODIA-ELECTION).
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The European Union plans a peace
mission to Kosovo next week, but the United States is warning that
armed intervention to stop the killing there remains an option.
Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, said
Washington has not ``ruled out'' unilateral military force or
participating in a NATO plan for action. ``We are prepared to act
alone if necessary,'' he said. His words came the same day the
European Union announced the peace mission to the Serb province.
Despite the tough talk, the United States still is pushing for a
negotiated end to the conflict between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A Secret Service officer has told a grand jury
that he and the deputy chief of staff found President Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky alone in a room in the White House, a
government official says. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Secret Service officer and Harold Ickes did not
find Clinton and the former White House intern engaged in any
improper behavior. The officer's account, if accurate, would add a
White House aide as witness to a Clinton-Lewinsky meeting alone.
Prosecutor Kenneth Starr is trying to determine whether Clinton had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, lied about it under oath and attempted
to cover it up. Clinton has denied having sexual relations with
her. (US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)

Passengers, crew rescued from stranded tourist ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ All 89 tourists and crew members were
rescued from a ship that ran aground and began taking on water in
Croatia's northern Adriatic Sea, media reported Friday.
	   Rescue teams came within minutes after receiving a mayday signal
Thursday from the Iris, which carries tourists from Porec in
Istria, Croatia's northern peninsula, to Venice in nearby Italy,
the Slobodna Dalmacija daily said.
	   The accident happened just a few miles from Porec.
	   The tourists, mostly foreigners from Slovakia, Germany and other
European countries, were transported from the ship, which began
sinking after it hit a shallow.
	   Media reports did not say how serious the leak was, but the
Slobodna Dalmacija said the crew had not prepared lifeboats to
evacuate the ship, which can carry 360 passengers.
	   It was not immediately clear what caused the accident. The
Croatian company that owns the ship, Kvarner Express, refused to
comment. A police investigation is ongoing.

China congratulates Japan's Obuchi, calls for stronger trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China congratulated Keizo Obuchi on his election
as head of Japan's ruling party Friday and appealed to him to
strengthen often shaky relations between the two nations.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang noted that as
foreign minister, Obuchi ``has with care and great effort strived
to develop China-Japan relations.''
	   Now as head of the Liberal Democratic Party and all but certain
to be named prime minister, ``we hope that Mr. Obuchi will continue
making contributions to the healthy and stable development of
Chinese-Japanese relations,'' Tang said in a statement.
	   The change in Japanese leaders came at an awkward time for
China. Chinese President Jiang Zemin was expecting to go to Japan
this fall for a summit with Obuchi's predecessor. Japan's weakening
economy has threatened one of China's biggest markets and
investors.
	   Beijing is anxious for Japan to halt a dip in imports and shore
up the sagging yen, a senior trade official said.
	   Joint efforts are needed to overcome ``difficulties'' in
bilateral trade resulting from the yen's devaluation, trade
ministry spokesman Hu Zhaoqing was quoted by the official Xinhua
News Agency as saying.
	   As foreign minister, Obuchi presided over the signing of a new
fisheries agreement with China that steered tactfully around their
territorial disputes in the East China Sea.
	   He was set to visit China last week, but canceled after Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned as Liberal Democratic Party
chief over his party's defeat in elections for the upper house of
parliament.
	   Obuchi was more palatable to China than his closest rival.
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama outraged Chinese
leaders last year by insisting that a U.S.-Japan treaty would
involve those countries in a conflict over Taiwan, which Beijing
claims as a renegade province.

Kohl aide accuses German opposition of being `too American'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With Chancellor Helmut Kohl still behind in
opinion polls two months before Germany's election, his
conservative allies tried a new charge Friday against the
opposition: spending too much time in the United States.
	   A parliamentary leader for Kohl's Christian Democrats, Joachim
Hoerster, criticized front-runner Gerhard Schroeder's recent picks
to be part of a Social Democratic government if he succeeds in
unseating Kohl.
	   Jost Stollmann, whom Schroeder wants to be his economics
minister, has stirred controversy by suggesting cutting subsidies
to old industries like coal and making government grants to
households with children dependent on family income.
	   The computer entrepreneur graduated from Harvard Business School
and worked in Chicago in the 1980s.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based publisher Michael Naumann, who would
become Schroeder's top cultural affairs aide, has said such a
position would allow for more central coordination of cultural
matters _ a remark Hoerster called reminiscent of Nazi Germany's
attempts to dictate acceptable art.
	   ``As seen by their comments, Stollmann and Naumann have
apparently been in the United States too long,'' Hoerster said.
``They don't know any more what's happening in Germany.''
	   Schroeder, a centrist who has tried to push the traditionally
leftist Social Democrats in a pro-market direction, has defended
his choices for a shadow cabinet, saying such people are needed to
break the paralysis in German politics.

Red Cross launches fund for victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a
special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic
defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a
quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
	   ``With Agent Orange, the land mines were planted deep in the
very essence of life _ in the genes of the men and women,'' said
John Geoghegan, the country head for the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
	   ``That this war is being fought again with their grandchildren
is a horrific thought.''
	   No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes
during a 10-year period to strip away cover for North Vietnamese
troops and their resupply convoys. Estimates range from tens of
thousands to 2 million Vietnamese.
	   In April, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai ordered the first
nationwide survey, to be completed next year.
	   In addition, veterans from at least four countries who fought on
the side of the former U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government sued
the chemical's manufacturers in the United States, saying exposure
caused chronic illness, deaths and birth defects.
	   According to U.S. records, the United States sprayed about 12
million gallons (45 million liters) of Agent Orange over parts of
southern and central Vietnam in 1961-71.
	   The total included about 375 pounds (170 kilograms) of dioxin, a
mere trace of which can cause cancer.
	   The spraying was stopped in 1971 _ four years before the end of
the war _ after laboratory tests showed that dioxin can cause
cancers and birth defects.
	   It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or
ailments are directly related to Agent Orange.
	   But the Vietnamese Red Cross says there appear to be common
threads: brothers and sisters suffering from the same deformities,
which is otherwise fairly uncommon; arms and legs that are twisted
in a certain way; and eyes without pupils.
	   Hoang Dinh Cau, chairman of the National Committee for
Investigation of Defects from Toxic Chemicals Used During the
Vietnam War, said recent studies show dioxin levels are dropping,
along with high rates of birth defects, in the affected areas.
	   But some still have high toxicity levels in both the soil and
the oil of fish that were checked.
	   Cau, 81, dismissed concerns that dioxin has and will continue to
leech into the food supply. However, some foreign scientists worry
that ongoing demining efforts are stirring up buried dioxin and
allowing it to be carried into the water system by erosion.
	   Vietnam estimates 16.5 percent of the 70,391 square miles
(182,299 square kilometers) in the former South Vietnam were
sprayed, some areas four times or more. Nearly 2 million people
lived in the affected areas.
	   In most of the country, the deformity rates peaked in the late
1970s and have fallen sharply since 1985, Cau said. But in the most
heavily sprayed areas, the declines didn't start until the '90s.
	   ``Initially, we did not think the chemicals would have an impact
on the second generation,'' Cau said. ``But dioxin can stay in the
soil very long.''
	   He pulled out a stack of case studies. One showed a couple who
had two healthy children before the father went to fight in the
south. Four miscarriages followed his return. Another couple had
eight deformed children.
	   He said recently developed treatments have improved the lives of
some victims. Those children who have the most serious deformities
are cared for at 11 ``peace villages'' scattered across the country
that can handle a total of 500 patients. More villages are planned.

Thailand's trade surplus soared during first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's trade rebounded sharply to a
surplus during the first half of 1998 compared to a deep deficit
during the same period the previous year, the Commerce Ministry
said Friday.
	   Thailand recorded a trade surplus of 225.8 billion baht (dlrs
5.5 billion) from January to June compared with a deficit of 173.3
billion baht (dlrs 4.2 billion) for the same period in 1997.
	   Thailand is the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times, and exports had slowed to zero growth in 1996. But the fall
of the country's currency, the baht, has given new competitive life
to many export products and sectors.
	   Computers and parts remained the country's top export bringing
in 155.8 billion baht (dlrs 3.8 billion) during the first half of
1998.
	   They were followed by electrical appliances 91.2 billion baht
(dlrs 2.2 billion), garments 66 billion baht (dlrs 1.6 billion),
rubber and rubber products 50.2 billion baht (dlrs 1.2 billion) and
integrated circuits 48.3 billion baht (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter and rice came in
sixth in exports at 45 billion baht (dlrs 1.09 billion).

Hundreds help cleanup after flash flood in southwestern Poland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 700 firefighters and soldiers worked
Friday to remove debris from a resort area in southwestern Poland
where flash floods have killed at least seven people.
	   Water levels on the Dusznica Bystrzycka river were dropping and
many of the 1,200 people evacuated from towns near the border with
the Czech Republic had returned home, according to Jan Jarosz of
the provincial flood committee in Walbrzych.
	   He said the death toll from the flash floods, which hit early
Thursday, remained at seven, but several other people were
apparently missing.
	   The water damaged more than 100 houses, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
of roads and dozens of small bridges in the Klodzko region, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, he said.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who ordered immediate government
assistance to area residents, planned to visit the region Friday.
	   Buzek said the local government had been warned about the heavy
storms that hit southwestern Poland Wednesday night, but the sudden
flood hit places where people never expected water could reach
them.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage. But the Klodzko region was not
affected then.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, with both share prices and the Japanese currency
rebounding in Tokyo. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
173.88 points, or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 16,361.89
points. On Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 105.05 points, or 0.64
percent. Buying by pension funds and foreign brokerages in the
afternoon wiped out early losses following an overnight sharp drop
on Wall Street and continued worries over Moody's Investors
Service's announcement Thursday that it was considering downgrading
the rating of Japan's national debt. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing intense competition and weak consumer
spending, Moody's Investors Service on Friday downgraded its
long-term debt rating of Japanese game maker Sega Enterprises Ltd.
to junk bond status. The downgrade affects 120 billion yen (dlrs
857 million) of the company's outstanding bonds. Moody's cited
competition from stronger and better positioned competitors and
Japan's continuing economic problems. (JAPAN-MOODY'S-SEGA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ British Telecommunications struck
a deal Friday to buy a 33-percent stake in Malaysia's leading
private telecommunications company. The agreement formalizes the
partnership and the acquisition for about 1.8 billion ringgit (dlrs
450,000). (MALAYSIA-BRITISH TELECOM)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma signed a
decree barring tax authorities from arbitrary inspections of
private businesses, a news report said Friday. The decree permits
tax authorities and other government agencies to inspect a private
enterprise only once a year, the Interfax news agency reported.
Entrepreneurs are to be notified about an upcoming inspection at
least 10 days in advance. Many business people complain that
surprise inspections are used as a method of pressuring them into
paying bribes. (UKRAINE-TAXES).

Senior Iranian cleric says Rushdie death sentence is irrevocable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie is irrevocable and Western countries should stop
bringing it up, a senior Iranian cleric said Friday.
	   ``Western countries must accept that the death sentence against
Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked under any circumstances, and they
must not discuss this issue again,'' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told
the Friday prayers sermon at Tehran University.
	   Jannati, a hard-liner who heads several powerful government
bodies, was referring to last week's visit by a European Union
delegation that urged Iran to distance itself from the bounty set
for killing Rushdie.
	   Iran has refused to revoke its 1989 death sentence on Rushdie,
an Indian-born British writer, whom it accuses of insulting Islam
in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   An official Iranian foundation has offered a reward of more than
dlrs 2 million for Rushdie's death, forcing the author to live in
hiding under British police protection.
	   The talks between the EU and Iranian officials were the first
high-level discussions since relations deteriorated in April 1997
when a German court found that Iranian leaders were involved in the
assassination of four Kurdish-Iranian dissidents in Berlin in 1992.
	   EU officials have said they are keen to normalize ties with Iran
following the coming to power last August of President Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate cleric who is trying to temper Iran's hard-line
foreign and domestic policies.
	   But, from the European perspective, the death sentence against
Rushdie remains a major obstacle.

Lebed urges Russian govt. to find money for missile base _ or else
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Lebed, a presidential hopeful now
serving as a Siberian governor, appeared to be joking in a letter
he wrote to the Russian government. But it's doubtful that anyone
in the Kremlin is laughing.
	   Lebed, a retired general, suggested that he should take over an
army missile base in his territory, Krasnoyarsk, because the
federal government hasn't been able to pay soldiers there for
months.
	   ``Officers of the Uzhursk missile base haven't been receiving
their wages for five months and their wives have been assailing the
unit's headquarters,'' Lebed said in an open letter to Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. The letter was released by the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``I'm seriously thinking about taking the base under the
region's jurisdiction,'' he added. ``I think, we will find money to
operate it in exchange for nuclear power status, becoming a new
headache for the world community along with India and Pakistan.''
	   Like many Russian territories, Krasnoyarsk has suffered a steep
economic decline and many state workers and pensioners go months
without pay.
	   Lebed, a harsh critic of President Boris Yeltsin and the federal
government, said officials in Moscow did not care about Siberia,
the vast Russian territory east of the Ural Mountains.
	   ``One comes to a sad conclusion that the government considers
lands east of the Ural Mountains as something alien,'' he wrote.
``It's rather weird, since 60 percent of the country's territory
and 80 percent of its resources lie there.''
	   He described the desperate conditions in the military in his
region, noting that people were protesting against government plans
to disband air force facilities in the region.
	   ``Hungry officers are angry officers,'' he said.
	   Lebed was elected in May to the governor's post in Krasnoyarsk,
a resource-rich region in central Siberia. Many analysts believe he
will use the job as a springboard to run for the Russian presidency
in elections in the year 2000.
	   Lebed finished a strong third in the 1996 presidential
elections. He was named Russia's security chief, but lost the post
four months later in the Kremlin infighting and has since become a
staunch government critic.
	   Lebed has said he would only run for president if he solves the
problems in his region.

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ As waters receded in a central China
industrial hub, Beijing ordered local governments along the Yangtze
river Friday to prepare for more flooding.
	   Top disaster relief officials warned that another flood crest _
the third this month _ was heading for the middle reaches of the
Yangtze, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   More than a month of often heavy downpours have left embankments
along the Yangtze and its lakes and tributaries weakened and
waterlogged. Water levels in the area are near or above their
historical highs, Xinhua said.
	   The system of dikes and embankments reinforced in recent days by
sandbags is the last protective shield for tens of millions of
people and some of China's richest farmland.
	   Rain-swollen rivers have already breached dikes and overwhelmed
banks in Hunan province. State-run television showed towns
submerged with only the roofs or buildings higher than two stories
poking through murky brown river water.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji telephoned Hunan Governor Yang Zhengwu
Thursday night to express concern and ordered the military and
police ``to spare no effort to safeguard the people's life and
properties,'' Xinhua reported.
	   More than 1,000 people have died throughout China in flooding
this year from rains that started earlier and fell harder than
usual. Six provinces along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, are among the hardest hit.
	   The National General Headquarters for Flood Prevention and
Drought Control told governments on the Yangtze _ from western
Sichuan province to coastal Shanghai _ to reinforce major dikes and
keep watch round-the-clock, Xinhua said.
	   Wuhan's 7 million residents got some relief Friday as blue skies
replaced some of the heaviest rains on record. Runoff that had
overwhelmed the city drainage system began to dissipate, leaving
mud and debris on streets and sidewalks.
	   Much of the city was returning to normal. Merchants went back to
work in street markets still knee-deep in water, although many
shops were closed for lack of electricity.
	   The low-lying Gaogong Street neighborhood, at the junction of
the Yangtze and the Hanshui River, remained under waist-deep water.
Residents have moved into the second stories of their homes and
piled furniture on balconies and roofs. Children swam in the
flooded streets.
	   ``It's been like this for 25 days,'' said resident Mei Jianying,
who gets to work by rowboat.
	   Wuhan suffered its heaviest rainfall on record Tuesday, which
killed one person and stranded 600,000, state media reported. Parts
of the city were without water and power for three days.
	   ``I'm thinking about moving out of here,'' said a cabdriver
named Yang whose neighborhood near the Yangtze floods every year
when the river swells with heavy summer rains.

Berlusconi appears in Spanish court in suspected TV fraud probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Italy (AP) _ Italian opposition leader and media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi appeared at a court here Friday in connection
with a probe into a suspected 5 billion peseta (dlrs 33 million)
tax fraud at a Spanish television network.
	   Berlusconi arrived at the National Court shortly after 10 a.m.
(0800 gmt) but left less than two hours later after investigating
magistrate Baltasar Garzon agreed to give him until September to
study the case, state radio said.
	   The former premier is among more than 30 people being
scrutinized by Garzon in a probe into the suspected tax fraud at
one of Spain's private channels, Telecinco, in which Berlusconi's
company Fininvest had a 25 percent stake in in the early 1990s.
	   Berlusconi appeared along with three other associates, Marcello
Dell'Utri, an Italian parliamentary deputy with Berlusconi's party
Forza Italia, and two Fininvest representatives, Alfredo Messina
and Giorgio Vanni, who are also expected to return in September.
	   Earlier this month, Berlusconi was given a two year and nine
month prison term for bribing tax inspectors to obtain favorable
audits of Fininvest company.
	   Police, under orders from Garzon searched Fininvest offices in
Italy last year.

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Sainz took the lead
in the Rally of New Zealand on Friday when he beat Colin McRae of
Scotland by just under a second on the Superspecial opening stage.
	   The Spaniard gunned his Toyota around the 2.1-kilometer
(1.3-mile) circuit in 1 minute, 39.6 seconds while McRae's Subaru
took 1:40.5. The two ran last on a surface made increasingly
treacherous by rain and earlier traffic.
	   A surprise third-fastest was Japanese Katsuhiko Taguchi in a
Mitsubishi, who is seeded only 38th for the rally.
	   Of the other works drivers, Juha Kankkunen (Ford) was sixth,
Didier Auriol (Toyota) seventh, Richard Burns (Mitsubishi) ninth,
Piero Liatti (Subaru) 13th, Tommi Makinen (Mitsubishi) 16th and
Bruno Thiry (Ford) 23rd.
	   The 79 cars competing in the world championship rally head for
the Maramarua Forest, southeast of Auckland, on Saturday morning
for six stages on what will be slippery forest roads.
	   The cars return Saturday afternoon to the Manukau Superspecial,
where the top 30 will run in reverse order with the rest following.
The rally ends Monday. (djp)

FINA suspends four Chinese swimmers for two years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from lawyer for swimmers; plan appeal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The governing body of world
swimming Friday handed four Chinese swimmers two-year suspensions
after they tested positive for banned substances in the World
Swimming Championships in January.
	   The FINA doping panel, in a brief statement, said the
suspensions from all competitions went into force immediately. A
temporary suspension period, which was in force from Jan. 14 until
April 25, will be deducted from the two-year total, FINA said.
	   At the worlds in Perth, Australia, the three Chinese women _
Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _ and male teammate Wang Wei
tested positive for triamterene, a banned diuretic which can be
used to mask the use of anabolic steroids.
	   Charles Duan, a lawyer for the four said he would appeal to the
International Olympic Committee's Court of Arbitration.
	   ``I think all the swimmers should be cleared,'' Duan said. ``I
think this case involved a lot of factors, in particular the bias
against the Chinese swimmers.''
	   ``That makes people not think about the facts,'' he added,
nothing about the evidence. The only aim was to try to convict
Chinese swimmers.''
	   The decision came on a day when the doping panel was also
expected to rule on the case of Irish triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith.
	   Smith faced a possible life ban on charges of tampering with a
urine sample. She was charged with manipulating an
out-of-competition drug test on Jan. 10 by adulterating her sample
with alcohol.

Injury rules out Foe transfer

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ A persistent ankle injury has ruined
Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe's planned transfer to
Manchester United.
	   Foe had been in Manchester receiving medical treatment in an
attempt to speed his recovery and seal a 3.4 million-pound (dlrs
5.6 million) transfer from Lens to the Premier League club.
	   But Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson Friday said Foe
would not have recovered in time to beat next month's Champions'
League transfer deadline and had returned to Lens.
	   The Cameroon star had agreed to terms with Manchester United
before the World Cup after months of negotiations, but fractured
his fibula during the tournament and failed a Manchester United
medical exam.
	   United was still expected to sign Dwight Yorke from Aston Villa
in a deal worth about 15 million pounds (dlrs 24.6 million) _
including a player exchange with Andy Cole.

Palestinians agree to renew talks on minor issues, not withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian chief negotiator saying
new talks will deal with day-to-day problems, not troop withdrawal &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinians agreed Friday to
renew talks with Israel over day-to-day problems, but their chief
negotiator said there would be no more negotiations on the key
issue, an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   The negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said there was no point in holding
more talks on the scope of an Israeli troop pullback since the
Palestinians have already accepted a U.S. plan for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   It was now up to Israel to accept the U.S. plan, Erekat told
reporters. ``The Palestinian leadership has made a decision that
there is no need for any more negotiations and what is needed is a
political decision by the Israeli government,'' Erekat said.
	   Despite Erekat's assertions, some confusion remained over how
the contacts between Israel and the Palestinians would proceed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat seemed to suggest after a
meeting with Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani on
Friday that contacts between the two sides would intensify.
	   Arafat said Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, would hold talks
with Kahalani. ``There will be continuous meetings beginning next
week,'' Arafat said, adding that ``all issues will be discussed.
	   However, Erekat was quick to lower expectations, saying the two
sides would talk about unresolved issues stemming from the interim
peace accords, such as creating a land route for Palestinians
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``I really don't know what the president (Arafat) meant when he
said Abu Mazen will meet Mr. Kahalani, but that meeting will be in
the context of of the day-to-day problems that we raise,'' Erekat
told reporters.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, reiterated that he would not meet with
Netanyahu unless Israel agreed to the U.S. initiative.
	   Earlier this week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had
discussed a troop pullback in three sessions. The Palestinians had
attended reluctantly, at the urging of the United States.
	   The Clinton administration announced earlier this month that it
had exhausted its role as mediator and expected the two sides to
work through the remaining problems themselves.
	   The Washington Post quoted Palestinian negotiators as saying
they feared the United States was retreating from its original
determination not to allow changes in the U.S. proposal.
	   In May, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had said her
13 percent pullback plan would not be watered down.
	   However, by urging Israel and the Palestinians to go it alone
and making the scope of the withdrawal the key issue to be
discussed in direct talks, Albright seemed to suggest the 13
percent figure was now negotiable.
	   In a July 9 meeting with Erekat and Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath, Albright reportedly said she no longer felt
she could pressure Israel to accept her plan. ``I tried, I tried
and I couldn't,'' Albright reportedly told Shaath.
	   Erekat said Friday that he did not believe Albright had changed
her position.
	   ``She reiterated to us that she stands by the American
initiative and that she wanted two or three bilateral meetings
(with the Israelis) after which she told us she would take a
decision,'' Erekat said.

British prime minister builds soccer bridge with France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair unveiled a plan
Friday to build a cultural and sporting ``bridge'' between Britain
and France.
	   Under the proposal, youth soccer teams from French cities that
hosted England and Scotland games during the France '98 World Cup
will be invited to visit major clubs in England and Scotland.
	   The young French players will be invited to watch Premier League
teams in action, attend top-level coaching sessions and meet stars
from teams like Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Celtic and
Rangers.
	   Blair, who announced the deal as he welcomed French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin to his constituency in northern England,
said the World Cup _ which France won _ demonstrated the power of
soccer to bring together people from different cultures.
	   Sports minister Tony Banks described the bridge as a way of
``saying thank you to the French for the hospitality they showed to
the rest of the world'' during the World Cup.

Chinese police turn down protest march application
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have blocked an attempt by
democracy campaigners to stage a march protesting the detention of
three colleagues, a rights group said Friday.
	   Police in eastern Hangzhou City demanded Mao Qingxiang and Wang
Rongqing withdraw their application, shortly after they submitted
it on Thursday, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Such marches are technically legal in China, but applications to
hold them must be approved by police, who rarely grant permission.
	   Mao and Wang hoped the march, scheduled for July 28, would draw
attention to the continued detentions of Wang Youcai and two others
who tried to set up a political opposition party.
	   The three are among 15 dissidents detained in the past two weeks
in the most severe police clampdown on dissent in recent years.
	   Wang has reportedly been charged with threatening state
security, making it likely he will either be prosecuted or
imprisoned without trial in a labor camp.
	   Eleven of those detained in the police sweep have already been
released, while another labor activist unrelated to the would-be
party remains in custody in southern Hunan province.
	   Wang and the others sought to use U.S. President Bill Clinton's
arrival in China last month to announce the formation of the China
Democracy Party, in a challenge to the ruling Communist Party's
political monopoly. Authorities have refused their attempts to
register the party as required by law.

New Hungarian prime minister pushes NATO, EU membership

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Hungary's new prime minister, Viktor
Orban, said Friday his government will continue to contribute to
NATO crisis management efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo, but said
Kosovo was a much more sensitive issue.
	   Hungary, whose membership in NATO already has been ratified by
12 of the 16 current members, has participated in the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Bosnia since its inception in December 1995.
	   ``But the Kosovo crisis is in character a different one and
Hungary must be more cautious,'' Orban said after a meeting with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   He noted that several hundred thousand ethnic Hungarians live in
Yugoslavia and that 500 have been conscripted into the Serbian army
and are deployed in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.
	   ``We understand that they are Serbian or Yugoslav citizens, but
at the same time, we would like to make clear that the Hungarians
would not like to be involved (in Kosovo). This is a very sensitive
issue for the Hungarian government and we will do our best to
convince the Serbian government that the Hungarians should be got
out.''
	   Orban, 35, was sworn in as prime minister July 6 after his Young
Democrats-Civic Party won the largest number of seats in
parliamentary elections in May. He was in Brussels to meet with
NATO and European Union leaders.
	   Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, have been
accepted for NATO membership, but that must be ratified by the
parliaments of all NATO members. Britain, the Netherlands, Turkey
and Portugal still must vote on the new members, which are to be
officially welcomed at a NATO summit in Washington next April.
	   Hungary also is negotiating to join the 15-nation European
Union, though membership is still some years away.
	   Solana praised Hungary's progress, saying he was ``looking
forward to seeing Hungary as soon as possible as part of the
alliance.
	   ``The contribution of Hungary, in particular in Bosnia, is
something that the allies will never forget,'' the
secretary-general said.
	   He noted that Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic already are
taking part in the North Atlantic Council's debates on the
situation in Kosovo, where majority ethnic Albanians seek
independence, or at least extended autonomy.
	   Orban said Hungary also supported the further enlargement of
NATO, particularly to include Hungary's immediate neighbors.
	   ``It's in the interest of Hungary,'' he said. ``The enlargement
process is the best stabilizing policy in the Central European
region.''

 &UR; Eds: RECAST and UPDATES with Rugova quotes, U.S. ambassador
Christopher Hill arriving in Pristina, new U.N. figures on
refugees &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian politician
demanded international action to stop fighting in Kosovo Friday and
warned violence could spill into neighboring regions.
	   ``We demand international protection for Kosovo and its people
in order to stop further conflict that could spread to a wider
region,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, a moderate leader of Kosovo
Albanians, about 90 percent of the province of two million.
	   ``Serbian military and police forces continue with attacks and
massacres against the Albanian population,'' he said.
	   Rugova was to meet later in the day with Christopher Hill, the
U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, who is trying to
kick-start stalled peace talks with the Yugoslav government. Hill
arrived in Pristina Friday after meeting Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic in Belgrade.
	   The U.S. rejects independence for Kosovo but hasn't ruled out
military force to halt the five-month conflict between Serb
security forces and secessionist guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army that has killed hundreds.
	   Western diplomats fear the fighting could ignite secessionist
passions among the large ethnic Albanian community in neighboring
Macedonia.
	   Neither ethnic Albanian nor Serb officials reported new fighting
Friday in Kosovo.
	   Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have accused each other of summary
executions, beatings and other atrocities during recent battles for
the central Kosovo town of Orahovac.
	   The fighting began a week ago when the KLA assaulted the
Serb-held town of 20,000. After several days of fighting that left
many dead, the Serbs regained control of Orahovac.
	   The Geneva office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
said Friday the Orahovac fighting created 15,000 - 20,000 new
refugees, adding to an earlier total of more than 100,000 Kosovars,
who fled their homes to escape fighting.
	   The European Union plans a peace mission to Kosovo next week
while the United States warns that outside force to stop the
killing remains an option.
	   The EU announcement came Thursday, the same day Walter Slocombe,
undersecretary of defense for policy, said the U.S. administration
has not ``ruled out'' unilateral military force or participating in
a NATO plan for action. ``We are prepared to act alone if
necessary,'' he said.
	   Also on Thursday, an aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic blasted top U.S. envoy, Robert Gelbard, calling him ``an
accomplice of women and children murderers in Kosovo and of
criminals who kidnap civilians, supports terrorism and terrorist
gangs.''
	   The aide, Ivica Dacic, apparently expressed Milosevic's anger
that Gelbard had met with Serbian opposition politicians while
looking for support in peace efforts.

Tour de France cyclist admits publicly to doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Armin Meier on Friday became
the first cyclist to publicly admit taking the banned performance-
enhancing substance EPO as the drugs scandal overshadowing the Tour
de France continued to escalate.
	   Riders, meanwhile, bulked at starting the 12th stage of the
competition, saying the investigation into the use of drugs was
wrecking the sport. They later hesitantly moved into motion.
	   Meier said on France Info radio that during police questioning
he had admitted to taking EPO.
	   ``Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it,'' he said, adding that ``I'm just the victim of a system.''
	   Meier and five of his teammates were released in Friday, a day
after Lyon police detained them for questioning. Miguel Moreno,
assistant director for Festina, also was freed. Three riders were
still being questioned.
	   In the northern city of Lille, Festina team director Bruno
Roussel, team doctor Eric Ryckaert and physiotherapist Willy Voet
-- all under formal investigation in the affair -- gave their
versions on the doping issue in a three-year court session.
	   The sporting director and team doctor of the Dutch TVM team,
detained Thursday, were also being questioned Friday by police in
the southern town of Pamiers. They could be held until Saturday.
	   The TVM team represented the latest chapter in the unfolding
doping drama surrounding the Tour de France, the world's prestige
cycling competition.
	   About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a team car
near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time, but the
affair rebounded in the wake of the Festina scandal.

ASEAN foreign ministers welcome nomination of new Japan premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations welcomed Keizo Obuchi's election as head
of Japan's ruling party Friday, expressing confidence he could bail
Japan out of its economic troubles.
	   Most said his links with the trading bloc, gained through years
as Japan's foreign minister, will enable Japan to better help
financially-ravaged Southeast Asian countries.
	   ``We hope this contact he had with us will provide the kind of
leadership we would expect from Japan,'' said Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi. ``We hope that they will play a more
active role and they would be able to help us.''
	   Obuchi, 61, was elected president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party Friday, a position that virtually guarantees he
will be chosen as Japan's next prime minister because of the
party's majority in Japan's lower house of parliament.
	   Although Japan is burdened with its own economic woes, Badawi
said Japan's role remains crucial in helping Asian economies
recover from the region's continuing financial crisis.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said he expects no basic
changes in the policies of Obuchi, who comes is from the same party
as as his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   The foreign ministers began an annual meeting on Friday expected
to be dominated by discussions on how to extricate the region from
the crisis.
	   Prior to his election, Obuchi himself was invited to a
post-ministerial meeting next week with the ASEAN ministers
representing Japan, one of the group's 10 dialogue partners. His
attendance, though, remains uncertain.
	   Obuchi is expected to be elected prime minister next week by
Japan's Parliament.
	   ASEAN countries, whose economies are strongly integrated to that
of Japan, have in the past urged Tokyo to hasten reforms of its
financial system.
	   ``It has been a common expectation that Japan would put its
economic house in more effective order so that it could revive its
own economy and could be able to pull along other economies, which
during the past few years have been very closely integrated with
the Japanese economy,'' said Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
	   ``I do believe the new administration in Japan understands that
expectation and will respond to that expectation favorably,'' he
said.
	   In a statement, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
congratulated Obuchi, saying he hoped Japan, under the new leader,
would take a more active role in ASEAN's affairs.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Georgia, Russia, Abkhazia trade accusations as tensions grow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Russia, Georgia and the separatist
province of Abkhazia traded recriminations Friday, a day after a
mine blast injured nine Russian peacekeepers.
	   Russia blamed militia groups that support Georgia's central
government for the explosion Wednesday night outside the village of
Khumeni, where Russian peacekeepers are stationed.
	   The Russian Defense Ministry said Georgia had failed to control
the militia groups, and threatened to fire back in case of new
attacks, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   ``The command of the peacekeepers has been ordered to take
adequate measures to eliminate terrorist groups,'' ITAR-Tass quoted
the ministry's statement as saying.
	   Georgia, meanwhile, accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to
do their job and prevent alleged kidnappings of ethnic Georgians by
Abkhazian separatists.
	   Georgian officials said five ethnic Georgians were kidnapped
Wednesday in the village of Orsantiya, a region controlled by
Russian peacekeepers. One of the hostages was fatally shot
Thursday, and the remaining four released for a ransom of dlrs 200
each, the officials said.
	   Georgia's Foreign Ministry released a statement Friday, blaming
Russian peacekeepers for ``inactivity'' and ``failure to take
effective measures'' to prevent such attacks.
	   Abkhazia denied any involvement in the kidnappings, and said
they took place in Georgian territory.
	   ``If somebody has been kidnapped on Georgia's territory, then
that's where they should search,'' Interfax news agency quoted
Abkhazia's Interior Minister Almasbei Kchach as saying.
	   Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war between Georgian
government troops and Abkhazian separatists. The peacekeepers have
helped prevent a resumption of full-scale fighting, but occasional
clashes still occur.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian representatives are currently meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss a peace settlement.
	   The Georgian Foreign Ministry on Friday accused ``forces
uninterested in a peaceful settlement'' of timing the recent
attacks to disrupt the peace talks.

Riders, disgusted by doping scandal, make late start

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with riders finally starting &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France (AP) _ Riders bulked at the start of
Friday's 12th stage of the Tour de France, saying the investigation
into the use of performance enhancing drugs was wrecking the sport.
	   The 148-member pack finally moved into action 16 kms (10 miles)
from the official starting point -- and two hours after the
official starting time.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' the world's No. 1 cyclist, Laurent
Jalabert of France, told Radio Tour, the station that follows the
race.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone. We won't cycle
and that's the end of it.''
	   Jalabert said the riders were all ``revolted'' that cycling had
taken a backseat to the doping investigation.
	   However, Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc helped negotiate a
start to the stage, 222 kms (138 miles) from Tarascon to Le Cap
d'Agde.
	   Leblanc called an urgent meeting with the sporting directors of
competing teams to resolve the crisis, which grew out of the
mounting doping scandal that has haunted the Tour since its July 11
in Dublin, Ireland.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Legislators on Friday chose an independent
committee including prominent government critics to determine who
was responsible for problems at Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion
airport.
	   Selina Chow of the pro-business Liberal Party will head the
13-member committee, which will look into the problems at Chek Lap
Kok airport. It will work independently of the commission appointed
by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Details of the legislature's study have yet to be hammered out
before the committee can begin the investigation, Hong Kong Radio
reported. The legislators are scheduled to meet next week.
	   Among the prominent critics of the government on the panel are
Emily Lau of the Frontier movement, Christine Loh of the Citizens'
Party and independent Margaret Ng, who represents the legal
profession in the legislature.
	   ``I feel that the members understand we can work
independently,'' said legislator James To of the Democratic Party.
``The committee will have a wider mandate, and we can summon even
the chief executive.''
	   Passenger services have improved since the airport opened July
6. The Airport Authority reported late Friday that 75 percent of
all flights left within 15 minutes of schedule. The average waiting
time for baggage was 14 minutes, it said.
	   But cargo-handling still is not up to full speed, and is not
expected to be until the end of August.
	   Legislators toured the main cargo terminal Friday, but said they
were not satisfied with the visit.
	   Liberal Party member James Tien said the visit gave legislators
a better feel for the problems confronting Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, but that many questions remained unanswered.
	   The chairman of the government-appointed commission, Justice Woo
Kwok-hing has said that his investigation would operate under rules
of a judicial inquiry, meaning unfair public discussion of the case
during the investigation could constitute contempt of court.

Thailand's foreign reserves up slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Bank of Thailand said Friday that
its foreign reserves stood at dlrs 27.2 billion as of July 17,
compared with dlrs 26.8 billion on July 10.
	   The squandering of Thailand's foreign reserves by central
bankers in a failed defense of the country's currency forced them
to float the baht in July 1997, triggering Asia's financial crisis.
	   At one point, foreign reserves were believed to have fallen to
about dlrs 1 billion. The fall of the baht since its flotation has
necessitated a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the Thai economy by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The central bank said in a statement that dlrs 20 million of the
increase in its reserves came through drawings on the IMF credit
line. An official told reporters that the remaining dlrs 380
million increase was due to capital inflows. He did not elaborate.
	   Net forward obligations in foreign exchange markets were
unchanged at dlrs 12.3 billion, the central bank said.

Shell and Occidental enter into oil and gas deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Royal Dutch Shell Group and
American-based, Occidental, have entered into an international oil
and gas deal, one of Shell's companies, Sarawak Shell said in a
statement Friday.
	   It said the deal involved Occidental acquiring Shell's assets
and businesses in Yemen and Columbia, while in return, Shell will
acquire Occidental's upstream subsidiaries in the Philippines and
Malaysian interests.
	   In Malaysia, Shell will acquire all of Occidental's interest in
Occidental Oil and Gas (Malaysia), which holds an interest in block
SK8, Central Luconia Province Offshore Bintulu Sarawak, and all of
Occidental's shares in Occidental LNG (Malaysia) Ltd.
	   ``The deal will be concluded after all approvals have been
obtained and requirements have been satisfied,'' the statement
said.
	   The statement said this is one of the many deals which Shell and
Occidental companies have signed committing themselves to exchange
some of the assets in their respective oil and gas exploration and
production portfolios.
	   ``This deal with Occidental reinforces Shell's commitment to a
long term presence in Malaysia,'' said Sarawak Shell Bhd managing
director Lim Haw Kuang.
	   He said in addition to some 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion)
of investment and expenditure which Shell Malaysia has planned in
the next five years, the deal could potentially lead to a further
investment up to 1 billion ringgit (dlrs 250 million).
	   The complex deal involved the largest cross-border exploration
and production asset swaps in the world.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Four teenagers from a Russian wilderness
survival school drowned in the Azov Sea during a boat trip,
Ukrainian officials said Friday.
	   The four, from Yekaterinburg's Ostrov (Island) school, left for
their four-day trip along the sea shore on July 13 but failed to
return on time.
	   Their bodies were found Thursday. Two of the bodies, those of
18-year-old instructor Alisa Zlobina and Mikhail Voluyev, 14, were
positively identified, and civil defense officials believed the
other two bodies were those of Yevgeny Ovchinnikov and Konstantin
Smirnov, both 14.
	   The bodies were found dozens of miles (kilometers) apart due to
strong sea current. The catamaran used by the four has not been
found and the cause of the accident remained unclear.

Kohl aide accuses German opposition of being `too American'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 1 graf with Schroeder trip to Washington next month &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With Chancellor Helmut Kohl still behind in
opinion polls two months before Germany's election, his
conservative allies tried a new charge Friday against the
opposition: spending too much time in the United States.
	   A parliamentary leader for Kohl's Christian Democrats, Joachim
Hoerster, criticized front-runner Gerhard Schroeder's recent picks
to be part of a Social Democratic government if he succeeds in
unseating Kohl.
	   Jost Stollmann, whom Schroeder wants to be his economics
minister, has stirred controversy by suggesting cutting subsidies
to old industries like coal and making government grants to
households with children dependent on family income.
	   The computer entrepreneur graduated from Harvard Business School
and worked in Chicago in the 1980s.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based publisher Michael Naumann, who would
become Schroeder's top cultural affairs aide, has said such a
position would allow for more central coordination of cultural
matters _ a remark Hoerster called reminiscent of Nazi Germany's
attempts to dictate acceptable art.
	   ``As seen by their comments, Stollmann and Naumann have
apparently been in the United States too long,'' Hoerster said.
``They don't know any more what's happening in Germany.''
	   Schroeder, a centrist who has tried to push the traditionally
leftist Social Democrats in a pro-market direction, has defended
his choices for a shadow cabinet, saying such people are needed to
break the paralysis in German politics.
	   He also apparently is not bothered by the United States:
Schroeder's office announced Friday he would travel to Washington
on Aug. 4-5 to meet with President Bill Clinton and Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan and deliver a speech at Georgetown
University.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinians agreed Friday to
renew talks with Israel on day-to-day problems, but their chief
negotiator said there would be no more negotiations on the key
issue, an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   The negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said there was no point in holding
more talks on an Israeli troop pullback since the Palestinians have
already accepted a U.S. plan for an Israeli withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   It was now up to Israel to accept the U.S. plan, Erekat told
reporters. ``The Palestinian leadership has made a decision that
there is no need for any more negotiations and what is needed is a
political decision by the Israeli government,'' Erekat said.
	   Despite Erekat's assertions, some confusion remained over how
the contacts between Israel and the Palestinians would proceed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat seemed to suggest after a
meeting with Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani on
Friday that contacts between the two sides would intensify.
	   Arafat said Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, would hold talks
with Kahalani. ``There will be continuous meetings beginning next
week,'' Arafat said, adding that ``all issues will be discussed.
	   However, Erekat was quick to lower expectations, saying the two
sides would talk about unresolved issues stemming from the interim
peace accords, such as creating a land route for Palestinians
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``I really don't know what the president (Arafat) meant when he
said Abu Mazen will meet Mr. Kahalani, but that meeting will be in
the context of the day-to-day problems that we raise,'' Erekat told
reporters.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, reiterated that he would not meet with
Netanyahu unless Israel agreed to the U.S. initiative.
	   Earlier this week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had
discussed a troop pullback in three sessions. The Palestinians had
attended reluctantly, at the urging of the United States.
	   The Clinton administration announced earlier this month that it
had exhausted its role as mediator and expected the two sides to
work through the remaining problems themselves.
	   The Washington Post quoted Palestinian negotiators as saying
they feared the United States was retreating from its original
determination not to allow changes in the U.S. proposal.
	   In May, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had said her
13 percent pullback plan would not be watered down.
	   However, by urging Israel and the Palestinians to go it alone
and making the scope of the withdrawal the key issue to be
discussed in direct talks, Albright seemed to suggest the 13
percent figure was now negotiable.
	   In a July 9 meeting with Erekat and Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath, Albright reportedly said she no longer felt
she could pressure Israel to accept her plan. ``I tried, I tried
and I couldn't,'' Albright reportedly told Shaath.
	   Erekat said Friday that he did not believe Albright had changed
her position.
	   ``She reiterated to us that she stands by the American
initiative and that she wanted two or three bilateral meetings
(with the Israelis) after which she told us she would take a
decision,'' Erekat said.

Finance Minister puts off fund-raising trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim will postpone a planned trip to Europe and the United
States designed to promote interest in the country's upcoming dlrs
2 billion sovereign bond, according to a government official.
	   Anwar was scheduled to visit Zurich, London, Washington and New
York at the end of the month.
	   Special economics minister Daim Zainuddin won't make the trip
either, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear if the postponement was related to Moody's
Investors Service downgrade on Friday of Malaysia's long-term
foreign currency ceiling.
	   Malaysia's bonds, which are lead managed by JP Morgan and Union
Bank of Switzerland, will be used to pump cash into the Asset
Management Corporation, or Danaharta as it's known locally.
	   The bad loan bank, which starts running in August, will buy up
non-performing loans from struggling banks so that lenders can
instead concentrate on offering more credit to viable businesses.

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian politician
demanded international action to stop fighting in Kosovo Friday and
warned violence could spill into neighboring regions.
	   ``We demand international protection for Kosovo and its people
in order to stop further conflict that could spread to a wider
region,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, a moderate leader of Kosovo
Albanians, about 90 percent of the province of two million.
	   ``Serbian military and police forces continue with attacks and
massacres against the Albanian population,'' he said.
	   Rugova was to meet later in the day with Christopher Hill, the
U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, who is trying to
kick-start stalled peace talks with the Yugoslav government. Hill
arrived in Pristina Friday after meeting Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic in Belgrade.
	   In an interview published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, Lum Haxhiu, said to be an officer in the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army, reaffirmed that the ``KLA cannot be controlled by
any Albanian political force because it's a national army, a
people's army, and its policy is national, not a party policy.''
	   He also said the divisions in the ethnic Albanian political camp
``only show the incompetence of political forces to coordinate
their activities in the struggle for national liberation ... for
the independence of Kosovo.''
	   Recalling a recent meeting he and other KLA leaders had with
Richard Holbrooke, a top U.S. envoy, in Kosovo, Haxhiu was quoted
as saying:
	   ``We made it clear to him that we won't give up arms until we
free every part of Kosovo. I told Mr Holbrooke: `Recognize the
independence of Kosovo and I'll be the first to break my rifle.'''

More than half Armenians considered `poor,' report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than half of Armenia's citizens live below
the poverty level of 25,000 drams (dlrs 50) a month, officials said
Friday.
	   Only 45 percent of Armenia's residents have incomes above the
subsistence level, the State Statistics Department said, according
to Interfax news agency. The minimum wage in Armenia is (5,000
drams) dlrs 10 a month, it said.
	   The remaining 55 percent of the population is classified either
as ``poor'' or ``very poor,'' the statistics department said.
	   Many of the poor live in areas stricken by the 1988 earthquake,
and also include large families, pensioners, the unemployed and the
disabled, Interfax reported. Unemployment in Armenia has reached 20
percent.
	   Other factors contributing to Armenia's economic hardships
included a devastating war with neighboring Azerbaijan over the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ensuing trade embargo imposed by
Azerbaijan and Turkey, and general troubles of post-Soviet
transition to capitalism.

ASEAN discusses more open, frank comment on tough issues

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign ministers from Myanmar and
other authoritarian Southeast Asian states warned that a call for
more open criticism of each other's policies could lead to discord
and distrust.
	   But Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, who proposed the
change in a 31-year-old regional policy, told his counterparts
Friday that if they do not speak more frankly about human rights
and environmental issues they will lose credibility with the
international community.
	   Supported only by the Philippines, which is hosting the annual
meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, Surin said, ``Like it or not, the issues of
democracy and human rights are those that we have to increasingly
deal with in our engagement with the outside world.''
	   Without announcing a policy change, the ministers agreed
informally during a closed-door dinner meeting Thursday to tolerate
more forthright statements from each other.
	   But Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told his counterparts
there is a fine line between interaction and interference and
warned against crossing it. For example, he said it was all right
to raise a border dispute, but not to demand democracy, according
to diplomats present at the meeting.
	   The strongest opponent of open criticism was Myanmar, admitted
to ASEAN last July despite protests from Europe, the United States
and international human rights groups. Myanmar has not made the
reforms some of its neighbors had hoped for and would be a likely
target if more open criticism became the norm.
	   According to delegates present at the closed-door discussion,
Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said the attraction of ASEAN
membership was the non-interference policy, and changing it would
affect trust.
	   Despite the reservations, Surin told reporters Friday: ``From
now on, issues affecting each other may be brought up and discussed
without being perceived as interference, Thailand is comforted by
the fact that we can now raise issues without fear of being
misunderstood by, or antagonizing other member countries.''
	   Singapore's foreign minister, Shanmugam Jayakumar, who opposed
more public outspokenness, will be ASEAN chairman next year.
Because of vast differences in culture, race, religion, language
and forms of government among the nine ASEAN nations, ``internal
political developments will remain a particularly sensitive area
that could set off centrifugal forces that could pull ASEAN
apart,'' Jayakumar said.
	   Formed in 1967 as a bulwark against communism, ASEAN has had
remarkable success in preventing armed conflict among most of its
members. Staunch supporters of the group's policies of consensus
and non-interference credit the hands-off approach with maintaining
the peace and building a cooperative trade association.
	   But Surin argued that war is no longer Southeast Asia's main
security threat. ``Instead of armed aggression and conflict,
pressing challenges in the form of economic disruptions and
transnational problems such as illicit drugs, international crime
and environmental degradation will become more prominent,'' he
said.
	   ASEAN, which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, began to
stretch its non-intervention policy last year when it postponed
Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup led by co-premier
Hun Sen.
	   Since then ASEAN has urged the Cambodian government to normalize
politics by holding elections which are scheduled for July 26 _
during the ASEAN meetings.

Cyprus denounces Demirel statement on economic integration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photo NIC-101 available

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus denounced Friday a statement by
Turkey's president that the occupied north of the island would be
regarded economically as a province of Turkey.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides called on the world to
take steps to prevent such a development.
	   ``The statement by (Turkish President Suleyman) Demirel is one
more proof of Turkish intentions. The international community must
cease its caressing of Turkey and its toleration of Turkish actions
against Cyprus,'' Stylianides said.
	   Demirel said in Ankara on Thursday that the economies of Turkey
and the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state were heading toward
integration.
	   ``From the economic point of view, Cyprus will be treated like a
province of Turkey,'' Demirel said. ``And thus the ... economic
problems of the 180,000 (residents of north Cyprus), who have been
isolated from the rest of the world, will be solved.''
	   Demirel is due to visit northern Cyprus on Saturday to take part
in week long celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1974
Turkish invasion.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of a coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway state
is recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish Cypriots are already part of the Turkish economy in that
they use the Turkish lira and have to accept Turkey's 77 percent
inflation. Their lack of recognition impedes their ability to trade
with countries other than Turkey.
	   The Cypriot protest came as the U.S. State Department
coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, conferred separately with
Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders Friday.
	   Miller said his visit, one of many this year, was ``part of a
search to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.'' He said he would
be exploring ways to lower tension caused by the Cypriot
government's planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   Turkey has vowed to prevent the deployment, expected later this
year. Greece, a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, has warned it will respond to any attack on Cyprus.

Debutant Elworthy hits 48 in South Africa's 374
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steve Elworthy scored a fighting 48
on test debut at Trent Bridge Friday before South Africa was bowled
out for 374 in the fourth cricket test against England.
	   Elworthy, a last minute inclusion ahead of an injured Makhaya
Ntini, held the tail together after skipper Hansie Cronje was
dismissed for 126.
	   England batted for 36 minutes and was 28 without loss at lunch.
	   South Africa resumed on 302 for seven and soon lost Cronje but
Elworthy, who took a painful blow on the head off Darren Gough,
ensured the run flow continued by hammering seven boundaries in his
71 minute stay at the crease.
	   Elworthy shared a 49-run partnership with Allan Donald (four not
out) taking South Africa from 325 for eight to 374, before he was
caught by Mark Ramprakash attemptingh to hook Darren Gough over the
square leg boundary.
	   His innings added to England's frustration on the second
morning, as the home side attempted to wrap up the South African
first innings with the second new ball.
	   Angus Fraser, who triggered a lower order collapse with the
second new ball on the first evening, earned his 11th five-wicket
haul in an innings when he dismissed Cronje.
	   Cronje hit 16 boundaries and a six in his first century since he
scored 101 against New Zealand in Auckland in 1994/95. He went 45
consecutive innings without a century.
	   Fraser was the most successful of the English bowlers, claiming
5-60 in 26 overs, while Gough finished with 4-116 off 30.2 overs.

ASEAN ministers call for free and fair election in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cambodia's election must be free and
fair if the country is to join the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, ASEAN foreign ministers stressed Friday at their annual
meeting.
	   ``We are watching very carefully the political process that will
culminate in general elections a few days from now,'' Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in a speech.
	   ``It is essential for the credibility of this process that all
parties have equal access to the media and that it is free, fair
and peaceful so that it will lead to the creation of a stable
government that can ensure lasting peace and stability for the
Cambodian people.''
	   If the process goes well, Cambodia can become the 10th member of
ASEAN, Alatas, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and other
ministers said.
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997. But
ASEAN postponed its entry because of a coup that month by co-prime
minister Hun Sen. ASEAN then formed a three-nation task force
comprised of Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines to press for a
return to political stability in Cambodia.
	   But widespread violence and intimidation against the political
opposition have led many critics to wonder whether Sunday's
election can be fair.
	   ASEAN diplomats said the problems that have occurred since the
entry last year of military-ruled Myanmar into the regional group
have made it more cautious about the admission of Cambodia. ASEAN
has been criticized by other nations for its acceptance of Myanmar
because of that country's poor human rights record.

Croatia-Netherlands Fed Cup likely without Lucic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOL, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian tennis star Mirjana Lucic will miss
the Fed Cup matchup against the Netherlands this weekend, tour
officials said Friday.
	   The officials said that after initially agreeing to play, Lucic
has not showed up or contacted them about playing and is thus not
expected to participate. Iva Majoli, the WTA's No. 20, will play
singles and doubles, with Silvija Talaja, ranked 145, playing the
second single match.
	   Jelena Kostanic, who won the girls doubles championship in
Wimbledon, will join Majoli in the doubles match on Sunday.
	   Lucic, 16, became the nation's favorite as she swiftly made it
to the WTA's top 50. She is currently 44th on the WTA list.
	   Majoli also did not do well in Wimbledon, being ousted in the
second round by Nathalie Tauziat of France. Talaja also left
Wimbledon quickly, after a first-round defeat.

Russian army major commandeers tank to demand back pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unpaid for months like millions of other Russians,
army Maj. Igor Belyayev decided it was time to protest _ with a
tank.
	   Belyayev unlocked the gates of his garrison in Novosmolino in
central Russia and drove a T-80 battle tank to the town's central
square, according to the Russian media reports on Friday,
	   During the incident Wednesday, he was joined by officers' wives,
who also protested back wages that are three months overdue and
food subsidies owed for 19 months, the reports said.
	   Military officials brought another tank to tow Belyayev's
vehicle back, but the angry women surrounded Belyayev's tank to
defend him. Late at night, Belyayev himself drove the tank back to
base.
	   Military prosecutors have launched an investigation, the reports
said.

Government rules out pardon for soldiers executed in World War I
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A pardon for 306 British soldiers executed during
World War I is impossible because it is no longer possible to
distinguish the guilty and the innocent, the government said
Friday.
	   However, he expressed the government's regret for the
executions, and announced that it intended to abolish the death
penalty for military offenses.
	   The Royal British Legion, which represents former service
members, had urged a pardon for those executed, and so had some
lawmakers.
	   ``We cannot distinguish between those who deliberately let down
their country and their comrades in arms and those who were not
guilty of desertion or cowardice,'' Armed Forced Minister John Reid
told the House of Commons.
	   More than 3,000 British servicemen were sentenced to death
between Aug. 4, 1914, when Britain declared war against Germany,
and March 31, 1920, nine months after the armistice. All but 306
sentences were commuted by commanders.
	   ``In the vast majority of cases, there is little to be gleaned
from the fragments of the stories that would provide serious
grounds for legal pardon,'' Reid said.
	   ``Eighty years ago, when witnesses were available and the events
were fresh in their memories, this might have been a possibility.
But the passage of time has rendered it well-nigh impossible in
most cases.''
	   Reid added that the government would introduce legislation to
abolish the death penalty which is still prescribed for five
military offenses: misconduct in action, assisting the enemy,
obstructing operations with intent to assist the enemy, mutiny with
the objective of refusal or avoidance of service against the enemy,
and failure to suppress a mutiny with intent to assist the enemy.
	   The Royal British Legion welcomed Reid's express ion of regret
but said members would be disappointed that there would be no
pardons.

Ghana court jails editors in libel case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) - Two newspaper editors have been sentenced to
30-days in prison for publishing details of a court battle launched
by Ghana's first lady, Nana Konadu Rawlings, against a U.S.
magazine that accused her of having links to the narcotics trade.
	   Kwaku Baako Jr., editor of The Guide and Abdul Harruna Atta,
editor of The Statesman, were also fined dlrs 4,500 on Thursday
after being convicted on contempt charges.
	   A lawyer for the editors, Akoto Ampaw, said they planned to
appeal the convictions.
	   Earlier this year, the two editors disregarded a court order
forbidding publication of details surrounding Mrs. Rawlings'
lawsuit against the U.S.-based weekly magazine African Observer.
	   Mrs. Rawlings is the wife of Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings.
	   African Observer printed allegations that Mrs. Rawlings was
linked to drug smuggling.
	   The first lady vigorously denied the allegations and responded
with libel charges against the U.S. publication.

Sanchez Vicario faces Seles again as Spain meets U.S. in Fed Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The United States and Spain square off this
weekend for a Fed Cup semifinal that will feature a rematch between
French Open finalists Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Monica Seles.
	   A powerhouse in this tournament, Spain's women won four of the
five Fed Cups between 1991-1995 and then lost to the United States
in 1996.
	   The country's tennis stars appear to be back on a roll this year
and will be hoping it continues through this weekend.
	   In June, Sanchez Vicario defeated Seles 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 to
win the Roland Garros. Then last week, Carlos Moya, who won the
men's Roland Garros, led Spain's Davis Cup team to its first
semifinals in 11 years on downing Switzerland.
	   In Madrid's Club de Campo clay court, Sanchez Vicario will be
joined by Conchita Martinez, Magui Serna and Vivi Ruano.
	   World No. 5 Seles' teammates are Mary Joe Fernandez, Lisa
Raymond and Fed Cup newcomer Corina Moriaru. Lindsay Davenport was
to have been in the side but was pulled out last week by coach
Billie Jean King.
	   The two countries have faced each other seven times in Fed Cup
competition, with the United States holding the advantage at four
victories against three for Spain.
	   Seles has a 6-0 record in Fed Cup play.
	   The semifinal begins Saturday evening with Sanchez Vicario
taking on Raymond followed by Martinez against Seles.
	   In the reverse singles Sunday, Sanchez Vicario plays Seles and
Martinez faces Raymond. In doubles the same day, Sanchez Vicario
and Martinez are scheduled to face Fernandez and Raymond.
	   The winner will go on to play either defending champion France
or Switzerland who play their World Group I semifinal also this
weekend.

Conran, Hirano share lead in Aiful Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AOMORI, Japan (AP) _ Kosaku Hirano shot a 4-under-par 68 Friday
to share a one-stroke lead with overnight leader Steve Conran
midway through the Aiful Cup.
	   Hirano, who has never won in 13 years as a pro, started the
round with an eagle and had four birdies and two bogeys en route to
an 8-under 136 total.
	   ``It's been a long, long time since last time I led a field in a
tournament,'' said the 45-year-old Hirano. ``I may have a good
chance, however, if I continue to keep the fairway off the tee and
wield the putter as good as I usually do.''
	   Hirano once won a minor event, the Gifu Open, in 1993. But his
best season so far on the Japan PGA Tour came in 1995 when he
earned 3.40 million yen (dlrs 24,300) and finished 149th on the
earnings list.
	   The 32-year-old Conran from Australia, in contention for his
first victory since joining the Japan tour two years ago, shot a 71
for 136.
	   Kimpachi Yoshimura had a 67 to share third at 137 with Nobumitsu
Yuhara, who fired a 68, and Zaw Moe of Myanmar, who shot a 69.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, aiming for back-to-back victories
following his Yonex Open title two weeks ago, shot a 67 and was in
a group of seven tied for sixth at 138.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian militants called for the execution
of Tehran's mayor Friday, a day after he was sentenced to five
years in prison for corruption.
	   About 100 members of the Ansar'e Hezbollah, a Muslim
fundamentalist group allied to hard-liners in the ruling hierarchy,
chanted slogans against the popular mayor outside Tehran
University.
	   ``Death to the plundering mayor! Death to the traitor,'' the
protesters chanted, led by a van mounted with loudspeakers.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was convicted of corruption
Thursday after a month-long trial that was viewed as part of power
struggle between hard-liners and a reformist camp around President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Karbaschi was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, fined the
equivalent of dlrs 330,000 and barred from holding public office
for 20 years.
	   His lawyer says he will appeal the verdict. Friday's
demonstration suggests that certain hard-liners think the mayor
received too light a sentence.
	   Karbaschi, who denied stealing city council money, had denounced
the trial as politically motivated. He was a close ally of Khatami
and manager of the moderate president's 1997 election campaign.
	   As mayor for eight years, he was widely respected for his
efforts to improve the city, building roads and parks and reducing
pollution.
	   Before Friday's protest, a senior hard-line cleric told
congregants at the university's prayer service that it was time to
put the trial behind them.
	   ``I'm gratified that this court case, which had started with
such controversy, ended calmly,'' said Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati,
head of the Guardian Council, which monitors parliament.
	   The arrest of Karbaschi in April sparked riots in Tehran. The
court proceedings were closely reported in the media and widely
discussed.
	   ``Everyone, the people and officials, should avoid creating
tensions now that this trial is over,'' Jannati said.
	   Most people leaving the campus after prayers ignored the Ansar'e
demonstrators, who are known for such protests.

Pfizer applies for approval to sell Viagra in Japan: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A unit of drugmaker Pfizer applied for permission
on Friday to sell its Viagra anti-impotence remedy in Japan, where
the little blue pill has already caused a media sensation.
	   Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Japanese affiliate of New
York-based Pfizer Inc. submitted the application and clinical test
results from the United States to Japan's Health Ministry, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Company officials in Tokyo were unavailable for comment.
	   Viagra's debut has been reported on widely in Japan, especially
in the tabloid press. One weekly magazine even printed an article
advising Japanese readers how to obtain the drug by mail order.
	   The pills, available only by prescription in the U.S., have been
legally imported to Japan by individuals and then resold by
marketers exploiting a ban on selling unapproved drugs wholesale.
	   A Japanese travel agency has even begun tours to Hawaii for the
sole purpose of getting a prescription for Viagra.
	   In Japan 30-tablet bottles of the drug have been sold for as
much as 80,000 yen (dlrs 569).
	   Last week, the health ministry reported Japan's first death of a
man who had taken Viagra, and warned against using it without
proper instruction.

China forecasts more flooding as some Yangtze towns submerged

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ As waters receded in a rain-drenched central
China industrial hub, Beijing ordered local governments along the
Yangtze river Friday to prepare for more flooding.
	   Following an emergency midnight meeting, top disaster relief
officials warned that another flood crest _ the third this month _
was heading for the middle reaches of the Yangtze, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   In a directive to local governments, the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters noted that ``serious flooding'' has
already swamped parts of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces.
	   State-run television showed towns in Hunan's Li county submerged
by flood waters; only the roofs or buildings higher than two
stories poked through the murky brown river water. People stood on
roof tops. Pounding waters toppled one house.
	   More than a month of often heavy downpours have left embankments
along the Yangtze and its lakes and tributaries weakened and
waterlogged. Water levels in the area are near or above their
historical highs, Xinhua said.
	   The system of dikes and embankments reinforced in recent days by
sandbags is the last protective shield for tens of millions of
people and some of China's richest farmland.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji telephoned Hunan Governor Yang Zhengwu
Thursday night to express concern and ordered the military and
police ``to spare no effort to safeguard the people's life and
properties,'' Xinhua reported.
	   More than 1,000 people have died throughout China in flooding
this year from rains that started earlier and fell harder than
usual. Six provinces along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, are among the hardest hit.
	   The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters early
Friday ordered governments on the Yangtze _ from western Sichuan
province to coastal Shanghai _ to reinforce major dikes and keep
watch round-the-clock, Xinhua said.
	   Invoking instructions from President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Zhu, the disaster relief agency warned local officials they would
be held responsible for ensuring people's safety. It ordered the
organizing of patrols to make sure dikes and dams hold.
	   Wuhan's 7 million residents got some relief Friday as blue skies
replaced some of the heaviest rains on record. Runoff that had
overwhelmed the city drainage system began to dissipate, leaving
mud and debris on streets and sidewalks.
	   Much of the city was returning to normal. Merchants went back to
work in street markets still knee-deep in water, although many
shops were closed for lack of electricity.
	   The low-lying Gaogong Street neighborhood, at the junction of
the Yangtze and the Hanshui River, remained under waist-deep water.
Residents moved into the second stories of their homes and piled
furniture on balconies and roofs. Children swam in the flooded
streets.
	   ``It's been like this for 25 days,'' said resident Mei Jianying,
who gets to work by rowboat.

Senior Iranian cleric says Rushdie death sentence is irrevocable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie is irrevocable and Western countries should stop
challenging it, a senior Iranian cleric said Friday.
	   ``Western countries must accept that the death sentence against
Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked under any circumstances, and they
must not discuss this issue again,'' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said
in a Friday sermon at Tehran University. Friday is the Muslim
Sabbath.
	   Jannati, a hard-liner who leads several powerful government
bodies, was referring to last week's visit by a European Union
delegation that urged Iran to distance itself from the bounty set
for killing Rushdie.
	   Iran has refused to revoke its 1989 death sentence on Rushdie,
an Indian-born British writer, whom it accuses of insulting Islam
in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   An official Iranian foundation has offered a reward of more than
dlrs 2 million for Rushdie's death, forcing the author to live in
hiding under British police protection.
	   The talks between the EU and Iranian officials were the first
high-level discussions since relations deteriorated in April 1997
after a German court found that Iranian leaders were involved in
the assassination of four Kurdish-Iranian dissidents in Berlin in
1992.
	   EU officials have said they are keen to normalize ties with Iran
following the election of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric who is trying to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and
domestic policies.
	   But, from the European perspective, the death sentence against
Rushdie remains a major obstacle.

Death toll rises to four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Rescuers on Friday found the body
of another victim of the flooding that hit northeast Bohemia,
raising the death toll to four, the news agency CTK reported.
	   The man, who apparently drowned during flash floods early
Thursday, was found in the village of Pulice, about 130 kilometers
(81 miles) northeast of Prague.
	   ``It was a local man who had been missing,'' the agency quoted a
local policeman as saying.
	   One person still remained unaccounted for Friday afternoon.
	   In neighboring Slovakia, 36 people have been killed and up to 50
are missing following a sudden downpour late Monday that flooded
the Sabinov district in the eastern portion of the country.
	   The flash floods in the Czech Republic came after heavy rains
swamped an area of about 100 square kilometers (40 square miles).
Houses in 20 villages were damaged as three local streams rose
above their banks.
	   Roads were damaged and five bridges collapsed in the floods, the
agency said. Damage to the roads was estimated at some 200 million
koruna (dlrs 6.2 million.)
	   While water levels in the rivers Bela and Zlaty potok were
slowly declining, water in the Dobra River was still on the rise.
	   CTK said a rescuer was killed and another was seriously injured
in an ambulance accident in the region Friday.

Croatia-Netherlands Fed Cup likely without Lucic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOL, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian tennis star Mirjana Lucic will miss
the Fed Cup matchup against the Netherlands this weekend, tour
officials said Friday.
	   The officials said that after initially agreeing to play, Lucic
has not showed up or contacted them about playing and is thus not
expected to participate. Iva Majoli, the WTA's No. 20, will play
singles and doubles, with Silvija Talaja, ranked 145, playing the
second single match.
	   Jelena Kostanic, who won the girls doubles championship in
Wimbledon, will join Majoli in the doubles match on Sunday.
	   Lucic, 16, became the nation's favorite as she swiftly made it
to the WTA's top 50. She is currently 44th on the WTA list.
	   Majoli also did not do well in Wimbledon, being ousted in the
second round by Nathalie Tauziat of France. Talaja also left
Wimbledon quickly, after a first-round defeat.

After Iranian missile tests, Israel asks for U.S. intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the wake of an Iranian missile test launch,
Israel has asked the United States to try harder to prevent the
transfer of missile technology to Iran, an official said Friday.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called Leon Feurth, a top aide to
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and asked that Gore raise the Iranian
missile threat in talks with Russian leaders in Moscow this
weekend, said an official close to Sharansky, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and know-how to
the Iranian missile program. Russia has denied this.
	   Sharansky told the Gore aide that Wednesday's Iranian test
launch demonstrated how serious the threat to Israel was.
	   The Shahab-3 missile tested by Iran has a potential range of 800
miles (1,300 kilometers), enough to strike any target in Israel.
	   Sharansky told Feurth that if the transfer of Russian technology
was halted now, the Iranians would be unable to complete the
development of the missile system.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the defense minister said the test launch
gave new impetus to his demand for an additional dlrs 600 million
in defense spending. ``We'll need more resources, a bigger budget,
more deterrence capability and more motivation,'' Mordechai said.
	   The test launch came amid recent warnings from Israeli defense
experts that Israel's army was not ready to counter future threats,
such as ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the
hands of Iran and Iraq, Israel's most implacable foes.

Gore, Kiriyenko draw up plans for presidential summit

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko drew up plans Friday for a summit between
their presidents that is likely to take place in just over a
month's time.
	   It was Gore's first encounter with Kiriyenko since he became
prime minister earlier this year, and the vice president said he
was impressed.
	   ``He's committed to reform,'' Gore told NBC-TV News. ``He's a
dynamic, decisive young prime minister. He seems to be off to a
great start.''
	   Gore has long co-chaired a joint commission on scientific and
technical concerns, previously headed by Kiriyenko's predecessor,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   ``It's good to see so many long-time friends on your side of the
table,'' Gore said after shaking hands with the Russian delegation
Friday morning at the President Hotel. ``I want you to know that
President (Bill) Clinton and I are absolutely committed to
deepening these relationships.''
	   Their main task was to set the agenda for a Moscow summit
between Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, planned for the
end of August or early September.
	   However, the two sides also discussed two topics of long-term
concern to the United States: the spread of Russian missile
technology to Iran, and Russia's long-stalled ratification of the
START II arms reduction treaty.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko were expected to sign two agreements by the
end of the day, a senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition
he not be identified.
	   One pact would set up a program to address the problems of
Russia's ``defense cities'' _ isolated research communities that
are having trouble making their way in the new economy. The
agreement would include U.S. funding and know-how for converting
such facilities to civilian use and finding new jobs for their
scientists.
	   The second agreement would provide U.S. funding for a new plant
to reprocess plutonium from Russian nuclear weapons into fuel for
power plants. The plan is designed to prevent nuclear materials
from getting into the wrong hands.
	   The two sides also discussed funding for joint space programs,
which have been delayed by Russia's cash problems. Gore won a
promise from the Russians to find the money to fulfill its
obligations to the international space station, whose launch has
been pushed back to November, said Yuri Koptev, head of Russia's
space agency.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko both described the U.S.-Russian relationship
in grand terms, saying tackling common problems will help it grow
stronger.
	   ``The U.S.-Russian relationship will play a key role, indeed the
decisive role, in determining what kind of a world we create for
our children and our grandchildren,'' Gore said.
	   ``We hope that by the 21st century we will have resolved all
outstanding issues and eliminated the negative consequences of the
past,'' Kiriyenko added.
	   The two men also touched on Russia's financial crisis. However,
Gore had little to say on the issue, the U.S. official said, since
Kiriyenko displayed both knowledge of the problems and the
determination to fix them.
	   Kiriyenko was named prime minister in March with a mandate to
speed up the country's economic reforms, but he has been battling
the financial crisis since shortly after he assumed the post.
	   Gore spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in Moscow on
Thursday evening.
	   The vice president toured the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear
reactor Thursday, becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official the
site of the world's worst nuclear accident.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Relief workers sealed off the
most devastated areas of Papua New Guinea Friday and evacuated
survivors of a tsunami that killed more a thousand people and left
decomposing corpses littering swathes of the northern coast.
	   The move means officials will probably never know the full death
toll from the waves that rolled over entire villages after dark a
week ago, just as many residents were tucked into their huts on
this Pacific island nation.
	   Lt. Col. Rod West, commander of the Australian army relief
efforts, said the most affected areas would be turned into
graveyards to allow the hundreds and perhaps thousands of
unrecovered bodies to decompose.
	   ``Some of these bodies are very much deteriorated,'' West said.
``The plan is to seal the areas and let nature takes its course _
the natural flushing of the lagoon.''
	   Thwarted by gnarled mangrove swamps, authorities decided to
abandon the effort to retrieve bodies around Sissano lagoon and
seal off the 3-square-mile (8-sq.-kilometer) area. An unknown
number of remaining survivors were evacuated to help prevent the
spread of disease.

Indonesia criticizes Pakistan, India, other nuclear weapon states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Indonesia regrets that recent tests
by India and Pakistan have made it harder to limit the spread of
nuclear arms and remains disillusioned with nuclear powers'
reluctance to give up their weapons, the country's foreign minister
said Friday.
	   ``Indonesia cannot condone nuclear tests by any country at any
time,'' Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in a speech to his
counterparts in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ``Not only do such tests violate the principles underlying the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
they could also trigger a nuclear arms race and destabilize the
security environment of our region,'' he said.
	   Alatas also said non-nuclear states have an incentive to acquire
nuclear weapons as long as countries that currently possess them
are allowed to keep them.
	   ASEAN seeks to make Southeast Asia a nuclear weapons free zone,
including a ban against such weapons on ships traversing
international waters in the region.
	   The Southeast Asian foreign ministers will meet next week with
counterparts from the United States, China, Russia and Europe to
discuss security issues.
	   Alatas suggested that slow progress on implementation of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty could be discussed during those meetings.
	   Indonesia is becoming ``thoroughly disillusioned as regards the
commitment of the nuclear weapon states to the full implementation
of the treaty,'' he said.
	   ``The rejection by some nuclear weapon states of a multilateral
approach toward a step-by-step reduction of nuclear arsenals is
contrary to their commitment to pursue the ultimate goal, the total
elimination of nuclear weapons.''

 &UR; Eds: RECAST and UPDATES with Rugova quotes, U.S. ambassador
Christopher Hill arriving in Pristina, new U.N. figures on
refugees; newspaper interview by KLA officer &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian politician
demanded Friday that foreign powers intervene to stop fighting in
Kosovo and warned violence could spill into neighboring regions.
	   ``We demand international protection for Kosovo and its people
in order to stop further conflict that could spread to a wider
region,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, a moderate leader of Kosovo
Albanians, about 90 percent of the province of two million.
	   ``Serbian military and police forces continue with attacks and
massacres against the Albanian population,'' he said.
	   Rugova was to meet later in the day with Christopher Hill, the
U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, who is trying to
kick-start stalled peace talks with the Yugoslav government. Hill
arrived in Pristina on Friday after meeting Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic in Belgrade.
	   In an interview published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, Lum Haxhiu, said to be an officer in the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army, insisted that the ``KLA cannot be controlled by
any Albanian political force because it's a national army, a
people's army, and its policy is national, not a party policy.''
	   Recalling a recent meeting he and other KLA leaders had with
Richard Holbrooke, a top U.S. envoy, in Kosovo, Haxhiu was quoted
as saying:
	   ``We made it clear to him that we won't give up arms until we
free every part of Kosovo. I told Mr. Holbrooke: `Recognize the
independence of Kosovo and I'll be the first to break my rifle.'''
	   The U.S. rejects independence for Kosovo but hasn't ruled out
military force to halt the five-month conflict between Serb
security forces and secessionist guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army that has killed hundreds.
	   Western diplomats fear the fighting could ignite secessionist
passions among the large ethnic Albanian community in neighboring
Macedonia.
	   Neither ethnic Albanian nor Serb officials reported new fighting
Friday in Kosovo.
	   Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have accused each other of summary
executions, beatings and other atrocities during recent battles for
the central Kosovo town of Orahovac.
	   The fighting began a week ago when the KLA assaulted the
Serb-held town of 20,000. After several days of fighting that left
many dead, the Serbs regained control of Orahovac.
	   The Geneva office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
said Friday the Orahovac fighting created from 15,000 to 20,000 new
refugees, adding to an earlier total of more than 100,000 Kosovars,
who fled their homes to escape fighting.
	   The European Union plans a peace mission to Kosovo next week,
while the United States warns that outside force to stop the
killing remains an option.
	   The EU announcement came Thursday, the same day Walter Slocombe,
undersecretary of defense for policy, said the U.S. administration
has not ``ruled out'' unilateral military force or participating in
a NATO plan for action. ``We are prepared to act alone if
necessary,'' he said.
	   Also on Thursday, an aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic blasted top U.S. envoy, Robert Gelbard, calling him ``an
accomplice of women and children murderers in Kosovo and of
criminals who kidnap civilians, supports terrorism and terrorist
gangs.''
	   The aide, Ivica Dacic, apparently expressed Milosevic's anger
that Gelbard had met with Serbian opposition politicians while
looking for support in peace efforts.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Armin Meier on Friday became the
first cyclist to publicly admit taking the banned
performance-enhancing substance EPO in a widening drug scandal that
was overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   Riders, meanwhile, balked at starting the 12th stage of the
competition, saying the drug investigation was wrecking the sport.
They later hesitantly moved into motion.
	   Meier said that during police questioning he had admitted to
taking EPO.
	   ``Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it,'' he told France Info radio. ``I'm just the victim of a
system.''
	   Meier refused to say if any of his teammates had also taken the
banned substance, and he criticized the police treatment of riders
during the interrogation.
	   ``I feel a little like a criminal. Each rider had two police
officers. They put me under pressure for four or five hours. They
took everything. I undressed. They could see all of me. I went into
a cell with a wooden bed.
	   ``But I feel better inside because I have told the truth.
Perhaps it is good for the sport.'' he added.
	   By Friday afternoon, all riders from the Festina team had been
released.
	   One of them, Richard Virenque, maintained throughout questioning
that he had not taken illegal drugs, said his lawyer Gilbert
Collard.
	   Joint sporting directors Miguel Moreno and Michael Gros were
also freed Friday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lille, Festina team director Bruno
Roussel, team doctor Eric Ryckaert and physiotherapist Willy Voet
-- all under formal investigation in the affair -- gave their
versions on the doping issue in a three-hour court session.
	   The sporting director and team doctor of the Dutch TVM team,
detained Thursday, were also being questioned Friday by police in
the southern town of Pamiers. They could be held until Saturday.
	   The TVM team represented the latest chapter in the unfolding
doping drama surrounding the Tour de France, the world's prestige
cycling competition.
	   About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a team car
near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time, but the
affair rebounded in the wake of the Festina scandal.
	   Jean-Louis Bessis, lawyer for Festina physiotherapist Willy
Voet, called for an immediate, wide-ranging debate among teams and
tour officials. If that does not happen ``we will not have had the
political and judicial will to clean up the Tour de France,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile a lawyer for the French Cycling Federation, arriving
at a Lille court for a meeting called by the investigating judge,
said that many have been too quick to condemn cyclists.
	   ``If they are simply suspected of having taken doping products
the law of 1989 does not consider it illegal,'' said Paul Mauriac.
	   Even before the tour was hit by its latest problems Friday,
influential daily Le Monde called for an end to this year's race,
contending authorities need to get to the bottom of their
investigation.
	   ``Tour de France discredited,'' proclaimed its front page
headline Friday.
	   ``Who, from now on, could rejoice in seeing the rest of a
compromised peloton enter Paris on Sunday, Aug. 2? Who would have
the heart to applaud the winner of a race without faith or law?,''
the paper said in a commentary.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 700 firefighters and soldiers worked
Friday to remove debris from a resort area in southwestern Poland
where flash floods have killed at least seven people.
	   Water levels on the Dusznica Bystrzycka river were dropping and
many of the 1,200 people evacuated from towns near the border with
the Czech Republic had returned home, according to Jan Jarosz of
the provincial flood committee in Walbrzych.
	   He said the death toll from the flash floods, which hit early
Thursday, remained at seven, but several other people were
apparently missing.
	   The water damaged more than 100 houses, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
of roads and dozens of small bridges in the Klodzko region, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, he said.
	   A railway link between Klodzko and Kudowa Zdroj, a border
crossing town with the Czech Republic, remained closed after the
flooding damaged part of the tracks and a bridge.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who ordered immediate government
assistance to area residents, traveled to the region Friday.
	   A government minister in charge of flood recovery assured
parliament Friday that the government was distributing food, water
and blankets to all in need.
	   The official, Jerzy Widzyk, also promised immediate damage
compensation from the government.
	   Before his departure, Buzek said the local government had been
warned about the heavy storms that hit southwestern Poland
Wednesday night, but the sudden flood hit places where people never
expected water could reach them.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage. But the part of the Klodzko
region which suffered Thursday was not affected then.

Dutch soccer legend is people's choice for national coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Johan Cruyff is the nation's
favorite to succeed Guus Hiddink as the Dutch team coach, according
to a survey published Friday.
	   One in three people interviewed for the poll picked Cruyff, who
captained the Dutch ``Clockwork Orange'' team that lost the 1974
World Cup final to West Germany, as Hiddink's successor, Amsterdam
daily Het Parool reported.
	   Cruyff, who has coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant
Barcelona, is currently working as a television soccer analyst.
	   Hiddink was hired as coach by Real Madrid after guiding the
Netherlands to a semifinal berth in the World Cup finals in France
and the Dutch soccer association is hunting for a successor.
	   The man regarded by the Dutch media as favorite for the job,
former Glasgow Celtic manager Wim Jansen, was picked by just 12
percent of the 1,000 people interviewed for the poll by market
research company NIPO.
	   Jansen played alongside Cruyff in the 1974 World Cup final and
also was in the Dutch team that reached the final four years later
only to lose again.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ In Papua New Guinea's tsunami
disaster zone, Brother Leo Ahanotu trudges through thick swamp mud
to reach survivors and celebrate mass with them. Meanwhile, pilot
Don Harvey prepares his small plane to make yet another landing on
a rough airstrip hacked from the jungle to deliver aid.
	   The two men are part of a missionary network which brought the
news of the disaster to the world, and which has been crucial to
the massive rescue and relief effort.
	   But the network, a latticework of citizen's band radios,
unreliable local phone lines and light aircraft was servicing the
stricken region long before the disaster, and will be here long
after the emergency is over. It links some of the most isolated and
primitive regions in the world.
	   For thousands of years, the hundreds of different tribes on the
island of New Guinea have existed in isolation, maintaining
primitive _ sometimes cabalistic _ rituals and customs, screened
from the outside world by volcanic mountain terrain and
impenetrable jungle.
	   About 80 percent of Papua New Guinea's 4 million residents live
in rural provinces, in villages sitting atop mountains that plunge
thousands of feet into deep river valleys. The next day's village
may be a days' walk away. A similar existence is common on the
western side of the island, in Indonesia's easternmost province,
Irian Jaya.
	   Into this climate come the missionaries and those who work for
them, like Tom Hans, who told The Associated Press he was inspired
by the tales of Christians opening up the jungles of Africa and
South America.
	   ``The landscape is absolutely beautiful but the terrain is
amazing,'' Hans, a retired U.S. Army helicopter pilot from
Worthington, Indiana, said Friday.
	   ``Most of the airstrips are 500 feet long with a 10 degree
gradient, so you land uphill and take off downhill. They are like
ski jumps; you can't see over the edge and you just go.''
	   Hans, who retired a Major after serving for 20 years, including
in Korea, is a pilot in Irian Jaya for the Missionary Aviation
Fellowship, an international Christian organization which flies in
remote regions around the world.
	   It was MAF pilot Harvey who first overflew the Sissano Lagoon,
into which four villages and their inhabitants were swept when the
destructive waves hit on July 18, killing at least 1,300, with
about 6,000 still missing and leaving thousands more homeless.
	   The organization's response was quick.
	   ``I flew down there and could see the complete destruction. I
went and got special dispensation _ because we are not allowed the
fly on Sundays _ then we flew all day Sunday. We brought back a lot
of broken people,'' said Drew Sumner, the organization's regional
manager.
	   For three days, the missionaries and the air service were
central to the relief and rescue effort: organizing food and
medical treatment, transporting hundreds of injured people to
hospital.
	   The government declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, and the
police and military took control of the operation.
	   Unless specifically requested to make flights, the MAF and
missionaries have started returning to their normal work:
delivering children to school, evacuating the ill from other
villages, carrying priests on their God's work.
	   ``Sometimes we're the mailman, the bank man, the maintenance
man,'' said Harvey of the pilot's role in remote villages. ``We
cash checks, sometimes help in medical situations, all sorts of
things.''
	   In an open air service in topical heat, Ahanotu breaks wafers of
bread and gives them to villagers to complete his service. As the
Nigerian born missionary prepares to return to his home village
down the coast, he is asked by a villager whether he will return.
	   ``They want me to come back. If they want that, I will come
back. I will keep coming back.'' he said.

Togo's president sworn in for 5-year term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ President Gnassigbe Eyadema, who has ruled
Togo for 31 years since taking power in a bloody coup, was sworn in
for another five-year term Friday following a June election victory
disputed by opposition groups and foreign observers.
	   Three African presidents and a number of other foreign diplomats
were among the 3,000 people attending the solemn swearing-in
ceremony held in the public Palais de Congres meeting hall in the
capital of Lome.
	   But critics, including the 37 opposition members in the
country's 81-person parliament, boycotted the ceremony after
calling for a general strike Friday to protest Eyadema's second
five-year elected term.
	   Soldiers patrolled the streets on foot and in armored vehicles
to prevent possible violence although business appeared to continue
normally in the streets of the capital.
	   Several days of riots and protests followed Eyadema's declared
victory following June 21 presidential elections in which
vote-counting was interrupted and the chief electoral officer
resigned complaining of harassment.
	   The European Union and United States criticized the elections as
flawed.
	   A one-day general strike on July 17 was widely observed by
workers and business owners and only a few government offices
remained open.
	   The country's most popular opposition leader, Gilchrist Olympio,
officially came in second after claiming an early election victory.
Olympio lives in exile and fears for his life in Togo.
	   Olympio is the son of Togo's first president who was killed by
Eyadema.
	   Eyadema, wearing a somber civilian suit, pledged to uphold human
rights and the country's constitution while developing the economy,
which is among the poorest in the world.
	   The constitution limits Togolese presidents to two five-year
terms in office. Eyadema won his first term in 1993 after governing
for 26 years as a dictator.
	   Attending Friday's ceremony were the presidents of Ivory Coast,
Benin and Niger.

Police arrest former Duvalier father-in-law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police have arrested the former
father-in-law of ousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier on
allegations of corruption and stealing public money, Radio
Haiti-Inter reported Friday.
	   Ernest Bennett was arrested Thursday at a Port-au-Prince home,
the private radio station said.
	   His daughter, Michelle, married Duvalier in 1980. Duvalier
inherited power from his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
Jean-Claude Duvalier's marriage coincided with the downturn in the
Haitian economy and the excesses of the regime were blamed on his
free-spending wife.
	   Bennett was a small-time coffee speculator at the time of the
marriage. He ended up with a Mercedes-Benz car dealership and some
part of every big business deal in Haiti.
	   He became the symbol of the Duvalier ``kleptocracy,'' which
combined systematic repression with the illicit enrichment of the
dictator's cronies.
	   A popular uprising ousted Duvalier in 1986, and the Bennett
family fled Haiti. Michelle divorced her husband and remarried
after Duvalier went broke in France.
	   In 1986, the property of the entire Bennett family, accused of
misappropriating state funds, was placed under seal.
	   Bennett has slipped in and out of Haiti for years, and there was
a public outcry during one of his visits in January 1997. It was
not clear what suddenly prompted Haitian authorities to act.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine and France have agreed to increase
political and economic ties, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said Friday after a day of talks with leaders of the former Soviet
republic.
	   Vedrine met with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma to prepare
for French President Jacques Chirac's visit to Ukraine in
September. They also discussed trade, political, military and
economic cooperation, and the lingering problems related to the
Chernobyl nuclear accident.
	   ``We have a firm intention to increase political and economic
relations with Ukraine and jointly discuss issues related to
European development,'' Vedrine told reporters.
	   Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said Vedrine's visit would help
Ukraine establish closer relations with the European Union.
	   ``This visit shows that integration into Europe is our
priority,'' Tarasyuk said at a news conference.
	   Ukrainian-French relations have grown recently, following
Kuchma's visit to France last year and a meeting of a bilateral
cooperation commission in March.
	   France has also helped Ukraine deal with consequences of the
1986 Chernobyl accident, and has expressed interest in developing
Ukraine's An-70 military transport plane.
	   Military cooperation between the two countries could eventually
result in a number of ``interesting projects,'' Tarasyuk said.
	   Vedrine's talks with Kuchma covered a wide range of subjects,
including plans to repair the leaky sarcophagus over the ruined
Chernobyl nuclear reactor and construction of two new reactors to
compensate for the plant's planned closure by 2000.
	   ``(France) supports provision of foreign loans to finish the two
reactors, and we need to take more active measures in this
direction,'' Vedrine said.
	   His meeting with Kuchma also focused on European security issues
and Kiev's cooperation with NATO. The two even discussed France's
victory in the World Cup soccer tournament, said Kuchma's spokesman
Oleksandr Maidannyk.
	   Vedrine, who arrived in Kiev late Thursday, also met with First
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko and parliament Speaker
Oleksandr Tkachenko.

Thousands of soldiers to be mobilized ahead of banned rally: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military will mobilize
around 9,000 soldiers in the capital city of Jakarta to stand guard
in anticipation of a rally by supporters of a prominent opposition
figure.
	   Police have refused to grant opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri and her supporters permission to stage the protest on
July 27, which was planned to commemorate the anniversary of a
bloody 1996 crackdown.
	   ``We have prepared 90 company-level squads to anticipate all
possible security disturbance,'' Jakarta Military Commander Maj.
Gen. Djadja Suparman was quoted as saying Friday by the Antara news
agency.
	   Supporters of Megawati criticized the the military's plans to
mobilize troops.
	   ``Such an overacting reaction will only damage the image of the
security apparatus themselves,'' said Sukowaluyo Mintorahardjo, a
former noted legislator and ardent supporter of Megawati.
	   ``We just want to remind the nation that the raid that left some
deaths and missing has yet been resolved,'' he told the Associated
Press.
	   Two years ago Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto. That
led, however, to her ouster from the Indonesia Democratic Party in
June of 1996.
	   Megawati supporters protested the move by occupying party
headquarters, but on July 27 of that year rival party members
backed by the military and police staged a predawn raid on the
facility.
	   In the ensuing violence, at least five people were killed and
dozens of others were reported missing.

Arab League to ask U.N. to send fact-finding mission on refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Arab League will ask the United Nations to
dispatch a fact-finding mission to Israel to investigate the state
of property once owned by Palestinian refugees, a PLO official said
Friday.
	   Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes or were driven out by
Israeli troops during the 1948 Mideast war. Many of the refugees
still live in camps scattered throughout the Middle East.
	   The fate of the refugees is to be negotiated in future talks
between Israel and the Palestinians on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Assad Abdel Rahman, the PLO official responsible for refugee
affairs, said the decision to ask for a U.N. fact-finding mission
was made during a meeting of representatives from countries that
have absorbed Palestinian refugees, including Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon. The meeting took place in Egypt five days ago, he said.

Lebanese journalist sentenced to three years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A military court has sentenced a Lebanese
journalist in absentia to three years in prison on security
charges, his lawyer said Friday.
	   The sentence was imposed Thursday on Pierre Atallah, a reporter
and copy-editor for the independent daily An-Nahar, who is in exile
in France.
	   The court convicted Atallah of ``visiting an enemy country
(Israel) as well as insulting security and judicial authorities.''
On top of the prison sentence, it fined him 500,000 Lebanese pounds
(dlrs 330), lawyer Butros Harb said.
	   Atallah, 38, fled to France in May 1997 after unidentified
assailants attacked him near his Beirut house on the same day that
the court charged him with spying for Israel.
	   In 1996 police detained him for two weeks after he interviewed
the leader of a small pro-Israeli, Christian militia in the
Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon. Atallah said the
interview was part of his job.
	   Atallah was detained for another two weeks in 1997 during a
sweep on right-wing Christians suspects after an attack on a Syrian
minibus that killed one person.
	   He has denied all charges of involvement with Israel against
Lebanon.

Canada urges South Korea to join land mine ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said Friday that military confrontation with communist
North Korea should not stop South Korea from signing a treaty
banning land mines.
	   ``Antipersonnel mines are no longer an acceptable weapon of
war,'' Axworthy said during a luncheon hosted by the Korea-Canada
Society.
	   The Canadian minister said South Korea can renounce antipersonal
mines without increasing the danger of a North Korean invasion
because the global ban does not apply to mines triggered by tanks
and other heavy vehicles.
	   The United States and South Korea refused to join 127 countries
in signing the Canada-initiated treaty last year, saying land mines
along the border with the North serve as a deterrent to war.
	   Washington also insists that land mines along the Korean border
are needed to protect the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.
	   Also Friday, Axworthy, who is in Seoul on a four-day trip, met
with his South Korean counterpart, Park Chung-soo, and President
Kim Dae-jung to discuss trade and security issues on the divided
Korean peninsula.
	   He planned to visit the demilitarized zone between the two
Koreas Saturday. An estimated 1 million land mines are planted
inside the 155-mile-long, 2.4-mile-wide zone.

Malaysian comedy inspired by Asia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Financial turmoil, Viagra and the
Titanic have taken center stage in a Malaysian satirical comedy on
the fallout of Southeast Asia's economic crisis.
	   ``Instant Cafe _ Bullish on Bouncing Back,'' a two-hour comedy
review inspired by the economic downturn, highlights the region's
touchiest issues, peppering them with a satirical look at what has
made Malaysia's plunge particularly colorful.
	   The name of the show is a spoof on a widely ridiculed government
TV commercial that promises blue skies and an economy ``bullish on
bouncing back.''
	   The performance _ which jabs at the country's leadership,
policies, power struggles and crisis buzzwords _ is wildly
provocative in a country whose leadership frowns on public displays
of social commentary and criticism.
	   It comes at a time when the media have been reprimanded for
``negative'' coverage and the country's top two newspaper editors
were forced to resign last week.
	   ``I think the reason why we exist is that those in power regard
us as proof of a more tolerant society,'' said Jo Kukathas, the
artistic director for the troupe, Instant Cafe. Like all theater
groups, it was required to get a production permit from City Hall.
	   The government has even hired Instant Cafe in the past to
perform at private functions and international conferences. ``It's
a very interesting paradox,'' said Kukathas.
	   The comedy would seem to pose little threat to national order.
Its plays are performed in English, rather than the more widely
spoken Bahasa Malaysia. And the show, which sold out after opening
night Monday in Kuala Lumpur, runs only five days and draws an
audience of about 300 middle- to upper-class Malaysians and
foreigners.
	   ``We say things that are subversive but we're allowed to say
things that are subversive,'' said Kukathas, who acts in the show
and helped write the script.
	   Through skits and songs using Viagra and the Titanic as
metaphors, the show says: If this once vigorous economy is not
revived, the country is going to sink.
	   Issues range from the downfall of Indonesia's longtime President
Suharto to chaos at Malaysia's new multibillion dollar airport.
	   In one skit, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's character sings a
parody to The Carpenters' tune of on ``Top of the World.'' In one
breath, he blames the economic crisis on the foreign media and
foreign currency speculators. Next, he denies Malaysia's economic
woes are so bad after all.
	   In a spoof on a TV talk show about Viagra, the host suggests
some Malaysia-specific varieties: a pill that causes bloating for
the 2 million people stricken by the country's water shortage, or
another that helps maintain fiscal virility so users can maintain
loan payments.
	   It closes with a parody of the Titanic, featuring a sinking ship
of 20 million passengers that is Malaysia _ ``the ship of
subsidized dreams on a maiden voyage to unreality,'' says a
narrator.
	   Mahathir, at the helm until the end, blames the crash on a
Jewish currency speculator _ a reference to his attack on U.S.
financier George Soros. In the skit, Soros is referred to as
``Goldberg or Rosenberg, no, Iceberg!''

Schumacher can overtake Hakkinen for Formula One lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Michael Schumacher can take the
Formula One lead and drive Ferrari closer to the coveted title in
the 10th race of the season, the Grand Prix of Austria.
	   Schumacher trails Mika Hakkinen of McLaren-Mercedes by two
points going into Sunday's race, the 10th in the 17-race Formula
One season, and has the momentum after three straight victories.
	   In Friday's free practice, Schumacher posted only the seventh
fastest time over two sessions. But the free practice is used to
experiment with tires and set-ups and usually means little for the
starting grid, which will be determined in Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``We had a few more difficulties than expected,'' Schumacher
said. ``On my first run a front wheel locked up and I went off the
track. I lost the rest of the morning session while the mechanics
worked on the car to repair the damage from the gravel.''
	   ``In the afternoon, I had a similar situation _ this time a rear
wheel locked up. We will have a lot of work to do tomorrow to be
competitive in qualifying,'' Schumacher said.
	   David Coulthard gave the sagging McLaren fortunes a much-needed
boost when he posted the fastest time in the free practice of one
minute, 13.703 seconds over the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) lap at the
A1-Ring.
	   Hakkinen, who leads Schumacher 56-54 in the drivers' standings,
had the third fastest time of 1:13.746. Giancarlo Fisichella in a
Benetton-Playlife was second in 1:13.704, just 1/1000th of a second
behind Coulthard.
	   After dominating the early past of the season, the McLaren team
has gone into a slump.
	   Coulthard has finished only one of his last four races, a sixth
place in the Grand Prix of France on June 28.
	   Hakkinen has won four races this season, but he is winless since
the Grand Prix of Monaco on May 24. He was forced to retire in
Canada, finished third in France and second in Silverstone at the
Grand Prix of Britain two weeks ago.
	   That finish is still contested. As Hakkinen took the checkered
flag in the final lap, Schumacher was in the box sitting out a
10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. Schumacher
was awarded victory since he had led Hakkinen by more than 10
seconds. McLaren has appealed against the ruling and the sport's
governing body will make a ruling Monday in Paris.
	   In last year's Austrian Grand Prix, the first in 10 years and
the first to be held on the revamped circuit once popularly called
Zeltweg after the nearby village, Schumacher was thwarted by
another 10-second penalty.
	   The penalty that took Schumacher into the box allowed Jacques
Villeneuve to race to victory and take a decisive step toward the
Formula One championship.
	   But Villeneuve and his Williams-Mecachrome team have been
struggling this season and the Canadian has yet to finish among the
top three. Villeneuve's best finishes this season were a pair of
fourth places, at the San Marino GP and in France.
	   There was little encouragement for the reigning champion, who
had the 13th fastest time in Friday's practice. His Williams
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen did even worse, being left in 17th
place after spinning out and finishing in the gravel.
	   Villeneuve announced Thursday that he was leaving Williams at
the end of the season for the new British American Racing team.
Frentzen also seems unlikely to remain at Williams.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has formally charged a
Rwandan for crimes against humanity during his country's 1994
genocide, officials said Friday.
	   The Rwandan, who was not identified, has been detained in
Switzerland since he was discovered here two years ago. He is
accused of taking part in the killings while mayor of a small
community in Gitarama province.
	   The chairman of a Swiss military tribunal assigned the case
expects to be able to reach a judgment before the end of this year,
said a statement by Dieter Weber, chief military prosecutor in the
Swiss army.
	   Weber said that, while the trial will be conducted in
Switzerland, it is possible that some witnesses will be questioned
by satellite in Rwanda.
	   Switzerland and other countries with less important suspects
have been encouraged to try them on their own territory rather than
add to the backlog of international courts.
	   Last year, Switzerland handed over Rwandan Alfred Musema to face
trial before the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in
Arusha, Tanzania.
	   A former Rwandan tea factory director, Musema was arrested in
Switzerland in February 1995 at a home for asylum-seekers. He was
accused of organizing the murder of ethnic Tutsis who worked at the
Gisovu tea plantation near the western Rwandan city of Kibuye.
	   Some 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed in the
slaughter planned by Rwanda's then Hutu-led government over a
three-month period in 1994.
	   In Switzerland's first war crimes trial in April 1997, a
military court acquitted a Bosnian Serb suspect and ordered that
the man be paid 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 69,000) compensation.
	   Investigations are under way into a ``handful'' of suspected war
criminals from the former Yugoslavia, Weber said.

Malaysian comedy inspired by Asia's economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Financial turmoil, Viagra and the
Titanic have taken center stage in a Malaysian satirical comedy on
the fallout of Southeast Asia's economic crisis.
	   ``Instant Cafe _ Bullish on Bouncing Back,'' a two-hour comedy
review inspired by the economic downturn, highlights the region's
touchiest issues, peppering them with a satirical look at what has
made Malaysia's plunge particularly colorful.
	   The name of the show is a spoof on a widely ridiculed government
TV commercial that promises blue skies and an economy ``bullish on
bouncing back.''
	   The performance _ which jabs at the country's leadership,
policies, power struggles and crisis buzzwords _ is wildly
provocative in a country whose leadership frowns on public displays
of social commentary and criticism.
	   It comes at a time when the media have been reprimanded for
``negative'' coverage and the country's top two newspaper editors
were forced to resign last week.
	   ``I think the reason why we exist is that those in power regard
us as proof of a more tolerant society,'' said Jo Kukathas, the
artistic director for the troupe, Instant Cafe. Like all theater
groups, it was required to get a production permit from City Hall.
	   The government has even hired Instant Cafe in the past to
perform at private functions and international conferences. ``It's
a very interesting paradox,'' said Kukathas.
	   The comedy would seem to pose little threat to national order.
Its plays are performed in English, rather than the more widely
spoken Bahasa Malaysia. And the show, which sold out after opening
night Monday in Kuala Lumpur, runs only five days and draws an
audience of about 300 middle- to upper-class Malaysians and
foreigners.
	   ``We say things that are subversive but we're allowed to say
things that are subversive,'' said Kukathas, who acts in the show
and helped write the script.
	   Through skits and songs using Viagra and the Titanic as
metaphors, the show says: If this once vigorous economy is not
revived, the country is going to sink.
	   Issues range from the downfall of Indonesia's longtime President
Suharto to chaos at Malaysia's new multibillion dollar airport.
	   In one skit, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's character sings a
parody to The Carpenters' tune of on ``Top of the World.'' In one
breath, he blames the economic crisis on the foreign media and
foreign currency speculators. Next, he denies Malaysia's economic
woes are so bad after all.
	   In a spoof on a TV talk show about Viagra, the host suggests
some Malaysia-specific varieties: a pill that causes bloating for
the 2 million people stricken by the country's water shortage, or
another that helps maintain fiscal virility so users can maintain
loan payments.
	   It closes with a parody of the Titanic, featuring a sinking ship
of 20 million passengers that is Malaysia _ ``the ship of
subsidized dreams on a maiden voyage to unreality,'' says a
narrator.
	   Mahathir, at the helm until the end, blames the crash on a
Jewish currency speculator _ a reference to his attack on U.S.
financier George Soros. In the skit, Soros is referred to as
``Goldberg or Rosenberg, no, Iceberg!''

Riders, disgusted by doping scandal, make late start

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with all Festina riders released; background;

	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France (AP) _ Riders delayed the Tour de
France for two hours Friday, saying they were ``fed up'' and
``revolted'' by the doping investigation that has enveloped the
prestigious event.
	   All the riders for the Festina team, meanwhile, were released
from custody by Friday afternoon. But two officials from the Dutch
TVM team were still being questioned.
	   After refusing to leave the starting point for an hour, all of
the tour's riders then ambled slowly on their bikes for another
hour.
	   Finally, they went into full speed 16 kms (10 miles) from the
starting point _ and two hours after the official starting time.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' the world's No. 1 cyclist, Laurent
Jalabert of France, told Radio Tour, the station that follows the
race.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone. We won't cycle
and that's the end of it.''
	   Jalabert said the riders were all ``revolted'' that cycling had
taken a backseat to the doping investigation.
	   However, Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc helped negotiate a
start to the 12th stage, which covers 222 kms (138 miles) from
Tarascon to Le Cap d'Agde.
	   It was one of the most dramatic moments of the doping scandal
that has haunted the Tour since its July 11 start in Dublin,
Ireland.
	   The last time riders made such a group action was in the
aftermath of a rider's death in 1995.
	   Three members of the Festina team, expelled from the Tour last
week, admitted to police that they took drugs to improve their
performances, according to LCI television.
	   ``Yes, I said I took EPO, how I took it, why I took it and all
that,'' said Swiss rider for Festina, Armin Meier, in an interview
with France Info radio.
	   The TVM team entered the spotlight earlier this week when it
emerged that the substance EPO had been found in the car of one of
its officials in March. But the case didn't come out into the open
until the current scandal involving Festina.
	   The influential daily Le Monde called on Friday for an end to
this year's race, saying authorities need to get to the bottom of
their investigation.
	   ``Who, from now on, could rejoice in seeing the rest of a
compromised pack enter Paris on Sunday, Aug. 2? Who would have the
heart to applaud the winner of a race without faith or law?,'' the
paper said in a commentary.
	   Defending champion Jan Ullrich was holding a 71-second lead over
American Bobby Julich heading into Friday's stage. The Tour is
slowly making its way across southern France before hitting the
Alps on Monday.
	   The German held onto the yellow jersey. He began the race July
11, but lost the lead for a week before gaining it back after
Saturday's time trial.
	   Julich, from Glenwood Springs, Colorado, rides for the French
Cofidis team.
	   ``Since last year I knew I could have a good result this year,''
Julich said. ``When I started this year's Tour I hoped to be in the
top 10.''
	   ``After the first week, I though `OK. Maybe the top 15'. Now I
see myself in Paris in the top three,'' he said.
	   Julich knows it will be tough to overcome the advantage that
Ullrich has.
	   ``Ullrich is very, very strong. He has a lot of experience and I
respect him a lot,'' said Julich. ``But I hope there will be a big
battle in the Alps.''
	   The three days in the Alps will have 12 climbs with two of the
climbs on Monday being rated ``out of category'' on a scale of
steepness, length and difficulty.
	   If there is a narrow gap between the riders coming out of the
mountains, it may come down to the 52-kilometer (32-mile) time
trial to Le Creusot on Saturday, Aug. 1, the day before the Tour
finishes in Paris.

Distraught parents of paralyzed gymnast to fly to her side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Wracked by guilt and fear, the distraught parents
of partly paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan prepared Friday to fly
to the United States to be at her side.
	   With 17-year-old Sang Lan in a Long Island hospital bed, unable
to move her legs, her parents half a world away in Beijing fretted
and wept as they looked with trepidation to the future.
	   ``The biggest worry is that they won't be able to cure her,''
her father, Sang Shisheng, said in an interview a day before he and
Sang's mother were planning to fly to New York.
	   Sang, the 1997 national vault champion, was injured in a botched
landing during a Tuesday warm-up for the Goodwill Games. Striking
the mat with her head, she fractured and dislocated two neck
vertebrae, leaving her with no movement in her legs. Doctors said
Wednesday it was unlikely she would ever walk again.
	   Her father said they found out that their only child had been
hurt when they turned on the television to see her compete. They
heard the announcer say instead that she had been carried away on a
stretcher.
	   That ``meant it had to be serious,'' Mr. Sang said. ``We were
shocked.''
	   While injuries are part and parcel of being an athlete, ``I
never expected anything this terrible, not once,'' he said.
	   Asked about the experimental nerve drug that Sang Lan was being
treated with, the father said he had ``total trust'' in U.S.
doctors and was sure they would give his daughter ``the best
medicine.''
	   Sang's parents speak with the heavy accent of their native
Ningbo, a port city near Shanghai on China's east coast. The
official Xinhua News Agency described the couple as ordinary
workers who earn about 1,200 yuan (dlrs 150) a month.
	   Officials prepared passports for them quickly and the Goodwill
Games organizing committee will pay their travel expenses, the
Beijing Morning Post reported.
	   Chinese sports officials gave them a new suitcase for the trip,
their first to the United States. On top of their neatly folded
clothes, the parents had lovingly placed a portrait of their
daughter, her head tilted and silky long black hair flowing over
her shoulders.
	   For Sang's mother, Chen Xiufeng, thinking about her daughter's
future was just too painful.
	   ``I just dare not imagine it,'' she said, tears rolling down her
cheeks.
	   The father added that Sang's mother has said she ``doesn't want
to go on living'' if their daughter's injuries prove permanent.
	   China often selects its athletes very young, putting them in
special schools where they are trained rigorously. The lucky ones,
like Sang Lan, eventually rise to the national team.
	   The father said Sang had gone to learn gymnastics at age six.
	   ``How can we ever make it up to her?'' He said. ```She was
separated from her mother and father at such a young age, with no
parental love.''

Bodies of U.N. military observers sent home

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The bodies of three United Nations
military observers killed in Tajikistan were flown home after a
solemn memorial ceremony on Friday.
	   The observers and their Tajik translator were ambushed Monday
while on patrol 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of the capital,
Dushanbe.
	   Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland, Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of
Uruguay, civil affairs officer Yutaka Akino of Japan and a Tajik
translator, Jourajon Mahramov, were all shot in their heads at
point-blank range.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the killings, but Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov has called the killers ``traitors'' of
the Tajik people and suggested opposition fighters were involved.
	   Opposition warlords in the eastern Garm region where the
killings took place have denied the president's accusations and
pledged to help find the killers.
	   Mahramov, the Tajik translator, was buried Wednesday. Coffins
carrying the remains of the other three victims covered with U.N.
flags were taken to Dushanbe's airport in trucks Friday after a
brief ceremony at U.N. headquarters in Dushanbe.
	   In a brief speech, Jan Kubis, the U.N. representative to
Tajikistan, said those killed had sacrificed their lives to help
the fragile Tajik peace process.
	   Kubis has recalled all U.N. field teams to Dushanbe pending the
outcome of an investigation into the killings.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war in the
impoverished former Soviet republic in Central Asia.
	   Despite the peace accord, there are periodic clashes between the
hard-line government and the mostly Islamic opposition. Numerous
warlords who do not recognize the peace deal wage turf battles with
one another.

Army officers face treason charges in Freetown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Dozens of West African
peacekeepers in tanks and on foot guarded a courthouse where 38
Sierra Leonean military officers appeared briefly on charges of
treason, state-run media reported Friday.
	   The 38 were being court-martialled Thursday for their alleged
involvement in a bloody May 1997 coup that toppled President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah. If found guilty they face death by firing squad.
	   Kabbah returned to power in March after the West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG ousted the coup leaders and
their followers from the capital of Freetown.
	   Among those being charged was Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of
junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding
with other members of his forces.
	   The case was postponed until July 28 to allow some of the
accused without legal representation to acquire lawyers.
	   The military court trials are separate from a hunt for junta
collaborators that led to at least 58 treason charges earlier this
year against government officials, journalists and some prominent
Freetown citizens.
	   Shortly after returning to power in March, Kabbah invoked
emergency measures that allow him to detain people at will and
suspend many civil liberties.
	   Others suspects earlier accused of treason include several
ex-cabinet ministers and a former Sierra Leonean correspondent for
the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   More than 200 people are being investigated by Kabbah's
government for alleged ties to Koroma's junta.
	   Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a victory for democracy
in West Africa, fighting between the coalition army and ousted
junta fighters has continued in the country's east.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Johan Cruyff is the nation's
favorite to succeed Guus Hiddink as the Dutch team coach, according
to a survey published Friday.
	   One in three people interviewed for the poll picked Cruyff, who
captained the Dutch ``Clockwork Orange'' team that lost the 1974
World Cup final to West Germany, Amsterdam daily Het Parool
reported.
	   Cruyff, who has coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant
Barcelona, is currently working as a television soccer analyst.
	   Hiddink was hired as coach by Real Madrid after guiding the
Netherlands to a semifinal berth in the World Cup finals in France
and the Dutch soccer association is hunting for a successor.
	   The man regarded by the Dutch media as favorite for the job,
former Glasgow Celtic manager Wim Jansen, was picked by just 12
percent of the 1,000 people interviewed for the poll by market
research company NIPO.
	   Jansen played alongside Cruyff in the 1974 World Cup final and
also was in the Dutch team that reached the final four years later
only to lose again.

Suspects charged in 1994 killing of Russian journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two more suspects have been charged in connection
with the 1994 killing of a Russian investigative journalist, a news
agency said Friday.
	   Russia's Prosecutor General charged Alexander Kapuntsov, deputy
director of the Ross security company, with conspiracy to murder
Dmitry Kholodov, a 27-year-old reporter with the Moskovsky
Komsomolets newspaper, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Airborne regiment Maj. Alexander Soroka was charged with
premeditated murder and illegal possession of a weapon, Interfax
said.
	   Soroka and Kholodov were arrested last week. Two majors and a
colonel were arrested and charged this spring.
	   Kholodov died when a briefcase supposedly provided by an
informant exploded in his hands at the newspaper's office.
	   At the time, Kholodov was investigating corruption in the
military, and the newspaper has said his death was related to his
probe.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The campaign for Cambodia's second
election in the post-Khmer Rouge era closed Friday amid tension and
hope, with an opposition leader challenging strongman Hun Sen and
the U.N. calling for an end to violence until the vote-winners take
office.
	   The United Nations mission coordinating foreign observers told a
news conference that despite violence and intimidation into the
run-up to the polls, conditions existed for elections that would be
``broadly representative of the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   That wording represented a more flexible standard than the
``free and fair'' phrasing which opposition leaders and human
rights advocates had sought.
	   Spokesman Sven Linder said the Joint International Observer
Group would expect ``appropriate behavior'' during the vote count
and an atmosphere ``free of violence'' until the winning candidates
are installed to endorse the vote _ a key goal for Hun Sen, who
wants to win back international legitimacy after a coup last year.
	   Earlier, trucks and motorcycles brought 7,000 partisans of
dissident Sam Rainsy to a park opposite the National Assembly for a
symbolic final campaign rally _ last year, 16 supporters were
killed and more than 100 injured, including Sam Rainsy himself, in
a grenade attack there widely blamed on Hun Sen.
	   Carried on the shoulders of his bodyguards, Sam Rainsy led a
moment of silence and threw jasmine petals to his supporters. They
then formed a convoy and rolled out of town to Takhmau, a
stronghold of the ruling Cambodian People's Party where Hun Sen
lives and is recuperating from an appendectomy. Security forces
kept a low profile and there were no clashes.
	   Hun Sen has been accused of using violence and fear to ensure he
wins Sunday's vote. It comes a year after he deposed his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in street battles in Phnom
Penh. The campaign officially ended Friday, followed by a
cooling-off day.
	   ``If the election is reasonably free and fair, the will of the
people will be translated into ballots,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If the
CPP wins in a landslide victory, I don't think the will of the
people will have been expressed.''
	   Earlier, Buddhist monks and nuns ended a week-long march from
the countryside, their numbers swelling from 150 to 3,000 in an
unofficial vote for peace as they entered Phnom Penh. Banners read:
``The more we fight, the more we lose.''
	   Ranariddh, appearing before 1,000 people in the port of
Sihanoukville, said he expected his royalist FUNCINPEC party would
carry the country. The prince spoke, sang and danced on the podium
in a festive atmoshere. Then he went swimming in the Gulf of
Thailand.
	   ``Within three days, FUNCINPEC will again win all the country,''
Ranariddh said.
	   Phnom Penh has been calm, but many fear that if Hun Sen loses
the vote he will use the army to retain power. Some 95,000 security
forces personnel are to be deployed nationwide Sunday, but
Cambodians may find their presence more intimidating than
comforting.
	   Opposition leaders acknowledge the campaign has been relatively
peaceful compared to 1993, when the Khmer Rouge guerrillas remained
a deadly force and attacked towns and ethnic Vietnamese villages.
	   The United Nations deployed 20,000 peacekeepers and spent dlrs 3
billion organizing that election, meant to bring peace and
democracy after decades of civil war and the Khmer Rouge regime of
the late 1970s that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people.
	   Ranariddh's party won. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer
Rouge, forced his way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   This time, Cambodia is organizing the election and the U.N. role
is limited to coordinating foreign observers. Hun Sen-linked
organizations have tried to dominate the Cambodian component of the
observation missions.
	   The Khmer Rouge are virtually extinct. A few hundred die-hard
rebels have vowed to disrupt the polls and attacked an election
convoy last week, killing two people, but thousands more have made
peace and will vote for the first time in their lives.
	   Overall, some 5.4 million people are registered to vote for 122
National Assembly seats.

Italian police hit ring selling pirated software on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police broke up a ring that sold pirated software on
the Internet, filing charges Friday against more than 100 people.
	   They also confiscated more than 40,000 counterfeits nationwide,
including copies of the new Windows 98, video games and
word-processing programs.
	   Police say the software had a retail value of about 20 billion
lire (dlrs 11 million). The pirates were selling it at a discount.
They advertised on the Internet, took orders by e-mail and then
mailed out the programs.
	   Italy's illegal video, compact disc and computer software
industry ranks second only to Russia's in Europe; by some
estimates, 20 to 33 percent of the CDs sold in Italy are pirated.
	   Police said more than 100 charges of counterfeiting software and
receiving stolen property were filed. None of the suspects has been
arrested, they said.

Tajik president bans soldiers from growing beards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The president of Tajikistan on
Friday banned members of the military from growing beards and
driving in cars with tinted windows.
	   The moves are designed to strengthen the government's control
over opposition fighters who were supposed to join the military
under a peace agreement ending a five-year civil war in the Central
Asian country.
	   Many of the opposition fighters have resisted, and periodic
clashes continue to erupt in the former Soviet republic.
	   Most of Tajikistan's opposition leaders and their Islamic
fighters are bearded, but President Emomali Rakhmonov and other
government members are clean-shaven.
	   One exception is Gen. Gafur Mirzoyev, chief of the presidential
guards, but presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said he will have
to obey the order.
	   ``Otherwise, he would set a bad example,'' Saidov said.

Government rules out pardon for soldiers executed in World War I
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS graf 5 to clarify dates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A pardon for 306 British soldiers executed during
World War I is impossible because it is no longer possible to
distinguish the guilty and the innocent, the government said
Friday.
	   However, he expressed the government's regret for the
executions, and announced that it intended to abolish the death
penalty for military offenses.
	   The Royal British Legion, which represents former service
members, had urged a pardon for those executed, and so had some
lawmakers.
	   ``We cannot distinguish between those who deliberately let down
their country and their comrades in arms and those who were not
guilty of desertion or cowardice,'' Armed Forced Minister John Reid
told the House of Commons.
	   More than 3,000 British servicemen were sentenced to death
between Aug. 4, 1914, when Britain declared war against Germany,
and March 31, 1920, 16 months after Germany surrendered and nine
months after it signed the Versailles treaty. All but 306 sentences
were commuted by commanders.

Schumacher can overtake Hakkinen for Formula One lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Michael Schumacher can take the
Formula One lead and drive Ferrari closer to the coveted title in
the 10th race of the season, the Grand Prix of Austria.
	   Schumacher trails Mika Hakkinen of McLaren-Mercedes by two
points going into Sunday's race, the 10th in the 17-race Formula
One season, and has the momentum after three straight victories.
	   In Friday's free practice, Schumacher posted only the seventh
fastest time over two sessions. But the free practice is used to
experiment with tires and set-ups and usually means little for the
starting grid, which will be determined in Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``We had a few more difficulties than expected,'' Schumacher
said. ``On my first run a front wheel locked up and I went off the
track. I lost the rest of the morning session while the mechanics
worked on the car to repair the damage from the gravel.''
	   ``In the afternoon, I had a similar situation _ this time a rear
wheel locked up. We will have a lot of work to do tomorrow to be
competitive in qualifying,'' Schumacher said.
	   David Coulthard gave the sagging McLaren fortunes a much-needed
boost when he posted the fastest time in the free practice of one
minute, 13.703 seconds over the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) lap at the
A1-Ring.
	   ``We made encouraging progress,'' Coulthard said. ``I believe
tire wear is going to be an issue for all the teams this weekend.''
	   Hakkinen, who leads Schumacher 56-54 in the drivers' standings,
had the third fastest time of 1:13.746. Giancarlo Fisichella in a
Benetton-Playlife was second in 1:13.704, just 1/1000th of a second
behind Coulthard.
	   ``There was a lot of dust on the track and I found myself caught
up in traffic on a number of occasions,'' Hakkinen said.
	   After dominating the early past of the season, the McLaren team
has gone into a slump.
	   Coulthard has finished only one of his last four races, a sixth
place in the Grand Prix of France on June 28.
	   Hakkinen has won four races this season, but he is winless since
the Grand Prix of Monaco on May 24. He was forced to retire in
Canada, finished third in France and second in Silverstone at the
Grand Prix of Britain two weeks ago.
	   That finish is still contested. As Hakkinen took the checkered
flag in the final lap, Schumacher was in the box sitting out a
10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. Schumacher
was awarded victory since he had led Hakkinen by more than 10
seconds. McLaren has appealed against the ruling and the sport's
governing body will make a ruling Monday in Paris.
	   In last year's Austrian Grand Prix, the first in 10 years and
the first to be held on the revamped circuit once popularly called
Zeltweg after the nearby village, Schumacher was thwarted by
another 10-second penalty.
	   The penalty that took Schumacher into the box allowed Jacques
Villeneuve to race to victory and take a decisive step toward the
Formula One championship.
	   But Villeneuve and his Williams-Mecachrome team have been
struggling this season and the Canadian has yet to finish among the
top three. Villeneuve's best finishes this season were a pair of
fourth places, at the San Marino GP and in France.
	   There was little encouragement for the reigning champion, who
had the 13th fastest time in Friday's practice. His Williams
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen did even worse, being left in 17th
place after spinning out and finishing in the gravel.
	   ``it was very slippery out there and it is much hotter than last
year,'' Villeneuve said. ``We are far back, but the times are very
tight. It's difficult to say how much more I can get out of the car
for qualifying tomorrow.''
	   Villeneuve announced Thursday that he was leaving Williams at
the end of the season for the new British American Racing team.
Frentzen also seems unlikely to remain at Williams.

After Iranian missile tests, Israel asks for U.S. intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Alarmed by an Iranian missile test launch,
Israel has asked the United States to try harder to prevent the
transfer of missile technology to Iran, an official said Friday.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called Leon Feurth, a top aide to
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and asked that Gore raise the Iranian
missile threat in talks with Russian leaders in Moscow this
weekend, said an official close to Sharansky, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and know-how to
the Iranian missile program. Russia denies it.
	   Sharansky told the Gore aide that Wednesday's Iranian test
launch demonstrated the gravity of the threat to Israel.
	   The Shahab-3 missile tested by Iran has a potential range of 800
miles (1,300 kilometers), enough to strike any target in Israel.
	   Sharansky told Feurth that if the transfer of Russian technology
was halted now, the Iranians would be unable to complete the
development of the missile system.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the defense minister said the test launch
gave new impetus to his demand for an additional dlrs 600 million
in defense spending. ``We'll need more resources, a bigger budget,
more deterrence capability and more motivation,'' Mordechai said.
	   The test launch came amid recent warnings from Israeli defense
experts that Israel's army was not ready to counter future threats,
such as ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the
hands of Iran and Iraq, Israel's most implacable foes.

Bologna prosecution demands indictment of ski star

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ A prosecutor on Friday asked for the
indictment of Italian ski star Alberto Tomba and his parents on
charges of tax fraud, the ANSA news agency said.
	   The Bologna prosecutor is alleging that the Tomba family, long
under investigation for tax evasion, may have hidden incomes of
about 23 billion lire (dlrs 12.7 million) between 1990 and 1996,
ANSA said.
	   Prosecutor Luigi Persico did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
	   According to ANSA, he asked the court to indict Alberto Tomba,
his father Franco and his mother Maria Grazia. Franco Tomba is his
son's business manager.
	   Tax fraud is punishable in Italy by up to five years in prison
and heavy fines.
	   Tomba, a three-time Olympic champion and Italy's most successful
skier ever, had been under scrutiny for allegedly hiding his money
abroad to elude Italian tax laws.
	   One of the most popular Alpine skiers, the 31-year-old Tomba is
said to make about dlrs 9 million a year, mostly from product
endorsements.
	   He failed to win a medal on his fourth and last Olympics at
Nagano in February and must decide whether continuing his ski
career in the 1998-99 season.

Fighting in Turkey's southeast kills 15 Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Troops killed 15 autonomy-seeking
Kurdish rebels in fighting in Turkey's southeast, officials said
Friday.
	   Thirteen of the rebels died in clashes in the eastern province
of Tunceli, a military statement said, without specifying when the
fighting took place. It did not say where or when the other two
died.
	   Meanwhile, the Anatolia news agency said rebels attacked a
detachment of paramilitary police near the eastern town of Malatya
overnight Wednesday, killing one soldier and injuring seven.
	   The Kurdish conflict has killed some 37,000 people since 1984.

Opposition says Tudjman may have violated constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Opposition parties said Friday that
President Franjo Tudjman overstepped his authority by ordering the
government to scrap a recently approved bill significantly raising
his and other state officials' salaries.
	   On Thursday, Tudjman told the government not to implement the
bill until it is revised for the parliament session in September.
	   The Croatian public would be satisfied to see what they consider
excessive wages go down, but the opposition warned that Tudjman
likely violated the constitution.
	   The bill was adopted in parliament on July 10 thanks to the
majority of Tudjman's ruling party. The opposition voted against
it.
	   The constitution says that the president shall promulgate laws
within eight days.
	   By failing to do so and further preventing the law from being
applied, Tudjman violated the constitution, Ivica Racan, the leader
of the strongest opposition party said.
	   ``We are faced with a circus which has serious political, legal
and constitutional consequences,'' Racan, who heads the Social
Democrats, said.
	   The Liberals said Tudjman's move ``demonstrated that parliament
and the government are only puppets aimed to fulfill the wishes of
one man, the president.''
	   Still, there is little the opposition can do: proceedings toward
impeachment could be instituted only with a two-thirds majority of
parliament. But the opposition controls just over a third of 127
seats.
	   Croats were outraged to see that the bill gave Tudjman a monthly
net salary of an equivalent dlrs 7,800, and dlrs 3,125 a month to
parliament deputies. The average monthly salary in Croatia is 2,700
kuna (dlrs 400).
	   Tudjman likely decided to seek lower ceilings after realizing
that the public uproar could ruin his party's chances at the next
parliamentary elections in late 1999.

Ronaldo's club reports record season ticket sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Inter Milan, the Italian club of
international stars Ronaldo and Ivan Zamorano, on Friday reported
that season tickets sales had hit a record 50,000 with two more
months to go before the beginning of the next Serie A campaign.
	   Ticket sales have brought in 26 billion lire (dlrs 14.4 million)
so far, the club said.
	   Demand was apparently buoyed by the signing of star forward
Roberto Baggio and by expectations that the team could clinch both
the Italian title and the Champions Cup.
	   Last season, Inter sold 47,630 season tickets, mostly because of
the signing of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, the best FIFA player of
the year.

Russia lauds Japan's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry praised Japan's likely
choice for prime minister on Friday.
	   Japan's governing party lawmakers picked Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi to head the Liberal Democratic Party. He needs the approval
of the lower house of parliament to become prime minister, but that
is almost guaranteed since the LDP has a majority there.
	   ``We praise Keizo Obuchi's contribution to the development of
Russian-Japanese relations,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin.
	   Obuchi has played a prominent role in improving Japan's
relationship with Russia.
	   The two countries have never signed a treaty ending World War II
because of a disagreement over four islands in the Kuril chain that
were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war but are still
claimed by Japan.

Japanese scientists produce cow clone from cells of cow fetus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A calf cloned from cells taken from a cow fetus was
born Friday in southern Japan, becoming the nation's first using
the method, researchers said.
	   The calf is the latest clone born in recent weeks in Japan under
an ambitious program to seek ways to consistently reproduce cows
that give more milk or higher quality beef.
	   Scientists in the United States succeeded in cloning a cow from
a fetal cells earlier this year.
	   Two adult-clone calves using cells taken from ova were born
earlier this month at an institute in central Japan. Some 40 more
cow cloning experiments using cells taken from cow fetuses, ears,
buttocks and other parts from adults are under way.
	   The Holstein was born by caesarean section and is larger than
average at 57.2 kilograms (125.8 lbs), said Koji Tahara, senior
scientist at the Kagoshima Prefectural Cattle Breeding Development
Institute.
	   Both the calf and his surrogate mother are in good condition, he
said.
	   The institute used a similar technique to that used to produce
Dolly, the sheep that made history by becoming the world's first
adult-animal clone.
	   Researchers removed cells from a Holstein fetus, which was about
13 centimeters (5.2 inches) long, then placed them in unfertilized
eggs which had their nuclei removed.
	   The artificially cultivated embryos were placed into the
surrogate cow's womb last October.
	   ``Theoretically, however, cloning an adult is better than
relying on uncertainty of cells from a fetus,'' Tahara said. ``But
we are still in the process of figuring out what could be the best
way to make cloned cows.''
	   He added that using a cow fetus is considered a method with a
relatively high success rate and lower costs.
	   On Feb. 16, scientists in the United States produced a clone
calf _ a Holstein named Gene _ with cells from a 30-day-old fetus.
	   The Kagoshima institute is expecting clone calves using cells
taken from a cow's ear to be born as early as mid-August, Tahara
said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian High Court was told
Friday that a book entitled ``50 reasons why Anwar Ibrahim should
not be prime minister'' was written in a conspiracy to tarnish the
name of Anwar, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance
minister.
	   Cyrus Das, the counsel for Anwar, urged the court to grant an
injunction order against the book effective through the end of the
trial, the Bernama news agency reported.
	   The counsel for the book's writers and publisher, Mohd Hanif
Khatri Abdullah, denied the work was libelous and malicious, saying
that it was based on facts, the Bernama report said.

Report: Suspects arrested in attack in Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report suspects arrested &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen authorities arrested several suspects in
the assassination attempt on the president of the restive republic
and found ammunition and explosives in an apartment near where the
attack took place, a news agency reported Friday.
	   The suspects were being questioned about Thursday's car bombing
from which President Aslan Maskhadov escaped with only minor
bruises, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen officials have blamed either Russian security services
or Chechen warlords were responsible for the bombing that left two
presidential bodyguards dead.
	   Maskhadov also called on former Chechen leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev and two other opponents to swear an oath on the Muslim
holy book, the Koran, that they had nothing to do with the attack.
	   Yandarbiyev showed up Friday in an Islamic law court,
accompanied by bodyguards, and said he was ready to proclaim his
innocence ``one thousand times.''
	   Maskhadov's representatives said they were satisfied, and the
court cleared Yandarbiyev without requiring him to take the actual
oath, Russian news agencies reported.
	   However, two warlords associated with Islamic fundamentalists
failed to heed the president's call and did not show up in court.
	   Yandarbiyev said he was convinced that the Russian special
services were behind the bombing and accused them of fomenting
tension between Maskhadov and his opponents in Chechnya.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service on Thursday denied that it was
involved.
	   Chechnya remains unstable despite the end of the 1994-96 war
with Russia, and tensions have been rising in recent weeks as
Maskhadov cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists linked to
the Wahhabi movement.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday sent Maskhadov a
telegram expressing ``deep concern and outrage'' over the attempt
on his life.
	   Following the attack, Chechen officials banned the broadcast of
Russian television channels in the republic, accusing them of
distorted coverage.
	   Earlier this week, Maskhadov suspended broadcasts of Chechnya's
numerous private television channels, some of which are controlled
by rivals.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory last year, but has
been unable to contain the soaring crime or improve the republic's
economy, which was ruined by the war.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew at the end of 1996, but no one has recognized its
independence bid and Moscow insists that the territory remains part
of Russia.

Limited progress on China WTO entry with telecoms offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ China made its first offer to open up its mobile
phone and pager industry to foreign competition Friday as part of
its latest efforts to gain membership of the World Trade
Organization. But its trading partners said it still needs to do
more.
	   The United States and other countries said they were pleased by
the telecoms offer. They have also welcomed a Chinese move to
eliminate restrictions on where foreign banks can set up
immediately after China joins.
	   But countries at a meeting of the WTO working party studying the
Chinese bid expressed concern that China made no offer to free up
its farming industry, trade officials said.
	   Government minister Long Yongtu said China is ``willing to
concert our efforts with all interested parties in order to make an
early breakthrough'' on farming.
	   U.S. officials said China couldn't take short cuts to gain
membership.
	   The United States has said any new offer will require broad
liberalization of the financial sector, not just selective
approvals for foreign banking, securities and insurance firms.
	   Chinese officials were optimistic. ``It is groundless to say
this negotiation has encountered some serious difficulties,'' Long
told a news conference.
	   The WTO is the main international body governing global trade
relations and setting fair trade rules. There is general agreement
China should join the organization and be bound by its
responsibilities, but no agreement yet on the price for this.
	   Beijing wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would
have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of
goods and services.
	   The United States, which has a big trade deficit with China,
says the entry terms should be tougher as the Chinese economy is
already well developed.
	   ``In opening up its market, China can only take a step-by-step
approach in line with its current level of economic development,''
Long told delegates.
	   China's telecoms proposal, which would also liberalize some data
services, would commit it to open up paging services to foreign
competition upon joining the WTO and mobile phone services five
years later.
	   A Chinese offer to scrap all restrictions on distribution
services within five years of joining, with around 10 exceptions,
didn't satisfy all delegations, trade officials said.
	   Negotiations on China's WTO entry have been in progress for 11
years.

Indonesian leader orders the release of 50 political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president signed decrees
on Friday ordering the release of 50 political prisoners as part of
a plan to improve his country's human rights record, Justice
Minister Muladi said.
	   ``The prisoners will be freed as soon as possible,'' Muladi told
reporters.
	   So far, 28 dissidents have been released on the orders of
President B.J. Habibie, who has pledged to enact sweeping
democratic reforms and hold elections next year.
	   Habibie has promised to free most of Indonesia's 200 political
prisoners, jailed under his autocratic predecessor, former
President Suharto.
	   Suharto quit in May after a wave of protests and riots against
his regime.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said those not included in the latest
release included pro-independence activists from three troubled
provinces in Indonesia _ the strongly Islamic Aceh region, Irian
Jaya in the western half of New Guinea and the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor.

New Hungarian prime minister pushes NATO, EU memberships

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Hungary's new prime minister, Viktor
Orban, said Friday his government will continue to contribute to
NATO crisis management in Bosnia and Kosovo, but he said Kosovo was
a much more sensitive issue.
	   Hungary, whose membership in NATO already has been ratified by
12 of the 16 current members, has participated in the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Bosnia since its inception in December 1995.
	   ``But the Kosovo crisis is in character a different one and
Hungary must be more cautious,'' Orban said after a meeting with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   He noted that several hundred thousand ethnic Hungarians live in
Yugoslavia and that 500 have been conscripted into the Serbian army
and are deployed in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.
	   ``We understand that they are Serbian or Yugoslav citizens, but
at the same time, we would like to make clear that the Hungarians
would not like to be involved (in Kosovo). This is a very sensitive
issue for the Hungarian government and we will do our best to
convince the Serbian government that the Hungarians should be got
out.''
	   Orban, 35, was sworn in as prime minister July 6 after his Young
Democrats-Civic Party won the largest number of seats in
parliamentary elections in May. He was in Brussels to meet with the
leaders of the NATO alliance and the European Union.
	   Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, have been
accepted for NATO membership, but that must be ratified by the
parliaments of all members. Britain, the Netherlands, Turkey and
Portugal have yet to vote on the new members, which will be
officially welcomed at a summit in Washington next April.
	   Hungary also is negotiating to join the 15-nation European
Union. The Hungarians have set a target date of Jan. 1, 2002.
	   ``It's not a new idea,'' said Orban. ``It was a self-imposed
deadline of the previous government. The European Union said this
is ambitious but not unrealistic. I don't know what that means, but
it's not `no.'''
	   The prime minister said he would at least like to be able to
tell Hungarians on Jan. 1, 2002 that everything that needs to be
done on the Hungarian side has been done.
	   ``This is not the most important issue,'' he said. ``Far more
important are the conditions for European Union membership.''
	   Orban said he asked the EU for financial help in controlling the
flow of Balkan refugees. The EU wants Hungary to tighten its
border.
	   ``We are ready to modify all regulations concerning immigration
and border crossing activity. We are ready to make it more strict.
This is in the interest of Hungary and the EU as well. But we need
a financial contribution from the European Union.''
	   Solana praised Hungary's progress, saying he was ``looking
forward to seeing Hungary as soon as possible as part of the
alliance.
	   ``The contribution of Hungary, in particular in Bosnia, is
something that the allies will never forget,'' the
secretary-general said.
	   He noted that Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic already are
taking part in the North Atlantic Council's debates on the
situation in Kosovo, where majority ethnic Albanians seek
independence, or at least extended autonomy.
	   Orban said Hungary also supported the further enlargement of
NATO, particularly to include Hungary's immediate neighbors.
	   ``It's in the interest of Hungary,'' he said. ``The enlargement
process is the best stabilizing policy in the Central European
region.''

Head of taxi drivers' association killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The head of a taxi drivers'
association was shot to death in his car on the outskirts of
Prague, the news agency CTK reported Friday.
	   The agency said the victim, identified as Ivan Hribal, 40, was
the chief of Virtus, an organization for some of Prague's 6,000 cab
drivers.
	   Police have no suspects in the Thursday morning killing, and the
motive for the attack remains unclear.
	   Virtus was founded last year as a successor to another
association, Thorges.
	   Cab drivers in the Thorges association were known for charging
up to 10 times more than the standard fare and for charging other
drivers for using Prague's lucrative downtown stands.
	   After Thorges was dissolved last year, most of its members
joined Virtus.

Mir's owner sells part of stock to run station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The state-controlled company that runs the Mir
space station announced Friday it was selling shares to private
investors to raise funds for Russia's cash-strapped space program.
	   The RKK Energiya Corp. will sell 13 percent of its stock to help
keep Mir in orbit. The sale is expected to yield dlrs 100 million
to dlrs 120 million, the Interfax news agency quoted space
officials as saying.
	   Energiya built and has been running Mir since it was put in
orbit in early 1986. After the Soviet collapse, the company was
partly privatized, but the government retained a controlling
interest.
	   The Russian space program's cash shortage is so serious that
officials even discussed abandoning Mir next month, about a year
ahead of schedule.
	   Last month the government finally promised to pay the dlrs 600
million it owed for Mir's 1997 operations, and space officials said
they could keep the station in orbit until June 1999. They earlier
planned to discard Mir in December 1999.

Mongolia's three-month old government resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Under fire for a disputed bank
merger, Mongolia's three-month old coalition government resigned en
masse Friday after losing a vote of no confidence.
	   The minority Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party had demanded
the vote following a feud with the government over its decision to
merge a state bank with a private bank. The MPRP accused the
government of organizing the merger in a way that financially
benefited its members.
	   In protest, the MPRP boycotted the Great Hural, Mongolia's
parliament, for six weeks, throwing proceedings into turmoil.
Without its participation, laws, bills and amendments had to be
shelved.
	   Last Friday, the party said it would return to parliament if a
vote of no confidence was taken.
	   Prime Minister Tsakiagiin Elbegdorj and his cabinet of ten
ministers submitted their resignation Friday to the Great Hural
after losing the no-confidence vote 42-33.
	   The coalition government has 30 days to reorganize itself and
nominate a new prime minister.
	   The MPRP had attacked the government decision to merge the
insolvent state-run Reconstruction Bank with the private Golomt
Bank as ``a dangerous step to the economic security of the
nation.''
	   ``We believe that the Elbegdorj government does not contain the
ethical rights to bear the responsibility for the confidence of the
Mongolian people,'' the party said in a statement.
	   It also claimed the government forced the Reconstruction Bank
into bankruptcy by issuing a series of bad loans worth U.S. dlrs
3.5 million.
	   Mongolia, once dependent on subsidies from Moscow, has seen its
economy weaken precipitously since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
According to World Bank estimates, 36 percent of its 2 million
people live in poverty. Inflation topped 30 percent last year and
unemployment is high in what is still a largely pastoral economy.
	   In 1990, peaceful protests forced the pro-Soviet People's
Revolutionary Party to drop communism and allow free and fair
multiparty elections. Its 75-year rule ended with a 1996
parliamentary election that swept the reformist Democratic Union
into office and won U.S. accolades for the nation's progress toward
democracy.

Lemerre reportedly set to take over as French coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roger Lemerre is to be named as France's new
national soccer coach, French television station TF1 reported
Friday.
	   The French Football Federation has called a news conference for
Monday to announce the successor to Aime Jacquet, who announced
plans to retire after his team's World Cup victory earlier this
month.
	   Auxerre boss Guy Roux, one of Lemerre's main challengers, said
Thursday that he was no longer interested in the job.
	   Monaco coach Jean Tigana is the other main candidate for the
post, but Lemerre has been firm favorite to take over since
Jacquet's departure.
	   TF1 did not provide sources for its information that Lemerre
would succeed Jacquet.

Hingis leads heavily favored Swiss against France in Fed Cup semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS 8th thru 11th grafs to reflect French line-up. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World number one Martina Hingis will
lead the strongly favored Swiss on home clay against defending
champion France on Saturday in a Federation Cup world group
semifinal.
	   But the Swiss teenager will get plenty of help from
up-and-coming Patty Schnyder, who has actually outshone her
teammate so far this season winning five titles.
	   ``The bar is very high,'' said French captain Yannick Noah, who
guided France to the title last year. ``We are facing a team that
has the world No. 1 and a player who just won two tournaments
back-to-back. The team will also benefit from the support of 8,000
spectators.''
	   The Swiss are the first to admit they have the upper hand.
	   ``We're the favorites,'' said Hingis, who trails Schnyder with
just four titles to her name this year. ``I'm No. 1 and Patty just
won her fifth title of the year. For us it's this year or never.''
	   France's task has been made even tougher in the absence of its
two best clay-court players _ world No. 13 Sandrine Testud and No.
14 Mary Pierce.
	   Disliking Pierce's attitude in previous Fed Cup ties, Noah
refused to retain the former Australian Open champion. Team veteran
Testud, who won France's decisive match in its final against the
Dutch last year, is nursing the ankle she sprained in Palermo last
week.
	   France was expected to lean heavily on world No. 10 Nathalie
Tauziat, who lost to Jana Novotna in the final at Wimbledon this
year, but Noah chose her only for Sunday's doubles match.
	   Instead, Noah has called on world No. 34 Amelie Mauresmo and
No.36 Julie Halard-Decugis, seriously plagued by injury the last
two years, to face Schnyder and Hingis in the singles.
	   Doubles specialist Alexandra Fusai, ranked 40 in both singles
and doubles, will pair up with Tauziat in the doubles to face the
same two Swiss.
	   Notoriously weak on clay, Tauziat was unlikely to inspire fear
among the Swiss. Each of Switzerland's players has beaten the
30-year-old this year, including Swiss No. 3 Emmanuelle Gagliardi.
	   The only slight concerns on the Swiss side are Hingis' scanty
tennis schedule these past weeks and Schnyder's heavily loaded one.
	   ``When you're winning, fatigue doesn't exist,'' said world No.
11 Schnyder, who just played 14 matches over the past two weeks.
``In Austria as in Sicily, I never had to exceed my limits.''
	   Hingis, on the other hand, has not played since she was
eliminated in the semifinals of Wimbledon by Novotna. Taking a week
off to follow the World Cup finals in Paris, the 17-year-old
returned to Zurich only last week to resume training.
	   ``It won't be anything like the tie against Argentina last year
in Zurich,'' Hingis predicted. ``I don't think the load on our
shoulders is exactly crushing.''
	   However slim the odds might be for his team, Noah is still
optimistic.
	   ``It's my fifth tie in the Fed Cup and it's the first time we're
facing an opponent stronger than us on paper'' said Noah, who also
led two French men's teams to Davis Cup triumphs.
	   ``I don't need to motivate my players for this tie. They know
that victory here would be more than delicious.''
	   In the final on September 19-20, the winners will take on either
the United States or Spain playing in the other semifinal in
Madrid.

Serb twins to sue for erroneous arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb twins
mistakenly arrested by NATO as war crimes suspects were physically
abused during their detention and will sue for damages, Bosnian
Serb police said Friday.
	   Miroslav and Milan Vuckovic, 26, were snatched Wednesday from
Prijedor by NATO peace keepers only to be released a day later.
They were mistaken for Predrag and Nenad Bankovic, also twins,
wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
for atrocities allegedly committed during the Bosnian war in 1992.
	   ``In addition to physical abuse, the Vuckovic brothers have
endured a serious psychological trauma,'' said a police statement
in Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
``Miroslav and Milan Vuckovic have said they will bring charges.''
	   The brothers were not at their home in Prijedor on Friday, and a
relative said they were inaccessible, recovering in a local
hospital.
	   NATO officials have expressed regret for the wrong arrest.
	   ``The brutal arrest was carried out with considerable force,
which is obvious by numerous bruises ... on the faces and bodies of
both Vuckovic brothers,'' the Serb police statement read.
	   The whereabouts of the real suspects remains unknown. Their
father has claimed they live in England, but has refused to provide
details.

Danish expedition sets out to find meteor on Greenland ice cap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish scientific expedition on
Friday began efforts to find a huge meteor that is believed to have
smashed into Greenland last winter.
	   On Dec. 9, a giant flash that split the darkness was reported by
three fishermen working off Greenland's east coast, and a
parking-lot surveillance camera in Nuuk, the territory's capital on
the west coast, recorded a brief illumination at that time.
	   Experts believe it was a solid meteor, travelling at more than
12,000 kilometers per hour (7,500 miles per hour).
	   But no traces of a meteor have been found amid the
near-featureless ice cap that covers most of the Danish territory.
	   Since the initial reports, investigators have located about 100
other people who saw the flash and by comparing their angles of
vision have determined a likely crash site of about 120 square
kilometers (45 square miles).
	   Bjorn Jorgensen, coordinator of the state-funded expedition,
told The Associated Press: ``So far I'm an optimist. We have not
met any problems, but it is impossible to say what chances we
have.''
	   Danish media on Friday quoted an unidentified taxi driver in
Nuuk describing the flash as ``a great fireball with a bright tail
of fire ... from which burning yellow threads stuck out, almost
like a millipede with yellow fiery legs.''

German firm rebuffs appeals to compensate WWII-era slave workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Despite appeals from schoolchildren,
one of Germany's biggest construction companies refused Friday to
compensate World War II-era slave laborers who helped it build what
later became a U.S. airbase near Frankfurt.
	   Zueblin construction firm chief Manfred Nussbaumer said at a
Stuttgart news conference that the company merely supervised the
construction with 10 employees. The slave laborers, he said,
technically worked for a Nazi SS agency.
	   ``We see no need to pay compensation,'' Nussbaumer said, adding
that the company acknowledges no ``guilt.''
	   The company was responding to a letter-writing campaign by a
high school class and the town council in Moerfelden-Walldorf, a
Frankfurt suburb, to secure compensation for the 1,700 women,
mostly Hungarian Jews, who were forced to build airstrips during
World War II.
	   The town says it has documents showing the company paid the SS a
token amount for each worker per day, and maintains the company
profited from the labor _ something the company denies.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany. The German government has compensated them for
imprisonment and health damage, but has refused to honor wage
claims, saying laborers technically were working for private
companies.
	   German companies, facing a wave of lawsuits on behalf of slave
laborers, generally have said the laborers were organized by the
Nazi government and that its successor, the current German
government, should be responsible for wage claims.
	   A major recent exception is Volkswagen, which announced this
month it would set up a private fund to handle claims of former VW
slave laborers.
	   Johannes Gernandt, 19, and classmates visited one of the
surviving airport laborers in Hungary last summer after seeing a
local historian's 1996 exhibit about the work camp. Local
teen-agers did much of the original research on the camp in the
early 1970s.
	   Ibolya Jacob, now in her late 70s, told Gernandt she was brought
to Germany from the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. She said they
lived on soup made of potato scraps and had only summer clothes to
wear, even in winter.
	   ``She told us she broke her rib, but kept working because
everyone knew that if you couldn't work anymore you'd have to go
back to Auschwitz,'' Gernandt said.
	   After the war, the airstrip became part of the U.S. Rhine-Main
Air Base, which is adjacent to Frankfurt's international airport.
	   The Moerfelden-Walldorf council wrote in March to Zueblin,
Germany's sixth-largest construction firm, demanding it open its
archives, contact surviving slave workers and pay them
compensation.
	   The students wrote similar letters last December and last month.
	   The community is excavating the wooded site where the work camp
was located. Last Saturday, excavators uncovered a cellar where
workers were believed to have been punished if they misbehaved.
	   Gernandt said he and community members would continue to press
Zueblin to pay compensation.
	   ``This won't be the last word on this issue,'' Gernandt said.

Rios routs Becker to close in on No. 1 Sampras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios, moving to one win of
regaining the No. 1 spot from Pete Sampras, routed Boris Becker in
straight sets Friday to reach the semifinals of the Mercedes Cup.
	   Rios, the top seed, dominated the German with his pinpoint
passing shots, twice rattling off 10 straight points in a 6-2, 6-0
win at the dlrs 1.04 million event.
	   Just two weeks ago, Becker beat Rios in straight sets to reach
the Swiss Open final, but this time the Chilean played almost
flawlessly. he fired an ace to close out the one-sided match in
just 45 minutes.
	   Rios would regain the top ranking on the ATP computer from
Sampras if he beats world No. 11 Karol Kucera of Slovakia Saturday.
	   Rios held the No. 1 ranking for four weeks starting March 30,
breaking the American's 102-week hold on the top, before an elbow
injured sidelined him.
	   Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, also reached the semis by
beating fellow Spaniard Fernando Vicente, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, while
Kucera downed Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Moya struggled with both his serve and forehand in the first set
before winning against his 19-year-old friend and practice partner.
	   ``Maybe I was too confident at first,'' said Moya. ``It's always
hard playing aginst your best friend on the tour. Plus, we know
each other's games too well.''
	   Becker, who plays only a part-time schedule these days, appeared
tired and a step slow after struggling past Spain's Felix Mantilla
in two hours Thursday.
	   But Rios showed why he's regarded as one of the game's best
returners as he punished the three-time Wimbledon champion every
time he approached the net.
	   During the break to take a 4-2 first set lead, Rios twice
drilled passing shots down the line, then lifted a perfect low lob
over the onrushing Becker's head.
	   Rios didn't drop another point until the second set, once again
ending Becker's hopes of winning a clay court title before he eases
into retirement.

Hand grenade and bomb attacks injure one, damage buildings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One person was injured and
two buildings damaged Friday in two explosives attacks in
ethnically divided Bosnian cities.
	   Unidentified assailants exploded a bomb in a Muslim residential
area of the central city of Novi Travnik Friday afternoon, injuring
one person and causing substantial damage to the building, said
Bosnian state radio. The city also has a substantial Bosnian Croat
population.
	   Hours earlier, unidentified attackers lobbed a hand grenade at a
local Bosnian Croat administration building in the western city of
Mostar.
	   The agency said the drive-by-attack caused damages but injured
no one in Mostar, a city divided between Bosnia's Muslims and
Croats since their 1993-1994 ethnic war.
	   An eye-witness to the Mostar attack will help police identify
the two occupants of the car, said Kelly Moore, a U.N. spokeswoman

Indonesian military to reduce troop numbers in East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amid new diplomatic efforts to bring
peace to East Timor after years of guerrilla war and human rights
abuse, Indonesia said Friday it will withdraw some troops from the
troubled territory next week.
	   ``We hope the withdrawal will improve the situation and ease
tensions there,'' said military spokesman Brig. Gen. Syamsul
Ma'arif. ``The exact number to go hasn't been decided yet.''
	   Troops from different units would leave in ships from the
provincial capital, Dili, on Tuesday after a farewell ceremony, he
said.
	   Journalists, often barred from visiting East Timor, are to be
flown in by the military to cover the event.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced the autocratic former
leader Suharto in May, last month promised to pull out some of the
12,000 Indonesian soldiers currently deployed in East Timor, about
2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Habibie made the pledge to 1996 Nobel Peace laureate, East Timor
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   Belo had complained that the presence of the military had been a
constant source of violence and tension in the territory of 800,000
predominately Catholic people, in mainly Muslim Indonesia.
	   A U.N. mediator has also called for troops reductions.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it in 1976.
	   Human rights groups have accused the military of a wide range of
abuses over the years, including torture and killings.
	   In 1991 scores of pro-independence protesters were shot to death
when Indonesian troops opened fire to break up a an anti-Indonesian
demonstration. Clashes with rebels, estimated by the military at
around only 200 in number, happen regularly in the mountainous
interior.
	   The planned withdrawal comes ahead of talks over the territory's
future with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal in New York on Aug. 4-5.
	   It will take place ahead of a scheduled visit to Indonesia by
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on Aug. 1-2.
	   During a visit to Indonesia earlier this week, U.N. special
envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, said the proposed partial
withdrawal of Indonesian troops would build confidence in the
troubled territory, but that some soldiers would have to stay to
maintain security.
	   Marker has been trying for years to broker a peace deal for East
Timor, ruled by Portugal for centuries before Indonesia invaded.
	   Hopes of reaching a settlement have increased since Indonesia
changed presidents two months ago.
	   Suharto ordered the 1975 invasion and later steadfastly refused
to make compromises despite the prolonged conflict.
	   Habibie has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and to
release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of East Timor as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   But Habibie has rejected demands by separatists for a referendum
on outright independence.

Sports minister urging FIFA to respect Polish law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's sports minister said Friday he
was ready to talk with international soccer officials ``any time''
to reach a compromise over a conflict with the national soccer
union, but urged the Swiss-based federation to respect Polish law.
	   FIFA and UEFA warned in a statement Thursday that Polish teams
could be barred from international competitions unless the national
soccer federation and the government solve their current
difficulties by Aug. 7.
	   ``I cannot accept the FIFA position,'' minister Jacek Debski
said in an interview. ``FIFA cannot demand that Poland ceases to
apply its own law and follows FIFA regulations.''
	   FIFA and UEFA have demanded that Debski reinstate Polish Soccer
Federation administrators he suspended in May after they refused to
submit to a probe of mismanagement accusations. The international
federations argue that national soccer unions should remain
independent from the government.
	   Debski argued that the administrators would be immediately
reinstated if government controllers review union files and say
everything is all right.
	   ``The government is using its powers according to the law,'' he
said. ``The fact that they have been refusing to submit to a probe
for many months must arouse suspicion.''
	   Debski said he hopes that a court-appointed mediator will be
able to convene the soccer federation's congress to elect new union
administrators.
	   The soccer federation is one of the few sectors in Polish life
that has failed to adapt to free market conditions since the fall
of communism in 1989, the minister charged.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for the ``poor
condition'' of Polish soccer.
	   He said the main problems included corruption among players and
referees, lack of training facilities and programs.
	   If barred from international competitions, Polish clubs will
seek compensation from the World and European federations through
international arbitration, he said.
	   Polish Soccer Federation spokesman, commenting on the conflict,
told the PAP news agency that soccer officials were disgusted with
Debski's ``uncompromising position.''
	   ``We will do everything possible not to allow barring of our
teams from the competitions, but if we fail, then only one person
will be responsible for the failure of Poland's soccer: Jacek
Debski,'' spokesman Tomasz Jagodzinski said.

More than 100 civilians reported massacred in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Attackers massacred 110 civilians in
Angola's remote northeast, according to unconfirmed reports from
the area Friday. Angolan media quoted survivors as saying the
fighters were from UNITA, a rebel group that was to have disbanded
under the country's peace treaty.
	   The Luanda-based U.N. mission overseeing Angola's peace process
said its staff in Lunda Norte province reported local police as
saying 110 villagers were slain and more than 80 were wounded in
Tuesday night's attack.
	   Survivors interviewed by Angolan media alleged the attackers
were from UNITA, which signed a pact with the government in 1994 to
end a two-decade civil war.
	   Reports of the attack came within days of Portuguese Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama's declaration that there was ``a dangerous
crisis'' in Angola and urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
visit the country as soon as possible to halt its imminent slide
back into civil war. Angola is a former Portuguese colony.
	   UNITA was to have demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla army
under the U.N.-brokered peace deal, but the government claims it
still has armed men hidden in the bush of this vast southwest
African country.
	   The attack reportedly occurred at the small village of Bula,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Luanda, in a diamond-rich
area near the country's northern border with Congo.
	   The U.N. mission, which has 1,200 staff in Angola, said it
planned to send officials to Bula to check the reports.
	   A survivor told private radio station Luanda-Antena Comercial
that the attackers used automatic weapons, machetes and grenades.
	   The villagers were believed to be mostly illegal diamond-diggers
from the Congo, Senegal and Mali, the U.N. said.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte. The diamonds provide the movement with hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, analysts say.
	   Dozens of civilians and police have been killed in ambushes in
remote areas during the past two months.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for the attacks, saying the
former rebels want to destabilize the country, though Jonas
Savimbi's movement has denied involvement.
	   Full implementation of the peace accord has been delayed by
lingering hostility between the former foes.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, alleging that police have committed human rights
abuses in areas already handed over.

Foreign diplomats seek negotiated end to Guinea-Bissau conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Diplomats from Portuguese-speaking
nations arrived Friday in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa to try and
mediate an end to the seven-week-old conflict between the
government and a breakaway military faction.
	   The six diplomats _ the foreign ministers of Portugal,
Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe, as well as
officials from Brazil and Angola _ arrived on board a Portuguese
Navy frigate, a Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman said in
Lisbon.
	   They were flown into the capital Bissau by helicopter and due to
meet with President Joao Bernardo Vieira and members of the
government. Talks with rebel leaders were expected on Saturday.
	   Heavy shelling as the warring factions bombarded each other's
positions delayed the diplomats' arrival in Bissau for several
hours, the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The capital of the former Portuguese colony has been under
sporadic fire since June 7, when a breakaway military faction
occupied the city's main military garrison and the international
airport where they are still entrenched.
	   No figures were available on the total number of people killed
in the fighting, which also has spread to inland areas of this
small country of about 1 million people wedged between Senegal and
Guinea.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, accuse Vieira of corruption and demand that he step down.
Vieira is supported by some 1,300 troops from neighboring Senegal.
	   Previous mediation efforts _ by the foreign ministers of
Portugal and Angola and by local politicians and civic and
religious leaders _ have failed.

Tribunal prosecutor accuses Serbs of hindering arrest efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Bosnian Serb authorities are
issuing indicted war crimes suspects with false identity papers in
an effort to ``deliberately frustrate'' NATO arrest operations, the
chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal claimed
Friday.
	   The statement by Louise Arbour followed the arrest Wednesday
night by troops in NATO's Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia of
two brothers believed to be war crimes suspects.
	   The brothers turned out not to be Predrag Banovic and his twin
brother Nenad, who are accused of killing and torturing Muslim
inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the summer of
1992. NATO returned the wrongly arrested brothers to the eastern
Bosnian town of Prijedor Thursday.
	   ``Several of the accused who have been arrested by SFOR this
year have had in their possession ... false official identity
papers, including photographs, issued by various Republika Srpska
authorities,'' Arbour claimed in a written statement, referring to
the Serbian entity in Bosnia.
	   ``This demonstrates that not only is Republika Srpska avoiding
its legal obligations ... but has also been engaged in deliberately
frustrating the tribunal's work by issuing false identification
papers to those persons indicted by the tribunal in an attempt to
shield them from the tribunal's jurisdiction.''
	   Arbour also reiterated that under the peace deal that ended the
Bosnian war the primary responsibility for arresting indicted
suspects lies with local authorities.
	   Serbian officials say their constitution prohibits them
arresting Serb nationals and extraditing them to The Hague.
	   The tribunal has 27 suspects in custody, another 31 indicted
suspects remain at large, including former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic.

 &UR; Japan ruling party head and likely new premier to attend ASEAN
talks

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The newly elected head of Japan's ruling party has
decided to attend an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting
Sunday, just days before he is expected to be voted into office as
the next Japanese prime minister, the Japanese Foreign Ministry
said Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who won a race Friday to head the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, will depart Sunday for bilateral
talks and an informal dinner with foreign ministers participating
in the ASEAN Regional Forum in Manila, the ministry said in a
statement.
	   Obuchi will return to Tokyo early Monday, it said.
	   The Foreign Minister is almost certain to succeed outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto because the Liberal Democrats control
the government through a majority in the powerful lower house of
Parliament.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally be elected Japan's 18th premier
next week.
	   In Manila, Obuchi also hopes to hold bilateral talks with two
other non-ASEAN counterparts, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
	   Obuchi is expected to stress the importance of joint action to
convince India and Pakistan to stop building nuclear arms and sign
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the official said.

Bodies of guards killed in clash with Saudi returned to Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The bodies of three Yemeni guards killed
this week during clashes with Saudi Arabian forces have been
returned to Yemen, a government official said Friday.
	   The bodies arrived late Thursday from southern Saudi Arabia
where they had been taken by the Saudis after the clashes Sunday on
the disputed Red Sea island of Duwaima, said the official speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   One Saudi soldier and nine Yemenis were injured during the
clash, the result of a decades-old territorial dispute between the
two neighbors.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
border region of Empty Quarter, a vast desert with potentially
lucrative oil fields. Fighting has occasionally erupted along their
2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.
	   Besides, the two nations have yet to demarcate a mountainous
border in the east.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh accused Saudi Arabia of
shelling the Duwaima island and firing rockets at border guards
stationed there. Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef said the
Saudis fired in self-defense. The five-hour fighting stopped after
a cease-fire was negotiated.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the border before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire and
an eventual withdrawal.
	   The latest clash comes during a tense time in Yemen, which is
reeling from weeks of protests against a 40 percent hike in fuel
prices and battles between restive tribesmen and government forces.

Schumacher can overtake Hakkinen for Formula One lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Michael Schumacher can take the
Formula One lead and drive Ferrari closer to the coveted title in
the 10th race of the season, the Grand Prix of Austria.
	   Schumacher trails Mika Hakkinen of McLaren-Mercedes by two
points going into Sunday's race, the 10th in the 17-race Formula
One season, and has the momentum after three straight victories.
	   In Friday's free practice, Schumacher posted only the seventh
fastest time over two sessions. But the free practice is used to
experiment with tires and set-ups and usually means little for the
starting grid, which will be determined in Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``We had a few more difficulties than expected,'' Schumacher
said. ``On my first run a front wheel locked up and I went off the
track. I lost the rest of the morning session while the mechanics
worked on the car to repair the damage from the gravel.''
	   ``In the afternoon, I had a similar situation _ this time a rear
wheel locked up. We will have a lot of work to do tomorrow to be
competitive in qualifying,'' Schumacher said.
	   David Coulthard gave the sagging McLaren fortunes a much-needed
boost when he posted the fastest time in the free practice of one
minute, 13.703 seconds over the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) lap at the
A1-Ring.
	   ``We made encouraging progress,'' Coulthard said. ``I believe
tire wear is going to be an issue for all the teams this weekend.''
	   Hakkinen, who leads Schumacher 56-54 in the drivers' standings,
had the third fastest time of 1:13.746. Giancarlo Fisichella in a
Benetton-Playlife was second in 1:13.704, just 1/1000th of a second
behind Coulthard.
	   ``There was a lot of dust on the track and I found myself caught
up in traffic on a number of occasions,'' Hakkinen said.
	   After dominating the early past of the season, the McLaren team
has gone into a slump.
	   Coulthard has finished only one of his last four races, a sixth
place in the Grand Prix of France on June 28.
	   Hakkinen has won four races this season, but he is winless since
the Grand Prix of Monaco on May 24. He was forced to retire in
Canada, finished third in France and second in Silverstone at the
Grand Prix of Britain two weeks ago.
	   That finish is still contested. As Hakkinen took the checkered
flag in the final lap, Schumacher was in the box sitting out a
10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. Schumacher
was awarded victory since he had led Hakkinen by more than 10
seconds. McLaren has appealed against the ruling and the sport's
governing body will make a ruling Monday in Paris.
	   In last year's Austrian Grand Prix, the first in 10 years and
the first to be held on the revamped circuit once popularly called
Zeltweg after the nearby village, Schumacher was thwarted by
another 10-second penalty.
	   The penalty that took Schumacher into the box allowed Jacques
Villeneuve to race to victory and take a decisive step toward the
Formula One championship.
	   But Villeneuve and his Williams-Mecachrome team have been
struggling this season and the Canadian has yet to finish among the
top three. Villeneuve's best finishes this season were a pair of
fourth places, at the San Marino GP and in France.
	   There was little encouragement for the reigning champion, who
had the 13th fastest time in Friday's practice. His Williams
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen did even worse, being left in 17th
place after spinning out and finishing in the gravel.
	   ``it was very slippery out there and it is much hotter than last
year,'' Villeneuve said. ``We are far back, but the times are very
tight. It's difficult to say how much more I can get out of the car
for qualifying tomorrow.''
	   Villeneuve announced Thursday that he was leaving Williams at
the end of the season for the new British American Racing team.
Frentzen also seems unlikely to remain at Williams.

Fires continue to burn around Greece

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Forest fires continued to rage around
Greece Friday, two days after four firefighters were killed
battling a blaze in the capital.
	   More than 300 acres (150 hectares) of forest were destroyed on
Mount Olympus, the legendary home of the gods in northern Greece,
from a fire which began in Agia Kori, 400 kilometers (249 miles)
northwest of Athens.
	   Firefighters and helicopters also battled fires in the town of
Amfilohia, 425 kilometers (264 miles) northwest of Athens.
	   Brush fires were also reported in the northern regions of
Kastoria, Chalkidiki and on the islands of Evia and Cephalonia.
	   Fires were also reported in the Peloponnese region, including a
blaze near the port of Patra.
	   Dozens of homes and warehouses have been destroyed in forest and
brush fires around the country over the past week.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko drew up plans Friday for a summit between
their presidents that is likely to take place in just over a
month's time.
	   It was Gore's first encounter with Kiriyenko since he became
prime minister earlier this year, and the vice president said he
was impressed.
	   ``He's committed to reform,'' Gore told NBC-TV News. ``He's a
dynamic, decisive young prime minister. He seems to be off to a
great start.''
	   Gore has long co-chaired a joint commission on scientific and
technical concerns, previously headed by Kiriyenko's predecessor,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   ``It's good to see so many long-time friends on your side of the
table,'' Gore said after shaking hands with the Russian delegation
Friday morning at the President Hotel. ``I want you to know that
President (Bill) Clinton and I are absolutely committed to
deepening these relationships.''
	   Their main task was to set the agenda for a Moscow summit
between Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, planned for the
end of August or early September.
	   However, the two sides also discussed two topics of long-term
concern to the United States: the spread of Russian missile
technology to Iran, and Russia's long-stalled ratification of the
START II arms reduction treaty.
	   Gore later telephoned Yeltsin to discuss the summit and to
praise his speech at the recent funeral of Nicholas II, Russia's
last czar who was executed by the Bolsheviks 80 years ago.
	   ``I greatly admired your speech at the funeral in St.
Petersburg,'' Gore told Yeltsin, who is vacationing in northwestern
Russia. ``I thought it was very eloquent and I congratulate you on
your statesmanship and leadership.''
	   Gore and Kiriyenko also signed two agreements.
	   One would set up a program to address the problems of Russia's
``defense cities'' _ isolated research communities that are having
trouble making their way in the new economy. The agreement would
include U.S. funding and know-how for converting such facilities to
civilian use and finding new jobs for their scientists.
	   The second agreement would provide U.S. funding for a new plant
to reprocess plutonium from Russian nuclear weapons into fuel for
power plants. The plan is designed to prevent nuclear materials
from getting into the wrong hands.
	   The two sides also discussed funding for joint space programs,
which have been delayed by Russia's cash problems. Gore won a
promise from the Russians to find the money to fulfill its
obligations to the international space station, whose launch has
been pushed back to November, said Yuri Koptev, head of Russia's
space agency.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko both described the U.S.-Russian relationship
in grand terms, saying tackling common problems will help it grow
stronger.
	   ``The U.S.-Russian relationship will play a key role, indeed the
decisive role, in determining what kind of a world we create for
our children and our grandchildren,'' Gore said.
	   ``We hope that by the 21st century we will have resolved all
outstanding issues and eliminated the negative consequences of the
past,'' Kiriyenko added.
	   The two men also touched on Russia's financial crisis. However,
Gore had little to say on the issue, the U.S. official said, since
Kiriyenko displayed both knowledge of the problems and the
determination to fix them.
	   Gore spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in Moscow on
Thursday evening.
	   The vice president toured the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear
reactor Thursday, becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official the
site of the world's worst nuclear accident.

UEFA awards Georgian champion 3-0 Champions Cup default win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Friday awarded Dinamo Tbilisi a
3-0 default win against Albanian champion Vallaznia after the
latter used a substitute not listed on the referee's list of
players.
	   On Wednesday Dinamo, of Georgia, won the first leg of the teams'
Champions Cup qualifying round tie 1-0.
	   In the 83rd minute of the match, Vallaznia brought on an
unlisted substitute, prompting the UEFA disciplinary body to impose
the default win for its opponent, UEFA said in a statement.
	   The second leg of the tie takes place in Tirana next Wesnesday.
An appeal lodged by Vallaznia will be heard the day before the
match, UEFA said.
	   The European body also suspended Vallaznia's Gjergj Shlakku for
two UEFA club matches following his dismissal for ``particularly
rough play.''

Australian foreign minister urges Japan to speed up economic
</HEADLINE>
reforms

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Friday that he hopes Japan's new prime minister will implement
economic reforms quickly, noting the Japanese economy's importance
to the region.
	   Speaking to government-owned Hong Kong Radio after a meeting
with the territory's leader, Tung Chee-hwa, Downer said that Japan
does not have ``a lot of time to get its economy moving again.''
	   Downer addressed his remarks to Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign
minister and the newly-elected head of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party. Obuchi is widely expected to be voted into office
next week as the Japanese prime minister.
	   Downer said he and Tung shared the hope that Obuchi will move
the economic reform process along swiftly because the Asian region
also does not have a ``lot of time to wait for Japan to get its
economy moving again.''
	   Obuchi won a race Friday to become president of Japan's ruling
party. He automatically becomes the party's candidate for prime
minister when Parliament convenes for a vote, expected on July 30.
	   Downer arrived in Hong Kong for a brief stopover after a visit
to Malaysia. He is scheduled to attend the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations Regional Forum and post-ministerial conferences in
Manila from July 26-29.

Arab League to ask U.N. to send fact-finding mission on refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Arab League will ask the United Nations to
dispatch a fact-finding mission to Israel to investigate the status
of property once owned by Palestinian refugees, a PLO official said
Friday.
	   Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes or were driven out by
Israeli troops during the 1948 Mideast War. Many of the refugees
still live in camps scattered throughout the Middle East.
	   The fate of the refugees is supposed to be negotiated in future
talks between Israel and the Palestinians on a permanent peace
agreement.
	   Assad Abdel Rahman, the PLO official responsible for refugee
affairs, said the decision to ask for a U.N. fact-finding mission
was made during a meeting of representatives from countries that
have absorbed Palestinian refugees, including Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon. The meeting took place in Egypt five days ago, he said.

Thousands of soldiers to be mobilized ahead of banned rally: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with decision to change venue grafs 2, 4-7.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military will mobilize
around 9,000 soldiers in the capital city of Jakarta to stand guard
in anticipation of a rally by supporters of a prominent opposition
figure.
	   Police have refused to grant opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri and her supporters permission to stage the rally on
July 27, which was planned to commemorate the anniversary of a
bloody 1996 crackdown, at Jakarta's Senayan Sports Palace, for
security reason.
	   ``We have prepared 90 company-level squads to anticipate all
possible security disturbance,'' Jakarta Military Commander Maj.
Gen. Djadja Suparman was quoted as saying Friday by the Antara news
agency.
	   Suparman's statement came as the organizer decided to move the
commemoration from the sport palace.
	   ``In order to avoid undesired things, we have decided to move
the rally at other place,'' said Ray B. Janes, chairman of the
Jakarta branch of Megawati's faction. ``This decision is in line
with Ms. Megawati's attitude of always avoiding violence.''
	   Janes said they were still looking for other appropriate venues.
	   However, other supporters of Megawati criticized the military's
plans to mobilize troops.
	   ``Such an overacting reaction will only damage the image of the
security apparatus themselves,'' said Sukowaluyo Mintorahardjo, a
former noted legislator and ardent supporter of Megawati.
	   ``We just want to remind the nation that the raid that left some
deaths and missing has yet been resolved,'' he told the Associated
Press.
	   Two years ago Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto. That
led, however, to her ouster from the Indonesia Democratic Party in
June of 1996.
	   Megawati supporters protested the move by occupying party
headquarters, but on July 27 of that year rival party members
backed by the military and police staged a predawn raid on the
facility.
	   In the ensuing violence, at least five people were killed and
dozens of others were reported missing.

IMF mission to visit Russia in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission will return
to Moscow in early September to evaluate Russia's economic
performance and decide whether to release the second installment of
a bailout loan, a top IMF official said Friday.
	   The IMF approved its portion of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout
earlier this week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800
million after parliament failed to approve the austerity measures
it had demanded. The Russian government responded by circumventing
parliament and imposing the measures by decree.
	   By September, the IMF wants to see a draft 1999 budget submitted
to parliament, a reduction in the pension fund deficit, and
progress toward meeting 1998 budget targets, said the fund's Moscow
representative, Martin Gilman.
	   ``Only if all these steps are taken and IMF experts see
practical results of the efforts of tax agencies, the Finance
Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Trade and Industry Ministry,
the State Customs Committee and the Central Bank, will the mission
have reason to say that the financial situation in Russia has
started improving,'' Gilman said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia's economy has been slipping for months, after showing the
first signs of modest growth at the end of last year.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets, in part because of
world trends like falling oil prices, but also because of the
country's chronic failure to cut the federal budget and collect
taxes.
	   If the IMF likes what it sees in September, it will release the
remaining dlrs 800 million of the first installment plus a second
installment of dlrs 3.5 billion, Gilman said.
	   The government's cash shortage has resulted in a chronic failure
to pay workers' wages and pensions on time, and protest strikes
have swept across Russia in recent months.
	   On Friday, workers of the Amur Ship-Building Plant in the Far
East walked off the job to demand a year's backlog of unpaid wages,
exceeding 70 million rubles (dlrs 11 million), the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Coal miners from the town of Osinniki in Central Siberia's
Kemerovo region resumed a blockade of a local railway to demand
wages that are months overdue, Interfax reported, citing local
union leaders.
	   Gilman said that if the government improves its economic
performance in 1999, that, together with IMF support for the
Central Bank's gold and currency reserves, should encourage
investors to return to Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced plans Friday to issue bonds
redeemable by future gold production, Interfax said. The move is
intended to raise money to finance gold production. No other
details were released.
	   And, the Central Bank reduced a benchmark interest rate from 80
percent to 60 percent, ITAR-Tass reported. The rate, which was 24
percent in early February, was as high as 150 percent in the end of
May, as the bank sought to combat the market crisis.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has signed
several military pacts with Cuba, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Without giving details, the Congolese newspaper La Reference
Plus reported the agreements were made during an unpublicized visit
by Kabila to Cuba.
	   Congolese officials refused Friday to discuss the visit.
	   ``You'll have to wait until he returns,'' Interior Minister
Gaetan Kakudji said of Kabila's trip.
	   Cuban officials have made two visits to Congo since Kabila came
to power last year.
	   Kabila knew Cuba's President Fidel Castro in the 1960s, when
Cuban soldiers fought briefly alongside Kabila's then-unsuccessful
rebel force in what was then called Zaire.
	   During his years of opposition to the late longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila drew support from communist
countries. In recent years, Kabila has advocated free market
economics.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Riot police broke up fighting between two
rival cults on a Lagos university campus, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The clash between the cults _ the Black Axe and the Eiye
Fraternity _ occurred Thursday on the campus of the University of
Lagos, the daily Lagos Guardian said.
	   One student died in the violence, the paper reported.
	   Authorities canceled a campus beauty pageant, fearing more
violence.
	   At least 20 killings in the past three years have been blamed on
the dozen or so campus cults in the west African nation that are
also charged with rapes, extortion, assaults and arson attacks .
	   Police on Friday were guarding campus entrances and searching
people for weapons, the Lagos Guardian said.
	   ------
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ New graduates at a Nigerian university
will undergo testing for HIV, a Lagos newspaper reported Friday.
	   Freshmen at the university of Ife in southwest Nigeria will be
tested for the AIDS-causing virus and receive counseling, the
Lagos-based Daily Times quoted the university's vice chancellor
Wale Omole as saying.
	   About 90 percent of new students have reasonable knowledge about
HIV and AIDS, Omole said. One in 22 Nigerians is believed to carry
the virus.
	   Globally, about 30.6 million people live with the human
immunodeficiency virus or full blown AIDS, two-thirds of them in
sub-Saharan Africa, the U.N. AIDS agency says.

	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Gabonese police arrested more than 400
suspected illegal immigrants during a one-hour sweep through poor
neighborhoods in Gabon's capital of Libreville last week, Gabonese
state-run radio reported.
	   Those arrested were mostly Nigerians seeking work in the
oil-rich central African country, according to Radio-Television
Gabonese monitored Thursday in neighboring Cameroon.
	   About one-quarter of Gabon's population of 1.2 million people
are foreigners who serve as a source of cheap labor.
	   -----
	   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) _ Increased investment in tourism
accounted for most of the dlrs 4 billion in projects approved by
the government and presented to parliament on Friday.
	   Introducing budget estimates for the coming financial year,
Finance Minister Amina Salim Ali said the number of private
investment projects had nearly doubled over the previous year
because of increased political stability and better infrastructure.
	   The proposed projects include large hotels and rapid transport
services within the semi-autonomous archipelago and to mainland
Tanzania. Many of the investors are believed to be Italian, but
Salim Ali did not specify the countries.
	   In 1997, the number of tourists rose by nearly 20,000 to 87,000.
The government hopes to attract 100,000 visitors this year to
generate an income of dlrs 3.2 million.
	   Tanzania intends to replace income from the declining market for
cloves with tourism.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Wildlife officials suspect that poachers
started a fire burning in Kenya's largest game reserve, Tsavo,
officials said Friday.
	   The Kenya Wildlife Service said the fires were sighted Wednesday
by a service pilot who reported that vehicle tracks led from the
scene of the fire in Tsavo East National Park into neighboring
Tanzania.
	   ``It is believed the fires may have been started on purpose by
Tanzanian poachers in reprisal for being intercepted by KWS rangers
last week,'' the statement said.
	   The wildlife service said it had set up fire breaks to prevent
the blaze from spreading to tourist camps in the Lake Jipe area.
	   Earlier this month, fires set by herders and people making
charcoal burned almost 3,000 square kilometers, or roughly a third
of the park.
	   Together, Tsavo East and Tsavo West contain 20,020 square
kilometers (8,000 square miles) with endangered species such as
black rhinos and hirolla antelope.
	   ----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's Health Ministry said Friday
that three of the four children who died following a recent measles
vaccination campaign were suffering from other ailments, including
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV.
	   The deaths intensified resistance to a campaign that has
vaccinated 4.5 million children under age 15. Opponents include
apostolic church sects who reject schooling and western medicine.
	   Health Minister Timothy Stamps said the campaign would continue
in future years because it has saved many lives.
	   He said that two girls age 8 who died were already showing
severe symptoms of diseases associated with AIDS such as
tuberculosis, encephalitis and viral meningitis when they received
the shots.
	   A 19-month-old girl had died of internal injuries resulting from
rape, Stamps said.
	   Police report an upsurge of rapes of minors as the AIDS epidemic
spreads. One in four adults is infected with HIV.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Four new diamond mines will be
established in the eastern highlands of Lesotho, Natural Resources
Minister Monyane Moleleki said Friday.
	   The new mines would provide employment for the large number of
local mineworkers who have been retrenched from South African
mines, Moleleki said.
	   Lesotho is a mountainous kingdom wholly surrounded by South
Africa.
	   The minister said two mines near the border with South Africa's
KwaZulu-Natal Province and in the northeast highlands would start
operations before Christmas.
	   The other two would start operating early next year after
arrangements with the Lesotho Mining Board.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Convicted military coup plotter James
Njoloma died Thursday in the hospital section of Zomba Central
Prison, 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of here, state radio
announced Friday.
	   Njoloma, a former army lieutenant, was serving a 15-year term
for an abortive plot to overthrow President Bakili Muluzi's
government after the 1994 elections. Muluzi ousted former President
Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who died last year.
	   In 1995 Njoloma was convicted by a military court martial of
inciting mutiny. After two months in hiding he handed himself over
to authorities.
	   Malawi's prisons have recently been criticized by human rights
activists for a large number of deaths blamed on poor conditions,
overcrowding and AIDS.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Britain has announced a dlrs 22.6 million
grant to Ghana to help the West African country improve its water
distribution and treatment systems.
	   British High Commissioner Ian Mackley said letters of approval
would be exchanged with Ghana's housing and works minister Isaac
Adjei-Mensah on Friday.
	   The money will be used to upgrade water treatment facilities in
the cities of Kumasi and Sunyani in western Ghana.
	   Britain had earlier committed dlrs 33 million for water projects
in northern Ghana and announced a dlrs 85 million grant earlier
this month to Ghana's Education Ministry.
	   --
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has closed seven of its
diplomatic missions in a cost-cutting operation, Radio Tanzania
said Friday.
	   Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Emmanuel Mwambulukutu said
missions would be closed in Guinea, Sudan, Angola, Burundi and The
Netherlands, while staffs at missions in Rome and the Republic of
Congo (Brazzaville) would be greatly reduced.

Government: foreign minister justified in calling Clinton a liar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Friday said its foreign minister
was justified in calling U.S. President Bill Clinton a liar because
his administration has backed away from promises to solve the
Cyprus dispute.
	   ``Mr. Pangalos said a truth. He gave evidence which has
historical depth. He didn't make up or imagine things in order to
make a statement,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   His comment was made one day after Pangalos described
preelection promises made by Clinton to help solve the 24-year
division of Cyprus as ``gross lies.''
	   U.S.-led efforts to solve the Cyprus problem collapsed last May
when Turkish Cypriots insisted on recognition of their breakaway
state as a condition for resuming U.N.-sponsored peace talks. They
also demanded cancellation of the European Union's membership talks
with Cyprus.
	   Perceptions have been growing here that the United States has
been siding with Turkey over the Cyprus dispute.
	   Reppas defended a number of anti-American statements made by
senior officials following White House spokesman Mike McCurry's
Wednesday description of the 1974 events on Cyprus as a
``conflict'' rather than an invasion by Turkish forces.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the north.
	   ``We believe that as a reply the statements of the Greek
officials were necessary,'' Reppas said.
	   But despite the apparent deterioration in Greek-American
relations, Athens still welcomes Washington's mediation in efforts
to solve the island's problem.
	   ``The Greek government wishes for there to be progress on the
Cyprus issue. It wishes for the U.S. government to intensify its
efforts,'' Reppas said.

Ukrainian president demands flexibility in talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma ordered
government negotiators Friday to be flexible in talks with the
International Monetary Fund on a crucial dlrs 2.5 billion loan for
the former Soviet republic.
	   ``We never needed outside financing as acutely as now, in the
face of a full-blown financial crisis,'' Kuchma told a Cabinet
meeting.
	   Ukraine needs foreign financial aid urgently to make big foreign
and domestic debt payments in the next few months, including dlrs
500 million in August alone.
	   Kuchma said 90.5 percent of government revenues in the first
half of 1998 went to service Ukraine's foreign debt, which he said
was more than dlrs 18 billion.
	   Talks between government officials and an IMF mission are to
start in Kiev on Saturday. The IMF mission will assess how Ukraine
has implemented the conditions it set for qualifying for the loan.
	   Kuchma told Cabinet officials to ``unequivocally defend state
interests'' in the negotiations, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   But at the same time, Ukrainian negotiators ``must adopt a
constructive stance and offer alternative solutions for disputed
questions,' Kuchma said. ``In no circumstances should the talks be
pushed to a dead end.''
	   Also Saturday, the IMF mission is to discuss with Finance
Minister Ihor Mityukov the country's revised 1998 budget, which the
government has yet to implement.
	   Approval of the new budget, which would cut the deficit by one
percentage point to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, is a key
IMF requirement for disbursement of the loan.
	   Kuchma has recently issued a series of economic decrees, aiming
to bypass the largely leftist parliament and fulfill dozens of
other conditions set by the IMF.
	   The fund rejected a similar loan last year and suspended other
aid to Ukraine this spring because of stalled reforms and excessive
government spending.
	   Kuchma and other government officials have expressed confidence
that this might be the final trip by an IMF delegation to Ukraine
before it recommends approval of the loan.
	   Ukraine hopes the approval of the IMF loan would help it attract
foreign investments and would lead to a more-than dlrs 1 billion
loan from the World Bank, which also has suspended cooperation with
Ukraine.

Lebanese journalist sentenced to three years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A military court sentenced a Lebanese
journalist in absentia to three years in prison on security
charges, his lawyer said Friday.
	   The sentence was imposed Thursday on Pierre Atallah, a reporter
and copy-editor for the independent daily An-Nahar, who is in exile
in France.
	   The court convicted Atallah of ``visiting an enemy country
(Israel) as well as insulting security and judicial authorities.''
On top of the prison sentence, it fined him 500,000 Lebanese pounds
(dlrs 330), lawyer Butros Harb said.
	   Atallah, 38, fled to France in May 1997 after unidentified
assailants attacked him near his Beirut house on the same day that
the court charged him with spying for Israel.
	   In 1996, police detained him for two weeks after he interviewed
the leader of a small pro-Israeli, Christian militia in the
Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon.
	   He has denied all charges of involvement with Israel against
Lebanon.

Hague tribunal investigators in Dubrovnik
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Investigators from the war crimes
tribunal Friday visited Dubrovnik as part of an investigation into
Serb attacks on the city in 1991, the state-run news agency HINA
reported.
	   Two investigators of the tribunal, based in The Hague,
Netherlands, met with the town's mayor and surveyed television
footage from that period.
	   One of the investigators, Clint Williamson, confirmed that their
arrival is the beginning of the tribunal's investigation into the
events that occurred in the city in late 1991 and 1992, HINA
reported.
	   The investigators will remain in the city two days, the daily
Vecernji list reported.
	   Dubrovnik, the ancient town on Croatia's southern Adriatic
coast, was attacked in late 1991 from Montenegro and Serb-held
areas of Bosnia by the Yugoslav army and from the Adriatic by the
Yugoslav navy.
	   TV footage of relentless shelling of medieval fortresses and
houses in Dubrovnik, which is known across the world as a cultural
monument and tourist resort, as well as the siege and bombardment
of Vukovar on Croatia's east, prompted international condemnation
and recognition of Croatia's independence from former Yugoslavia.
	   The attacks on Dubrovnik and Vukovar were seen as the worst
episodes in the 1991 war, which broke out when Croatia's minority
Serbs rebelled against the country's independence.
	   Unlike Vukovar, Dubrovnik was not seized by the Serbs.
	   The Dubrovnik district court launched criminal investigations at
the end of the war against 146 Yugoslav army members and Serb
militiamen. No indictments have been issued yet.

After Iranian missile tests, Israel asks for U.S. intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Gore, grafs 2-3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the wake of an Iranian missile test launch,
Israel has asked the United States to try harder to prevent the
transfer of missile technology to Iran, an official said Friday.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore who is visiting Moscow, raised the
Iranian missile threat in talks with Russian leaders.
	   ``It's a continuing source of discussion and we got into it in
depth,'' Gore told NBC-TV News, ``I did raise this launch as an
example of why this is such a terrible problem that has to be
solved.''
	   Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and know-how to
the Iranian missile program. Russia has denied this.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called Leon Feurth, a top aide to
Gore, and had asked that Gore raise the issue, said an official
close to Sharansky, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Sharansky told the Gore aide that Wednesday's Iranian test
launch demonstrated how serious the threat to Israel was.
	   The Shahab-3 missile tested by Iran has a potential range of 800
miles (1,300 kilometers), enough to strike any target in Israel.
	   Sharansky told Feurth that if the transfer of Russian technology
was halted now, the Iranians would be unable to complete the
development of the missile system.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the defense minister said the test launch
gave new impetus to his demand for an additional dlrs 600 million
in defense spending. ``We'll need more resources, a bigger budget,
more deterrence capability and more motivation,'' Mordechai said.
	   The test launch came amid recent warnings from Israeli defense
experts that Israel's army was not ready to counter future threats,
such as ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the
hands of Iran and Iraq, Israel's most implacable foes.

Serb twins to sue for erroneous arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with physician's comments; CORRECTS names of those
mistakenly arrested and real suspects. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb twins
mistakenly arrested by NATO as war crimes suspects were physically
abused during their detention and will sue for damages, Bosnian
Serb police said Friday.
	   Miroslav and Milan Vucicevic, 26, were snatched Wednesday from
Prijedor by NATO peace keepers only to be released a day later.
They were mistaken for Predrag and Nenad Banovic, also twins,
wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
for atrocities allegedly committed during the Bosnian war in 1992.
	   ``In addition to physical abuse, the Vucicevic brothers have
endured a serious psychological trauma,'' said a police statement
in Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
``Miroslav and Milan Vucicevic have said they will bring charges.''
	   The brothers were not at their home in Prijedor on Friday, and a
relative said they were inaccessible, recovering in a local
hospital.
	   A doctor at the hospital said both had suffered ``psychological
stress and minor physical injuries ... indicating they had
sustained blows or been kicked.'' He refused to give his name.
	   ``The brutal arrest was carried out with considerable force,
which is obvious by numerous bruises ... on the faces and bodies of
both Vucicevic brothers,'' the Serb police statement read.
	   NATO officials have expressed regret for the wrong arrest.
	   The whereabouts of the real suspects remains unknown. Their
father has claimed they live in England, but has refused to provide
details.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Legislators on Friday chose an independent
committee including prominent government critics to determine who
was responsible for problems at Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion
airport.
	   Selina Chow of the pro-business Liberal Party will head the
13-member committee, which will look into the problems at Chek Lap
Kok airport. It will work independently of the commission appointed
by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Details of the legislature's study have yet to be hammered out
before the committee can begin the investigation, Hong Kong Radio
reported. The legislators are scheduled to meet next week.
	   Among the prominent critics of the government on the panel are
Emily Lau of the Frontier movement, Christine Loh of the Citizens'
Party and independent Margaret Ng, who represents the legal
profession in the legislature.
	   ``I feel that the members understand we can work
independently,'' said legislator James To of the Democratic Party.
``The committee will have a wider mandate, and we can summon even
the chief executive.''
	   Passenger services have improved since the airport opened July
6. The Airport Authority reported late Friday that 75 percent of
all flights left within 15 minutes of schedule. The average waiting
time for baggage was 14 minutes, it said.
	   But cargo-handling still is not up to full speed, and is not
expected to be until the end of August.
	   Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd, the territory's main cargo
handling operator, said that starting on Saturday it will be able
to handle an additional 300 tons of cargo daily at the new airport.
	   At present, it is handling slightly more than 50 percent of the
5,000 tons of cargo that was handled daily before the curtailment
of services due to computer problems.
	   Legislators toured the main cargo terminal Friday, but said they
were not satisfied with the visit.
	   Liberal Party member James Tien said the visit gave legislators
a better feel for the problems confronting Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, but that many questions remained unanswered.
	   The chairman of the government-appointed commission, Justice Woo
Kwok-hing has said that his investigation would operate under rules
of a judicial inquiry, meaning unfair public discussion of the case
during the investigation could constitute contempt of court.

Police seize smuggled marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officials on Friday seized 720
kilograms (1,587 pounds) of marijuana near the Greek-Albanian
border, the third large haul of the drug apparently smuggled across
the frontier in the past week.
	   The marijuana was found stashed in a hidden compartment in a
cargo truck apparently abandoned near the northern town of Ioanina,
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Albania, local media said.
	   No identification papers were found in the truck, reports said.
	   On Monday, authorities confiscated 306 kilograms (674 pounds) of
marijuana hidden in bushes near the northern seaside resort town of
Parga, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Greek-Albanian border.
	   Last Saturday, police arrested two Albanian men at the Kakavia

Mongolia's three-month old government resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Under fire for a disputed bank
merger, Mongolia's 3-month old coalition government resigned en
masse Friday after losing a vote of confidence in parliament.
	   The minority Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party had demanded
the vote following a feud with the government over its decision to
merge a state bank with a private bank. The opposition party
accused the government of organizing the merger in a way that
financially benefited its members.
	   In protest of the merger, the opposition party boycotted the
Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, for six weeks, throwing
proceedings into turmoil. Without its participation, laws, bills
and amendments had to be shelved.
	   Last Friday, the party said it would return to parliament if a
vote of confidence was taken.
	   Prime Minister Tsakiagiin Elbegdorj and his cabinet of ten
ministers submitted their resignation Friday to the Great Hural
after losing the vote 42-33.
	   The coalition government has 30 days to reorganize itself and
nominate a new prime minister.
	   It also claimed the government forced the Reconstruction Bank
into bankruptcy by issuing a series of bad loans worth U.S. dlrs
3.5 million.
	   Mongolia, once dependent on subsidies from Moscow, has seen its
economy weaken since the breakup of the Soviet Union. According to
World Bank estimates, 36 percent of its 2 million people live in
poverty. Inflation topped 30 percent last year and unemployment is
high in what is still a largely rural economy.
	   In 1990, peaceful protests forced the pro-Soviet People's
Revolutionary Party to drop communism and allow free and fair
multiparty elections. Its 75-year rule ended with a 1996
parliamentary election that swept the reformist Democratic Union
into office and won U.S. accolades for the nation's progress toward
democracy.

Limited progress on China WTO entry with telecoms offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ China made its first offer to open up its mobile
phone and pager industry to foreign competition Friday as part of
its latest efforts to gain membership of the World Trade
Organization. But its trading partners said it still needs to do
more.
	   The United States and other countries said they were pleased by
the telecoms offer. They have also welcomed a Chinese move to
eliminate restrictions on where foreign banks can set up
immediately after China joins.
	   But trade officials studying the Chinese bid at a working group
meeting in Geneva expressed concern that China did not offer to
free up its farming industry.
	   Government minister Long Yongtu said China is ``willing to
concert our efforts with all interested parties in order to make an
early breakthrough'' on farming.
	   U.S. officials said China couldn't take short cuts to gain
membership.
	   The United States has said any new offer will require broad
liberalization of the financial sector, not just selective
approvals for foreign banking, securities and insurance firms.
	   Chinese officials were optimistic. ``It is groundless to say
this negotiation has encountered some serious difficulties,'' Long
told a news conference.
	   The WTO is the main international body governing global trade
relations and setting fair trade rules. There is general agreement
China should join the organization and be bound by its
responsibilities, but no agreement yet on the price for this.
	   Beijing wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would
have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of
goods and services.
	   The United States, which has a big trade deficit with China,
says the entry terms should be tougher as the Chinese economy is
already well developed.
	   ``In opening up its market, China can only take a step-by-step
approach in line with its current level of economic development,''
Long told delegates.
	   China's telecoms proposal, which would also liberalize some data
services, would commit it to open up paging services to foreign
competition upon joining the WTO and mobile phone services five
years later.
	   A Chinese offer to scrap all restrictions on distribution
services within five years of joining, with around 10 exceptions,
didn't satisfy all delegations, trade officials said.
	   Negotiations on China's WTO entry have been in progress for 11
years.

Dresdner Bank makes payments 10 former slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Slave Workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ One of Germany's biggest banks paid
80,000 marks (dlrs 45,000) in compensation to 10 former slave
laborers at a Nazi weapons plant, a private group announced Friday.
	   The Frankfurt-based Initiative Against Forgetting said the
recipients were among 1,600 concentration camp prisoners sent to
work in the Frankfurt Adlerwerken.
	   Dresdner Bank spokeswoman Gabriele Eick confirmed that the bank
had made ``humanitarian'' payments to 10 men forced to work during
World War II in the company, which Dresdner Bank held a stake in.
	   The payments were made months ago and without any legal action,
she said, expressing astonishment that the private group had broken
an agreement about not making them public.

First Tour de France cyclist admits to doping as drama grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tour saying TVM could be expelled too if evidence
of doping; sports minister saying race must continue, TRIMS.
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Armin Meier on Friday became the
first cyclist to publicly admit taking the banned
performance-enhancing substance EPO in a widening drug scandal that
is overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   Riders, meanwhile, balked at starting the 12th stage of the
competition, saying that cycling was taking a backseat to the
doping investigation. They moved into action two hours after the
official starting time.
	   Meier said that during police questioning he had admitted to
taking EPO.
	   ``Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it,'' he told France Info radio. ``I'm just the victim of a
system.''
	   Meier refused to say if any of his teammates had also taken the
banned substance, and he criticized the police treatment of riders
during the interrogation.
	   ``I feel a little like a criminal. Each rider had two police
officers. They put me under pressure for four or five hours. They
took everything. I undressed. They could see all of me. I went into
a cell with a wooden bed.
	   ``But I feel better inside because I have told the truth.
Perhaps it is good for the sport.'' he added.
	   Tour organizers said that the Dutch TVM team, under suspicion
for possible doping, would, like Festina was last week, ``be
immediately expelled'' from the competition if there was firm
evidence against the team.
	   Two TVM officials were being questioned Friday.
	   By Friday afternoon, all Festina team riders had been released
from a Lyon jail along with joint sporting directors Miguel Moreno
and Michael Gros.
	   Richard Virenque, one of France's most popular riders,
maintained throughout questioning that he had not taken illegal
drugs, said his lawyer Gilbert Collard.
	   In Lille, in the north, Festina team director Bruno Roussel,
team doctor Eric Ryckaert and physiotherapist Willy Voet -- all
under formal investigation in the affair -- gave their versions on
the doping issue in a three-hour court session.
	   Voet was later freed from prison.
	   The TVM team's sporting director and doctor, detained Thursday,
were questioned in the southern town of Pamiers. They could be held
until Saturday.
	   The TVM team represents the latest chapter in the unfolding
doping drama surrounding the Tour de France.
	   About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a team car
near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time, but the
affair rebounded in the wake of the Festina scandal that is rocking
the cycling world.
	   The influential daily Le Monde called for an end to this year's
race, contending it has become a meaningless contest that now
impedes all sides from getting to the bottom of the issue.
	   ``Tour de France discredited,'' proclaimed Le Monde's front page
headline.
	   ``Who, from now on, could rejoice in seeing the rest of a
compromised pack enter Paris on Sunday, Aug. 2? Who would have the
heart to applaud the winner of a race without faith or law?,'' the
paper said in a commentary.
	   But Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet said Friday in an
interview with France Info radio that the race must go on.
	   ``The Tour is seriously ill,'' she said. ``But there's no reason
to kill it.''

Autopsy finds dead Bahraini killed himself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An autopsy has found that a Bahraini man
found dead in a mountain town this week had killed himself, news
reports said Friday, ending speculation that he was murdered for
political reasons.
	   Also Friday, a Bahraini envoy met with a top Lebanese Foreign
Ministry official to reiterate his government's position that the
dead man was not a Bahraini intelligence agent as the official
Lebanese news agency had reported.
	   ``It should be clear to all that the (dead Bahraini) is an
ordinary man and has no official capacity at all. He definitely has
no links to Bahrain's state security,'' Abdel Aziz Bouali,
Bahrain's ambassador to Syria, told reporters.
	   Bahrain does not have an embassy in Lebanon.
	   The body of the man, identified by local newspapers and the
Bahraini government as Tawfik Abdel-Nabi al-Baharna, was found
Monday on a road in the mountain town of Beit Mery with a gunshot
wound to his head and a pistol in his hand.
	   Lebanon's National News Agency said this week he was sent by the
Bahraini government to spy on Bahraini dissidents. Lebanese Foreign
Minister Fares Bweiz also said initially that al-Baharna was a
secret agent but retracted that statement Thursday.
	   Other news reports speculated that he was murdered. But on
Friday, newspapers published a police statement saying two
government coroners have confirmed that al-Baharna shot himself in
the head.
	   The suicide was confirmed by the gunpowder smudge around the
bullet wound, which indicated the gun was fired from not more than
five centimeters (2 inches) away from the head, the statement said.
	   Bouali, the Bahraini envoy, said al-Baharna ``was involved in
free businesses'' in Lebanon. He did not elaborate.
	   ``It has been proven that this man was passing through a
difficult financial crisis and a severe psychological crisis that
led him to commit suicide as has been confirmed by a coroner's
report,'' Bouali said.
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper said the victim committed suicide
after losing ``big amounts of money'' in gambling at a casino where
he reportedly was a regular customer.

Report: Suspects arrested in attack in Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Maskhadov denying blaming Russian secret
services, SPECIFIES that four suspects arrested, TRIMS pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen authorities arrested four suspects in an
assassination attempt on the president of the restive republic and
found ammunition and explosives in an apartment near where the
attack took place, Russian media reported Friday.
	   The suspects were being questioned about Thursday's car bombing
from which President Aslan Maskhadov escaped with only minor
bruises, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Russia's ORT television
station said there were four suspects.
	   Chechen officials have blamed either Russian security services
or Chechen warlords for the bombing that killed two presidential
bodyguards. But Maskhadov denied Friday that he personally accused
Russia.
	   Maskhadov called on former Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev
and two other opponents associated with Islamic fundamentalists to
swear an oath on the Muslim holy book, the Koran, that they had
nothing to do with the attack.
	   Yandarbiyev showed up Friday in an Islamic law court,
accompanied by bodyguards, and said he was ready to proclaim his
innocence ``1,000 times.''
	   Maskhadov's representatives said they were satisfied, and the
court cleared Yandarbiyev without requiring him to take the actual
oath, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Two warlords did not show up in court.
	   Yandarbiyev said he was convinced that the Russian special
services were behind the bombing and accused them of fomenting
tension between Maskhadov and his opponents in Chechnya.
	   At a news conference shortly after the bombing, Maskhadov blamed
unspecified foreign ``special services'' for the attack. Other
Chechen officials, including Maskhadov's deputy, Vakha Arsanov,
blamed Moscow.
	   Russian media said that in a televised address later in the day,
Maskhadov, too, specifically accused Russian secret services. But
on Friday his office denied that was the case.
	   ``Maskhadov stressed every time that the crime was organized and
ordered by foreign special services,'' the president's spokesman
Mairbek Vachagayev said Friday.
	   ``But he did not say these were Russian special services or the
special services of any other specific country,'' Vachagayev said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service has denied that it was
involved.
	   Following the attack, Chechen officials banned the broadcast of
Russian television channels in the republic, accusing them of
distorted coverage.
	   Chechnya remains unstable despite the end of the 1994-96 war
with Russia, and tensions have been rising in recent weeks as
Maskhadov cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists linked to
the Wahhabi movement.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory last year, but has
been unable to contain the soaring crime or improve the republic's
economy, which was ruined by the war.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew at the end of 1996, but no one has recognized its
independence bid and Moscow insists that the territory remains part
of Russia.

Openers take England to 105 without loss at tea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Mark Butcher and Mike Atherton
replied boldly to South Africa's 374, putting on a century stand as
England went into tea at 105 without loss on the second day of the
fourth cricket test Friday.
	   The England openers weathered opening stints from pace bowlers
Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock at Trent Bridge and then started
asserting some authority _ the missing ingredient in England's
recent innnings.
	   Butcher, returning to the side after a two-match absence with a
hand injury, raced to his half century and was 52 not out with
Atherton unbeaten on 40 at the break.
	   Butcher cover drove Pollock for three to reach his fourth half
century in 12 tests and in the process brought up the century stand
in the 38th over.
	   It was England's best opening stand since the pair scored 179 in
the first innings the first test at Edgbaston. Butcher contributed
77 while Atherton made 103.
	   The South African three pronged pace attack struggled for line
despite conditions being ideal for seam and swing bowling under
overcast condition.
	   Earlier in the day, England made an early inroad to the South
African innings by removing skipper Hansie Cronje for 126 in the
first hour of play.
	   But the home side was frustrated by a 49-run stand between
33-year-old test debutant Steve Elworthy (48) and Donald, unbeaten
on four, before Darren Gough knocked out Elworthy and Paul Adams in
successive overs.
	   Gough took four wickets and conceded 116 runs.
	   Angus Fraser, who had won selection after a toss of a coin with
Alan Mullally, was by far the menacing of the England medium pace
quartet.
	   He added the wicket of Cronje to his first day's scalps _ Daryll
Cullinan, Jonty Rhodes, Pollock and Boucher _ for his 11th
five-wicket haul.
	   Fraser finished with 5-60 _ his first five-wicket haul against
South Africa _ in 26 overs while another debutant, Andrew Flintoff,
took 1-52.
	   Cronje, who joined Johnny Waite as the only two South African to
play 50 tests, was lifted by the announcement that he has been
retained captain until the end of next year's World Cup in England.
	   In the process, he will lead South Africa in the final test at
Leeds, five against West Indies and three more in New Zealand.
	   Cronje's century was his first in 46 test innings, since his 101
against New Zealand at Auckland in 1994/95.

Wife of suspected Croatian war criminal arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The wife of a Croatian who led a
Nazi-era concentration camp was arrested Friday following an
extradition request from Yugoslavia.
	   Nada Sakic, 76, wife of former Jasenovac concentration camp
commandant Dinko Sakic, was taken before a federal judge for
extradition hearings, said Eduardo Musto, an Interpol spokesman in
Buenos Aires.
	   Nada Sakic, known here by her Spanish given name Esperanza, is
believed to have run a female block at Jasenovac when she was only
16.
	   Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic asked for her
extradition on Tuesday.
	   Dinko Sakic was extradited to Croatia last month and is expected
to stand trial there on charges of war crimes and crimes against
humanity.
	   Now in Zagreb's main prison, Sakic fled Croatia in 1945, when
its wartime Nazi puppet state was defeated. He lived quietly in
Santa Teresita, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the
Argentine capital, until April of this year, when he acknowledged
in an interview that he ran Jasenovac.

Pfizer applies for approval to sell Viagra in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to with Pfizer confirming application

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pfizer Inc. applied Friday for permission to sell
its Viagra impotence remedy in Japan, where the little blue pill
has already caused a media sensation, the company said.
	   Viagra's debut has been given extensive coverage in Japan,
especially in the tabloid press. One weekly magazine even printed
an article advising Japanese readers how to obtain the drug by mail
order.
	   The pills, available only by prescription in the United States,
have been legally imported to Japan by individuals and then resold
by marketers exploiting a ban on selling unapproved drugs
wholesale.
	   A Japanese travel agency has even begun tours to Hawaii for the
sole purpose of getting a prescription for Viagra.
	   In Japan, 30-tablet bottles of the drug have been sold for as
much as 80,000 yen (dlrs 570). In the United States, Viagra sells
for about dlrs 10 a pill.
	   Last week, the health ministry reported Japan's first death of a
man who had taken Viagra, and warned against using it without
proper instruction.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms dotted the regional
waters overnight with clusters of showers moving across the Virgin
Islands and large portions of Puerto Rico. Most of this activity
was moving west near 20 mph, making it difficult for large rainfall
accumulations to occur. This weather pattern is expected to prevail
across the local area today before gradual clearing occurs across
the Virgin Islands this afternoon.
	   Overnight showers and thunderstorms were the result of a
low-level trough moving west into the local region and encountering
an unstable atmosphere produced by an upper-level trough extending
from just east of the Bahamas southeastward towards Puerto Rico.
Both of these features are moving west this morning and should end
their effects on our local area this evening across eastern
sections and early tonight across west sections. However,
sufficient moisture and instability will prevail today to produce
isolated areas of very heavy rainfall and flash flooding and
mudslides will be possible. After a few short hours of drier
weather and minor clearing across the area this evening and early
tonight, a long narrow cloud band with scattered showers and
isolated thunderstorms is expected to move west across the Lesser
Antilles and into the Virgin Islands shortly after midnight and
into eastern Puerto Rico during the middle of the night.
	   This cloud band will mark the beginning of increasing winds and
more stable atmospheric conditions across the northeast Caribbean.
During the day Saturday, look for freshening trade winds of 15 to
20 knots with a gradual increase in wind and seas over the weekend.
After several days of winds near 20 knots and rough seas off shore,
marine conditions across the local waters have subsided in the past
36 hours and all small craft advisories have been discontinued.
Winds and seas more typical of July are expected through tonight
before the increasing trend begins again.

Greece shortlists American, Russian missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Friday said it has narrowed its
choices for a new anti-aircraft defense system to the American
Patriot and Russian S-300 missile.
	   Greece is looking for new fighter jets, missiles, ships, tanks
and other weapons as part of an estimated dlrs 24 billion five-year
arms modernization program.
	   A decision on the missile system will be taken in September, the
government said after a meeting of its defense council. Decisions
on other weapons systems are also expected to come in the fall.
	   According to Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, Greek
officials will make a decision based on cost and immediate delivery
of the missile system.
	   There have been reports that Greece may also wind up with the
S-300 missiles destined for the war-divided eastern Mediterranean
island of Cyprus.
	   Greece says it needs the new weapons because of a perceived
threat from neighboring NATO ally Turkey. The two countries have
nearly gone to war three times in the past 24 years.
	   Turkey is also shopping for new arms, budgeting dlrs 150 billion
over the next 25 years to upgrade its own weaponry.
	   Greece is looking at a various American and Russian weapons
systems. The only Russian equipment that Greece looks set to
acquire are large troop and cargo carrying hovercraft.
	   Athens is considering American F-15E's, F-16's and the Abrams
main battle tank. Except for American and French weapons already in
its arsenal, Greece is also considering such Russian systems as the
SU-27 jet.

Photographer who inspired Fellini is dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tazio Secchiaroli, a Roman photographer who inspired
the ``paparazzo'' character in Federico Fellini's film ``La Dolce
Vita,'' died in his home following a long illness, the family said
Friday. He was 73.
	   Secchiaroli was one of a pack of photographers who chased and
snapped U.S. movie stars and other VIPs along Via Veneto and in the
local night clubs in the 50s and 60s when Rome was known as
``Hollywood on the Tiber.''
	   After ``La Dolce Vita'' was shown, the term ``paparazzo'' became
synonymous with pesky, star-pursuing photographers.

Hutu party denies role in fighting near Bujumbura
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHABATAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A Burundian Hutu political party Friday
denied it had anything to do with fighting earlier this week
outside Bujumbura in which 20 people were reported killed.
	   ``We are totally disassociating (ourselves) with the attack
which took place in Bujumbura on Wednesday,'' said Palipehutu
leader Sezoya Antoine.
	   The fighting occured Wednesday in Matambu commune in Rural
Bujumbura province, 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the capital,
Bujumbura. The provincial governor said armed elements of
Palipehutu were reponsible for the attack, which contravened a
cease-fire that was supposed to have begun Monday together with the
second round of all-party peace talks on Burundi in this northern
Tanzanian town.
	   Fighting was also reported the same day in Burundi's southern
regions of Makamba and Bururi.
	   The Palipehutu is one of 19 groups attending the talks aimed at
ending the conflict in Burundi involving the predominantly Tutsi
government forces and Hutu rebels.
	   Antoine said Palipehutu's armed wing, the National Front for
Liberation, stopped fighting July 20 as agreed last month at the
first round of talks mediated by former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere.
	   ``We want everybody to respect the peace agreement signed here
last month by all parties,'' he said.
	   Burundian military officials have said the cease-fire is not
applicable to the army since it has a duty ``to protect citizens.''
	   Brussels-based representatives of the largest Hutu rebel group,
the Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD) have distanced the
group from the cease-fire agreement. They say Leonard Nyangoma, who
signed the agreement on the organization's behalf, no longer
represents the group.
	   Stanislas Ntahobari, governor of Rural Bujumbura, accused
Palipehutu of drawing attention to itself by mounting an attack
while the talks are underway.
	   ``There are those trying to destabilize who want to make their
presence known while the negotiations are being conducted in
Arusha,'' Ntahobari said. ``It was the same thing during the first
round of negotiations.''
	   The governor said 3,000 people had left their homes on the
orders of the military after the fighting broke out. They have
gathered in government-protected areas in the same region.
	   Meanwhile, the talks continued Friday behind closed doors, but
Nyerere's spokesman, Hashim Mbita, declined to give details.

Six lawmakers leave Polish coalition over Gdansk shipyard decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Six Solidarity deputies defected Friday
from the ruling parliamentary coalition to protest the
Solidarity-led government's failure to bail out the Gdansk shipyard
where their democratic movement was born.
	   The rightist Solidarity bloc and its coalition partner still
have a majority of 245 in the 460-member lower house.
	   But the defections continue an erosion of support from within
that eventually could hamper the government's ability to push
through free-market reforms to qualify for European Union
membership. Nine other deputies defected in recent weeks,
protesting hardships caused by reforms.
	   Friday's walkout was prompted by a court decision Thursday to
allow the sale of the Gdansk shipyard, which was declared bankrupt
in August 1996.
	   The deputies said it was ``shameful'' that the shipyard where
Lech Walesa and colleagues challenged communist rule and founded
Solidarity should be sold during a Solidarity-led government. They
argued the government should have done more to bail out the
shipyard.
	   The government, seeking to please EU officials in Brussels, was
allowing the ``hasty sellout of national property into foreign
hands and the intellectual degradation of the young generation,''
the defectors said in a statement.
	   They said they planned to try to form a new rightist opposition
bloc. The government's main opposition remains a parliamentary bloc
made up of 164 former communists and 27 Peasants Party members.
	   The court ruled Thursday that the shipyard could be sold to a
consortium of the Gdynia shipyard and Evip Progress consulting
firm, rejecting the Gdansk board's offer to negotiate a settlement
with the shipyard's creditors.
	   The court said the Gdansk board failed to prove it could pay off
the shipyard's debts of 628 million zloty (dlrs 182 million) and
said Gdynia's offer was ``the most profitable and credible.''
	   The Gdansk board said it would appeal the court decision.
	   The shipyard's branch of the Solidarity trade union also opposed
the sale, saying the buyers did not make enough guarantees for
worker welfare.
	   The buyers pledged to spend dlrs 80-100 million through 2010 to
modernize the shipyard and boost the work force from the current
2,000 to as many as 4,500.
	   The buyers reportedly paid at least 100 million zloty (dlrs 29
million) for the Gdansk shipyard.
	   The Gdynia shipyard, which employs 8,000 people, overcame a
financial crisis itself and made 53 million zloty (dlrs 15.3
million) profit last year. It plans to build 12 ships this year.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A long-awaited and costly champagne
came out of storage Friday, but the service wasn't exactly elegant
_ instead of tuxedoes, the servers wore dripping frogmen suits
after salvaging the bubbly from a Baltic shipwreck.
	   The champagne, along with barrels of cognac, has been lying on
the seabed off the southwest coast of Finland since 1916, when a
German U-boat torpedoed the schooner that was carrying an order for
the Russian army.
	   A salvage team had been working for weeks to raise the schooner,
the Joenkoeping, from a depth of 64 meters (210 feet), battling bad
weather much of the time.
	   On Friday, the team raised the Joenkoeping (pronounced
YEUN-sheu-ping) to within 10 meters of the surface. Frogmen dove
down and gathered the champgne in baskets.
	   ``It's going very well. The sea is calm, and the divers are
bringing up the champagne quicker than we can count,'' said salvage
team member Markku Kankaristo by telephone from the diving site
near Rauma, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   According to freight documents, the Joenkoeping was carrying
about 5,000 bottles of Hiesdieck Gout Americain champagne, 67
barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of wine when it was sunk,
Kankaristo said.
	   The wreck was discovered last year by a Swedish team of divers
which salvaged several hundred bottles of the champagne.
	   Along with weather problems, the salvage effort also was delayed
by a dispute over ownership. Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman
laid claim to the cargo because the company of his
great-grandfather was involved in the order.
	   Fryckman's frogmen recovered hundreds of bottles from the wreck
until a Finnish court ordered him to remove his divers and vessel
from the salvage site, allowing the Swedish-led operation to
continue until the end of the year.
	   Depending on how much of the cargo is intact, it could fetch
some dlrs 2 million at auction, experts have estimtaed.
	   ``It's very murky down there, and we just don't have any idea''
how much is intact, Kankaristo said. ``Also, we don't know what
condition the wine and cognac are in.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko drew up plans Friday for a summit between

	   It was Gore's first encounter with Kiriyenko since he became
prime minister earlier this year, and the vice president said he
was impressed.
	   ``In a very short period of time he has established a full

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After a campaign of bold pledges of far-reaching
reform, fresh leadership and radical initiatives, Japan's ruling
Liberal Democrats elected the favorite of party powerbrokers as
their president Friday, scorning a revolt by rebel lawmakers and
defying voter demands for change.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi walked away with a commanding
majority of the 414 votes cast in the first ballot for party
president, a post that is almost sure to lead to his assumption of
the premiership when the Parliament votes later this month.
	   Obuchi's victory was a triumph for party elders who staved off a
push by dissident lawmakers to pick a leader more appealing to an
electorate increasingly impatient with the LDP's failure to turn
around Japan's worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   Disgruntled party members, opposition leaders and other critics
immediately lashed out at the selection of Obuchi _ a long-term LDP
insider who is not known as an innovator _ as a sign that the party
is unable to update its ways. The opposition called for immediate
lower house elections.
	   ``The LDP just has empty words,'' scowled Hideyuki Otsuka, owner
of a small company in Tokyo. ``Japan needs adventurous leadership
that can bring about change once and for all.''
	   Obuchi overcame challenges from two candidates who offered more
radical solutions to Japan's economic problems in an unusually open
race that was touted as a major move by the party to be more
responsive to the public.
	   After the vote, Obuchi declared his victory reflected a mandate
for his policies and called for party unity.
	   ``This election was conducted in completely different way from
... the past,'' he declared. ``Because the economic slump in our
country has a big impact on Asia and the rest of the world, we have
to pull Japan out of recession as soon as we can.''
	   Because of the LDP control of the lower house, Obuchi was
virtually certain to win the election for prime minister in
Parliament expected on July 30 and succeed Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
announced last week he would resign after the party's humiliating
defeat in July 12 upper house elections.
	   Obuchi crushed his opponents in Friday's vote, garnering 225
votes _ well ahead of the 102 ballots won by former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and the 84 votes received by maverick
candidate Health Secretary Junichiro Koizumi.
	   The economy dominated the campaign. While all the candidates had
similar proposals, Obuchi _ apparently with the OK of the party
leadership _ fleshed his policies out with the most details.
	   The main thrust of Obuchi's economic program is trying to get
Japan's thrifty consumers to buy. He has proposed 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) in tax cuts and a 10 trillion yen spending
package. Obuchi also said that cleaning up the debt-plagued
financial sector with a swift implementation of the ruling party's
``bridge bank'' scheme was among his top priorities.
	   Despite skepticism about his credentials as a reformer, Obuchi
said he would work to wrest more power from Japan's bureaucrats,
who traditionally have all but dictated policy to lawmakers.
	   ``It should be up to politicians to come up with the best
policies for the people and for bureaucrats to execute them,'' he
said.
	   The opposition called for dissolving the powerful lower house of
Parliament _ where the LDP still commands a majority _ and holding
immediate elections. Such a move could capitalize on voter
discontent with the ruling party and drive it from power.
	   ``We do not foresee the LDP taking a stance aimed at making
major reforms,'' Naoto Kan, leader of the opposition Democratic
party and Japan most popular politican was quoted as saying by
Kyodo News agency. ``Reform can only take place under a government
selected by citizens.''
	   The results of the election came after the close of the Tokyo
stock markets. In currency markets, Obuchi's win failed to trigger
a massive sell-off of the yen that some had predicted, despite
doubts about the strength of his economic program.
	   The dollar bought 140.54 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.14 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   One of the most immediate tests of Obuchi's leadership will be
whether he can finding coalition partners to allow the LDP to pass
legislation in the upper house of Parliament, where it lacks a
majority.
	   That may be difficult. Potential allies may be leery of joining
forces a ruling party with rock-bottom approval ratings.
	   But rather than heed calls for change, experts predicted that
Obuchi _ who has built a reputation as a consensus-builder _ will
merely accelerate Hashimoto's policies rather than embark on
genuinely new path.
	   ``The key difference is the Obuchi will have to compromise more
with the opposition to get bills passed through the upper house,''
said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg Japan
Ltd.
	   Obuchi will also have to placate a Japanese public that has lost
faith in the LDP and had preferred both of the foreign minister's
rivals to himself. Some in Tokyo were unhappy _ but not surprised _
with the LDP's choice.
	   ``Obuchi doesn't have a personality that suggests things will
change from Hashimoto,'' said Noriyoshi Kondo, a shopkeeper. ``I
don't expect the economy to get any better.''

U.N. rights chief criticizes Iran hanging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N.'s top human rights official on Friday
criticized the hanging of an Iranian man reportedly charged with
converting to the Baha'i faith from Islam.
	   Mary Robinson is ``gravely concerned about the reported
conditions that led to the execution'' on Tuesday of Ruhollah
Rowhani, ``particularly the seeming absence of due process,'' said
a statement from her office.
	   Robinson said she is also disturbed by reports that three more
Baha'is _ Ata'ullah Hamid Nasirizadih, Sirus Dhabih-Muqaddam and
Hidayat Kashifi _ have been secretly sentenced to death and face
imminent execution.
	   She appealed to Iran not to carry out any such sentences against
the Baha'is ``as their only offense appears to have been to belong
to a particular religious faith.''
	   The statement noted information that a number of other Baha'is
are imprisoned or awaiting trial ``under similar circumstances.''
	   On Thursday, the U.S. State Department condemned Rowhani's
hanging. The White House issued a statement expressing President
Clinton's condolences to his family.

Distraught parents of paralyzed gymnast to fly to her side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with more details about Sang's training,
parents' first trip outside of China, other details
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Wracked by guilt and fear, the distraught parents
of partly paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan prepared Friday to fly
to the United States to be at her side.
	   With 17-year-old Sang in a Long Island hospital bed, unable to
move her legs, her parents half a world away in Beijing fretted and
wept as they looked with trepidation to the future.
	   ``The biggest worry is that they won't be able to cure her,''
her father, Sang Shisheng, said in an interview a day before he and
Sang's mother were to fly to New York.
	   Sang, the 1997 national vault champion, was injured in a botched
landing during a Tuesday warm-up for the Goodwill Games. Striking
the mat with her head, she fractured and dislocated two neck
vertebrae, leaving her with no movement in her legs. Doctors said
Wednesday it was unlikely she would walk again.
	   Her father said they found out that their only child had been
hurt when they turned on the television to see her compete. They
heard the announcer say instead that she had been carried away on a
stretcher.
	   That ``meant it had to be serious,'' Mr. Sang said. ``We were
shocked.''
	   While injuries are part and parcel of being an athlete, ``I
never expected anything this terrible, not once,'' he said.
	   Now, the father said, comes the remorse of not having seen more
of Sang as she grew up. Like most Chinese gymnasts, she began
training very young _ at age 6.
	   After two years in a sports school in their hometown of Ningbo,
Sang was good enough to be accepted by a school away from home
where her parents got to see her just once a month, the father
said.
	   Then six years ago, she was picked for national team training
1,200 kilometers (740 miles) away from home in Beijing. Since then,
parents and daughter have seen each other just three times, most
recently last October, he said.
	   ``How can we ever make it up to her?'' the father said. ``She
was separated from her mother and father at such a young age, with
no parental love.''
	   ``Thinking back, I do have some regrets,'' he said.
	   Sang last spoke to her parents by phone a few days before she
left for the United States. They have not been in touch since her
accident, the father said.
	   For Sang's mother, Chen Xiufeng, thinking about her daughter's
future was just too painful.
	   ``I just dare not imagine it,'' she said, tears rolling down her
cheeks.
	   The father added that Sang's mother has said she ``doesn't want
to go on living'' if their daughter's injuries prove permanent.
	   Asked about the experimental nerve drug Sang was being treated
with, the father said he had ``total trust'' in U.S. doctors and
was sure they would give his daughter ``the best medicine.''
	   Sang's parents speak with the heavy accent of their native
Ningbo, a city near Shanghai on China's east coast. Mr. Sang is a
housing management officer, Mrs. Sang works in a steel factory.
Together, they earn about 1,200 yuan (dlrs 150) a month.
	   Officials prepared passports for them quickly and the Goodwill
Games organizing committee will pay their travel expenses, the
father said.
	   Chinese sports officials gave them a new suitcase for the trip,
their first outside of China. On top of their neatly folded
clothes, the parents had lovingly placed a portrait of Sang, her
head tilted and silky long black hair flowing over her shoulders.
	   ``I'm very proud to have such a daughter,'' the father said.

After Iranian missile tests, Israel asks for U.S. intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Gore, grafs 2-3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the wake of an Iranian missile test launch,
Israel has asked the United States to try harder to prevent the
transfer of missile technology to Iran, an official said Friday.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is visiting Moscow, raised the
Iranian missile threat in talks with Russian leaders.
	   ``It's a continuing source of discussion and we got into it in
depth,'' Gore told NBC-TV News, ``I did raise this launch as an
example of why this is such a terrible problem that has to be
solved.''
	   Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and know-how to
the Iranian missile program. Russia denies it.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called Leon Feurth, a top aide to
Gore, and had asked that Gore bring up the issue, said an official
close to Sharansky, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Sharansky told the Gore aide that Wednesday's Iranian test
launch demonstrated how serious the threat to Israel was.
	   The Shahab-3 missile tested by Iran has a potential range of 800
miles (1,300 kilometers), enough to strike any target in Israel.
	   Sharansky told Feurth that if the transfer of Russian technology
was halted now, the Iranians would be unable to complete the
development of the missile system.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the defense minister said the test launch
gave new impetus to his demand for an additional dlrs 600 million
in defense spending. ``We'll need more resources, a bigger budget,
more deterrence capability and more motivation,'' Mordechai said.
	   The test launch came amid recent warnings from Israeli defense
experts that Israel's army was not ready to counter future threats,
such as ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the
hands of Iran and Iraq, Israel's most implacable foes.

Government mediators getting involved in NBA lockout

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA labor dispute is starting to look a
little more like the last baseball strike.
	   The National Labor Relations Board entered the mix Thursday
after the players union filed an unfair labor practice complaint,
alleging the league imposed a lockout without bargaining to an
impasse as required under national labor law.
	   When the baseball strike was nearly destroying the sport four
years ago, it was a union NLRB filing that ended up being the
deciding factor. The baseball players argued that owners weren't
bargaining in good faith, and the NLRB agreed. The agency asked a
federal court to grant an injunction restoring the old work rules,
and Judge Sonia Sotomayer issued the order.
	   In this case, the union even claims that the word ``lockout''
does not accurately describe what has happened. The players termed
it a unilateral change in conditions of employment and cited seven
factors: Refusing to negotiate contracts, violating anti-collusion
rules, ceasing health benefits, refusing treatment for injuries
sustained since July 1, failing to set a salary cap, disregarding
grievance guidelines and refusing to allow sanctioned summer
leagues.
	   ``The board will determine, on as prompt a basis as possible,
whether the rights of the basketball players, as employees, have
been violated,'' said Daniel Silverman, regional director of the
NLRB's New York office. ``We fully recognize the needs of the
parties and the public for a decision without delay, and we will do
our best to meet that objective.''
	   Silverman said his office will conduct an investigation over the
next few weeks, then make a determination what to do next.
	   If the board agrees with the union, it can ask a federal judge
to issue an injunction restoring terms of the old collective
bargaining agreement that expired June 30.
	   ``Arbitration, charges of unfair labor practices and threats of
decertification will not end this lockout. That will occur only if
there is good faith negotiations leading to a new collective
bargaining agreement,'' NBA chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin
said.
	   ``The NBA owners have made multiple proposals to the players,
while the players have refused to budge from their first offer. The
only refusal to bargain here is by the players association.''
	   Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter late
Thursday night set Aug. 6 for a new round of formal talks. The last
session was held June 22 and broke off after 30 minutes.
	   ``NBA players want to play ball,'' Hunter said in announcing the

FINA suspends four Chinese swimmers for two years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; ADDS initial appeal turned down &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Four Chinese swimmers, suspended
from all meets for two years on Friday for using banned substances
in the World Swimming Championships in January, had an initial
appeal of their case turned down.
	   The doping panel of FINA _ the world governing body of swimming
_ said the suspensions from all competitions went into force
immediately. A temporary suspension period, which was in force from
Jan. 14 until April 25, will be deducted from the two-year total,
FINA said.
	   At the worlds in Perth, Australia, the three Chinese women _
Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _ and male teammate Wang Wei
tested positive for triamterene, a banned diuretic which can be
used to mask the use of anabolic steroids.
	   Charles Duan, a lawyer for the four, immediatley appealed the
case to the Lausanne Tribunal of Sport. The appeal was rejected
pending a written statement from FINA and is likely to be heard in
several weeks.
	   ``I think all the swimmers should be cleared,'' Duan said. ``I
think this case involved a lot of factors, in particular the bias
against the Chinese swimmers.''
	   ``That makes people not think about the facts,'' he added,
nothing about the evidence. The only aim was to try to convict
Chinese swimmers.''
	   The decision came on a day when the doping panel was also
expected to rule on the case of Irish triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith.
	   Smith faced a possible life ban on charges of tampering with a
urine sample. She was charged with manipulating an
out-of-competition drug test on Jan. 10 by adulterating her sample
with alcohol.

Fearing UK-German merger, France speeds up defense privatization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's surprise plan to privatize and merge
Aerospatiale with Matra was propelled by fears of being left out of
British and German efforts to form a huge European defense firm to
compete with the U.S. giants.
	   British Aerospace and Germany's Dasa _ private companies that
have balked at combining with Aerospatiale as long as it was
state-controlled _ are talking about a merger.
	   Defense and financial analysts said the French government was
racing against time when it announced Wednesday it would sell its
controlling interest in Aerospatiale and create the world's
fourth-largest aerospace company with Matra.
	   The new firm, with 56,000 employees and annual revenues over
dlrs 13 billion from aircraft, rockets and satellites, is to be
created by the end of this year.
	   The move improves the chances of creating a European defense
giant many analysts previously thought was much further off.
	   ``It was a real surprise,'' said Tim Bennett, aerospace defense
analyst for Morgan Stanley in London. The merger was prompted by
France's ``fear of being left out by Anglo-German or Anglo-American
consolidations.''
	   Richard Bassett of Jane's Defense Weekly noted the Euro-merger
trend powered by the coming euro currency, including plans
announced this month to create an Anglo-German stock market.
	   ``The French were being told: `You've missed the boat on the new
European stock market. Do you want to do the same in the defense
industry?' '' Bassett said.
	   France's leftist government that came to power a year ago
initially appeared to dash hopes of privatization. Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin pragmatically has gone ahead with the sell-off of
state companies, but Aerospatiale was unexpected.
	   With the French long calling for a European defense industry,
Jospin couldn't ignore the talks between British Aerospace and
Dasa.
	   The Financial Times said Friday the relationship between BAe and
Dasa ``was becoming increasingly close.''
	   DASA spokesman Christian Poppe said talks with BAe were ``part
of the conversations we are having also with other partners for the
purpose of creating a European merger.''
	   Some industry observers are skeptical France can quickly
streamline its bloated defense industry, and the fighter jet
building Dassault has dragged its feet on a merger.
	   With Aerospatiale absorbing Matra and maintaining 46-48 percent
state interest, ``it's added intervention by the French
government,'' said Digby Waller of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London. ``It's a recipe for extra cost and
lower innovation.''
	   But Bassett said the strategy of the next century ``is not to be
dependent on American defense industry. The main European tank will
be a European tank, not an Abrams. The fighter will be the
Eurofighter, not the F-16.''

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ For advice on young people and even
younger technology, the Jamaica government is turning to a
13-year-old consultant.
	   Makonnen Blake Hannah was named this week as Youth and
Technology Consultant to the government by Phillip Paulwell,
minister of Commerce and Technology.
	   ``He is an extraordinarily gifted child, selected from a number
of extraordinary young people aged between 8 and 16 who are
attending an intensive one-month Tech 2000 course recently
established in Kingston to give opportunites for children to
exercise their minds in technology,'' said Peter King, adviser to
the minister. ``He will be paid an honorarium.''
	   Makonnen will accompany the minister to technology events
dealing with youth and will also offer advice on computer hardware
and software.
	   The son of filmmaker and 1974 United Nations peace medalist
Barbara Blake Hannah, Makonnen has been schooled at home. He agreed
that he could be described as an expert.
	   ``I can program a little bit, I'm good at system design, kind
of, advanced windows and dos usage, stuff like that _ you could
call me an expert,'' Makonnen said.
	   He sees no problem with the job fitting into his daily studies,
as he says he has always keeps up on what is happening in the world
of technology.

American F-16 fighter overshoots runway in northern Japan

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with report of Misawa mayor's protest; US Air Force
suspending F-16 flights

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 jet fighter overshot the runway at an
airport in northern Japan on Friday and burst into flames, injuring
an American pilot and prompting a protest by the local mayor.
	   The U.S. Air Force said it would temporarily suspend flight
exercises at the facility following the crash.
	   The pilot, 1st Lt. Melvin B. Simpson from the 35th Fighter Wing
at Misawa, suffered burns in the accident, which occurred Friday
morning, the U.S. Air Force said in a release.
	   Simpson was transferred to a hospital in Hachinohe, a city near
Misawa, after being taken to a base hospital for emergency
treatment, the release said. The extent of the pilot's burns and
his hometown were not immediately available.
	   Airport fire fighters quickly extinguished the flames, said Koji
Mori, spokesman of the local Japanese Air Self-Defense Force base.
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation, the U.S. Air
Force release said.
	   Misawa Mayor Shigeyoshi Suzuki visited the base Friday to lodge
a protest, Kyodo new service reported.
	   ``The latest accident would cause unmeasurable fears among local
citizens and I find it extremely regrettable,'' Suzuki was quoted
as saying by Kyodo.
	   Later Friday, Col. John Clines, deputy commander of the base,
told a news conference that all F-16 flight exercises will be
suspended until their inspection is finished, Kyodo reported.
	   Clines asked for understanding and patience from the local
residents. Clines said the U.S. military would do its best to
ensure aviation safety, Kyodo said.
	   He promised the mayor that the Air Force would put together an
investigation team and release a report in about a month, Kyodo
said.
	   The Misawa airport, which is jointly used by the U.S. Air Force,
Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and Japan Air Systems, a Japanese
commercial airline, was closed after the mishap, Mori said.
	   The airport, located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, has a single runway.
	   Misawa residents have in the past complained about the noise and
vibrations from F-16 and expressed fears of danger.
	   In a separate incident, at least one Marine was injured in a
failed helicopter landing at a U.S. Marine Corps base Thursday on
Japan's southern island of Okinawa, Japanese defense officials said
Friday.
	   The UH1N helicopter was destroyed after failing to land on a
helipad at Camp Hansen at around noon Thursday, the Naha Defense
Facilities Agency said.
	   It was not until five hours after the accident that the U.S.
Marine Corps notified the Japanese defense officials, an agency
spokesman said, adding Japanese officials were given no further
details from the U.S. side.

Parliament bars creation of a state-owned gas and oil giant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament undermined government
efforts Friday to establish a single state-owned oil and gas
company uniting all the country's major oil and gas companies.
	   Lawmakers gave preliminary approval to legislation that would
bar the government from transferring its stakes in gas and oil
companies to the newly created company, Naftogaz Ukrainy.
	   The legislation also bans government agencies from turning
enterprises in the gas and oil sector into shareholding companies.
	   President Leonid Kuchma created Naftogaz Ukrainy earlier this
year. The company was to be formed by uniting state-owned
companies, and transferring to it the stakes the government holds
in other partially privatized gas and oil enterprises.
	   Naftogaz Ukrainy was to take charge of the national gas and oil
pipeline network, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
	   The creation of Naftogaz Ukrainy was seen as an attempt to find
a way to privatize Ukraine's gas and oil companies, most of which
parliament banned from privatization in 1995. The government was
said to be planning a future privatization of Naftogaz itself.
	   A number of Western firms have expressed interest in Ukraine's
gas and oil sector, including Royal Dutch-Shell, which last year
offered dlrs 1.5 billion for a 49-percent stake in the pipeline
carrying gas from Russia to Europe.
	   However, the company's negotiations with the government went
nowhere when parliament refused to remove pipelines from its list
of enterprises banned from privatization.
	   Kuchma can veto parliament's decision within 15 days after the
law receives final approval. Lawmakers can overturn his veto by
repeatedly approving the law by a two-thirds majority.

Rios routs Becker to close in on No. 1 Sampras

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios closed in on Pete
Sampras' No. 1 ranking Friday by routing Boris Becker in straight
sets to reach the semifinals of the Mercedes Cup.
	   Rios, the top seed, dominated the German with pinpoint passing
shots at the dlrs 1.04 million event in a match even more one-sided
than the final score of 6-2, 6-0 indicated.
	   On two occasions, the Chilean rattled off 10 straight unanswered
points.
	   ``I said to him, this is my country, let me have at least one
point,'' said Becker. ``But he answered, you're going to have to
earn it.''
	   The Chilean would regain the top ranking on the ATP computer
from Sampras, who has taken the week off, if he beats world No. 11
Karol Kucera of Slovakia Saturday at the dlrs 1.04 million event.
	   Rios broke Sampras' 102-week hold on the No. 1 ranking March 30,
held the top spot for four weeks, then relinquished it to the
American again when an elbow injury sidelined him.
	   Rios' win was so lopsided that Becker began to grin and the
spectators broke into applause when the German blasted a serve Rios
couldn't handle, ending one of his scoreless streaks.
	   Becker had been beaten this badly only twice in his career. He
was on the losing end of 6-1, 6-1 matches to American Jay Berger in
1989 and fellow German Michael Stich three years later.
	   Just two weeks ago, Becker had beaten Rios in straight sets to
reach the final of the Swiss Open. The difference this time, he
said, were that rain storms had soaked the courts.
	   ``He's probably the best player on the tour right now. He's
probably going to dominate for the next five years,'' said Becker.
``But he had all the time in the world to pass me. The courts were
slow and a slow match isn't my game.''
	   But Rios, who has won five tournaments this year, showed why
he's regarded as one of the game's best returners against Becker,
ending the rout in just 45 minutes by slamming an ace.
	   When he broke the German's serve to take a 4-2 first set lead,
Rios drilled a passing shot down the left line, a second one
cross-court and finished by lifting a lob over the onrushing
Becker's head.
	   ``I think I'm playing better that at the Swiss Open,'' said
Becker. ``But this time he was a different opponent. He had
something to pay back after I beat him there. Plus it was No. 1
against a former No. 1.''
	   Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, also reached the semis by
beating fellow Spaniard Fernando Vicente, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, while
Kucera downed Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Moya struggled with both his serve and forehand in the first
set, then steadied his play to win a baseline match against his
19-year-old friend and practice partner.
	   ``Maybe I was too confident at first,'' said Moya. ``It's always
hard playing against your best friend on the tour. We know each
other's games too well.''
	   Becker, 30, has reduced his schedule to 10 to 12 tournaments a
year as he winds down his career. But the German said he's
satisfied with his performance when he does step on court.
	   He added that it was probably a good thing he beat Rios, who has
appeared in magazine polls as the tour's least-liked player, at the
Swiss Open two weeks ago.
	   ``Personally, I get along with him fine,'' said Becker, whose
last Wimbledon title came in 1989. ``But it's good for him to know
that some of us, occasionally played some good tennis in the
'80s.''

Riders, disgusted by doping scandal, make late start; Steels wins

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage, further details
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France (AP) _ The Tour de France had a late
start Friday with riders balking at the start of the 12th stage,
saying the investigation into the use of performance enhancing
drugs was wrecking the sport.
	   The 148-member pack finally moved into action 16 kms (10 miles)
from the official starting point -- and two hours after the
official starting time.
	   Belgium's Tom Steels won the stage from Tarascon-sur-Ariege to
Cap d'gde in southern France, 222 kilometers (137 miles), his
second of the Tour. The pack caught Jacky Durand of France 300
meters from the finish with Steels capturing the sprint.
	   Laurent Jalabert was part of a long breakaway during the day
with his brother Nicolas and Bart Voskamp of the Netherlands. the
lead was up to five minutes at one point before the pack caught
them.
	   Laurent Jalabert, the world's No. 1-ranked cyclist, was
instrumental in the early protest and acted as a spokesman for the
riders.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' Laurent Jalabert told Radio Tour, the
station that follows the race.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone. We won't cycle
and that's the end of it.''
	   He said the riders were all ``revolted'' that cycling had taken
a backseat to the doping investigation and stopped at the actual
starting point, a few kilometers (miles) outside the city.
	   However, Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc helped negotiate a
start to the stage.
	   Leblanc called an urgent meeting with the sporting directors of
competing teams to resolve the crisis, which grew out of the
mounting doping scandal that has haunted the Tour since its July 11
in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Leblanc also made a statement during the team ``if the precise
elements reveal that this team didn't respect the rules and ethics
of the Tour de France the the International Cycling Union.''
	   Three members of the Festina team, expelled from the Tour last
week, admitted to police that they took drugs to improve their
performances, according to LCI news television.
	   ``Yes, I said I took EPO, how I took it, why I took it and all
that,'' said Swiss rider for Festina, Armin Meier, in an interview
with France Info radio.
	   Most Festina riders were still being held for questioning, as
three of the team officials met Friday before a judge in Lyon.
	   And in a new chapter to the unfolding drama, officials from the
Dutch TVM team were called on the carpet on Thursday for alleged
doping within the team.
	   Poliht earlier this week when it emerged that the substance EPO
had been found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Taking a back seat to all the drug-related incidents on Friday
was the actual race, once it got started. But there was little
change.
	   Jan Ullrich held a 71-second lead over American Bobby Julich
heading after Friday's stage. The Tour is slowly making its way
across southern France before hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   The German held onto the yellow jersey. He began the race July
11 as the defending champion but lost it for a week before gaining
it back after Saturday's time trial and the first mountain stage on
Tuesday.
	   Saturday's 13th stage is from Frontigan-la-Peyrade to
Carpentras, 196 kilometers (122 miles).

Asia hopes new Japanese leader will spur economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asian leaders welcomed Japanese Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi's triumph in the race for ruling party president
Friday, hoping his international expertise would translate into
more Japanese help for the region's troubled economies.
	   ``We hope this contact he had with us will provide the kind of
leadership we would expect from Japan,'' said Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi. ``We hope that they will play a more
active role and they would be able to help us.''
	   Although Japan is burdened with its own economic woes, Badawi _
attending a Southeast Asian foreign ministers' meeting in Manila _
said Japan's role remains crucial in helping Asian economies
recover from their financial crisis.
	   Obuchi won the presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party on Friday, automatically making him the party's nominee for
prime minister. He is nearly certain to be voted premier in
Parliament because the LDP commands a majority in the powerful
lower house.
	   Tokyo is under increasing pressure from allies, prominently the
United States, to sort out its economic problems as a first step
toward creating a market for troubled Asian neighbors to sell their
goods and containing the region's financial crisis.
	   ``It has been a common expectation that Japan would put its
economic house in more effective order so that it could revive its
own economy and could be able to pull along other economies,'' said
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
	   ``I do believe the new administration in Japan understands that
expectation and will respond to that expectation favorably,'' he
said.
	   Australia also called for reform. Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer, in Hong Kong, told government-owned radio that Japan does
not have ``a lot of time to get its economy moving again.''
	   China congratulated Obuchi and appealed to him to strengthen
often shaky relations between the two nations. Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang noted that as foreign minister,
Obuchi ``has with care and great effort strived to develop
China-Japan relations.''
	   Now as head of the Liberal Democratic Party and all but certain
to be named prime minister, ``we hope that Mr. Obuchi will continue
making contributions to the healthy and stable development of
Chinese-Japanese relations,'' Tang said in a statement.
	   The change in Japanese leaders came at an awkward time for
China. Chinese President Jiang Zemin was expecting to go to Japan
this fall for summitry with Obuchi's predecessor. Japan's weakening
economy has threatened one of China's biggest markets and
investors.
	   Beijing is anxious for Japan to halt a dip in imports and shore
up the sagging yen, a senior trade official said.
	   Obuchi was more palatable to China than his closest rival.
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama outraged Chinese
leaders last year by insisting that a U.S.-Japan treaty would
involve those countries in a conflict over Taiwan, which Beijing
claims as a renegade province.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry praised Japan's likely choice for
prime minister. Obuchi has played a prominent role in improving
Japan's relationship with Russia.
	   The two countries have never signed a treaty ending World War II
because of a disagreement over four islands in the Kuril chain that
were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war but are still
claimed by Japan.

Serb twins to sue for erroneous arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with physician's comments; CORRECTS names of those
mistakenly arrested and real suspects. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two Bosnian Serb brothers
mistakenly arrested by NATO as war crimes suspects were battered
during their detention and intend to sue for damages, Bosnian Serb
police claimed Friday.
	   Miroslav and Milan Vucicevic, 26, were snatched Wednesday by
NATO peacekeepers, only to be released a day later. They were
mistaken for Predrag and Nenad Banovic, also twins, wanted by the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, for atrocities
allegedly committed during the Bosnian war in 1992.
	   ``In addition to physical abuse, the Vucicevic brothers have
endured serious psychological trauma,'' said a police statement in
Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
``Miroslav and Milan Vucicevic have said they will bring charges.''
	   The brothers were not at their home in Prijedor on Friday. A
relative said they were inaccessible, recovering in a local
hospital.
	   A doctor at the hospital said both had suffered ``psychological
stress and minor physical injuries ... indicating they had
sustained blows or been kicked.'' He refused to give his name.
	   ``The brutal arrest was carried out with considerable force,
which is obvious by numerous bruises ... on the faces and bodies of
both Vucicevic brothers,'' the Serb police statement read.
	   NATO officials have expressed regret for the wrong arrest.
	   The whereabouts of the real suspects remains unknown. Their
father has claimed they live in England, but has refused to provide
details.

FINA doping panel meets on Smith tampering charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be updated with hearing concludes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic triple-gold medalist
Michelle Smith met a FINA doping panel Friday on charges she
tampered with a urine sample in a test early this year.
	   Smith, who could face a life ban if found guilty of the charges,
entered the hearing with her lawyer Peter Lennon at 1200 GMT at the
luxurious Palace hotel in downtown Lausanne.
	   FINA had incidated it hoped to conclude the hearing on Friday
but gave no indication that it would _ or when it would release the
panel's ruling.
	   Smith, who won her three gold medals in the 1996 Olympics, was
to answer charges that she manipulated an out-of-competition drug
test by adulterating her sample with alcohol.
	   She has consistently denied taking drugs to enhance her
performances.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's A sample, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Analysis of her second sample, conducted at the same lab in the
presence of Lennon and a biochemist from Dublin hospital, showed
identical signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen, FINA
said.
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol, suggesting an attempt to mask the detection of drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life ban.
	   Smith, who says she has been tested probably more often than any
other international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test
in Kilkenny County, Ireland, on January 10.
	   Earlier Friday, the same three-man FINA panel found four Chinese
swimmers guilty of using banned substances in the World
Championships in Perth, Australia and suspended them for two years
from all competition.
	   FINA said the suspensions went into force immediately. A
temporary suspension period, which was in force from Jan. 14 until
April 25, will be deducted from the two-year total.
	   The three Chinese women _ Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _
and male teammate Wang Wei tested positive for triamterene, a
banned diuretic which can be used to mask the use of anabolic
steroids.
	   Charles Duan, a lawyer for the four, immediatley appealed the
case to the Lausanne Tribunal of Sport. The appeal was rejected
pending a written statement from FINA and is likely to be heard in
several weeks.

Mountains sent a letter to the government asking it to consider the
dire financial situation of Russia's nuclear enterprises, a news
agency reported Friday.
	   In the letter to Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov,
scientists from the Experimental Physics Institute and the
Technological Physics Institute in the city of Snezhinsk said they
have not been paid for months and that negotiations with the
institutes' management have achieved nothing.
	   The two institutes were among leading nuclear weapons designers
in the Soviet Union.
	   Millions of government workers across Russia go without
paychecks for as long as a year at a time, because the government's
failure to collect taxes leaves it unable to cover even the most
basic expenses. Research institutes are among those that have
suffered the most.
	   The physicists also said they were forced to begin preparations
for a strike, even though they consider strikes an extreme form of
protest that hurts the country, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   About 3,500 employees of a top secret nuclear research center
held a three-hour strike Thursday to demand the payment of back
wages, Interfax reported.
	   More than 3,000 people took part in a rally in the town of
Sarov, where the Research Institute of Experimental Physics,
formerly known as Arzamas-16, is located.
	   The institute, about 400 kilometers (300 miles) northeast of
Moscow, is one of Russia's premier nuclear research sites, similar
to Los Alamos in the United States.

Three miners die in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Three Ukrainian miners died and one was
injured in two separate incidents in the eastern coal region of
Donetsk, officials said Friday.
	   Two miners were killed and another was injured in an accident
during construction of a shaft at the Abakumova mine Friday
morning, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Another worker died in rock collapse at the Zasyalko mine, it
said.
	   The deaths brought to at least 223 the number of Ukrainian mine
workers killed on the job this year, according to figures from the
State Committee for Work Safety.
	   The committee blames the high number of deaths on neglect of
safety rules and outdated equipment.

Hindu organization asks government to show it cares for god
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Unhappy with the principle that religion
and state should steer clear of each other, the World Hindu Council
has asked the prime minister to show his government cares for god.
	   Secularism does not mean we should be against religion, said
Bhupendra Kumar Modi, the Council's newly appointed president
incharge of Hindu activities abroad. Even a secular country such as
the United States prints ``In God We Trust'' on its dollar bills to
show its belief in god, said Modi, flashing a 100-dollar bill.
	   Modi did not suggest ways the government could show its faith,
but said he was waiting for the prime minister to come up with
ideas of his own.
	   The World Hindu Council, known in India as the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad, is known primarily for its role in the demolition of an
ancient mosque in northern India in 1992 that triggered nationwide
Hindu-Muslim riots in which some 2,000 people were killed.
	   Although India is constitutionally a secular country, it is
ruled by a coalition led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party. Modi said his request had nothing to do with the fact that a
like minded party was in power.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has not yet responded to the
Council's suggestion.

Government: foreign minister justified in calling Clinton a liar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Friday said its foreign minister,
Theodoros Pangalos, was justified in calling U.S. President Bill
Clinton a liar because his administration has backed away from
promises to solve the Cyprus dispute.
	   ``Mr. Pangalos said a truth. He gave evidence which has
historical depth. He didn't make up or imagine things in order to
make a statement,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   His comment was made one day after Pangalos described
preelection promises made by Clinton to help solve the 24-year
division of Cyprus as ``gross lies.''
	   Clinton had said before both of his elections that Cyprus would
be among his top foreign policy priorities. Two years ago Richard
Holbrooke, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, had declared 1996 ``the year of Cyprus.''
	   But U.S.-led efforts to solve the Cyprus problem collapsed last
May when Turkish Cypriots insisted to Holbrooke, then a special
Cyprus envoy, that their breakaway state be recognized as a
condition for resuming U.N.-sponsored peace talks. They also
demanded cancellation of the European Union's membership talks with
Cyprus.
	   Perceptions have been growing here that the United States has
been siding with Turkey over the Cyprus dispute.
	   Reppas defended a number of anti-American statements made by
senior officials following White House spokesman Mike McCurry's
Wednesday description of the 1974 events on Cyprus as a
``conflict'' rather than an invasion by Turkish forces.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the north.
	   ``We believe that as a reply the statements of the Greek
officials were necessary,'' Reppas said.
	   But despite the apparent deterioration in Greek-American
relations, Athens still welcomes Washington's mediation in efforts
to solve the island's problem.
	   ``The Greek government wishes for there to be progress on the
Cyprus issue. It wishes for the U.S. government to intensify its
efforts,'' Reppas said.

IMF mission to visit Russia in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble falling slightly, stocks closing down, last
graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission will return
to Moscow in early September to evaluate Russia's economic
performance and decide whether to release the second installment of
a bailout loan, a top IMF official said Friday.
	   The IMF approved its portion of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout
earlier this week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800
million after parliament failed to approve the austerity measures
it had demanded. The Russian government responded by circumventing
parliament and imposing the measures by decree.
	   By September, the IMF wants to see a draft 1999 budget submitted
to parliament, a reduction in the pension fund deficit, and
progress toward meeting 1998 budget targets, said the fund's Moscow
representative, Martin Gilman.
	   ``Only if all these steps are taken and IMF experts see
practical results of the efforts of tax agencies, the Finance
Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Trade and Industry Ministry,
the State Customs Committee and the Central Bank, will the mission
have reason to say that the financial situation in Russia has
started improving,'' Gilman said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia's economy has been slipping for months, after showing the
first signs of modest growth at the end of last year.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets, in part because of
world trends like falling oil prices, but also because of the
country's chronic failure to cut the federal budget and collect
taxes.
	   If the IMF likes what it sees in September, it will release the
remaining dlrs 800 million of the first installment plus a second
installment of dlrs 3.5 billion, Gilman said.
	   The government's cash shortage has resulted in a chronic failure
to pay workers' wages and pensions on time, and protest strikes
have swept across Russia in recent months.
	   On Friday, workers of the Amur Ship-Building Plant in the Far
East walked off the job to demand a year's backlog of unpaid wages,
exceeding 70 million rubles (dlrs 11 million), the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Coal miners from the town of Osinniki in Central Siberia's
Kemerovo region resumed a blockade of a local railway to demand
wages that are months overdue, Interfax reported, citing local
union leaders.
	   Gilman said that if the government improves its economic
performance in 1999, that, together with IMF support for the
Central Bank's gold and currency reserves, should encourage
investors to return to Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced plans Friday to issue bonds
redeemable by future gold production, Interfax said. The move is
intended to raise money to finance gold production. No other
details were released.
	   And, the Central Bank reduced a benchmark interest rate from 80
percent to 60 percent, ITAR-Tass reported. The rate, which was 24
percent in early February, was as high as 150 percent in the end of
May, as the bank sought to combat the market crisis.
	   The Russian stock market fell 1.32 percent in slow trading
Friday to close at 157.74 points. The ruble fell slightly against
the U.S. dollar.

Pakistani foreign minister expects little of summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Nuclear rivals Pakistan and India
won't make any progress in talks next week because they'll have no
outsider to prod them toward compromise, Pakistan's foreign
minister said Friday.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee meet next week in Sri Lanka in their first
head-to-head talks since each ordered nuclear weapons tests in May.
The tests raised tensions between two countries that have fought
three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, and the
prime ministerial talks are seen as a chance to calm the region.
	   But Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Auyb Khan, speaking to
reporters in Islamabad, said round after round of Indo-Pakistani
talks in the past has produced ``nil.''
	   ``We are urging the world community for mediation,'' he said.
``The two countries are nuclearized. Both have displayed their
nuclear capabilities and advanced missile systems. God forbid if
war erupts between the two countries.''
	   Last year at the same regional summit that will form the
backdrop for the Sharif-Vajpayee talks, then Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral of India and Pakistan's Sharif met and launched
negotiations at the bureaucratic level on their disputes. Those
negotiations bogged down over Kashmir, the core of their rivalry
and the cause of two of their three wars.
	   The Himalayan territory is divided between India and Pakistan,
and both claim it in its entirety.
	   Pakistan believes it is at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks
with its much larger and more powerful neighbor. India adamantly
rejects any outside pressure to resolve the Kashmiri dispute.
	   Pakistan wants residents of both Indian- and Pakistani-held
Kashmir to be allowed to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan,
but such a plebiscite, as outlined in decades-old U.N. resolutions,
is opposed by India.

Crime rates in Moscow rise for first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The crime rate in Moscow rose in the first six
months of 1998 over the same period last year, a news agency said
Friday.
	   Moscow has registered 37,800 crimes since January, up 500 from
January to June of 1997, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Drug-related crimes grew fivefold, leading Moscow prosecutor
Sergei Gerasimov to say the city's crime-fighting efforts were
``not adequate,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Though serious crimes fell by 10 percent, crimes among young
people grew. Crimes involving abductions, drug trafficking, and
weapons and ammunition theft were also up.
	   At a meeting with Gerasimov, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said he
is afraid the increased drug trade will spread among Moscow's
children and possibly out of the Russian capital.
	   ``If no measures are taken to fight this evil now, in the near
future it might acquire dimensions of national mischief,'' Luzhkov
said, according to ITAR-Tass.

Rios routs Becker to close in on No. 1 Sampras
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Kuerten-Costa match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios closed to within one win
of taking away Pete Sampras' No. 1 ranking Friday by routing Boris
Becker in straight sets to reach the semifinals of the Mercedes
Cup.
	   Rios, the top seed, dominated the German with pinpoint passing
shots at the dlrs 1.04 million event in a match even more one-sided
than the final score of 6-2, 6-0 indicated.
	   On two occasions, the Chilean rattled off 10 straight unanswered
points.
	   ``I said to him, this is my country, let me have at least one
point,'' said Becker. ``But he answered, you're going to have to
earn it.''
	   The Chilean would regain the top ranking on the ATP computer
from Sampras, who has taken the week off, if he beats world No. 11
Karol Kucera of Slovakia Saturday at the dlrs 1.04 million event.
	   Rios broke Sampras' 102-week hold on the No. 1 ranking March 30,
held the top spot for four weeks, then relinquished it to the
American again when an elbow injury sidelined him.
	   Rios' win was so lopsided that Becker began to grin and the
spectators broke into applause when the German blasted a serve Rios
couldn't handle, ending one of his scoreless streaks.
	   Becker had been beaten this badly only twice in his career. He
was on the losing end of 6-1, 6-1 matches to American Jay Berger in
1989 and fellow German Michael Stich three years later.
	   Just two weeks ago, Becker had defeated Rios in straight sets to
reach the final of the Swiss Open. The difference this time, he
said, were that rain storms had soaked the courts.
	   ``He's probably the best player on the tour right now. He's
probably going to dominate for the next five years,'' said Becker.
``But he had all the time in the world to pass me. The courts were
slow and a slow match isn't my game.''
	   But Rios, who has won five tournaments this year, showed why
he's regarded as one of the game's best returners against Becker,
ending the rout in just 45 minutes by slamming an ace.
	   When he broke the German's serve to take a 4-2 first set lead,
Rios drilled a passing shot down the left line, a second one
cross-court and finished by lifting a lob over the onrushing
Becker's head.
	   ``I think I'm playing better that at the Swiss Open,'' said
Becker. ``But this time he was a different opponent. He had
something to pay back after I beat him there. Plus it was No. 1
against a former No. 1.''
	   Kucera downed Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach, 6-4, 6-4, while
Carlos Moya and Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten both won to set up a clash
of the last two French Open champions in Saturday's second
semifinal.
	   Moya, who won the grand slam this year, bounced fellow Spaniard
Fernando Vicente, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, while 1997 winner Kuerten ousted a
third Spaniard, Albert Costa, 7-5, 6-0.
	   Moya struggled with both his serve and forehand in the first
set, then steadied his play to win a baseline match against his
19-year-old friend and practice partner.
	   ``Maybe I was too confident at first,'' said Moya. ``It's always
hard playing against your best friend on the tour. We know each
other's games too well.''
	   Becker, 30, has reduced his schedule to 10 to 12 tournaments a
year as he winds down his career. But the German said he's
satisfied with his performance when he does step on court.
	   He added that it was probably a good thing he beat Rios, who has
appeared in magazine polls as the tour's least-liked player, at the
Swiss Open two weeks ago.
	   ``Personally, I get along with him fine,'' said Becker, whose
last Wimbledon title came in 1989. ``But it's good for him to know
that some of us, occasionally played some good tennis in the
'80s.''

Spanish Supreme Court denies dirty war verdict reached
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Friday denied it has
convicted a former minister and 11 others for their role in a dirty
war against Basque Separatists allegedly run from within the
government of ex-premier Felipe Gonzalez.
	   A day earlier, local media sent shock waves through political
and judicial circles by reporting what they described as a leaked
verdict from the court finding former Interior Minister Jose Luis
Barrionuevo and 11 others guilty for their part in the 1983
kidnapping of French businessman Segundo Marey.
	   If confirmed, the verdict would shore up widespread allegations
that the Gonzalez's governments set up and ran the so-called GAL
death squads that killed 27 people in a campaign against the armed
the Basque separatist group ETA in the early 1980s.
	   In a statement, the Supreme Court Judge Jose Jimenez Villarejo
said the sentences have still not been set for the accused, even if
they are found guilty. The court ordered an investigation into the
supposed leak.
	   The GAL scandal led directly to the defeat of Gonzalez's
Socialist party in general elections two years ago, after nearly 14
years in office.
	   Most politicians followed Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's
refusal to comment on the verdict until it is officially released,
although some, backed by the daily El Mundo, called on Gonzalez to
take responsibility and retire from politics.
	   A guilty verdict would almost certainly affect the international
status enjoyed by Gonzalez _ one of Spain's most respected
politicians ever.
	   The former Spanish premier is currently the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe's appointed mediator to the
Kosovo conflict. He is also tipped to run as candidate for
president of the European Commission.
	   Gonzalez has not commented on the reported verdict. In court, as
a witness, he denied all involvement of his governments with the
GAL and said the trial was part of a plot to damage him and his
Socialist Party.
	   News reports Thursday said Barrionuevo, Gonzalez's Interior
Minister between 1982-88, and former Secretary of State for
Security Rafael Vera will receive sentences of 13 years. Both
pleaded innocent during the 22-day trial that finished July 14.
	   The remaining 10 accused _ who all admitted guilt _ would get
smaller jail terms, newspapers reported.
	   Marey's abduction was considered GAL's first operation. He was
released after 10 days once his kidnappers had realized he was not
the ETA hitman they were chasing.
	   Speaking Thursday, Marey said he was happy with the reported
verdict that newspapers said would be officially released next
week.
	   GAL, which stands for the Anti-terrorist Liberation Group,
killed 27 people in a drive against ETA in southern France between
1983 and 1987. Eight of its victims proved to have no ties to ETA,
which has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
Basque independence.

U.S. squad gets first true test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rudy Tomjanovich and his cast of basketball
understudies have one more dress rehearsal.
	   After beating up on two countries that have meager talent, the
United States will play less-modest Italy Saturday night in a final
exhibition game before the World Championships.
	   ``The Italian team will the best we've played so far,''
Tomjanovich, the Houston Rockets head coach moonlighting this
summer as head of Team USA, said Friday.
	   ``We feel that with each game we've played a tougher team and
that helps in our development. We've only been together about two
weeks.''
	   With the flap between the NBA and its players having kept the
Dream Team from making another appearance, Tomjanovich has gathered
a mix of players from college, the Continental Basketball
Association and European leagues.
	   ``Hey, with this team we're just one of the teams'' at the
worlds, he said. ``There will be a lot more drama in the games and
a lot more satisfaction if we reach our goal.''
	   After arriving in Europe to prepare for the tournament, which
opens Wednesday in Athens, Greece, Tomjanovich's team has beaten
France 93-63 and Spain 95-78. France didn't qualify for the
championships and Spain is considered a real outsider.
	   Italy, runner-up at the 1997 European Championships and 1994
Goodwill Games, can't match the Americans' skill, but does have
size on its side. Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka is not a power player
but at 2.15 meters (7-foot-1) can grab rebounds and make slick
moves to the basket.
	   Roberto Chiacig and Alessandro Frosini add bulk inside,
complementing Carlton Myers' outside shooting.
	   ``We have a group of very hard-working players, which is good
because we will probably be undersized in every game we play'' in
Greece, Tomjanovich said. ``To make up for that we'll have to play
tough defense and move a lot on offense.''
	   The biggest player on his roster is 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) Brad
Miller from Purdue University, though Tomjanovic indicated 6-foot-9
(2.03-meter) Bill Edwards will see minutes at center.
	   Edwards limped off the court Friday at the Palaeur Arena with a
twisted left ankle incurred during a full-court scrimmage. It's the
court where his pro team, Calze Pompea Roma in the Italian League,
plays home games.
	   A far cry from the United Center, Palace at Auburn Hills or any
other NBA arena, but a stage nonetheless.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A veteran post office worker in Ukraine
apparently had a hobby _ opening other people's letters and
stealing valuables from them.
	   Police in the central Ukrainian city of Kirovohrad have arrested
the woman on suspicion of stealing thousands of letters received
from abroad.
	   Officers found more than 3,000 opened envelopes and dozens of
foreign currency notes after searching the unidentified woman's
apartment, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The woman, who had worked at the Kirovohrad central post office
for more than 20 years, inspected every letter received from abroad
and allegedly took those that contained money, invitations for a
foreign trip or airplane tickets, Interfax said.
	   Police started the investigation after post office authorities
received numerous complaints from Britain, Israel and the United
States about lost letters, said Oleksandr Malyushenko of the local
Interior Ministry department.

Foreign diplomats seek negotiated end to Guinea-Bissau conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Diplomats from Portuguese-speaking
nations arrived Friday in Guinea-Bissau to try and mediate an end
to the seven-week-old conflict between the government and a
breakaway military faction in West Africa.
	   The six diplomats _ the foreign ministers of Portugal,
Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe, as well as
officials from Brazil and Angola _ arrived on board a Portuguese
Navy frigate, a Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman said in
Lisbon.
	   They were flown into the capital Bissau by helicopter and were
due to meet with President Joao Bernardo Vieira and members of the
government. Talks with rebel leaders were expected on Saturday.
	   Heavy shelling as the warring factions bombarded each other's
positions delayed the diplomats' arrival in Bissau for several
hours, the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The capital of the former Portuguese colony has been under
sporadic fire since June 7, when a breakaway military faction
occupied the city's main military garrison and the international
airport where they are still entrenched.
	   No figures were available on the total number of people killed
in the fighting, which also has spread to inland areas of this
small country of about 1 million people wedged between Senegal and
Guinea.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, accuse Vieira of corruption and demand that he step down.
Vieira is supported by some 1,300 troops from neighboring Senegal.
	   Previous mediation efforts _ by the foreign ministers of
Portugal and Angola and by local politicians and civic and
religious leaders _ have failed.

Ford Brazil reported planning to reduce workweek to shrink
</HEADLINE>
inventory &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor
Co. is planning to reduce the workweek at the largest of its three
assembly lines in yet another effort to shrink its inventory of
unsold cars, union officials said Friday.
	   Union representative Joao Rorigues de Souza said that starting
Aug. 3, the company's assembly line in a Sao Paulo suburb will
operate four days a week instead of five.
	   He said Ford officials announced the reduction at a meeting
Thursday. Ford officials would neither confirm or deny the plan at
the Sao Bernardo do Campo factory.
	   A sharp drop in sales and a stock of 38,000 unsold vehicles at
the factory and dealers lots were cited by the automaker in taking
the action, according to de Souza.
	   He said the production cut ``will last until the market heats up
again.''
	   In a previous effort to adjust production to demand, Ford
suspended production for seven working days earlier this month, but
failed to make much of dent in its inventory.
	   On Thursday, the local subsidiary of German automaker Volkswagen
said it will suspend production for two days at the end of the
month.
	   Brazil's auto industry, which includes Ford, Fiat and General
Motors, has a stock of more than 100,000 unsold cars, according to
the National Federation of Auto Distributors.
	   The auto industry's sales started dropping sharply late last
year when Brazil introduced a series of austerity measures to
counter the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   A steep increase in excise taxes on industrial production was
followed by an equally sharp rise in annual interest rates, which
nearly doubled to 43.5 percent.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first six months of the year
plummeted 23 percent compared with a year ago, according to the
National Association of Vehicle Manufacturers.
	   This week, Sergio Reze, the federation's president, asked
Finance Ministry officials to reduce the excise tax manufacturers
pay on vehicles, which ranges from 13 to 35 percent, as a way to
increase sales.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ For advice on young people and even
younger technology, the Jamaica government is turning to a
13-year-old consultant.
	   Makonnen Blake Hannah was named this week as Youth and
Technology Consultant to the government by Phillip Paulwell,
minister of Commerce and Technology.
	   ``He is an extraordinarily gifted child, selected from a number
of extraordinary young people aged between 8 and 16 who are
attending an intensive one-month Tech 2000 course recently
established in Kingston to give opportunites for children to
exercise their minds in technology,'' said Peter King, adviser to
the minister. ``He will be paid an honorarium.''
	   Makonnen will accompany the minister to technology events
dealing with youth and will also offer advice on computer hardware
and software.
	   The son of filmmaker and 1974 United Nations peace medalist
Barbara Blake Hannah, Makonnen has been schooled at home. He agreed
that he could be described as an expert.
	   ``I can program a little bit, I'm good at system design, kind
of, advanced windows and DOS usage, stuff like that _ you could
call me an expert,'' Makonnen said.
	   He sees no problem with the job fitting into his daily studies,
he says he always keeps up on what is happening in the world of
technology.

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Italian World Cup soccer player
Francesco Moriero could be heading to England to pair at midfield
with Paul Gascoigne at Middlesbrough.
	   Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has agreed to a 5
million-pound (dlrs 8.2 million) transfer deal with Inter Milan for
the 29-year-old Italian winger.
	   The transfer hinges on Moriero _ a member of the Italian
national team that lost its World Cup quarterfinal to France in a
penalty shootout _ agreeing to personal terms with Middlesbrough.
	   ``He's quick, powerful and has good technique, and he plays in a
position where I believe we need strengthening,'' Robson said
Friday.
	   If Moriero does sign, he will be the third former Inter player
at the Riverside, joining striker Marco Branca and central defender
Gianluca Festa.
	   Robson said Friday he had signed fullback Gustavo Lombardi on
loan until December 31 from Argentine team River Plate.

Germany wants rest of Bosnian war refugees out by end of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Germany wants the remaining 150,000
Bosnian war refugees still on its soil out by the end of the year,
a government official said Friday.
	   ``There are no general exceptions,'' said Dietmar Schlee, the
federal official in charge of coordinating Germany's refugee return
policy and reconstruction aid.
	   After war broke out in Bosnia in 1992, Germany took in about
350,000 Bosnian refugees, more than any other country outside the
Balkans. It has spent more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 11 billion)
since then caring for them, Schlee said.
	   A year after the Dayton peace accord was signed in 1995, Germany
began encouraging them to go home.
	   ``Every hospitality comes to an end sometime,'' he said.
	   About 200,000 have done so already, Schlee said. About 2,000 of
those were forcibly deported, he said, while several thousand
others left Germany for third countries.
	   The pace of returns was expected to pick up in the next few
weeks, Schlee said, since many families with children were granted
permission to stay until the end of the school year.

German court orders new trial for Lebanese acquitted of asylum home

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect's comments, background on investigation
into neo-Nazi youths. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A German court ordered a retrial
Friday for a Lebanese man acquitted last year of setting a fire at
an asylum shelter that killed 10 people.
	   The Federal Court of Justice overturned the lower court's
verdict based on an appeal by the family of one of the victims.
	   They argued that the court should have considered as evidence
conversations that prosecutors had secretly recorded between the
defendant, Safwan Aid, and relatives while he was in prison.
	   Aid, 22, was acquitted on June 30, 1997. Prosecutors had
admitted that they had insufficient evidence to convict him of
setting the Jan. 18, 1996, fire, which killed 10 people and injured
38 others in Luebeck, in northern Germany.
	   Aid said at a news conference in Hamburg that a new trial would
find him innocent.
	   His attorneys, Gabriele Heinecke and Barbara Klawitter, said the
conversations were poorly recorded and could not easily be
translated and used as evidence. They also noted there has been
suspicion that neo-Nazi youths may have set thethem
saying their alibis had been confirmed. The investigation into the
youths was reopened in May. Prosecutors said one of the youths had
confessed, but then later recanted.
	   Aid, who lived in the house that was burned, was arrested two
days after the fire, then freed on bail after six months in
investigative custody. The main witness against him was a rescue
team medic who testified he heard Aid say, ``It was us.''
	   However, the state court found the witness may have
misunderstood Aid and that the suspect himself may have been in a
state of shock when he spoke to the medic.
	   Prosecutors had contended Aid set the fire to get revenge on
another occupant over a disagreement.
	   But Aid denied the charges and other residents testified there
had been no fights in the building.
	   Prosecutors had secretly recorded conversations Aid had with
relatives while he was in jail, but the court refused to accept the
tapes as evidence, ruling that the way they were made was
unconstitutional.
	   The federal court, however, said the lower court was wrong not
to consider the tapes and overturned its verdict.
	   It's not clear what value the tapes will be in a new trial,
however.
	   Prosecutors themselves did not challenge the lower court's
ruling, saying it was pointless since the tapes did not seem to
prove Aid's involvement.

Milan appeals court reduces prison sentence for former premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A Milan appeals court on Friday nearly
halved the prison sentence of former Italian Premier Bettino Craxi,
convicted of accepting payoffs for the building of the local subway
line.
	   The court convicted Craxi of corruption and sentenced him to
four years and six months in prison, Italian news agencies
reported. In 1996, a lower court had given him an eight-year-three
month-sentence.
	   Craxi, who is living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia, was also
given a 9.8 billion lire (dlrs 5.4 million) fine by the appeals
court.
	   Craxi's lawyer, Giannino Guiso, told the ANSA news agency that
the appeals court had ruled that the former Socialist premier
received the payoffs for financing his party and not for personal
enrichment.
	   Financing of political parties through payoffs is illegal,
although there are proposals now by lawmakers to make it no longer
a crime.
	   Last week Craxi had been acquitted by a Rome court in connection
with alleged kickbacks for works on Rome's subway system.

Cambodian election observers happy with ``representative'' verdict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The main foreign observer group
monitoring Cambodia's election said Friday it should be able to
certify the violence-marred process as ``broadly representative of
the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   The Joint International Observer Group _ the U.N. group
coordinating foreign observers _ issued a statement saying it felt
``justified in anticipating that reasonable conditions exist'' for
judging the election to be fair.
	   Groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, in
separate statements issued Friday, argued that the electoral
process is fundamentally flawed by violence and intimidation
against the opposition.
	   They claimed a neutral political climate was never established
by strongman Hun Sen and urged the international community not to
certify the election as fair on the basis of narrow technical
issues.
	   U.S. observers from the Democratic and Republican parties have
expressed similar objections.
	   The statement from the Joint International Observer Group
indicated that it would not hold Cambodia to as rigorous standards
as more developed democracies in determining whether its election
is free and fair.
	   While stating that high standards are required for any election,
it noted that Sunday's poll will mark the first time in several
decades that Cambodians are organizing their own multiparty
democratic election.
	   ``No political process can be taken out of its historical
context,'' said spokesman Sven Linder reading the statement. ``This
fact cannot be overlooked when the JIOG forms its opinion of the
1998 Electoral Process in Cambodia.''
	   Some 678 foreign election observers are in Cambodia, joining
tens of thousands of Cambodian poll watchers.
	   The foreign presence was requested by the opposition, who
believe that Cambodia's strongman, Hun Sen, will try to win the
election by whatever means necessary, including fraud and violence.
	   The group said its final judgment ``is naturally subject to the
conduct of polling and counting procedures in a manner ...
respecting all voters' right to express their choice freely in a
secret ballot.''
	   It said the judgment would also depend on all parties accepting
results without trying to undermine them.

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ An Italian working for the U.N. World
Food Program was robbed and then shot dead near his home in the
Burundian capital, police sources said Friday.
	   The man was tentatively identified as Renato Ricciardi, and the
sources said he was killed Thursday night.
	   The Burundi office of the WFP would not comment on the death,
but at the agency's headquarters in Rome, director Catherine
Bertini reportedly ``expressed deep sorrow on hearing of the
senseless killing.''
	   The WFP supplies relief food to several hundred thousand
Burundians displaced by five years of politically motivated ethnic
conflict in which at least 200,000 people, most of them civilians,
have been killed.

Chile to seek extradition of Irish sisters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A judge on Friday indicted two sisters
from Ireland on charges of helping in the spectacular helicopter
escape of four guerrillas from a maximum security prison here.
	   In announcing the indictments in absence of Christine and
Frances Shannon judge Lamberto Cisternas said he was asking the
foreign ministry to file a request for the extradition of the
sisters.
	   The four pro-communist guerrillas were rescued from the prison
main yard by a helicopter on Dec. 30, 1966. Two of them were
serving life terms for the 1991 assassination of a prominent
rightist senator and the others had been sentenced to 10 years
convicted of terrorism.
	   According to the investigation conducted by Judge Cisternas, the
Irish sisters helped to organize the plan to rescue the four
guerrilla, posing as tourists to rent the helicopter used in the
operation.
	   The whereabouts of the sisters is unknown but the extradition
request will be filed with the Irish government because of their
nationality.
	   One of the escaped guerrillas was located in Switzerland and is
in prison there awaiting for a court ruling on a Chilean request
for his extradition.
	   The three others remain at large and police here believe they
are in Cuba. The Cuban government, however, has denied that.
	   Local press reports indicated the Irish sisters are members of
Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army.

Jamaica plans effort to eliminate dangerous screwworm fly

	   ``Alarming but true, the fly will lay its eggs in the cuts and
bruises that a child or even an adult may have and which is not
properly tended,'' said Clarke. ``In Jamaica people have died from
infestations of the screwworm fly.''
	   To eradicate the fly, infertile flies raised in Mexico are
released from airplanes. When they mate with the native population
of screwworm flies, no offspring are produced.
	   Clarke said it is hoped the flies will breed themselves out of
existence in three years.
	   The program has already worked successfully in parts of Africa,
North America, Central America, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Curacao
in the Caribbean, resulting in complete eradication.
	   The three-year program set to begin in March or April next year
is expected to cost US dlrs 9 million.
	   ``Twenty million pupae will be brought into the island each
week, held in chambers and allowed to emerge. Fifteen million
sterile flies each week are expected to be produced,'' said James
Wendell Snow, technical adviser to the government.

Government increases Cape fur seal harvest by 25 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN GROBLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ The government authorized an additional
25 percent of Cape fur seals to be killed in the upcoming annual
harvest.
	   When the season opens in mid-August, private concessionaires
will be allowed to take 35,000 pups and 5,000 bulls from the
Atlantic coastline of this southwest African country, the
government said Thursday.
	   The pups are clubbed to death and the bulls shot.
	   The main market is for seal penises, which are dried and
exported as an aphrodisiac throughout Asia, the culling companies
say.
	   The pelts are exported to Italy and the meat and protein-rich
oil are given to about 300 workers, who help with the harvest and
sell the products locally.
	   The Wildlife Society of Namibia will observe the slaughter of
the seals, which it says are not endangered.
	   ``We support the concept of sustainable utilization of the
natural resource,'' the society's Gavin Fuller said Friday. ``But
we would have liked more data on the seals' numbers to enable a
more accurate assessment of the cull.''
	   The government gave no reason for this year's quota increase,
but in the past has said the seals are replenishing themselves
since the first harvest in 1987.
	   The government receives a nominal fee of 1.50 Namibian Dollars
(24 cents) per seal.
	   In 1994, bad weather sharply reduced fish stocks, leading to the
starvation of more than 100,000 seals, mainly pups.

World Food Program staffer shot and killed in Burundi

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ An international staffer of the World Food
Program was robbed and fatally shot as he arrived at his home in
Bujumbura, Burundi, U.N. officials said Friday.
	   The identification of the staffer and his nationality were not
released pending notification of his family, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
	   Preliminary reports say three bandits entered the man's property
Thursday night and one held up a guard while the others went
inside, U.N. officials said. The motive appeared to be robbery.
	   It was the sixth killing this year of a WFP staffer and the
third this month.
	   WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini and Sergio Vieira de
Mello, U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator, ``expressed deep sorrow
at hearing of the senseless killing,'' Eckhard said.

Tribunal prosecutor accuses Serbs of hindering arrest efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Bosnian Serb authorities are
issuing indicted war crimes suspects with false identity papers in
an effort to ``deliberately frustrate'' NATO arrest operations, the
chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal claimed
Friday.
	   The statement by Louise Arbour followed the arrest Wednesday
night by troops in NATO's Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia of
two brothers believed to be war crimes suspects.
	   The brothers turned out not to be Predrag Banovic and his twin
brother Nenad, who are accused of killing and torturing Muslim
inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the summer of
1992. NATO returned the wrongly arrested brothers to the eastern
Bosnian town of Prijedor Thursday.
	   ``Several of the accused who have been arrested by SFOR this
year have had in their possession ... false official identity
papers, including photographs, issued by various Republika Srpska
authorities,'' Arbour claimed in a written statement, referring to
the Serbian entity in Bosnia.
	   ``This demonstrates that not only is Republika Srpska avoiding
its legal obligations ... but has also been engaged in deliberately
frustrating the tribunal's work by issuing false identification
papers to those persons indicted by the tribunal in an attempt to
shield them from the tribunal's jurisdiction.''
	   Arbour also reiterated that under the peace deal that ended the
Bosnian war the primary responsibility for arresting indicted
suspects lies with local authorities.
	   Serbian officials say their constitution prohibits them
arresting Serb nationals and extraditing them to The Hague.
	   The tribunal has 27 suspects in custody, another 31 indicted
suspects remain at large, including former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic.

Yeltsin, Chirac discuss efforts to free French hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin assured his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac on Friday that Russia was doing
``everything possible'' to free a Frenchman kidnapped in southern
Russia six months ago, Yeltsin aides said.
	   Yeltsin and Chirac spoke by telephone about the fate of Vincent
Cochetel, head of a regional office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees who was abducted Jan. 29 by three masked gunmen in
North Ossetia, near Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya.
	   Russian media have said that Cochetel was being held in Chechnya
and that kidnappers have demanded dlrs 1.5 million in ransom for
his release.
	   Yeltsin and Chirac also discussed bilateral cooperation, said a
statement released by Yeltsin's press service.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya
and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are mostly motivated by
ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive.
	   The most high-profile captive is Valentin Vlasov, Yeltsin's
envoy to Chechnya. He was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1.

Burial of 32 flood victims interrupted by storm

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The burial of flood victims in
eastern Slovakia was interrupted Friday by torrential rains that
sent mourners fleeing for shelter, the Czech news agency CTK
reported.
	   Shortly after Bishop Bernard Bober started the funeral in the
village of Jarovnice for 32 flood victims, strong winds and driving
rain dispersed the crowd of 1,500.
	   It was unclear whether the funeral would resume Friday because
the Svinka River was rising dangerously, CTK reported.
	   Flash floods that hit the area late Monday killed 36. More than
30 people remain missing.
	   In the Czech Republic, the bodies of two flood victims were
recovered Friday, raising the death toll to five. Both people were
killed in flash floods Thursday in northeastern Bohemia.
	   The body of a woman was found in the river Zlaty potok in the
village Skalka, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) northeast of
Prague.
	   Policeman Zdenek Hlavacek told CTK the woman had not been
identified.
	   A man's body was recovered earlier Friday in the village of
Pulice.
	   CTK quoted the man's neighbors as saying he went out to warn
people about the coming flood early Thursday but never returned.
	   One person remained unaccounted for Friday afternoon.
	   The flash floods in the Czech Republic came after heavy rains
swamped an area of about 100 square kilometers (40 square miles).
Houses in 20 villages were damaged as three local streams
overflowed.
	   Roads were damaged and five bridges collapsed. Road damage was
estimated at some 200 million koruna (dlrs 6.2 million), CTK said.
	   A rescuer from Prague was killed and another seriously injured
in an ambulance accident in the region Friday.
	   Rescue workers with dogs continued to search for possible
survivors in Slovakia. A sudden downpour flooded the Sabinov
district of eastern Slovakia late Monday, causing river levels to
rise 6 meters (yards) in a matter of hours. The flood wiped out
area roads and bridges, trapping dozens of victims.
	   According to Slovak officials, water levels during the flooding
were the highest in 500 years.
	   Jarovnice, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the
capital, Bratislava, was the worst hit. Most of the victims were
Gypsies, also known as Roma, who lived in a settlement of shacks
that was washed away.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. diplomacy accelerated in the
search for peace in Kosovo, ethnic Albanians appealed Friday to
relief organizations to speed medical supplies to rural villages
where thousands fled from recent fighting.
	   ``There are many sick children and no help is coming,''
complained Rama Morina, a doctor in the Kosovo Liberation Army
stronghold Malisevo. ``It's a catastrophe.''
	   As part of the international effort to end the violence, special
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Friday with the leading Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, to explore ways to reach a cease-fire
and arrange talks with the government on Kosovo's future.
	   The challenge is to reconcile the Albanians' aspirations for
independence for the Serbian province _ where Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9-to-1 _ and the Yugoslav government's refusal to grant more
than autonomy.
	   ``Everyone is allergic to the word autonomy,'' Hill told
reporters after the meeting. ``One has to help work on something
that will ultimately be something that both sides will accept.''
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, added that
``there is a certain amount of urgency'' to finding a solution.
``And I don't think we have a lot of time.''
	   The KLA has refused to recognize any agreement worked out with
Rugova. In an interview published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper
Koha Ditore, a KLA officer identified as Lum Haxhiu said the ``KLA
cannot be controlled by any Albanian political force because it's a
national army, a people's army, and its policy is national, not a
party policy.''
	   He reiterated that KLA would settle for nothing less than full
independence for Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia
that has a population of 2 million people.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Albanian militants in late
February.
	   The search for peace has taken on new urgency since heavy
fighting around the town of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of here. Serb police drove off the KLA early Wednesday
after a six-day battle, sending thousands fleeing the fighting.
	   Most of the Albanians trekked to KLA-controlled villages, where
food, medicine and other supplies had already been in short supply
since the start of the crackdown.
	   In Malisevo, Dr. Morina was trying to cope with the refugee
influx in an overcrowded, poorly equipped clinic, down to only four
IV bags. He said six women had given birth in the past few days,
some on the floor because the shortage of beds.
	   In a nearby KLA-controlled village, Astravub, a makeshift clinic
had been set up in a school. The village's population had swollen
from 3,000 to about 10,000 because of the refugees from the
Orahovac fighting, local KLA officials said.
	   The only doctor, who refused to give his name because his
relatives live in Serb territory, said he saw 84 patients on
Thursday alone, including children suffering from fevers and
grownups with battle wounds.
	   Without water, electricity or adequate medicine, the doctor said
he was able to little more than administer first aid.
	   In Pristina, Albanian leader Rugova met with a delegation of the
International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss the refugee
situation. Rugova said he requested that ``international
humanitarian organizations use all resources available to help the
refugee population of Orahovac and the people of Kosovo.''
	   Rugova called again for international action to stop the
fighting and warned violence could spill into neighboring regions.
	   ``Serbian military and police forces continue with attacks and
massacres against the Albanian population,'' Rugova said. ``We
demand international protection for Kosovo and its people in order
to stop further conflict that could spread to a wider region,'' he
said.

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ An Italian working for the U.N. World
Food Program was robbed and then shot to death near his home in the
Burundian capital, police sources said Friday.
	   The man was tentatively identified as Renato Ricciardi, and the
sources said he was killed Thursday night.
	   Preliminary reports say three bandits entered the man's property
Thursday night and one held up a guard while the others went
inside, U.N. officials said. The motive appeared to be robbery.
	   It was the sixth killing this year of a WFP staffer worldwide
and the third this month.
	   The Burundi office of the WFP would not comment on the death,
but at the agency's headquarters in Rome, director Catherine
Bertini reportedly ``expressed deep sorrow on hearing of the
senseless killing.''
	   The WFP supplies relief food to several hundred thousand
Burundians displaced by five years of politically motivated ethnic
conflict in which at least 200,000 people, most of them civilians,
have been killed.

Yugoslav coach offers resignation

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav national soccer team coach
Slobodan Santrac offered his resignation Friday, following his
team's early exit from the World Cup.
	   Sources close to the national team said Santrac could be
succeeded by Radomir Antic, the former Atletico Madrid coach in the
Spanish first division.
	   Santrac said in his report to the Yugoslav soccer federation
that the team's loss to the Netherlands in the best of 16 round of
the World Cup that another coach should take his place on the eve
of the European Championship qualification rounds.
	   The sources said Santrac's resignation is likely to be
accepted, but they added it was unclear whether Antic would accept
the new job.
	   Santrac became Yugoslavia's head coach in 1995.

Netanyahu sends Hussein wishes for a swift recovery

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a
message Friday wishing a swift recovery to King Hussein of Jordan
who was being tested for possible lymphoma, his office said.
	   Hussein who is being treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn, disclosed the news of his condition in a letter to his
brother, Crown Prince Hassan, which was read on Jordanian
television earlier this week.
	   Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is a
tireless campaigner for peace with the Jewish state. However, he
has criticized Netanyahu's tough line in peace talks with the
Palestinians.

Eight Britons arrested on drugs charges on Spanish Costa Del Sol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUENGEROLA, Spain (AP) _ Police arrested eight Britons to break
up an important drug trafficking and money laundering gang based on
Spain's southern Costa Del Sol, police said Friday.
	   The eight were arrested over last weekend in the resort town of
Fuengerola, an agent at the local police station said. Police also
seized 600 kilos (1,300 pounds) of hashish and dozens of luxury
vehicles.
	   As well as trafficking hashish to Great Britain, the gang also
allegedly ran a money laundering operation from a local money
exchange bureau.
	   Daniel Redmond, 54, from London, who was arrested along with his
wife Christine, allegedly headed the operation.
	   Two other British couples were also detained in the bust _
Frederik Siggins, 66, and his wife Carole, 58, Brian Monaghan, 41,
and his wife Zoe.
	   John Radford, 55, and John Barnham, 49 made up the octet
detained.

Cyprus denounces Demirel statement on economic integration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus denounced Friday a statement by
Turkey's president that the occupied north of the island would be
regarded economically as a province of Turkey.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides called on the world to
take steps to prevent such a development.
	   ``The statement by (Turkish President Suleyman) Demirel is one
more proof of Turkish intentions. The international community must
cease its caressing of Turkey and its toleration of Turkish actions
against Cyprus,'' Stylianides said.
	   Demirel said in Ankara on Thursday that the economies of Turkey
and the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state were heading toward
integration.
	   Demirel is due to visit northern Cyprus on Saturday to take part
in week long celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1974
Turkish invasion.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of a coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway state
is recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish Cypriots are already part of the Turkish economy in that
they use the Turkish lira and have to accept Turkey's 77 percent
inflation. Their lack of recognition impedes their ability to trade
with countries other than Turkey.
	   The Cypriot protest came as the U.S. State Department
coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, conferred separately with
Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders Friday without achieving a
breakthrough in efforts to resume inter-communal peace talks.
	   ``We had good discussions. We tried to focus on the substance of
the problem,'' he said before flying to Athens for further
discussions with the Greek government.
	   He said his discussions explored ways to resume the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks and to lower tension caused by the
Cypriot government's planned deployment of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in the fall.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Turkey has vowed to prevent the deployment, expected later this
year. Greece, a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, has warned it will respond to any attack on Cyprus.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A judge on Friday indicted two sisters
from Ireland on charges of helping in the spectacular helicopter
escape of four guerrillas from a maximum security prison here.
	   In announcing the indictments in absence of Christine and
Frances Shannon judge Lamberto Cisternas said he was asking the
foreign ministry to file a request for the extradition of the
sisters.
	   The four pro-communist guerrillas were rescued from the prison
main yard by a helicopter on Dec. 30, 1996. Two of them were
serving life terms for the 1991 assassination of a prominent
rightist senator and the others had been sentenced to 10 years
convicted of terrorism.

Photographer who inspired Fellini is dead

 &UR; EDS: ADDS Sophia Loren's reax &QL; 
 &UR; With AP File Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tazio Secchiaroli, a Roman photographer who inspired
the ``paparazzo'' character in Federico Fellini's film ``La Dolce
Vita,'' died in his home following a long illness, the family said
Friday. He was 73.
	   Secchiaroli was one of a pack of photographers who chased and
snapped U.S. movie stars and other VIPs along Via Veneto and in
night clubs in the 50s and 60s when Rome was known as ``Hollywood
on the Tiber.''
	   After ``La Dolce Vita'' was shown, the term ``paparazzo'' became
synonymous with pesky, star-pursuing photographers.
	   ``With Tazio Secchiaroli, one of the greatest photographers of
the world of cinema is gone,'' actress Sophia Loren was quoted as
saying by the Italian news agency ANSA.

Burial of 32 flood victims interrupted by storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates PRAGUE, Czech-Floods

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The burial of flood victims in
eastern Slovakia was interrupted Friday by torrential rains that
sent mourners fleeing for shelter, the Czech news agency CTK
reported.
	   Shortly after Bishop Bernard Bober started the funeral in the
village of Jarovnice for 32 flood victims, strong winds and driving
rain dispersed the crowd of 1,500.
	   It was unclear whether the funeral would resume Friday because
the Svinka River was rising dangerously, CTK reported.
	   Flash floods that hit the area late Monday killed 36. More than
30 people remain missing.
	   In the Czech Republic, the bodies of two flood victims were
recovered Friday, raising the death toll to five. Both people were
killed in flash floods Thursday in northeastern Bohemia.
	   The body of a woman was found in the river Zlaty potok in the
village Skalka, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) northeast of
Prague.
	   Policeman Zdenek Hlavacek told CTK the woman had not been
identified.
	   A man's body was recovered earlier Friday in the village of
Pulice.
	   CTK quoted the man's neighbors as saying he went out to warn
people about the coming flood early Thursday but never returned.
	   One person remained unaccounted for Friday afternoon.

to come to a decision with Smith's lawyer Peter Lennon saying it
would be ``days or weeks' before one was forthcoming.
	   Smith faced the panel Friday on charges she tampered with a
urine sample in a test earlier this year and could face a life ban
if found guilty of the charges.
	   ``The doping panel heard various submissions made and the
evidence and the doping panel is going to reflect now on that
material,'' Lennon said.
	   ``We've been told they will inform us of any decision as soon as
they come to it and we'd like to think Michelle will be the first
to know.''
	   ``They have another meeting tomorrow (Saturday) in regard to
another case. The decision could be then or it could be a matter of
days or weeks.''
	   ``They're tired. It's their second case today,'' said FINA
honorary secretary Gunnar Werner of the panel.
	   The hearing lasted about 4 1/2 hours and Lennon said he was
given three hours to present Smith's defense.
	   Smith, looking tired and drawn, entered the hearing with Lennon
at at the luxurious Palace hotel in downtown Lausanne. Her husband
Erik De Bruin was not with her. She was not seen by reporters
leaving the meeting.
	   Smith, who won her three gold medals in the 1996 Olympics, is
charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug test by
adulterating her sample with alcohol.
	   She has consistently denied taking drugs to enhance her
performances.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's A sample, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Analysis of her second sample, conducted at the same lab in the
presence of Lennon and a biochemist from Dublin hospital, showed
identical signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen, FINA
said.
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol, suggesting an attempt to mask the detection of drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life ban.
	   Smith, who says she has been tested probably more often than any
other international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test
in Kilkenny County, Ireland, on January 10.
	   The three-man panel examining the case consisted of three
lawyers _ the chairman of the doping comission Harm Bayer of
Germany, Ben Belkacen Farid of Algeria and Bernard Favaro of the
United States.
	   Lennon had said previously he would appeal aany guilty finding
to a higher jurisdiction.
	   Earlier Friday, the same three-man FINA panel found four Chinese
swimmers guilty of using banned substances in the World
Championships in Perth, Australia, and suspended them for two years
from all competition.
	   FINA said the suspensions went into force immediately. A
temporary suspension period, which was in force from Jan. 14 until
April 25, will be deducted from the two-year total.
	   The three Chinese women _ Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _
and male teammate Wang Wei tested positive for triamterene, a
banned diuretic which can be used to mask the use of anabolic
steroids.
	   Charles Duan, a lawyer for the four, immediatley appealed the
case to the Lausanne Tribunal of Sport. The appeal was rejected
pending a written statement from FINA and is likely to be heard in
several weeks.

Lawyer for Mexican kidnapping ring arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A lawyer for members of a notorious Mexican
kidnapping ring was himself arrested for allegedly taking part in
at least five abductions.
	   The lawyer, Angel Vivanco Navarro, was picked up Thursday at a
Mexico City police office where he went to retrieve a car he had
reported as stolen. An officer there recognized him from an old
wanted list.
	   Criminal investigation police chief Mauricio Tornero Salinas
told a news conference that Navarro, 40, is wanted in connection
with more than five kidnappings and may be turned over to federal
authorities for prosecution.
	   Kidnapping is a federal offense in Mexico. Tornero did not
provide details of the abductions Navarro is suspected of being
involved with, but said he may also be involved in illegal
possession of firearms.
	   Navarro had been legal representative for Daniel Arizmendi
Lopez, the fugitive head of a gang of kidnappers notorious for
cutting off the ears of victims and sending them to relatives to
coerce ransom payments, Tornero said.
	   The Arizmendi gang has been blamed for dozens of kidnappings in
recent years. Police have arrested his wife, son, daughter, brother
and son-in-law as well as other suspects and seized properties
worth several million dollars allegedly bought with ransom money.
	   Navarro, a former provincial police officer, defended Arizmendi
several times against car theft charges.

Arsenal given all-clear to play Champions League games at Wembley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League and FA Cup champion Arsenal was
given the go-ahead Friday to play its European Champions League
matches at Wembley stadium this season.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, last week cleared
Arsenal to switch its Champions League games from Highbury to
Wembley, potentially doubling the crowd capacity to 70,000.
	   England's Football Association consented to the deal Friday _
allowing the Gunners to use Wembley this season on a one-off basis.
	   In a statement, the FA said it was committed to maintaining the
traditional status of using Wembley only for ``flagship'' events
but decided Arsenal's situation warranted special consideration.
	   Arsenal pushed for the move because UEFA ground requirements for
Champions League games would have reduced the capacity at its own
stadium, Highbury, by more than 6,000.
	   UEFA spokesman Frits Ahlstrom said he supported the move because
it meant more genuine fans would be able to watch Arsenal play in
the European tournament.
	   ``It's a sensible option to use a larger venue,'' he said.

Government: foreign minister justified in calling Clinton a liar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Friday said its foreign minister,
Theodoros Pangalos, was justified in calling U.S. President Bill
Clinton a liar because his administration has backed away from
promises to solve the Cyprus dispute.
	   ``Mr. Pangalos said a truth. He gave evidence which has
historical depth. He didn't make up or imagine things in order to
make a statement,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   His comment was made one day after Pangalos described
pre-election promises made by Clinton to help solve the 24-year
division of Cyprus as ``gross lies.''
	   Clinton had said before both of his elections that Cyprus would
be among his top foreign policy priorities. Two years ago Richard
Holbrooke, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, had declared 1996 ``the year of Cyprus.''
	   But U.S.-led efforts to solve the Cyprus problem collapsed last
May when Turkish Cypriots insisted to Holbrooke, then a special
Cyprus envoy, that their breakaway state be recognized as a
condition for resuming U.N.-sponsored peace talks. They also
demanded cancellation of the European Union's membership talks with
Cyprus.
	   Perceptions have been growing here that the United States has
been siding with Turkey over the Cyprus dispute.
	   Reppas defended a number of anti-American statements made by
senior officials following White House spokesman Mike McCurry's
Wednesday description of the 1974 events on Cyprus as a
``conflict'' rather than an invasion by Turkish forces.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the north.
	   ``We believe that as a reply the statements of the Greek
officials were necessary,'' Reppas said.
	   But despite the apparent deterioration in Greek-American
relations, Athens still welcomes Washington's mediation in efforts
to solve the island's problem.
	   ``The Greek government wishes for there to be progress on the
Cyprus issue. It wishes for the U.S. government to intensify its
efforts,'' Reppas said.

Yugoslav coach offers resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav national soccer team coach
Slobodan Santrac offered his resignation Friday, following his
team's early exit from the World Cup.
	   Sources close to the national team said Santrac could be
succeeded by Radomir Antic, the former Atletico Madrid coach in the
Spanish first division.
	   Santrac said in his report to the Yugoslav soccer federation
that after the team's loss to the Netherlands in the World Cup
another coach should take his place on the eve of the European
Championship qualification rounds.
	   The sources said Santrac's resignation is likely to be accepted,
but they added it was unclear whether Antic would accept the new
job.
	   Santrac became Yugoslavia's head coach in 1995.

Potent South American trade bloc seeks freer trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo USH101 &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) _ Six South American presidents pledged
to strengthen democracy in their ``Zone of Peace'' to pave the way
for free trade and resolved to push for full economic integration
by 2005.
	   Meeting amid snow-dusted peaks in southernmost Argentina, the
four presidents of the potent Mercosur trade bloc were joined by
Bolivian and Chilean counterparts at the one-day summit.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela also took part,
expressing interest in greater ties across the South Atlantic while
declaring that the rush toward globalization should not leave out
the poorer, less powerful nations.
	   ``Today we affirm that Mercosur is a 'Zone of Peace' and is at
peace,'' President Carlos Menem of Argentina said at a luxury hotel
on a snowy mountainside overlooking Ushuaia, the southermost city
on earth.
	   The Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and
Paraguay said peace and democracy was ``essential'' to full
economic integration, and said that their region was free of arms
of mass destruction.
	   ``The full exercise of democratic institutions is an essential
condition for the development and process of integration'' by
member nations, said the declaration, called the ``Protocol of
Ushuaia.''
	   It warned that any break in the ``democratic order'' would
constitute a grave threat to stability and could lead to expulsion
from Mercosur.
	   Bolivia and Chile also joined in the declaration as associate
members and neighbors of the trade bloc, which groups 204 million
people and economies totaling dlrs 1 trillion.
	   Mercosur has taken steps this year to free up bidding in
services and government services, but no progress was reported on
accords to open up key automobile and sugar markets.
	   Delivering the address of honor, Mandela declared that ``new
conditions today allow us to come together as neighbors across the
Atlantic.''
	   ``Finding itself at the juncture between the Indian and Atlantic
oceans, South Africa is in every sense a part of the South. Our
strategic location gives us the potential of being a bridge between
South America and Asia,'' said Mandela.
	   He praised growing trade between South Africa and the Mercosur
countries, but cautioned that free trade's benefits must alleviate
poverty in the developing world.
	   ``We cannot avoid the process of globalization. The world
politically and economically is becoming closely integrated,''
Mandela told reporters.''But globalization must not benefit the big
powers to the detriment of those who are poor or powerless.''
	   Attending the summit were presidents Menem of Argentina,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of
Paraguay and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay.
	   Neighbors Chile and Bolivia were represented by Eduardo Frei and
Hugo Banzer respectively during the daylong gathering at a hotel
perched on a mountainside above the Beagle Channel.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and 33 other democratic heads of
state last April vowed to expand free trade throughout the Americas
by 2005.
	   Picking up the tone of that summit, Chilean president Frei said
that the recent end of military government in the region is a
pillar to support trade expansion.
	   ``Twenty years ago, South America was a map of authoritarian
regimes. We are now a region in democracy,'' said Frei. ``We must
consolidate that opportunity'' with expanded free trade.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodian politicians aren't the only
ones rushing around before elections Sunday. Foreign couples,
especially Americans, are scrambling to adopt children in case a
new government tightens adoption rules.
	   ``We went from the airport to the orphanage to the embassy. I
never even got a chance to shave,'' said Joe Balcerak, of
Rochester, New York. He arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday, picked
up an 18-month-old girl he named Jana Lynn, and they left the
country Friday.
	   At least 22 American families came to adopt babies in the past
week, many with less than four days' notice. Some Europeans also
are adopting, but Americans seem to be the most active. The last
couples left town Friday with their new children.
	   After waiting months, sometimes years, to adopt children,
couples were told that if they could collect the children before
the elections, there would be no wait. Many had never considered
adopting a Cambodian child before last week.
	   Giddy parents congregated at the Sunway Hotel with their new
Cambodian children, rocking them in soft new baby blankets and
dressing them in fuzzy outfits.
	   ``We cleaned out (a nearby orphanage) pretty well,'' Balcerak
said. ``There are maybe only a half dozen left.''
	   Civil war during the 1980s left Cambodia with a surfeit of
orphans and an economy too shattered to care for them. Orphanages
would have perhaps one wet-nurse for eight babies _ meaning most
starved.
	   Cambodia first opened its doors to international adoptions in
1989, and they skyrocketed after a U.N. peacekeeping mission
arrived in 1991. But the country halted foreign adoptions in 1992
for fear that the adoptions could not adequately be monitored.
	   Adoptions began to resume slowly in 1993, under strict
government control. Fewer orphans have lost both parents because of
war; instead, many come from families that cannot afford them.
	   The doors to foreign adoptions have swung wide open amid the
political turmoil that followed a bloody coup last year when
strongman Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   The Ministry of Social Action and Veterans Affairs decided that
if prospective parents could prove that they met the adoption
requirements of their host countries, Cambodia would quickly
approve the requests.
	   A U.S.-based agency, Maine Adoption Placement, which has been
active in matching American couples with orphans, pushed to have a
batch of adoptions arranged before July 25.
	   ``I think they are afraid that the adoption policy might
change'' with Sunday's elections, said Sandy Nickels, the proud new
mother of a two-month-old baby girl, Grace Vandy.
	   Most families said they paid between dlrs 10,000 and dlrs
15,000, about a third of which goes to pay ``processing fees'' to
the Cambodian government. Critics suspect the children are being
rushed out of Cambodia by greedy officials who want to line their
own pockets in case the elections put their jobs in jeopardy.
	   The new parents appeared dazed by the whirlwind of events.
	   ``We had 48 hours to throw together two months of paperwork,''
said Michael Shantzis of San Francisco, the new father of an
18-month-old girl named Theany. Theany spent her last few hours in
Cambodia sleeping on a bench in the hotel's restaurant.
	   Theany's mother, abandoned by her husband, was forced to give
her up because she could not afford to raise her, the new parents
said. They hope to find some way to give money to the family.

Decision to seal Iraqi document satisfactory, UN says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with UN spokesman saying deal to seal
document satisfactory, UN chief not concerned. TRIMS outdated
material. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The decision to seal a sensitive Iraqi
document until the chief U.N. weapons inspector and Iraq's deputy
prime minister can view it together seems satisfactory, the U.N.
spokesman said Friday.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan ``is not nervous'' about what the
incident could mean for the February accord he negotiated to grant
U.N. weapons inspectors access to sensitive presidential sites,
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   In a letter Wednesday to the Security Council, chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler detailed a July 18 incident in
which inspectors were unable to copy a document detailing bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   U.N. inspectors must verify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War.
	   The sealed document is being held by Iraq pending Butler's visit
to Baghdad on Aug. 2 through Aug. 5, when he and Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz will review it.
	   The incident was the first serious instance of Iraqi
non-cooperation since the February accord. Butler's spokesman said
it shows that inspections must continue because Iraq is still
hiding vital data.
	   Iraq downplayed its significance, citing the agreement to let
Butler review the document as proof that the situation was
resolved.
	   Butler's letter was being reviewed in Baghdad, but Iraq's deputy
ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said Thursday that ``there is no problem
from our point of view.''

Key officials optimistic of meeting U.S. deadline for Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A key U.S. official said Friday he is optimistic
that the world's users of the Internet will meet Washington's
deadline for ending the United States monopoly control on the
naming system.
	   ``It is our strong disposition for the U.S. government to get
out of this and not to step in,'' Ira Magaziner, senior White House
senior policy adviser, told reporters at a global Internet meeting.
	   The United States, which started the Internet to facilitate
communication between government agencies and researchers, has set
a Sept. 30 deadline for a handover to a new self-governing system.
	   That is the end of the U.S. government contract with a
Virginia-based firm, Network Solutions, which has had sole rights
to register the most popular international Internet addresses _
those ending in .com, .org and .net.
	   The United States, which has been pulling back from Internet
funding and control in recent years, wants an international
non-profit group to be formed to take over management.
	   Magaziner said Washington isn't looking for a complete agreement
on all outstanding issues, but for a clear indication of ``a
process that is working.''
	   J. Christopher Clough, a spokesman for the company, told
reporters that whatever agreement is reached on increasing the
number of companies than can assign names, Network Solutions
expects to keep operating as normal after the deadline.
	   ``We have 4,000 new registrations a day and we expect to have
that many on Oct. 1,'' Clough said. ``The Internet will keep
working.''
	   Magaziner and other officials were in Geneva for the annual
global meeting of the Internet Society, which is hosting a new
round of discussion on a successor system.
	   Industry opposition has blocked a previous agreement that would
increase the number of possible names of sites on the World Wide
Web.
	   Companies, which already have had to battle over others
registering sites using their trade marks, are looking for a way to
keep from adding to the complex and costly legal procedures of
protecting their well-known names.
	   Network Solutions has already registered more than 2 million
addresses, with nearly 30 percent of them from outside the United
States last year, Clough said.
	   Jean-Noel Tronc, adviser to French Premier Lionel Jospin, said
France wants to have some sort of international government approval
of the new arrangement.
	   ``The only way for its legitimacy to be undisputed _ and there
is a strong need for this _ is to give it some kind of a mandate
from ... international organizations,'' Tronc said.
	   The Australian government reiterated its fears that the United
States could continue to dominate the Internet after the change.
	   ``We want to see this thing to be internationally sustainable''
after dominance of the Internet shifts away from the United States,
said Paul Twomey, chief executive of the National Office of
Information Economics.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. diplomacy accelerated in the
search for peace in Kosovo, ethnic Albanians appealed Friday to
relief organizations to speed medical supplies to rural villages
where thousands fled from recent fighting.
	   ``There are many sick children and no help is coming,''
complained Rama Morina, a doctor in the Kosovo Liberation Army
stronghold Malisevo. ``It's a catastrophe.''
	   As part of the international effort to end the violence, special
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Friday with the leading Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, to explore ways to reach a cease-fire
and arrange talks with the government on Kosovo's future.
	   The challenge is to reconcile the Albanians' aspirations for
independence for the Serbian province _ where Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9-to-1 _ and the Yugoslav government's refusal to grant more
than autonomy.
	   ``Everyone is allergic to the word autonomy,'' Hill told
reporters after the meeting. ``One has to help work on something
that will ultimately be something that both sides will accept.''
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, added that
``there is a certain amount of urgency'' to finding a solution.
``And I don't think we have a lot of time.''
	   The KLA has refused to recognize any agreement worked out with
Rugova. In an interview published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper
Koha Ditore, a KLA officer identified as Lum Haxhiu said the ``KLA
cannot be controlled by any Albanian political force because it's a
national army, a people's army, and its policy is national, not a
party policy.''
	   He reiterated that KLA would settle for nothing less than full
independence for Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia
that has a population of 2 million people.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Albanian militants in late
February.
	   The search for peace has taken on new urgency since heavy
fighting around the town of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of here. Serb police drove off the KLA early Wednesday
after a six-day battle, sending thousands fleeing the fighting.
	   Most of the Albanians trekked to KLA-controlled villages, where
food, medicine and other supplies had already been in short supply
since the start of the crackdown.
	   In Malisevo, Dr. Morina was trying to cope with the refugee
influx in an overcrowded, poorly equipped clinic, down to only four
IV bags. He said six women had given birth in the past few days,
some on the floor because of a shortage of beds.
	   In a nearby KLA-controlled village, Astravub, a makeshift clinic
had been set up in a school. The village's population had swollen
from 3,000 to about 10,000 because of the refugees from the
Orahovac fighting, local KLA officials said.
	   The only doctor, who refused to give his name because his
relatives live in Serb territory, said he saw 84 patients on
Thursday alone, including children suffering from fevers and adults
with battle wounds.
	   Without water, electricity or adequate medicine, the doctor said
he was able to little more than administer first aid.
	   In Pristina, Albanian leader Rugova met with a delegation of the
International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss the refugee
situation. Rugova said he requested that ``international
humanitarian organizations use all resources available to help the
refugee population of Orahovac and the people of Kosovo.''
	   Rugova called again for international action to stop the
fighting and warned violence could spill into neighboring regions.
	   ``Serbian military and police forces continue with attacks and
massacres against the Albanian population,'' Rugova said. ``We
demand international protection for Kosovo and its people in order
to stop further conflict that could spread to a wider region,'' he
said.

Ford, magazine publisher end dispute over ``Focus'' trade-mark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Publishers of the newsmagazine Focus
agreed Friday to let Ford's German subsidiary use ``Focus'' as a
brand name as long as the car's logo is substantially different
from the magazine's.
	   Ford, in turn, agreed to Burda's request that the automaker
donate 1 million marks (dlrs 550,000) to the aid group Doctors for
the Third World.
	   The agreement, announced by the two companies in Munich, ended a
dispute that threatened to hold up Ford's plans to start selling
cars worldwide this fall under the Focus name.
	   A state court in Cologne ruled July 3 that Ford would unfairly
benefit from name-recognition of Germany's second most popular news
weekly if it used the name Focus within Germany.
	   Burda spokesman Philipp Welte welcomed the agreement, saying
``Ford has proposed a marketing strategy that will guarantee a
clean separation of the trade-marks.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian militants denounced the 5 year
prison sentence for Tehran's mayor as too lenient on Friday, a day
after he was convicted of corruption.
	   About 100 members of the Ansar'e Hezbollah, a Muslim
fundamentalist group allied with hard-liners in the ruling
hierarchy, chanted slogans against the popular mayor outside Tehran
University.
	   ``Death to the plundering mayor! Death to the traitor,'' the
protesters chanted, led by a van mounted with loudspeakers.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was convicted Thursday of
embezzling public funds and misappropriating government money.
	   He was sentenced to five years in prison, fined dlrs 530,000 and
barred from holding public office for 20 years. His lawyer has said
he will appeal the verdict.
	   The monthlong trial was viewed as part of a power struggle
between hard-liners and a reformist camp around President Mohammad
Khatami. Karbaschi was a close ally of Khatami and manager of the
moderate president's 1997 election campaign.
	   The arrest of Karbaschi in April sparked riots in Tehran. Before
Friday's protest, a senior hard-line cleric told people at the
university's prayer service that it was time to put the trial
behind them.
	   ``Everyone _ the people and officials _ should avoid creating
tensions now that this trial is over,'' said Ayatollah Ahmad
Jannati, head of the Guardian Council, which monitors parliament.
	   Most people leaving the campus after prayers ignored the Ansar'e
demonstrators, who are known for such protests.

----
CAMBODIA: INTIMIDATION  - An atmosphere of fear pervades this
election campaign, with the arrest, torture or even murder of
opposition politicians becoming an almost daily occurrence.

-----
CAMBODIA: VIETNAM  - A look at how Cambodians' historic mistrust of
their larger more powerful neighbour has shaped this election. Hun
Sen, who had help from Hanoi when he ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979,
is derided as a Vietnamese puppet by opposition politicians Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.  International observers have
called for greater tolerance, following the killings of four ethnic
Vietnamese during the campaign.
----
CAMBODIA: PARTIES  -  More than 35 different parties are running in
the elections, giving voters a confusing array of choices. APTV
talks to some of the more unusual candidates. One uses the U-S flag
as its motto, aiming to draw attention to his years in the United
States. Another has a rabbit as his logo, saying the furry animal
has spiritual meaning for Cambodians.
----
CAMBODIA: MEDIA - Opposition leaders say Hun Sen has severely
limited their access to the electronic media, highlighting what some
observers say is a clear imbalance in the upcoming vote. APTV talks
to politicians as well as journalists in Cambodia to assess whether
everyone is getting fair play.
----
CAMBODIA: PAILIN - Thousands of Khmer Rouge rebels have defected to
the government and will have their first chance to vote in this
election. APTV visited Pailin, a former rebel enclave in northwest
Cambodia, to see how democracy and the open market are taking hold.
---
CAMBODIA: ECONOMY  -  Visit almost any street corner in Phnom Penh
and the lingering effects of the country's tragic past become clear.
With many Cambodians battling just to find enough food to eat,
improving
economic conditions has become a main campaign battle cry.

Head of judiciary asks judges to tell him if they are Freemasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Lord Chancellor, head of Britain's judiciary,
has written to judges asking them to say if they are members of the
Freemasons.
	   Lord Irvine sent the letter after the freemasons' United Grand
Lodge failed to give the government names of judges, and others
such as policemen and magistrates, who were members of the secret
society, Irvine's office said Friday.
	   Lord Irvine said that he would allow judges to refuse to say
whether they were members, but said he hoped that they would
provide clear answers.
	   ``I believe that any substantial `non cooperation` could create
a suspicion in the minds of the public and weaken confidence in the
judiciary,'' Irvine said in a statement. ``I suspect that a full
set of responses will also serve to demonstrate that Masonic
membership among the judiciary is nothing like as great as some
people suppose.''
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said on Feb. 17 that judges,
prosecutors, magistrates, police officers, probation officers and
prison staff who are Masons would be required to publish their
names on a public register, saying that membership of a secret
society by those in the criminal justice system could lead to
suspicions of a lack of impartiality or objectivity.
	   A spokesman for Irvine's office said that the request was aimed
at about 5,000 people in Britain who hold full or part-time
judicial positions.

Gore praises new Russian prime minister as ``impressive''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore praised Russia's new
prime minister Friday, saying he has an ``impressive''
understanding of his country's troubled economy and the danger
posed by the spread of nuclear weapons technology.
	   It was the first full-scale encounter between Gore and
Kiriyenko, who was named prime minister less than four months ago.
The two No. 2 leaders drew up a summit agenda for their presidents,
and discussed ways to ensure the security of Russian nuclear and
defense technologies.
	   ``In a very short period of time he has established a full
command of the facts,'' Gore told a news conference. ``I'm
impressed with his programs.''
	   Kiriyenko returned the compliment, calling their discussions
``very concentrated and fruitful.''
	   ``This has been a very good start to our working relationship,''
Gore said.
	   The leaders' main task was to set the agenda for a Moscow summit
between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, planned for the
end of August or early September. No details of the summit plans
were released.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko reached and signed two agreements designed to
protect Russia's plutonium stockpile and find new jobs for
scientists in defense industries. They also discussed Russia's deep
economic crisis.
	   Kiriyenko insisted that Russia is not pursuing unpopular
economic reforms to please the International Monetary Fund or the
United States.
	   ``We are doing this for ourselves,'' he said. ``This is being
done because there is no alternative.'' He called the Russian
parliament's resistance to the government program a ``normal part
of politics.''
	   Gore has long co-chaired a joint commission on science and
technology previously headed by Kiriyenko's predecessor, Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The commission is aimed at ensuring the safety of
Russian defense facilities, especially nuclear materials and
technologies.
	   In his meetings with Kiriyenko, Gore raised two topics of
long-term concern to the United States: the spread of Russian
missile technology to Iran, and Russia's long-stalled ratification
of the START II arms reduction treaty.
	   Gore noted Iran's test of a missile this week that could strike
Israel and Saudi Arabia. He urged Russians to ``think about the
fate of our children and grandchildren'' and ``chose responsible
policies that will safeguard the future.''
	   The Russian government has said it is making every effort to
prevent Iran from acquiring such technology, but has had trouble
controlling the actions of private companies.
	   Gore also called on the Russian parliament to ratify START II,
``so that the United States and Russia can begin negotiating
further reductions during START III.'' The United States Senate
ratified START II in 1996, and the Clinton administration had
previously set Russian ratification as a precondition for a summit.
	   During his visit, Gore spoke with Yeltsin by telephone, praising
his speech at the recent funeral of Russia's last czar in which he
called for national repentance for the sins of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
	   ``I thought it was very eloquent and I congratulate you on your
statesmanship and leadership,'' Gore told Yeltsin, who is
vacationing in northwestern Russia.
	   Under the plutonium agreement, a new plant will be built to
reprocess plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel for
civilian nuclear power plants.
	   ``The biblical prophesy of turning swords to plowshares is
illustrated with this type of program,'' Gore said.
	   The two leaders also signed an agreement under which the United
States will help Russia's ``defense cities'' _ isolated research
communities that are having trouble making their way in the new
economy. The agreement would set up programs to convert such
facilities to civilian use and finding new jobs for their
scientists.
	   Before Moscow, Gore paid a two-day visit to Ukraine where he
toured the ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, site of the
world's worst nuclear accident.

Women are big players in global market _ and getting bigger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Women own between a quarter and a third of all
businesses worldwide. In the European Union, one-third of new
businesses are being started by women. And in the United States,
more than 7.7 million women-owned businesses are now generating
dlrs 2.3 trillion in revenue.
	   The message from the 400 women from 73 countries attending the
fifth Global Summit of Women is that women are big economic players
in the global market _ and will become even bigger players in the
21st century.
	   ``Global markets and women are not often used in the same
sentence,'' said Irene Natividad, the summit director, who chairs
the U.S. National Commission on Working Women. ``But increasingly,
statistics show that women have economic clout _ most visibly as
entrepreneurs and most powerfully as consumers.''
	   Participants at the four-day summit, which ends Sunday, reflect
the growing global power of women: Many are company owners, top
executives, corporate board members, politicians and heads of
voluntary organizations.
	   Women wage earners represent 30 percent to 40 percent of the
global workforce, Natividad said, and as their numbers increase so
does their earning power ``with the result that women consumers are
affecting the fate of many companies by what they decide to buy.''
	   In a keynote address Friday, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, director of the
U.N. Development Program's Human Development Report, said an
increasing number of women are getting around discrimination in the
workplace and closed doors in the corridors of political and
corporate power by becoming entrepreneurs.
	   ``And the growing economic power and influence of women-owned
businesses are changing the shape of the global economy,'' she
said.
	   ``Four out of 10 women business leaders are currently involved
in the international marketplace. This is a new trend _ a survey
shows about half only became involved within the last year. And
nearly half of those not yet involved say they have plans to do so
in the next three years,'' Fukuda-Parr said.
	   The biggest potential for women's economic power in the 21st
century lies in the growing number of women entrepreneurs and the
increasing clout of women in a consumer-driven world, she said.
	   Ann Sherry, general manager of human resources at Bank of
Melbourne-Westpac Banking Corp., one of Australia's largest
financial institutions, said it's time for women to recognize
``that we are in the early days of a genuine `girl power'
revolution.''
	   ``Over the next 10 years, we will witness the full unfolding in
our societies of women as significant, and in many areas, decisive
economic actors,'' she said. ``The challenge we now face is a great
one. How shall we choose to use our new won power?''
	   ``Women have enormous power to wield as consumers, investors,
shareholders, superannuation fund holders and as a big part of the
employee community. Today, women make choices that can make or
break national and local institutions _ from companies to
governments,'' she said.
	   Sherry urged women to start influencing the policies and
directions of corporations to get better products and services, to
exert political power and reshape national and international
institutions to ensure their interests and values are reflected.
	   Baroness Jean Denton, a member of Britain's House of Lords and
former Northern Ireland trade minister, said women should use their
power not to move up existing corporate ladders, but to change
organizations ``to the benefit of women from top to bottom _ and I
think that will be to the benefit of the world.''

Cambodia ends election campaign with hope, trepidation

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The campaign for Cambodia's second
election in the post-Khmer Rouge era closed Friday, marred by
violence but described as a vital step toward bringing one of the
world's most tragic countries closer to democracy.
	   Few doubt that strongman Hun Sen, who called the election to
legitimize his power after deposing his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, will let go of power. The prince and the other
chief opposition challenger, Sam Rainsy, talked at final campaign
rallies like they hoped to win, but referred to possible
coalitions.
	   A year ago, Hun Sen launched tanks and troops into the streets
of Phnom Penh to chase Ranariddh from office. The men had shared
power in an uneasy coalition since 1993, when the U.N. spent dlrs 3
billion and deployed 20,000 peacekeepers to organize what were the
most democratic elections in Cambodia's history.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party won the vote. But Hun Sen,
who learned politics as a Khmer Rouge cadre and came to power in
1985 under the Vietnamese military occupation that followed them,
forced his way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   Many Cambodians believe Hun Sen wouldn't hesitate to call out
the army again to keep power. But he may not have to. He has packed
the electoral machinery with his supporters and tried to flood the
countryside with partisans of his Cambodian People's Party to act
as observers.
	   The 678 foreign monitors, here at the opposition's insistence,
are nowhere near enough to monitor the 11,600 polling stations.
	   ``If the election is reasonably free and fair, the will of the
people will be translated into ballots,'' said Sam Rainsy. ``If the
CPP wins in a landslide victory, I don't think the will of the
people will have been expressed.''
	   The United Nations election monitoring mission and independent
U.S. observers know the election will be far from honest. For the
United States, the process has been fatally flawed with the murder
of political activists, intimidation of voters and denial of media
access to the opposition.
	   But the U.N. mission, dominated by the European Union which is
contributing the most election funding, announced Friday it is
prepared to accept the result as ``broadly representative of the
will of the Cambodian people.''
	   Former U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, co-leader of a bi-partisan,
independent monitoring group that will probably influence U.S.
acceptance of the result, said that the election could be an
``important stepping stone ... if they pull it off.''
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy say they expect Hun Sen to jigger the
results in the week before they are announced. If he can't,
Ranariddh has said the next step could be Hun Sen disqualifying or
arresting a leader. Failing that, many Cambodians fear he would
call out the army.
	   The prince has downplayed the fears of military intervention,
knowing some Cambodians could cast ballots for Hun Sen's party just
to keep the peace. The United States, he tells crowds, will not
recognize a government coming to power via military action.
	   None of the main parties can expect to honestly win a majority
of the 122 National Assembly seats at stake. Each leader has
indicated that he would be ready to form a coalition, but with
provisos. The result could be another power-sharing experience that
sets the stage for more turmoil rather than stability.
	   The current campaign showed how much has changed since 1993 and
how little. Five years ago, Cambodia was barely emerging from one
of history's worst traumas.
	   The Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979 had caused the deaths
of as many as 2 million people in a crazed experiment at communist
agrarian reform. It was followed by a decade of harsh Vietnamese
military occupation that imposed a Soviet-style state.

jersey'' on the route, dropped back to the pack and is stilll
third, and Marco Pantani fourth, both 3:01 back of Ullrich.
	   The 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis of Denmark and Ullrich's teammate
on the Telekom team, is 15th, 7:00 back.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: The last time the entire pack of riders took action
was in 1995 the day after Fabio Casartelli's death. The pack rode
but didn't race and let the Motorola riders, Casartelli's
teammates, move ahead at the finish to win the stage.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``We are fed up with being treated like
cattle. So we are going to behave like cattle,'' Laurent Jalabert
on why the riders protested. He added ``The sport is no longer
interesting to anyone. We won't cycle and that's the end of it.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: The 13th stage from Frontigan-la-Peyrade to
Carpentras, 196 kilometers (122 miles).

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 700 firefighters and soldiers worked
Friday to remove debris from a resort area in southwestern Poland
where flash floods have killed at least eight people.
	   Water levels on the Dusznica Bystrzycka river were dropping and
many of the 1,200 people evacuated from towns near the border with
the Czech Republic returned home, said Jan Jarosz of the provincial
flood committee in Walbrzych.
	   The death toll from the flash floods that hit early Thursday
climbed to eight late Friday with the discovery of an unidentified
man's body, TV reports said. One person remained missing.
	   The water damaged more than 100 houses, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
of roads and dozens of small bridges in the Klodzko region, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, Jarosz said.
	   A railway link between Klodzko and Kudowa Zdroj, a border
crossing with the Czech Republic, remained closed after the
flooding damaged part of the tracks and a bridge.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who ordered immediate government
assistance to area residents, traveled to the region Friday.
	   A government minister in charge of flood recovery assured
parliament Friday that the government was distributing food, water
and blankets to all in need.
	   The official, Jerzy Widzyk, also promised immediate damage
compensation from the government.
	   Before his departure, Buzek said the local government had been
warned about the heavy storms that hit southwestern Poland late
Wednesday, but that the sudden floods hit places where people never
expected water could reach them.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage. But the part of the Klodzko
region that suffered damage Thursday was not affected then.

Crazed bull tramples woman to death

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A thunder-crazed bull trampled its
elderly owner to death on Friday while she was trying to force it
back into its pen.
	   The CTK news agency quoted police officials as saying the bull
had probably been crazed by recent violent thunderstorms in the
area of Rasovice, a town 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Prague.
	   The animal broke free of its chain, smashed down a gate,
destroyed a feeding trough and a bicycle before turning on the
unidentified woman, 79, and trampling her to death, CTK said.
	   The 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) bull was led back into its pen by
the woman's son.

Distraught parents of paralyzed gymnast to fly to her side

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Wracked by guilt and fear, the distraught parents
of partly paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan prepared Friday to fly
to the United States to be at her side.
	   With 17-year-old Sang in a Long Island hospital bed, unable to
move her legs, her parents half a world away in Beijing fretted and
wept.
	   ``The biggest worry is that they won't be able to cure her,''
her father, Sang Shisheng, said in an interview a day before he and
Sang's mother were to fly to New York.
	   Sang, the 1997 national vault champion, was injured in a botched
landing during a Tuesday warm-up for the Goodwill Games. Striking
the mat with her head, she fractured and dislocated two neck
vertebrae, leaving her with no movement in her legs. Doctors said
Wednesday it was unlikely she would walk again.
	   Her father said they found out that their only child had been
hurt when they turned on the television to see her compete. They
heard the announcer say instead that she had been carried away on a
stretcher.
	   That ``meant it had to be serious,'' Mr. Sang said. ``We were
shocked.''
	   While injuries are part and parcel of being an athlete, ``I
never expected anything this terrible, not once,'' he said.
	   Now, the father said, comes the remorse of not having seen more
of Sang as she grew up. Like most Chinese gymnasts, she began
training very young _ at age 6.
	   After two years in a sports school in their hometown of Ningbo,
Sang was good enough to be accepted by a school where her parents
got to see her just once a month, the father said.
	   Then six years ago, she was picked for national team training
1,200 kilometers (740 miles) away from home in Beijing. Since then,
parents and daughter have seen each other just three times, most
recently last October, he said.
	   ``How can we ever make it up to her?'' the father said. ``She
was separated from her mother and father at such a young age, with
no parental love.''
	   ``Thinking back, I do have some regrets,'' he said.
	   Sang last spoke to her parents by phone a few days before she
left for the United States. They have not been in touch since her
accident, the father said.
	   For Sang's mother, Chen Xiufeng, thinking about her daughter's
future was just too painful.
	   ``I just dare not imagine it,'' she said, tears rolling down her
cheeks.
	   The father added that Sang's mother has said she ``doesn't want
to go on living'' if their daughter's injuries prove permanent.
	   Asked about the experimental nerve drug Sang was being treated
with, the father said he had ``total trust'' in U.S. doctors and
was sure they would give his daughter ``the best medicine.''
	   Sang's parents speak with the heavy accent of their native
Ningbo, a city near Shanghai on China's east coast. Mr. Sang is a
housing management officer, Mrs. Sang works in a steel factory.
Together, they earn about 1,200 yuan (dlrs 150) a month.
	   Officials prepared passports for them quickly and the Goodwill
Games organizing committee will pay their travel expenses, the
father said.
	   Chinese sports officials gave them a new suitcase for the trip,
their first outside of China. On top of their neatly folded
clothes, the parents had lovingly placed a portrait of Sang, her
head tilted and silky long black hair flowing over her shoulders.
	   ``I'm very proud to have such a daughter,'' the father said.

Polls show tight races in Mexican gubernatorial elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's opposition parties are making strong
showings in polls ahead of two gubernatorial elections next week,
Reforma newspaper reported Friday.
	   The conservative National Action Party is in a tight race with
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI,
in the relatively prosperous north-central state of Aguascalientes.
	   A victory there would help National Action rebound from a June 5
loss to the PRI in Chihuahua state. That vote was the first time it
had lost a governor's race.
	   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party _ which won its first
governorship July 5 in Zacatecas _ was surging in impoverished
Oaxaca state in the south, according to the Reforma poll. It still
trailed the PRI, drawing 33 percent to the PRI's 42 percent. The
poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
	   A month earlier, the PRI had 39 percent support in the newspaper
poll, and the Democratic Revolution Party 24.
	   Other polls have shown the PRI well ahead in a third state,
Veracruz, which also holds elections on Aug. 2.
	   In Aguascalientes, Reforma's July 19-22 poll showed National
Action favored by 35 percent of voters to 30 percent for the PRI,
but the margin of error made that a technical tie.
	   Most other polls in recent months have also showed National
Action ahead, but also within polling errors.
	   The Veracruz race involves the best-known candidates: wealthy
businessman Miguel Aleman Velasco of the PRI is the son of former
President Miguel Aleman Valdes. Luis Pazos of National Action is
one of Mexico's best-selling writers on politics and economics.
Former national Attorney General Ignacio Morales Lechuga is running
for the small Green Party.

FINA doping panel fails to come to decision in Smith case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS with comments from FINA official &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A possible life ban from swimming
will hang over Michelle Smith's head for at least a few more days
while a FINA doping panel considers charges heard Friday against
her.
	   The 1996 triple Olympic gold medalist appeared before the
three-man panel hearing allegations she tampered with a urine
sample in a test earlier this year and could face a life ban if
found guilty.
	   The head of the commission Harm Bayer said the panel would
review the case Saturday but said it was doubtful they would reach
a decision and, if they did, would wait several days before
announcing it.
	   ``The doping panel heard various submissions made and the
evidence and the doping panel is going to reflect now on that
material,'' Smith's lawyer Peter Lennon said. He said a verdict
would be announced in ``days or weeks.''
	   ``We've been told they will inform us of any decision as soon as
they come to it and we'd like to think Michelle will be the first
to know.''
	   The hearing lasted about 4 1/2 hours and Lennon said he was
given three hours to present Smith's defense.
	   Smith, looking tired and drawn, entered the closed-door hearing
with Lennon at the luxurious Palace hotel in Lausanne, where FINA _
the world governing body of swimming _ has its headquarters.
	   Her husband Erik De Bruin was not with her. She was not seen by
reporters leaving the meeting although Bayer said she was returning
home.
	   Smith is charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test by adulterating her sample with alcohol. She has consistently
denied taking drugs to enhance her performances.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's A sample, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Analysis of her second sample, conducted at the same lab in the
presence of Lennon and a biochemist from Dublin hospital, showed
identical signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen, FINA
said.
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol, suggesting an attempt to mask the detection of drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life ban.
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on January 10.
	   The three-man panel examining the case consisted of three
lawyers _ the chairman of the doping commission Harm Bayer of
Germany, Ben Belkacen Farid of Algeria and Bernard Favaro of the
United States.
	   Lennon had said previously he would appeal any guilty finding to
a higher jurisdiction.
	   Earlier Friday, the same three-man FINA panel found four Chinese
swimmers guilty of using banned substances in the World
Championships in Perth, Australia, and suspended them for two years
from all competition.
	   FINA said the suspensions went into force immediately. A
temporary suspension period, which was in force from Jan. 14 until
April 25, will be deducted from the two-year total.
	   The three Chinese women _ Luna Wang, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _
and male teammate Wang Wei tested positive for triamterene, a
banned diuretic which can be used to mask the use of anabolic
steroids.
	   Charles Duan, a lawyer for the four, immediately appealed the
case to the Lausanne Tribunal of Sport. The appeal was rejected
pending a written statement from FINA and is likely to be heard in
several weeks.
	   The case of British swimmer Mike Fibbens, who failed a test for
the banned stimulant Benzoylecgonine, was to be heard Saturday.

Leaders of scout group in custody after four die in boat accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three leaders of a French scouting organization
were placed in custody Friday on charges of negligence, after four
scouts died when their sailboat capsized off the Britanny coast.
	   Seven scouts, aged between 12 and 16, were on board when the
boat capsized in strong winds overnight Wednesday. Three survivors
were found, but rescue teams called off their search Friday for a
sailor of a pleasure boat who came to the boys' rescue.
	   A prosecutor in the Britanny town of Guingamp on Friday ordered
Jean-Yves Cottard, in charge of the French Association of Scouts
and Catholic Guides, to be placed in custody. The same applied to
Cottard's two assistants.
	   The organization, believed to have close ties to France's far
right, is not recognized by the country's main scouting
organiztion, or the government.
	   The Guingamp prosecutor, Philippe Astruc, has said no adults
were on the boat. He is trying to determine whether the scouts had
sufficient security qualifications.
	   At the time of the accident, winds gusted at up to 60 kilometers
(about 40 miles) an hour and a warning had been posted.
	   Two helicopters and several boats aided in the search off
Perros-Guirec, on the northwestern end of Brittany.

Hundreds help cleanup after flash flood in southwestern Poland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About 700 firefighters and soldiers worked
Friday to remove debris from a resort area in southwestern Poland,
where flash floods have killed at least eight people.
	   The Dusznica Bystrzycka river was dropping again after
Thursday's deluge and many of the 1,200 people evacuated from towns
near the border with the Czech Republic returned home, said Jan
Jarosz of the provincial flood committee in Walbrzych.
	   The death toll climbed to eight Friday with the discovery of an
unidentified man's body, TV reports said. One person remained
missing.
	   The water damaged more than 100 houses, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
of roads and dozens of small bridges in the Klodzko region, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, Jarosz said.
	   A railway link between Klodzko and Kudowa Zdroj, a border
crossing with the Czech Republic, remained closed pending repairs
to a flood-damaged bridge and tracks.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who ordered immediate government
assistance to area residents, traveled to the region Friday.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage. But the part of the Klodzko
region that suffered damage Thursday was not affected then.

Ford Brazil reported planning to reduce workweek to shrink
</HEADLINE>
inventory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES top three grafs with confirmation from Ford &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor
Co. is planning to reduce the workweek at the largest of its three
assembly lines in yet another effort to shrink its inventory of
unsold cars, union officials said Friday.
	   Union representative Joao Rorigues de Souza said that starting
Aug. 3, the company's assembly line in a Sao Paulo suburb will
operate four days a week instead of five.
	   Ford's press office said the production was necessary because of
a sharp drop in sales and a stock of 28,000 vehicles at the factory
and dealers. De Souza caluclated the stock at 38,000 units.
	   The union representative said the production cut, which ``will
last until the market heats up again,'' would reduce Ford's monthly
output by close to 4,000 units.
	   A sharp drop in sales and a stock of 38,000 unsold vehicles at
the factory and dealers lots were cited by the automaker in taking
the action, according to de Souza.
	   He said the production cut ``will last until the market heats up
again.''
	   In a previous effort to adjust production to demand, Ford
suspended production for seven working days earlier this month, but
failed to make much of dent in its inventory.
	   On Thursday, the local subsidiary of German automaker Volkswagen
said it will suspend production for two days at the end of the
month.
	   Brazil's auto industry, which includes Ford, Fiat and General
Motors, has a stock of more than 100,000 unsold cars, according to
the National Federation of Auto Distributors.
	   The auto industry's sales started dropping sharply late last
year when Brazil introduced a series of austerity measures to
counter the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   A steep increase in excise taxes on industrial production was
followed by an equally sharp rise in annual interest rates, which
nearly doubled to 43.5 percent.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first six months of the year
plummeted 23 percent compared with a year ago, according to the
National Association of Vehicle Manufacturers.
	   This week, Sergio Reze, the federation's president, asked
Finance Ministry officials to reduce the excise tax manufacturers
pay on vehicles, which ranges from 13 to 35 percent, as a way to
increase sales.

Officials optimistic about meeting U.S. deadline for Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A senior U.S. official expressed optimism Friday
that the world's Internet users will meet Washington's deadline for
ending U.S. control of the naming system for the global network.
	   The United States, which started the Internet to facilitate
communication between government agencies and researchers, has set
a Sept. 30 deadline for a handover of the naming system to a new
self-governing body.
	   A U.S. government contract with Network Solutions expires on
that date. The Herndon, Virginia, company has had sole rights to
register the most popular international Internet addresses _ those
ending in .com, .org and .net.
	   Ira Magaziner, senior White House policy adviser, told reporters
at a global Internet meeting in Geneva that the U.S. government
wants ``to get out of this and not to step in.''
	   The United States, which has been pulling back from Internet
funding and control in recent years, wants an international
nonprofit group to be formed to take over management of the
network.
	   J. Christopher Clough, a spokesman for Network Solutions, said
that whatever agreement is reached on increasing the number of
companies that can assign names, Network Solutions expects to keep
operating as normal after the deadline.
	   ``We have 4,000 new registrations a day and we expect to have
that many on Oct. 1,'' Clough said. ``The Internet will keep
working.''
	   Magaziner and other officials were in Geneva for the annual
meeting of the Internet Society, which is hosting discussions on a
successor system.
	   Industry opposition blocked a previous agreement that would
increase the number of possible names of sites on the World Wide
Web.
	   Companies that have had to do battle when others register sites
using their trademarks want to find a way to keep from adding to
the complex and costly legal procedures of protecting their names.
	   Network Solutions has already registered more than 2 million
addresses, with nearly 30 percent of them from outside the United
States last year, Clough said.

	   ST. GEORGE's, Grenada (AP) _ A slap in the face of Washington,
or a sign of the changing times?
	   Ghosts from a gut-wrenching chapter in Grenada's history are
being revived as the Caribbean nation welcomes _ and protests _
Cuba's Fidel Castro in his first visit to the island where U.S.
troops ousted a Marxist regime in 1983.
	   On Aug. 2, Castro's plane will land at the same airport where
Americans and Cubans fought each other during the invasion, which
was condemned by Castro and viewed by some as the place his export
of revolution ended.
	   Like the events that led to the invasion, Castro's coming has
divided residents of this spice island.
	   It is ``unpardonable'' and ``a slap in the face'' to the United
States, which lost 18 servicemen in the 1983 fighting, said Lloyd
Noel, a former Grenada attorney general. Noel was jailed by the
late Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, a Castro friend and ally whose
execution sparked the invasion.
	   ``Castro did not create the situation we had here,'' countered
newspaper publisher Leslie Pierre, who also was jailed for
criticizing Bishop's regime but now says Grenada should welcome
Castro.
	   During his two-day stay, Castro plans to speak at a public
rally, sign an agreement for Cuban aid to Grenada and meet with
Bishop's mother, Alimenta Bishop, an avowed Castro fan.
	   Bishop's New Jewel Movement overthrew a corrupt government in
1979 and allied itself with Cuba, which gave millions of dollars to
build Grenada's Point Saline International Airport. U.S.
strategists feared the airport would allow Cuba to project its air
power into South America.
	   When an extremist Marxist faction executed Bishop in 1983 and
about 50 of his supporters, the United States invaded, with a token
force from eastern Caribbean nations.
	   The United States said it was worried about the safety of
American medical students on Grenada. Critics said the students
were not in danger.
	   After three days of fighting, an armed group of Cuban
construction workers surrendered. Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans
and 18 Americans were killed.
	   When U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he
received a hero's welcome for ordering the invasion.
	   Castro, meanwhile, called it ``one of the most inglorious and
infamous deeds that a powerful country like the United States could
ever commit against a small country.''
	   Today, Grenada is a democracy. Castro's Cold War sponsor, the
Soviet Union, is gone. His Cuba, clinging to Marxism, is still
suffering under a U.S. embargo.
	   Grenada's Prime Minister Keith Mitchell once was anti-Castro but
now argues that the time for isolating Cuba is past. His invitation
to Castro also underscores regional frustration with Washington,
accused of neglecting the Caribbean after the Cold War.
	   U.S. aid has declined, promised trade benefits haven't
materialized and the United States has challenged European trade
preferences for bananas, a lifeline for many small Caribbean
economies like Grenada's.
	   In recent years, Mitchell and other Caribbean leaders unhappy
with U.S. policy have forged trade and diplomatic ties with Havana.
Castro also is scheduled to visit Barbados and Jamaica next week.
	   The Cuban leader has done his part to curry favor with Grenada,
sending Cuban doctors, teachers and sports trainers here, paying
for Grenadians' college education in Havana and helping build a
national sports stadium.
	   Amid a sense of excitement not seen since Reagan's visit, street
banners and an ambitious government media campaign urge Grenadians
to welcome Castro.
	   Still, many are less than thrilled.
	   The largest opposition party, the Grenada United Labor Party,
says it will protest human rights violations in Cuba. Party leaders
were persecuted after the 1979 coup.
	   ``We experienced what happened to us here during 1979 to 1983,
when brave Americans came here and gave their lives to set us free.
So we are saying Castro must change,'' said party leader Herbert
Preudhomme.

Activists, set fires, hurl rocks in Bahrain business district
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ About 50 anti-government Shiite activists
started fires and hurled stones at people, shops and cars Friday,
causing panic and forcing business to come to a standstill in the
central market area of Manama.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   A Bahraini opposition group in exile said the riot was to
protest the death in detention of a 19-year-old Shiite man whose
body was handed over to his family on Tuesday.
	   Witnesses said calm was restored in the Shiite Muslim dominated
area after 20 minutes by riot police who fired tear gas to disperse
the troublemakers.
	   After the rampage, broken glass from shop fronts and signboards
of hotels and restaurants littered the streets. More than a dozen
cars had broken windscreens.
	   It was not immediately known if there were any arrests and
government officials did not comment.
	   Shiite activists have often resorted to violence since beginning
a campaign in December 1994 for political and social reforms. More
than 40 people have been reportedly killed in the violence.
	   The London-based Islamic Liberal Movement of Bahrain alleged
that Noah Khalil al-Noah, the man who died in detention, was
tortured by police.
	   ``The citizens have expressed their protest and anger against
the policy of repression and torture,'' the movement said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
	   Shiite Muslims form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000
citizens. The ruling Al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream
Sunni sect of Islam.
	   In Manama, the capital of Bahrain, witnesses said the rioters
emerged from alleys in several groups and suddenly started hurling
stones.
	   They also burned tires and lit bonfires of rubbish piles, wood
and newspapers, said the witnesses, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Police cordoned off the area and were expected to remain there,
said one riot policeman at the scene.

Rose comes back hard but still exits Dutch Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Teenager Justin Rose turned his
game around Friday to shoot a six-under par 65 at the Dutch Open,
but fell a stroke short of making the cut in his first pro tourney.
	   Englishman Rose, 17, shot six birdies and no bogeys to bounce
back to level par after carding a 77 in the first round Thursday.
But the cut for the top 65 players fell at one under.
	   Lee Westwood added a second-round 66 to his course
record-equalling 8-under-par 63 Thursday but had to share the lead
at 13 under with Australian Stephen Leaney.
	   With sunny, almost windless conditions almost perfect for
strokeplay on the tree-lined Hilversumsche course, Leaney matched
Westwood's first-round 63 for a 129 total.
	   With two rounds remaining the pair are four strokes clear of
Zimbabwean Nick Price, whose 65 put him in the clubhouse at a
9-under-par 133.
	   England's Jonathan Lomas shot a 69 to finish on 8 under in
fourth place, a stroke ahead of five players on 7 under.
	   Favored American Phil Mickelson bombed out of this 800,000 pound
(dlrs 1,320,000) European PGA tourney, shooting six bogeys for a
3-over par 74 and level par after two rounds.
	   But despite five bogeys, Spaniard Seve Ballesteros hung on for a
73 and a stroke under par to squeeze past the cut.

Rose comes back hard but still exits Dutch Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Teenager Justin Rose turned his
game around Friday to shoot a six-under par 65 at the Dutch Open,
but fell a stroke short of making the cut in his first pro tourney.
	   Englishman Rose, 17, shot six birdies and no bogeys to bounce
back to level par after carding a 77 in the first round Thursday.
But the cut for the top 65 players fell at one under.
	   Lee Westwood added a second-round 66 to his course
record-equalling 8-under-par 63 Thursday but had to share the lead
at 13 under with Australian Stephen Leaney.
	   With sunny, almost windless conditions almost perfect for
strokeplay on the tree-lined Hilversumsche course, Leaney matched
Westwood's first-round 63 for a 129 total.
	   With two rounds remaining the pair are four strokes clear of
Zimbabwean Nick Price, whose 65 put him in the clubhouse at a
9-under-par 133.
	   England's Jonathan Lomas shot a 69 to finish on 8 under in
fourth place, a stroke ahead of five players on 7 under.
	   Favored American Phil Mickelson bombed out of this 800,000 pound
(dlrs 1,320,000) European PGA tourney, shooting six bogeys for a
3-over par 74 and level par after two rounds.
	   But despite five bogeys, Spaniard Seve Ballesteros hung on for a
73 and a stroke under par to squeeze past the cut.

PepsiCo stock up; it may sell big stake in bottling business to
</HEADLINE>
public &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ PepsiCo Inc. shares rose sharply Friday after
the soft drink and snack foods business said it was considering
breaking its bottling operations into a separate publicly traded
company.
	   Such a move could generate a huge amount of cash and free
PepsiCo to focus on making itself a tougher competitor to Coca-Cola
Co. in the battles for soft drink customers and investors.
	   Coca-Cola made a similar move more than a decade ago.
	   In Wall Street's first reaction to the announcement late
Thursday, PepsiCo stock shot up 9.5 percent before giving up some
of its gains. PepsiCo was trading up dlrs 2.31 1/2, or by 6.2
percent, at dlrs 39.87 1/2 a share this afternoon on the New York
Stock Exchange.
	   PepsiCo currently owns bottling operations that account for
about 57 percent of the volume of Pepsi-Cola products sold in the
United States and 75 percent in Canada. Independently owned
bottlers handle the rest.
	   The new bottling company would own all of the company-owned
Pepsi-Cola bottling operations in North America and possibly some
international operations, according to a statement Thursday from
PepsiCo.
	   Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, said in
the statement that creation of ``a closely aligned, separately
managed bottler of this size would help us pursue consolidation
opportunities and improve our performance in the marketplace.''
	   The deal could generate ``literally billions of dollars,'' said
analyst Emanuel Goldman of PaineWebber. He said the precise amount
would depend on how the deal is set up.
	   The announcement comes as the nation's second-biggest soft drink
company is moving on a number of fronts to compete more
aggressively with Coca-Cola, which has been widening its lead in
the nation's dlrs 55 billion soft drink market.
	   On Monday, PepsiCo announced a deal to buy orange juice maker
Tropicana Products from Seagram Co. for dlrs 3.3 billion in a move
that would let it compete at the breakfast table with Coca-Cola's
Minute Maid brand.
	   In May, PepsiCo accused Coca-Cola in a federal lawsuit of
violating antitrust laws with its exclusive contracts with
independent food distributors who supply soft drinks to restaurants
and movie theaters. PepsiCo said the tactic unfairly costs it
access to a growing segment of the market.
	   PepsiCo would be following Coca-Cola's lead in setting up a
separate publicly traded company to be its main bottler.
	   Most of Coca-Cola's U.S. bottling operations are owned by
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., created in 1986 when Coca-Cola sold a
51 percent stake in its domestic company-owned bottling operations
to the public.
	   Coca-Cola Enterprises initially accounted for 30 percent of the
volume of Coca-Cola sales in the United States and now accounts for
about 60 percent.
	   The value of Coca-Cola Enterprises shares has grown about
sixfold since the company was taken public 12 years ago.
	   The statement left unanswered how much of a stake would be
offered to the public and how much would be raised.

Japanese midfielder at Italian signing ceremony: `right choice'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Japan's star soccer player Hidetoshi Nakata, at his
signing ceremony Friday with Perugia, called his decision to play
for the Italian team ``the right choice.''
	   RAI state TV said he signed a multi-year contract worth 1
billion lire (555,000 dlrs) a year.
	   Nakata told the TV interviewer: ``I only know that the Italian
league is No. 1 in the world.''
	   Perugia, which plays in the Umbrian city of the same name, was
promoted from the second to first division major league this
season.
	   Later, at a ceremony in the hill town of Viterbo, where team
president Luciano Gaucci has a castle, Nakata told reporters the
move was the ``right choice.''
	   Speaking through an interpreter, the midfielded added he will
study Italian.
	   Nakata's transfer to a top European team had been a hot topic of
conversation in Japan since the national team's debut in the World
Cup, where several European clubs were reportedly eyeing him as a
possible new recruit.
	   Nakata will be only the second Japanese to play in the Italian
major league, among the world's best divisions.
	   Kazuyoshi Miura, a striker for Japan's Verdy Kawasaki team,
played with another Italian team, Genoa, in the 1994-1995 season.

Hollywood struck dumb as dubbers go on strike

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hollywood's been struck dumb, silenced by a dubbers'
strike in Italy that could darken the silver screen.
	   The strike brings to the fore an unsung but indispensable part
of the movie business in Italy.
	   Elsewhere in Europe, subtitled or original-language versions of
films are usually available. Not here.
	   Italians like their movies in Italian. Period. That means
virtually all of the 300 or so first-run films imported by Italy
every year get dubbed.
	   Dubbers walked off the job July 13 in a long-simmering contract
dispute. The strike has studio reps and distributors chewing their
nails. Fall is a big movie season and a lot of major films are
supposed to open.
	   ``We're in trouble if they don't go back,'' said Patrizia
Gelvatti, of United International Pictures, which distributes MGM,
Paramount and Universal. ``We can't even get our trailers out.''
	   Steven Spielberg's World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' is
awaiting Italian voices, she said.
	   At Warner Bros., ``The Perfect Murder,'' a remake of the classic
``Dial M for Murder'' with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow
isn't dubbed yet. ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' is only partly dubbed.
	   ``This is a movie that could make a minimum of dlrs 8 million at
the box office,'' said the head of Warner Bros. in Italy, Paolo
Ferrari.
	   The good news is that the strike won't affect the upcoming
Venice Film Festival, which caters to purists by showing films in
the original language.
	   Italy's monster movie buffs can also rest easy; the folks at
Columbia Tristar say ``Godzilla'' is now speaking perfect Italian
and ready for theaters on Sept. 18.
	   It takes several months of painstaking work to produce a dubbed
version of a movie, and the people in the industry take a lot of
pride in what they do.
	   ``The French speak like they're delivering telegrams. And the
Germans: No life!'' dubbing director Francesco Vairano said
dismissively. ``I can proudly say that Italians are the best.''
	   Vairano, who's dubbed everything from ``Pulp Fiction'' to
``Hamlet,'' goes over and over small snippets of a scene with his
cast, seeking a seamless mesh between what the eyes see and the
ears hear.
	   ``We watch the faces very carefully, especially the actors'
eyes,'' he said.
	   Major stars are often recruited for special projects and scores
of seasoned directors and actors do dubbing. Some ``voices'' even
have followings. Fans of the ``Italian Woody Allen,'' Oreste
Lionello, insist he's even funnier than the real thing.
	   It's been a month since the last round of negotiations between
the union and film industry representatives, and neither side
sounds hopeful about an end to the strike.
	   ``I'm not very optimistic,'' said Ferrari, the Warner chief.

Nigerian journalists return home from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Two journalists returned home Friday after
being released from jail by the country's new military leader, who
has pledged to bring freedom and democracy to Africa's most
populous country.
	   Babafemi Ojudu, editor of Lagos Tempo, rejoined his family in
the commercial capital four days after military ruler Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar promised to free all political detainees and
hand over power to a civilian government by the end of May next
year, friends and family members said.
	   Ojudu had been held without charge since November last year. He
was believed to be suffering from jaundice and typhoid contracted
while spending time behind bars.
	   George Mbah, a journalist for the weekly Tell magazine who was
jailed in connection with an alleged 1995 coup plot against the
late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha, arrived home in Lagos Friday
four days after being freed from prison in the city of Biu in
northern Nigeria.
	   Abacha, who took over following a 1993 coup, died in June of
apparent heart failure. Under his rule, critics of the military
regime were summarily detained on trumped-up charges and sometimes
killed.
	   Nigeria has long grown accustomed to military dictators and has
only known 10 years of civilian rule during the 38 years since
independence from Britain.
	   But activists and politicians have begun cautiously meeting in
the past week to form new parties in the wake of Abubakar's
announcement that he intends bringing democracy to the country.
	   The results of elections held during Abacha's rule have been
annulled. Most of those elections were largely won by supporters of
Abacha.

Communist explains to party why he accepted Yeltsin Cabinet post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist appointed to the Russian Cabinet sent
a letter to his party on Friday explaining his decision, a news
agency reported.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, 60, a former deputy chairman of the Soviet
planning agency Gosplan, was named Minister for Industry and Trade
on Thursday, becoming the first Communist in the Cabinet.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had been expected to make a gesture of
this sort to improve his relations with the hard-line parliament,
which has blocked many of his economic reforms.
	   Maslyukov acknowledged Thursday that by accepting the post, he
may be seen as a traitor to the Communists' cause. On Friday he
sent a letter to the Russian Communist Party Central Committee
stressing that he would continue to abide by party discipline,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maslyukov also noted the ``special conditions'' surrounding his
acceptance of the job, giving him a greater say in industrial
policy, especially for defense industries.
	   Maslyukov served as chairman of Gosplan under Mikhail Gorbachev,
and is currently a Communist member of the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, and chairman of its committee on economic
policy.

IMF mission to visit Russia in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kiriyenko comments on Internet. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission will return
to Moscow in early September to evaluate Russia's economic
performance and decide whether to release the second installment of
a bailout loan, a top IMF official said Friday.
	   The IMF approved its portion of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout
earlier this week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800
million after parliament failed to approve the austerity measures
it had demanded. The Russian government responded by circumventing
parliament and imposing the measures by decree.
	   By September, the IMF wants to see a draft 1999 budget submitted
to parliament, a reduction in the pension fund deficit, and
progress toward meeting 1998 budget targets, said the fund's Moscow
representative, Martin Gilman.
	   ``Only if all these steps are taken and IMF experts see
practical results of the efforts of tax agencies, the Finance
Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Trade and Industry Ministry,
the State Customs Committee and the Central Bank, will the mission
have reason to say that the financial situation in Russia has
started improving,'' Gilman said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the bailout package is only
part of the program to boost the Russian economy, which has been
slipping for months, after showing the first signs of modest growth
at the end of last year.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets, in part because of
world trends like falling oil prices, but also because of the
country's chronic failure to cut the federal budget and collect
taxes.
	   ``No stabilization loans will solve the problem unless we solve
it ourselves,'' Kiriyenko said during an interview on the Internet.
``The most pressing issue which needs to be resolved is
harmonization with the budget. We should live in accordance with
our revenues and spend only as much as we receive in revenues.''
	   If the IMF likes what it sees in September, it will release the
remaining dlrs 800 million of the first installment plus a second
installment of dlrs 3.5 billion, Gilman said.
	   The government's cash shortage has resulted in a chronic failure
to pay workers' wages and pensions on time, and protest strikes
have swept across Russia in recent months.
	   On Friday, workers of the Amur Ship-Building Plant in the Far
East walked off the job to demand a year's backlog of unpaid wages,
exceeding 70 million rubles (dlrs 11 million), the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Coal miners from the town of Osinniki in Central Siberia's
Kemerovo region resumed a blockade of a local railway to demand
wages that are months overdue, Interfax reported, citing local
union leaders.
	   Gilman said that if the government improves its economic
performance in 1999, that, together with IMF support for the
Central Bank's gold and currency reserves, should encourage
investors to return to Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced plans Friday to issue bonds
redeemable by future gold production, Interfax said. The move is
intended to raise money to finance gold production. No other
details were released.
	   And, the Central Bank reduced a benchmark interest rate from 80
percent to 60 percent, ITAR-Tass reported. The rate, which was 24
percent in early February, was as high as 150 percent in the end of
May, as the bank sought to combat the market crisis.
	   The Russian stock market fell 1.32 percent in slow trading
Friday to close at 157.74 points. The ruble fell slightly against
the U.S. dollar.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Coca-Cola company announced
Friday that through a partnership with a Palestinian bottler it
will begin producing and distributing its soft drinks in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Coke and the privately owned Palestinian company National
Beverages Company (NBC) will set up a plant and warehouse in the

develop the struggling Palestinian economy.

its continued economic development and provides a significant
landmark in integrating the Palestinian economy in the global
system,'' Khouri said in a press release.

	   FERRARA, Italy (AP) _ Firefighters and police gave out drinking
water to motorists Friday who sweltered in 37 degree (99F) heat
during a seven-kilometer (4.5 mile) long backup on the autostrada
near this northern city.
	   Tying up traffic on the A13 highway was a hay track which caught
fire.
	   Adding to the misery throughout Italy was humidity as high as 60
percent. Health authorities advised the elderly and children to
stay indoors during hours of the hot afternoon sun.
	   Weather forecasters said northern Italy might cool off a bit
starting Sunday but that the rest of the country would have to wait
until at least Monday for a little relief.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police have arrested an alleged
Italian Mafia boss and 15 others suspected of running a drug route
from north Africa into Europe, police told reporters Friday.
	   Rinaldo Bisco was arrested with three other Italians on their
boat early Wednesday as it cruised close to the Mediterranean
island of Menorca, Barcelona Police Chief Francisco Arrebola told a
press conference reported by the national news agency EFE.
	   Another two Italians were arrested nearby, and police seized
1,064 kilos (2,346 pounds) of hashish from the boat they were
traveling in, while a Frenchman and a seventh Italian were detained
while they apparently waited for the boats to dock in Menorca, EFE
said.
	   Bisco allegedly ran a network for moving drugs from the Spanish
enclave of Ceuta in north Africa by boat to Menorca, one of the
Balearic Islands off the eastern coast. The drugs were transported
on to be distributed throughout Europe, Arrebola said, according to
EFE.
	   Related to the same case, a German and four Spaniards were
detained Thursday in southern Spain and two further suspected were
taken in by police in Ceuta on Friday. A 15th alleged member of the
Bisco's band was also arrested Friday in Madrid.
	   Bisco has been linked to the Neapolitan and Sicilian Mafias, and
allegedly ran drug trafficking operations between Brazil and France
until he set up his base in Spain in 1992, EFE reported.

Russia to join effort against `millennium bug'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian scientists will join American colleagues
in a special group to resolve the problem of the ``Millennium
Bug,'' Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Friday.
	   Kiriyenko said the problem was discussed during his meeting with
U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
	   ``This is a serious issue not only for America, in fact it is a
problem which affects all users of computer networks in the
world,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``I believe that indeed Russia has many top level experts who
could help resolve this problem,'' he said.
	   The Millennium Bug refers to the problem that many computers _
originally programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a
year _ may be unable to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900
_ since their codes represent those years as simply 00.
	   Computer experts warn that on Jan 1, 2000, banking systems may
fail, air traffic controls could stop working _ and nuclear
reactors might melt down if the problem in their computer systems
is not fixed.
	   Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry recently said it will wait until
2000 to fix any computer glitches arising from the Millennium Bug.
	   Kiriyenko ordered Russia's computer experts this spring to
develop ways to resolve the 2000 problem by the end of this year,
but it is commonly acknowledged that Russia is far behind its
western counterparts in fixing the glitch.

Parker Bowles aide resigns after leak to press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The personal assistant of Camilla Parker Bowles
resigned Friday after admitting responsibility for a press leak
about the first meeting of Prince Charles' companion and his son
Prince William.
	   The Sun tabloid reported on its front page July 9 that Prince
William, 16, had met Mrs. Parker Bowles at St. James's Palace on
June 12 and that they got along well.
	   There were questions about whether Prince Charles' staff had
leaked the story to improve the image of his companion, whom
Princess Diana blamed for the break-up of their marriage.
	   Amanda MacManus, who had worked part-time for Mrs. Parker
Bowles, said Friday, ``It is a matter of great regret to me that
chance remarks of mine led to the disclosure in the press of the
private meeting between Mrs. Parker Bowles and Prince William.''
	   Mrs. MacManus said she had mentioned the meeting to her husband,
who in turn told a friend in confidence. The friend then told a
reporter from The Sun.
	   ``I have been very upset by the rumor and speculation about how
The Sun obtained this information and have decided to make this
statement to remove the embarrassment and uncertainty that has
caused for many people,'' Mrs. MacManus said.
	   ``As the person responsible for this unhappy train of events, I
cannot with honor remain in this position,'' she said.
	   A statement from Mrs. Parker Bowles said she accepted the
resignation with regret, adding that she would miss Mrs. MacManus'
``efficiency, charm and friendship.''

Gore praises new Russian prime minister as ``impressive''

 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore praised Russia's new
prime minister Friday, saying he has an ``impressive''
understanding of his country's tr for their presidents,
and discussed ways to ensure the security of Russian nuclear and
defense technologies.
	   ``In a very short period of time he has established a full
command of the facts,'' Gore told a news conference. ``I'm
impressed with his programs.''
	   Kiriyenko returned the compliment, calling their discussions
``very concentrated and fruitful.''
	   The leaders' main task was to set the agenda for a Moscow summit
between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, planned for the
end of August or early September. No details were released.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko reached and signed two agreements designed to
protect Russia's plutonium stockpile and find new jobs for
scientists in defense industries. They also discussed Russia's deep
economic crisis.
	   Kiriyenko insisted that Russia is not pursuing unpopular
economic reforms to please the International Monetary Fund or the
United States.
	   ``We are doing this for ourselves,'' he said. ``This is being
done because there is no alternative.'' He called the Russian
parliament's resistance to the government program a ``normal part
of politics.''
	   Gore has long co-chaired a joint commission on science and
technology previously headed by Kiriyenko's predecessor, Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The commission is aimed at ensuring the safety of
Russian defense facilities, especially nuclear materials and
technologies.
	   Gore raised two topics of long-term concern to the United States
on Friday: the spread of Russian missile technology to Iran, and
Russia's long-stalled ratification of the START II arms reduction
treaty.
	   Gore noted Iran's test of a missile that could strike Israel and
Saudi Arabia. He urged Russians to ``think about the fate of our
children and grandchildren'' and ``chose responsible policies that
will safeguard the future.''
	   The Russian government has said it is making every effort to
prevent Iran from acquiring such technology, but has had trouble
controlling the actions of private companies.
	   Gore also called on the Russian parliament to ratify START II,
``so that the United States and Russia can begin negotiating
further reductions during START III.'' The United States Senate
ratified START II in 1996, and the Clinton administration had
previously set Russian ratification as a precondition for a summit.
	   During his visit, Gore spoke with Yeltsin by telephone, praising
his speech at the recent funeral of Russia's last czar in which he
called for national repentance for the sins of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
	   ``I thought it was very eloquent and I congratulate you on your
statesmanship and leadership,'' Gore told Yeltsin, who is
vacationing in northwestern Russia.
	   Under the plutonium agreement, a new plant will be built to
reprocess plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel for
civilian nuclear power plants.
	   ``The biblical prophesy of turning swords to plowshares is
illustrated with this type of program,'' Gore said.
	   The two leaders also signed an agreement under which the United
States will help Russia's ``defense cities'' _ isolated research
communities that are having trouble making their way in the new
economy. The agreement would set up programs to convert such
facilities to civilian use and finding new jobs for their
scientists.
	   Gore left for Washington on Friday night.
	   Before Moscow, Gore paid a two-day visit to Ukraine where he
toured the ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, site of the
world's worst nuclear accident.

France Telecom buys Salvadoran phone company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH BELTRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ France Telecom won a Friday
auction to buy 51 percent of the Salvadoran national telephone
company, known as ANTEL, for dlrs 275 million, outbidding Mexico's
Telmex by dlrs 4 million.
	   ANTEL's cellular division was split off earlier and a
controlling interest was sold last week to a Spanish company.
	   Officials earlier had estimated that the auction would bring
dlrs 268 million.
	   Under the sale plan, 25 percent of the company would be held by
the state, 14 percent sold on the local stock market and 10 percent
would go to employees.
	   However the employees' group purchased only 6.5 percent for dlrs
34.5 million. The remaining 3.5 percent is to be added to the
shares sold on the local stock market.
	   ``We should be very happy at having a (company) of the first
order,'' said ANTEL president Juan Jose Daboub.
	   He said the French company was to invest between dlrs 400
million and dlrs 500 million to improve service.
	   ``We are going to provide the country with a telecommunications
service of the top level,'' said Roland Geldwerth, project chief
for France Telecom.

Iranian shah's widow marks his 18th death anniversary in Egypt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reciting verses from Islam's holy book, the
former queen of Iran Friday marked the 18th anniversary of the
death of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi at his grave in Cairo.
	   Wearing a long black skirt, a black jacket and a string of
pearls, Farah Pahlavi arrived in a black Mercedes Benz at the Rifai
mosque, an 18th century mud-colored stone building, for the
one-hour ceremony. Her entourage followed in a bus.
	   The pro-U.S. shah had died on July 24, 1980 in Egypt where he
had fled after being deposed in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which
installed a clerical rule in the country.
	   Egypt cut off ties with Iran after the revolution and a
reconciliation has been hampered in part by Egypt's giving refuge
to the shah by then President Anwar Sadat, a staunch U.S. ally.
	   Recent media reports that Egypt and Iran are considering
normalization of relations had raised doubts whether the homage
ceremony for the shah will be held this year.
	   ``I am grateful to the kindness and the hospitality of both the
Egyptian government and the people for what they have done for me
and my family in times of hardship,'' Farah, 59, told The
Associated Press.
	   A little while earlier she had walked up to the grave inside a
cool, Persian-carpeted domed annex of the mosque and had held up
her hands in prayer while reciting from the Koran.
	   She laid wreaths of white lilies sent by other members of the
family, including the shah's two sons, two daughters and his twin
sister.
	   On a golden staff, next to the tomb, fluttered an old imperial
flag of Iran, displaying a shining sun and a lion on a
red-white-black background.
	   In a chamber next to the shah's tomb is the grave of King Farouk
of Egypt whose sister Fawziya was the shah's first wife.
	   Farah, who lives in France and the United States, said she is
said that her husband's remains are not buried in Iran.
	   ``But I more sad about the Iranian people,'' she said, referring
to the harsh social and political restriction imposed by Iran's
clerical government.
	   ``I know the Iranians are tired and fed-up but I am optimistic
that there are signs of change,'' said the former queen who is
better known in Iran as Shabanou, or empress.
	   Pahlavi became Iran's king in 1941 after his father, Shah Reza
Pahlavi, abdicated under British pressure.
	   A few months after fleeing to Egypt in January 1979, he went to
Panama. He returned to Egypt in March 1980 via the United States
where he was reluctantly admitted in October 1979 by then President
Jimmy Carter for cancer treatment.
	   Carter's decision triggered the occupation of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran and the taking of American hostages by militant students
_ an event that led to the severing of diplomatic ties between
Tehran and Washington.

Ford and Fiat cut back production to shrink inventories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fiat also cutting back production. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford
Motor Company and Fiat announced Friday that they would cut back
production in an effort to shrink their inventories of unsold
vehicles.
	   Ford's press office said that starting Aug. 3, the company's
assembly line in the Sao Paulo industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do
Campo will operate four days a week instead of five.
	   It said the production cut was necessary because of a sharp drop
in sales and an unsold stock of 28,000 vehicles at the factory and
dealers.
	   Union representative Joao Rodrigues de Souza said the measure,
which ``will last until the market heats up again,'' would reduce
Ford's monthly output by close to 4,000 units.
	   ``There will be no dismissals nor will wages be reduced,'' said
de Souza. ``Workers will compensate for the days not worked as soon
as sales start picking up.''
	   In a previous effort to adjust production to demand, Ford
suspended production for seven working days earlier this month, but
failed to make much of dent in its inventory.
	   As of Monday, Italian automaker Fiat will reduce its daily
output from 2,200 to 2,100 units, ``to adjust production to the
market's current situation,'' the company said in a statement.
	   Fiat said that production cut will remain in force ``until this
adjustment is completed.''
	   The company has a stock of approximately 28,000 unsold cars,
mostly at its dealership network.
	   On Thursday, the local subsidiary of Volkswagen said it will
suspend production for two days at the end of the month. The
two-day halt is expected to reduce the company's 16,000-car
inventory by about 4,000 vehicles.
	   Brazil's auto industry, which includes Ford, Fiat and General
Motors, has a stock of more than 100,000 unsold cars, according to
National Federation of Auto Distributors.
	   The auto industry's sales started dropping sharply late last
year when the government introduced a series of austerity measures
to counter the effects of the Asian crisis.
	   A steep increase in excise taxes on industrial production was
followed by an equally sharp rise in annual interest rates, which
nearly doubled to 43.5 percent.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first six months of the year
plummeted 23 percent compared to the same period in 1997, while
output decreased 15 percent, according to the National Association
of Vehicle Manufacturers.
	   This week, Sergio Reze, the federation's president, asked
Finance Ministry officials to lobby for a reduction in the excise
tax on industrial production as a way to ``reactivate the market.''
	   The excise tax on vehicles, which is paid by manufacturers, but
passed on to the consumer, ranges from 13 percent to 35 percent,
depending on model and horsepower.

First Tour de France cyclist admits to doping as drama grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying EPO found at TVM's hotel &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Armin Meier on Friday became the
first cyclist to publicly admit taking the banned
performance-enhancing substance EPO in a widening drug scandal that
is overshadowing the Tour de France.
	   Riders, meanwhile, balked at starting the 12th stage of the
competition, saying that cycling was taking a backseat to the
doping investigation. They moved into action two hours after the
official starting time.
	   Meier, a member of the disgraced Festina team expelled from the
Tour last week, said that during police questioning he had admitted
to taking EPO.
	   ``Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it,'' he told France Info radio. ``I'm just the victim of a
system.''
	   Meier refused to say if any of his teammates had also taken the
banned substance, and he criticized the police treatment of riders
during the interrogation.
	   ``I feel a little like a criminal. Each rider had two police
officers. They put me under pressure for four or five hours. They
took everything. I undressed. They could see all of me. I went into
a cell with a wooden bed.
	   ``But I feel better inside because I have told the truth.
Perhaps it is good for the sport.'' he added.
	   The Dutch TVM team is also at the center of the drug scandal.
	   The team's sporting director, Cees Priem, and the team doctor,
Andrei Mikhailov, were placed in custody Friday night after being
questioned in the southern town of Pamiers over allegations of
drug-taking by the team.
	   In a statement, prosecutor Pierre Nalbert said an investigating
judge would question them both on Monday.
	   About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a TVM team car
near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time, but the
affair rebounded in the wake of the Festina scandal that is rocking
the cycling world.
	   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said EPO
was found at the team's hotel in Pamiers during a search on
Thursday. There were no further details.

Brazil prepares to privatize telecommunications giant Telebras

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso once joked that Brazil is the only country where the head
of state can answer his telephone only to speak with a caller who
dialed another number.
	   Waiting up to 90 seconds for a dial tone is common here,
reaching the party you are calling less so _ to say nothing of the
poor quality of the lines or the high price of service.
	   Now all that may change.
	   On Wednesday, in what promises to be Latin America's largest
privatization, the government is auctioning off its controlling
stake of Telebras, the state-run telecommunications giant, at a
minimum bid of 13.5 billion reals (dlrs 11.7 billion).
	   Aside from fixing up Brazil's precarious phone system, the sale
should also go a long way toward reducing the country's budget
deficit, currently about 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   BellSouth of the United States, Telefonica SA of Spain and
Italy's Telecom Italia are among the 76 companies, pension funds
and investment groups who have signed on to bid at the July 29
auction for the government's voting shares.
	   And many here expect, the company, which is being broken up into
12 parts _ three fixed-line services, eight cellular phone
companies and one long-distance carrier _ will fetch twice that.
	   The company had a net profit of 3.9 billion reals (dlrs 3.4
billion) in 1997 and its outstanding stock is worth dlrs 40
billion.
	   ``I expect a 16 percent to 17 percent premium (above the minimum
bid) because the price the government set is already very high,''
Communications Minister Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros told
reporters Thursday. ``The biggest dispute will be for the cellular
companies where we could see a premium of as much as 100 percent
(above the minimum bid).''
	   At the Telebras auction, which is expected to last at least five
and half hours, the government will sell its 19.26 percent stake in
the company, a majority _ 51.79 percent _ of the voting shares.
	   The rest of the stock trades both in Brazil _ where it accounts
for up to 60 percent of all trading _ and on the New York Stock
Exchange _ where it is the most actively traded foreign stock.
	   With so much riding on the privatization and this being an
election year, critics are lining up to block the sale.
	   The left-wing Workers' Party and labor unions oppose the
operation and accuse the government of practically giving away the
company. Opposition presidential candidate Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da
Silva even accused Cardoso of purposely selling Telebras cheap in
order to use kickbacks to finance his re-election campaign.
	   When plans for the sale were announced last year, Telebras was
expected to sell for around dlrs 30 billion _ more than twice what
Telebras is now expected to fetch. But since then, the Asian
financial crisis has taken much of the shine away from stock in
companies in developing nations, including Telebras.
	   Cardoso has denied the charges and has even taken da Silva to
court over them.
	   Those opposing the sale are also going to court. There are
currently 40 actions filed before judges across Brazil seeking to
stop or delay the privatization.
	   The government has set up a team of 400 lawyers to undo the
injunctions as fast as they pop up.
	   ``If there's a delay it will probably be something like a week
long, and then things would go ahead,'' said Alexandre Gartner, a
telecom analyst at Banco Bozano, Simonsen. ``I don't see a delay
that could make privatization impossible.''
	   Police plan to close off the area around the Rio de Janeiro
Stock Exchange Saturday in preparation for Wednesday's auction and
have deployed 1,500 men to hold off protesters.
	   Despite the size of the privazation, the protests will probably
be smaller this time around, if only because most people are tired
of poor service and hope privatization might finally get them a
telephone.
	   At present, Telebras can't meet the demand for phones in a
country of 160 million people with only 20 million phones _ a ratio
of 11.3 phones for every 100 people. Some 18 million people are on
the waiting list.
	   If all goes as planned, the new owners of Telebras will have to
install 10 million new lines next year. By 2005, customers should
have to wait no longer than a week for their new phone to be
installed.
	   This is something Brazilians today hardly dare to dream.

Hospice for AIDS patients in Jamaica running out of money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A hospice that has provided a home for
patients dying from AIDS since 1992 is facing financial problems
and may have to close, said the hospice's director.
	   Ian McKnight, executive director of Jamaica AIDS Support, said
the hospice faces monthly bills of about US dlrs 10,000 to keep
operating. It is currently home to 16 patients.
	   ``While there is international funding for education work, and
preventative work, there is very little available for the care of
people living with HIV and AIDS,'' McKnight said Thursday.
	   Jamaica has 2,987 reported cases of AIDS among a total
population of 2.5 million, a per capita rate roughly equal to that
of the United States.

 &UR; White House protests Greek official's disparaging remark about
Clinton &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with White House reaction, recasts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Athens has formally
protested remarks by the Greek foreign minister calling President
Clinton a liar, the White House said Friday.
	   ``It was bad enough that he directed his very intemperate,
disappointing and undiplomatic remarks to the president of the
United States,'' White House press secretary Mike McCurry said when
told that he, too, had come under fire from Greek officials.
	   McCurry said U.S. ambassador Nicholas Burns verbally protested
to Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos for saying Clinton's
promises about helping resolve the Cyprus dispute were ``gross
lies.''
	   ``Those were remarks unbecoming a senior official of a close
ally of the United States,'' McCurry said. ``The remarks were
inconsistent with what are otherwise close and warm bilateral
relations we enjoy with the government of Greece. I certainly would
hope that the foreign minister would revise and extend his remarks,
because they were not appropriate.''
	   In Athens on Friday, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Pangalos was justified in his remark about Clinton because
Washington has backed away from promises to resolve the Cyprus
dispute.
	   ``Mr. (Theodoros) Pangalos said a truth,'' Reppas said. ``He
gave evidence which has historical depth. He didn't make up or
imagine things in order to make a statement.''
	   On Thursday, Pangalos described pre-election promises made by
Clinton to help solve the 24-year division of Cyprus as ``gross
lies.''
	   Clinton had said before both of his elections that Cyprus would
be among his top foreign policy priorities. Two years ago, diplomat
Richard Holbrooke, whom Clinton last month appointed U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, declared 1996 ``the year of
Cyprus.''
	   But U.S.-led efforts to solve the Cyprus problem collapsed in
May, when Turkish Cypriots insisted to Holbrooke, then a special
Cyprus envoy, that their breakaway state be recognized as a
condition for resuming U.N.-sponsored peace talks. They also
demanded cancellation of the European Union's membership talks with
Cyprus.
	   Perceptions have been growing here that the United States has
been siding with Turkey over the Cyprus dispute.
	   Reppas defended a number of anti-American statements made by
senior officials after McCurry's description Wednesday of the 1974
events on Cyprus as a ``conflict'' rather than an invasion by
Turkish forces.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey.
	   ``We believe that as a reply the statements of the Greek
officials were necessary,'' Reppas said.
	   But despite the statements, Reppas said Athens still welcomes
Washington's mediation in efforts to solve the island's problem.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reciting verses from Islam's holy book, the
former queen of Iran Friday marked the 18th anniversary of the
death of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi at his grave in Cairo.
	   Wearing a long black skirt, a black jacket and a string of
pearls, Farah Pahlavi arrived in a black Mercedes Benz at the Rifai
mosque, an 18th century mud-colored stone building, for the
one-hour ceremony. Her entourage followed in a bus.
	   The pro-U.S. shah died on July 24, 1980 at age 60 of cancer in
Egypt where he had fled after being deposed in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, which installed a clerical rule in the country.
	   Egypt cut off ties with Iran after the revolution and a
reconciliation has been hampered in part by Egypt's giving refuge
to the shah by then President Anwar Sadat, a staunch U.S. ally.
	   Recent media reports that Egypt and Iran are considering
normalization of relations had raised doubts whether the homage
ceremony for the shah will be held this year.
	   ``I am grateful to the kindness and the hospitality of both the
Egyptian government and the people for what they have done for me
and my family in times of hardship,'' Farah, 59, told The
Associated Press.
	   A little while earlier she had walked up to the grave inside a
cool, Persian-carpeted domed annex of the mosque and had held up
her hands in prayer while reciting from the Koran.
	   She laid wreaths of white lilies sent by other members of the
family, including the shah's two sons, two daughters and his twin
sister.
	   On a golden staff, next to the white-marbled tomb, fluttered an
old imperial flag of Iran, displaying a shining sun and a lion on a
red-white-black background.
	   In a chamber next to the shah's tomb is the grave of King Farouk
of Egypt whose sister Fawziya was the shah's first wife.
	   Farah, who lives in France and the United States, said she is
said that her husband's remains are not buried in Iran.
	   ``But I more sad about the Iranian people,'' she said, referring
to the harsh social and political restriction imposed by Iran's
clerical government.
	   ``I know the Iranians are tired and fed-up but I am optimistic
that there are signs of change,'' said the former queen who is
better known in Iran as Shabanou, or empress.
	   Pahlavi became Iran's king in 1941 after his father, Shah Reza
Pahlavi, abdicated under British pressure.
	   A few months after fleeing to Egypt in January 1979, he went to
Panama. He returned to Egypt in March 1980 via the United States
where he was reluctantly admitted in October 1979 by then President
Jimmy Carter for cancer treatment.
	   Carter's decision triggered the occupation of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran and the taking of American hostages by militant students
_ an event that led to the severing of diplomatic ties between
Tehran and Washington.

Cyprus denounces Demirel statement on economic integration

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus on Friday denounced a statement by
Turkey's president that the occupied north of the island would be
regarded economically as a province of Turkey.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides called on the world to
take steps to prevent such a development.
	   ``The statement by (Turkish President Suleyman) Demirel is one
more proof of Turkish intentions. The international community must
cease its caressing of Turkey and its toleration of Turkish actions
against Cyprus,'' Stylianides said.
	   Thursday in Ankara, Demirel said the economies of Turkey and the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state were heading toward integration.
	   Demirel is due to visit northern Cyprus on Saturday to take part
in weeklong celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1974
Turkish invasion.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of a coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway state
is recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish Cypriots are already part of the Turkish economy. They
use the Turkish lira and have to accept Turkey's 77 percent
inflation. Their lack of recognition impedes their ability to trade
with countries other than Turkey.
	   The Cypriot protest came as the U.S. State Department
coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, conferred separately Friday
with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders without achieving a
breakthrough in efforts to resume inter-communal peace talks.
	   ``We had good discussions. We tried to focus on the substance of
the problem,'' he said before flying to Athens for further
discussions with the Greek government.
	   He said his discussions explored ways to resume the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks and to lower tension caused by the
Cypriot government's planned deployment of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in the fall.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Turkey has vowed to prevent the deployment, expected later this
year. Greece, a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, has warned it will respond to any attack on Cyprus.

Potent South American trade bloc seeks freer trade

<TEXT>
	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) _ Six South American presidents pledged
to strengthen democracy in their ``Zone of Peace'' to pave the way
for free trade and resolved to push for full economic integration
by 2005.
	   Meeting amid snow-dusted peaks in southernmost Argentina, the
four presidents of the potent Mercosur trade bloc were joined by
Bolivian and Chilean counterparts at the one-day summit.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela also took part,
expressing interest in greater ties across the South Atlantic while
declaring that the rush toward globalization should not leave out
the poorer, less powerful nations.
	   ``Today we affirm that Mercosur is a 'Zone of Peace' and is at
peace,'' President Carlos Menem of Argentina said at a luxury hotel
on a snowy mountainside overlooking Ushuaia, the southermost city
on earth.
	   The Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and
Paraguay said peace and democracy was ``essential'' to full
economic integration, and said that their region was free of arms
of mass destruction.
	   ``The full exercise of democratic institutions is an essential
condition for the development and process of integration'' by
member nations, said the declaration, called the ``Protocol of
Ushuaia.''
	   It warned that any break in the ``democratic order'' would
constitute a grave threat to stability and could lead to expulsion
from Mercosur.
	   Bolivia and Chile also joined in the declaration as associate
members and neighbors of the trade bloc, which groups 204 million
people and economies totaling dlrs 1 trillion.
	   Mercosur has taken steps this year to free up bidding in
services and government services, but no progress was reported on
accords to open up key automobile and sugar markets.
	   Delivering the address of honor, Mandela declared that ``new
conditions today allow us to come together as neighbors across the
Atlantic.''
	   ``Finding itself at the juncture between the Indian and Atlantic
oceans, South Africa is in every sense a part of the South. Our
strategic location gives us the potential of being a bridge between
South America and Asia,'' said Mandela.
	   He praised growing trade between South Africa and the Mercosur
countries, but cautioned that free trade's benefits must alleviate
poverty in the developing world.
	   ``We cannot avoid the process of globalization. The world
politically and economically is becoming closely integrated,''
Mandela told reporters.''But globalization must not benefit the big
powers to the detriment of those who are poor or powerless.''
	   Attending the summit were presidents Menem of Argentina,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of
Paraguay and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay.
	   Neighbors Chile and Bolivia were represented by Eduardo Frei and
Hugo Banzer respectively during the daylong gathering at a hotel
perched on a mountainside above the Beagle Channel.
	   At a final news conference, Cardoso said Mercosur ``has not been
greatly affected by Asia's crisis.''
	   Menem said the crisis had not suprised the region like Mexico's
1994 peso devalution, whose so-called ``tequila effect'' dragged
down the value of Latin American stocks.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and 33 other democratic heads of
state last April vowed to expand free trade throughout the Americas
by 2005.
	   Picking up the tone of that summit, Chilean president Frei said
that the recent end of military government in the region is a
pillar to support trade expansion.
	   ``Twenty years ago, South America was a map of authoritarian
regimes. We are now a region in democracy,'' said Frei. ``We must
consolidate that opportunity'' with expanded free trade.

UN trying to negotiate return of aid groups to Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is trying to negotiate
the return of international aid organizations to the Afghan capital
and was to meet with the Taliban in Pakistan on Saturday, U.N. and
Taliban officials said Friday.
	   No immediate breakthroughs were expected from the meeting, where
U.N. officials will relay concerns about the expulsion and the
humanitarian situation in the country to the Taliban representative
in Islamabad.
	   Bronek Szynalski, the World Food Program's regional director,
was to urge the Taliban representative, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, to
readmit the groups, U.N. officials said.
	   The Taliban representative in New York, Noorullah Zadran,
expressed the religious militia's eagerness to resume talks during
a meeting Friday with the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Sergio
Vieira de Mello, de Mello said.
	   During the meeting, de Mello urged the Taliban to readmit the
aid groups and stressed the international community's concern about
the impact of the lost assistance, U.N. officials said.
	   ``Their presence in Kabul is vital,'' de Mello said in an
interview after the meeting, noting that about 75 percent of the
humanitarian aid in Kabul had been affected by the exodus.
	   About 200 international staffers from 38 aid organizations
pulled out of the Afghan capital Monday rather than obey a Taliban
order to move into war-damaged student dormitories.
	   The aid workers said they feared for their safety at the
dormitories, and didn't have the money to make extensive repairs.
	   Relations between the Taliban army and international aid groups
have been strained since 1996, when the religious militia swept
into Kabul, a city of about 750,000, and imposed its harsh version
of Islamic law.
	   The Taliban closed schools for girls and forced women off the
job. International aid workers balked at discriminatory practices
that denied women equal access to health care and education.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross weren't covered by the
edict and continue to work in Kabul, though at reduced levels.
	   Zadran said he hoped a settlement could be found. If the
negotiators truly want to help the Afghan people, they will be
``trying simply to listen if they can overcome whatever has
happened in the past two three days,'' he said in a phone
interview.
	   Zadran said he recommended that donors and representatives of
the aid organizations themselves be involved in negotiations,
rather than just the United Nations and the Taliban.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The wife of a Croatian who led a
Nazi-era concentration camp was arrested Friday following an
extradition request from Yugoslavia.
	   Nada Sakic, 76, wife of former Jasenovac concentration camp
commandant Dinko Sakic, was taken before a federal judge for
extradition hearings Friday morning, said Eduardo Musto, an
Interpol spokesman in Buenos Aires.
	   The judge ruled Sakic is to remain under house arrest.
	   Known here by her Spanish given name Esperanza, Nada Sakic is
believed to have run a female block at Jasenovac when she was only
16.
	   Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic asked for her
extradition Tuesday.
	   Dinko Sakic was extradited last month to Croatia, where he is
expected to stand trial there on charges of war crimes and crimes
against humanity.
	   Now in Zagreb's main prison, Sakic fled Croatia in 1945, when
its wartime Nazi puppet state was defeated. He lived quietly in
Santa Teresita, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the
Argentine capital, until April of this year, when he acknowledged
in an interview that he ran Jasenovac.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Some long-awaited and costly champagne
came out of storage Friday, but the service wasn't exactly elegant
_ instead of tuxedoes, the servers wore dripping frogmen suits
after salvaging the bubbly from a Baltic shipwreck.
	   The champagne, along with barrels of cognac, has been lying on
the seabed off the southwest coast of Finland since 1916, when a
German U-boat torpedoed the schooner carrying an order for the
Russian army.
	   A salvage team worked for weeks to raise the schooner, the
Joenkoeping, from 64 meters (210 feet), battling bad weather much
of the time. On Friday, the team raised the Joenkoeping (pronounced
YEUN-sheu-ping) to within 10 meters of the surface. Frogmen dove
down and gathered the champagne in baskets.
	   ``It's going very well. The sea is calm, and the divers are
bringing up the champagne quicker than we can count,'' said salvage
team member Markku Kankaristo by telephone from the diving site
near Rauma, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   According to freight documents, the Joenkoeping carried about
5,000 bottles of Hiesdieck Gout Americain champagne, 67 barrels of
cognac and 17 barrels of wine, Kankaristo said.
	   The wreck was discovered last year by a Swedish team of divers
which salvaged several hundred bottles of the champagne.
	   Along with weather problems, the salvage effort also was delayed
by a dispute over ownership. Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman
laid claim to the cargo because the company of his
great-grandfather was involved in the order.
	   Fryckman's frogmen recovered hundreds of bottles from the wreck
until a Finnish court ordered him to remove his divers and vessel
from the salvage site, allowing the Swedish-led operation to
continue until the end of the year.
	   Depending on how much of the cargo is intact, it could fetch
some dlrs 2 million at auction, experts have estimated.
	   ``It's very murky down there, and we just don't have any idea''
how much is intact, Kankaristo said. ``Also, we don't know what
condition the wine and cognac are in.''

Iranian shah's widow marks his 18th death anniversary in Egypt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reciting verses from Islam's holy book, the
former queen of Iran Friday marked the 18th anniversary of the
death of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi at his grave in Cairo.
	   Wearing a long black skirt, a black jacket and a string of
pearls, Farah Pahlavi arrived in a black Mercedes Benz at the Rifai
mosque, an 18th century mud-colored stone building, for the
one-hour ceremony. Her entourage followed in a bus.
	   The pro-U.S. shah died on July 24, 1980 at age 60 of cancer in
Egypt where he had fled after being deposed in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, which installed a clerical rule in the country.
	   Egypt cut off ties with Iran after the revolution and a
reconciliation has been hampered in part by Egypt's giving refuge
to the shah by then President Anwar Sadat, a staunch U.S. ally.
	   Recent media reports that Egypt and Iran are considering
normalization of relations had raised doubts whether the homage
ceremony for the shah will be held this year.
	   ``I am grateful to the kindness and the hospitality of both the
Egyptian government and the people for what they have done for me
and my family in times of hardship,'' Farah, 59, told The
Associated Press.
	   A little while earlier she had walked up to the grave inside a
cool, Persian-carpeted domed annex of the mosque and had held up
her hands in prayer while reciting from the Koran.
	   She laid wreaths of white lilies sent by other members of the
family, including her two sons and two daughters from the shah and
the shah's twin sister.
	   On a golden staff, next to the white-marbled tomb, fluttered an
old imperial flag of Iran, displaying a shining sun and a lion on a
red-white-black background.
	   In a chamber next to the shah's tomb is the grave of King Farouk
of Egypt whose sister Fawziya was the shah's first wife. The shah
had one daughter from Fawziya, whom he divorced in 1948. She lives
in Cairo but does not attend the death anniversary ceremonies.
	   Farah, who lives in France and the United States, said she is
sad that her husband's remains are not buried in Iran.
	   ``But I am more sad about the Iranian people,'' she said,
referring to the harsh social and political restriction imposed by
Iran's clerical government.
	   ``I know the Iranians are tired and fed-up but I am optimistic
that there are signs of change,'' said the former queen who is
better known in Iran as Shabanou, or empress.
	   Pahlavi became Iran's king in 1941 after his father, Shah Reza
Pahlavi, abdicated under British pressure.
	   A few months after fleeing to Egypt in January 1979, he went to
Panama. He returned to Egypt in March 1980 via the United States
where he was reluctantly admitted in October 1979 by then President
Jimmy Carter for cancer treatment.
	   Carter's decision triggered the occupation of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran and the taking of American hostages by militant students
_ an event that led to the severing of diplomatic ties between
Tehran and Washington.

Danish expedition sets out to find meteor on Greenland ice cap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish scientific expedition began
efforts Friday to find a huge meteor believed to have smashed into
Greenland last winter.
	   Three fishermen working off Greenland's east coast reported a
giant flash that split the darkness on Dec. 9, the same time a
parking-lot surveillance camera in Nuuk, the territory's capital on
the west coast recorded a brief illumination.
	   Experts believe it was a solid meteor, travelling at more than
12,000 kph (7,500 mph).
	   But no traces of a meteor have been found amid the
near-featureless ice cap that covers most of the Danish territory.
	   Since the initial reports, investigators have located about 100
other people who saw the flash, and by comparing their angles of
vision, have determined a likely crash site of about 120 square
kilometers (45 square miles).
	   ``So far I'm an optimist. We have not met any problems, but it
is impossible to say what chances we have,'' Bjorn Jorgensen,
coordinator of the state-funded expedition, told The Associated
Press:
	   Danish media on Friday quoted an unidentified taxi driver in
Nuuk describing the flash as ``a great fireball with a bright tail
of fire ... from which burning yellow threads stuck out, almost
like a millipede with yellow fiery legs.''

Jordan drives off without a word about new coach

<TEXT>
	   ELMHURST, Illinois (AP) _ Phil Jackson ended his tenure as coach
of the Chicago Bulls last month by riding off on his motorcycle.
Could Michael Jordan be next?
	   Jordan arrived at the summer basketball bearing his name Friday
on a cream-colored BMW motorcycle. Spotting TV cameras at the back
entrance, he zoomed to a spot in front of the building.
	   Brushing his way past reporters, he had no comment on the latest
round of the Bulls' soap opera _ the hiring of Tim Floyd as
director of basketball operations and making him the team's
coach-in-waiting.
	   Jordan has said he won't play for anyone but Jackson and he
doesn't want to play for Floyd. The Bulls _ throwing the ball back
in Jordan's court _ said they will try to get Jackson back,
although Jackson's agent says that isn't going to happen.
	   Jordan said last week he would not announce his final decision
until the NBA's lockout ends.
	   ``The golf game is good,'' was about all Jordan would mutter as
he entered the door at Elmhurst College on Friday.
	   Once inside, Jordan had the young campers enthralled. First, he
made one participant who lost his room key do 10 pushups to get it
back.
	   Then he taught those in attendance the art of free throw
shooting. He even offered a small bribe to the lucky few he called
to the line to shoot in front of the whole camp _ a new pair of

they're not here to see you guys.''

Iranian shah's widow marks his 18th death anniversary in Egypt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reciting verses from Islam's holy book, the
former queen of Iran on Friday marked the 18th anniversary of the
death of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi at his grave in Cairo.
	   Wearing a long black skirt, a black jacket and a string of
pearls, Farah Pahlavi arrived in a black Mercedes Benz at the Rifai
mosque, an 18th-century mud-colored stone building, for the
one-hour ceremony. Her entourage followed in a bus.
	   The pro-U.S. shah died of cancer July 24, 1980, at age 60 in
Egypt, where he fled after being deposed in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that installed clerical rule. Egypt, which later cut off
ties with Iran, partly hampered a reconciliation by giving refuge
to the shah. Anwar Sadat, who was Egyptian president at the time,
was a staunch U.S. ally.
	   Recent media reports that Egypt and Iran are considering
normalization of relations raised doubts whether the homage
ceremony for the shah will be held this year.
	   ``I am grateful to the kindness and the hospitality of both the
Egyptian government and the people for what they have done for me
and my family in times of hardship,'' Farah, 59, told The
Associated Press.
	   Earlier, she walked up to the grave inside a cool,
Persian-carpeted domed annex of the mosque and had held up her
hands in prayer while reciting from the Koran. She laid wreaths of
white lilies sent by other members of the family, including the
shah's two sons, two daughters and his twin sister.
	   On a golden staff, next to the white-marbled tomb, fluttered an
old imperial flag of Iran, displaying a shining sun and a lion on a
red-white-black background.
	   In a chamber next to the shah's tomb is the grave of King Farouk
of Egypt whose sister Fawziya was the shah's first wife. The shah
had one daughter with Fawziya, whom he divorced in 1948. She lives
in Cairo but does not attend the death anniversary ceremonies.
	   Farah, who lives in France and the United States, said she is
sad her husband's remains are not buried in Iran.
	   ``But I am more sad about the Iranian people,'' she said,
referring to the harsh social and political restriction imposed by
Iran's clerical government.
	   ``I know the Iranians are tired and fed-up but I am optimistic
that there are signs of change,'' said the former queen, better
known in Iran as Shabanou, or empress.
	   Pahlavi became king in 1941 after his father, Shah Reza Pahlavi,
abdicated under British pressure.
	   A few months after fleeing to Egypt in January 1979, he went to
Panama. He returned to Egypt in March 1980 via the United States,
where he was reluctantly admitted in October 1979 by then-President
Jimmy Carter for cancer treatment.
	   Carter's decision triggered the occupation of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran and the taking of American hostages by militant students
_ an event that led to the severing of diplomatic ties between
Tehran and Washington.

Car explodes at major Baghdad hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car exploded in the parking lot of a
major hotel in Baghdad Friday, the Iraqi television reported.
	   The Fiat car had been parked for 20 minutes at the Al-Rasheed
hotel when it blew up at about 9.55 p.m. (1755 gmt), the television
said quoting a government spokesman.
	   There were no injuries, it said. It was not clear if an
explosive device was planted in the car.
	   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the car
blast and no indication who could be responsible.
	   The television gave no other details and officials were not
available for comment.
	   Armed violence is extremely rare in Baghdad, mainly because of a
widespread security network that has not only kept street crime
down but has also effectively crushed all opposition activities.
	   President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Udai, was grievously
injured in an assassination attempt in December 1996 that was
claimed by two opposition groups in exile.
	   The parking area where the car exploded is about 100 meters
(yards) from the main building of the Al-Rasheed hotel, one of the
best known landmarks in Baghdad. It is used by most visiting
businessmen, diplomats and foreign government and U.N. officials,
including chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler.
	   Butler is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad on Aug. 2 to continue
talks with Iraqi officials to seek information on the country's
past program of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must eliminate
its illegal weapons program before U.N. sanctions can be lifted.
	   On Jan. 2, an unarmed rocket propelled grenade slammed into the
U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, shattering a small window but causing
no injuries.

Mexican accountant wanted in Salinas case escapes guards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ His name was on Swiss bank accounts holding
millions of dollars deposited by a president's brother. He eluded
police for two years. When he finally was arrested, a judge let him
out on bail.
	   Now Juan Gomez Gutierrez has disappeared, handing yet another
frustration to prosecutors investigating allegations of high-level
Mexican corruption, centering on Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother
of ex-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   The federal attorney general's office seemed almost in a rage
over the case on Thursday:
	   ``The law grants inexplicable and absurd facilities to suspects
so that they can flout justice,'' the agency said in a news
release.
	   It said Gomez Gutierrez apparently escaped the home of his
lawyer Monday even though it was surrounded by a dozen federal
agents. His host, prominent criminal lawyer Juan Velazquez, said he
didn't see Gomez Gutierrez leave. He himself left the country the
next day.
	   In an unusually effusive statement, federal prosecutors noted
they had argued in court that Gomez Gutierrez, who was arrested
July 15, would likely flee.
	   Nonetheless, a judge released him on bail of 600,000 pesos (dlrs
67,400).
	   Gomez Gutierrez is considered key to explaining how Raul Salinas
amassed more than dlrs 100 million in Swiss bank accounts
discovered shortly after his brother left office.
	   The former president, now living in Ireland, has not been
charged with any crimes.
	   Raul Salinas says the money was an investment fund collected
from family friends. Swiss investigators say they suspect at least
part of it was protection money paid by drug traffickers.
	   Raul Salinas has been imprisoned since 1995 on charges of
masterminding a political murder, as well as of financial crimes.
	   Mexico City newspapers reported Friday that Raul Salinas sent a
letter to the Swiss attorney general saying he used Gomez
Gutierrez's name because he didn't want to embarrass his brother.
	   ``I used false names ... because my brother was president of
Mexico, and I didn't want to involve my private activities with the
political life,'' the letter said, according to the daily La
Jornada.
	   He said witnesses who assert he accepted drug money are
unreliable because they are being protected by U.S. agencies that
are biased against him.
	   An arrest warrant was issued last week for Carlos Salinas'
former personal secretary, Justo Ceja Martinez. Prosecutors want
Ceja to explain how he came to hold large bank accounts and two
luxury homes on a monthly salary of less than 24,000 pesos (dlrs
2,700).
	   Ceja, who was in the United States before the warrant was
ordered, since has traveled to Europe, La Jornada said without
citing its sources.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The silent U.S. bats finally came to life at the
Baseball World Championships Friday, as a five-homer barrage lifted
the team to its first win, 13-6 over Taiwan.
	   After totaling just two runs in its first two games at the
tournament, the United States knocked around six different pitchers
and kept alive hopes of a quarterfinal berth.
	   Eric Munson hit two home runs and John Gall, Ryan Ludwick and
Bobby Hill had one apiece in the game at Messina, Sicily, which
pushed the Americans out of last place in Pool A. Gall also added a
single and a double.
	   Chan Chin Fen clubbed two homers for Taiwan (0-3).
	   In two games played at Palermo, Sicily, Australia (3-0) moved
atop Pool A by beating Russia 6-2, and Canada surprised South Korea
4-1.
	   Australia rocked Russian starter Andrei Bogatyev for 11 hits in
seven innings. Russia, making its debut at the championships,
dropped to 0-3.
	   David Ruhr sparked Canada (2-1) with a run-scoring triple as the
North Americans handed South Korea its first loss of the
tournament. South Korea lost to Cuba in the 1994 title game.
	   One later Pool A game was the Netherlands vs. Nicaragua. Pool B
action included five-time defending champion Cuba against host
Italy.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A veteran Brazilian Air Force
pilot was missing after his Brazilian-made AMX fighter plane
plummeted into the sea, an Air Force spokesman said Friday.
	   The source, who refused to give his name, said search crews
found the remains of the plane, which crashed about 12 p.m. local
time near an area known as Restinga da Marambaia, about 64
kilometers (40 miles) west of Rio de Janeiro.
	   The pilot, Lt. Col. Cesar Bonbonatto, 42, has been in the air
force for 26 years. He was on a routine training flight with
another aircraft.

<TEXT>
	   EDWARDSVILLE, Illinois (AP) _ Jackie Joyner-Kersee's great track
and field career has come down to one meet, one event and _ she
hopes _ one quiet celebration.
	   For all the adulation and accolades through the years,
Joyner-Kersee does not seek attention. But on Saturday night her
sport's spotlight falls on her one last time.
	   The meet, the U.S. Open at Southern Illinois-Edwardsville, is an
International Amateur Athletic Federation event, but is billed as
``Track and Field's Farewell to JJK.''
	   Seating capacity has been increased from about 3,500 to 10,000
to accommodate those who want to see Joyner-Kersee's hometown
finale.
	   Her resume includes six Olympic medals, including three golds.
She also has four world titles, four Goodwill Games championships
and 14 national events.
	   Most renowned for the heptathlon, Joyner-Kersee will be
competing only in the long jump, the event in which she once held
the world record and now is the American record-holder.
	   When the long jump is over and the meet completed, Joyner-Kersee
probably will have difficulty holding back tears, just as she did
Wednesday night at the Goodwill Games in Uniondale, New York, where
she won her final heptathlon.
	   Her husband and coach, Bob Kersee, also cried after his wife's
unexpected victory, her first heptathlon in two years, as she
fought off rust, heat, fatigue and age.
	   ``I'm going to miss track and field, the competition and the
cheers,'' Joyner-Kersee said after wiping away tears.
	   ``It's going to be tough for me, but whatever I can do to keep
track and field going strong, I'm going to do it. It may not be on
the track, but I'll be on the sidelines cheering and motivating
people. I don't have to be on the track to help the sport.''
	   Joyner-Kersee was overwhelmed by the wildly cheering crowd of
more than 10,000 at the Mitchel Athletic Complex.
	   ``It was incredible with everyone embracing me,'' she said.
``They did my heart some good.''
	   The final embrace comes Saturday night.
	   After the meet, nearby East St. Louis, where she was born 36
years ago, will honor her and her family and friends.
	   East St. Louis Mayor Gordon Bush will proclaim Jackie
Joyner-Kersee Day and present her with the key to the city. The
choir from Lincoln High, where she went to school, will perform.
The track team from the school, which closed this year despite
Joyner-Kersee's pleas, will join her on the field.
	   So will several family members, including her brother Al, the
1984 Olympic triple jump champion, and her sister-in-law, Florence
Griffith Joyner, the triple gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics and
world record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters. Local organizations
will shower her with gifts.
	   Her biggest supporter through the years has been her husband,
whom she married in 1986.
	   ``The moments of victory have been great, but watching her go
through adversity, watching her struggle through tough times and
keep that smile on her face, staying friendly, thinking positively,
remaining uplifting ... we're not losing a great athlete from track
and field, we're losing a great person,'' Kersee said. ``But I'm
glad it's over.''
	   There will be other great athletes on the field Saturday night,
including high hurdlers Allen Johnson, Mark Crear and Roger
Kingdom, shot putter John Godina, intermediate hurdlers Bryan
Bronson and Derrick Adkins, quarter-miler Butch Reynolds, sprinter
Dennis Mitchell and women's distance runners Regina Jacobs and Suzy
Hamilton. But none will compare to Joyner-Kersee.
	   ``She was one in a million,'' former heptathlete Cindy Greiner
said. ``She was like Michael Jordan. You just couldn't beat her.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexican government plane belonging to
President Ernesto Zedillo's military staff was declared missing
Friday and may have crashed in a craggy, jungle-covered mountain
region in eastern Mexico.
	   A presidential news release said the plane, a SkyVan
eight-seater, lost radio contact with its base at around 2 p.m.
Thursday around Pico de Orizaba, one of Mexico's highest peaks, in
the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz.
	   The plane was last reported 98 miles (157 kilometers) west of
the port of Veracruz, flying at approximately 15,000 feet (4,572
meters). The news release said a military pilot and copilot were on
board but did not specify if there were also passengers.
	   However, the army commander of the 5th Military Zone, which
includes Veracruz, said there were eight members of the
presidential guard along with the crew on the plane.
	   The Red Cross and search and rescue army crews were trying to
locate the missing aircraft.

Sudanese government and rebel delegations meet in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Representatives of the Sudanese government and of a
rebel force met in Italy Friday in their first face-to-face meeting
in four years, an Italian official was quoted as saying.
	   Italy's ambassador to Sudan, Claudio Pacifico, told the ANSA
news agency that the two sides met in Umbria, in central Italy,
during a conference. Previously the two sides had met in Nairobi
indirectly, using mediators.
	   No specifics of the meeting were disclosed.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting since 1983
for more autonomy for the predominantly Christian and animist south
from the Islamic north.
	   The Sudanese government is blaming the rebels for deaths from
hunger in the south.
	   A Cabinet official on Thursday said as many as 50 people are
dying every day of hunger in southern Sudan and accused the rebels
of seizing food supplies delivered to the south by international
aid organizations.
	   International aid workers have said that some of the shipments
have been burned by government-allied militias.

Two men accused of forcing young girls into prostitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Two men have been
charged with holding two girls captive and forcing them into
prostitution, prosecutor Francisco Dominguez Brito said Friday.
	   Dominguez said the two girls, between 12 and 14 years old, were
kept drugged and forced to turn over the 500 Dominican pesos to
2,000 Dominican pesos (dlrs 40 to dlrs 150 US) they earned daily to
the suspects.
	   He identified the two men arrested as Julio Perez and Amaurys
Encarnacion Castillo. The victims were not identified.
	   The arrests come at a time of increased concern over the
exploitation of minors in sex tourism. A group of legislators
recently introduced measures that would deny the right to bail to
those charged with prostituting or raping minors and would increase
the fines and jail time for the crimes.

Peru's Amazon Indians protest Shell pullout to Fujimori
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Amazon Indian leaders told President Alberto
Fujimori on Friday that the pullout of two of the world's oil
giants from a massive natural gas project in the jungle may
threaten their homeland.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell and Mobil withdrew from the dlrs 3 billion
Camisea project in the heart of the Amazon jungle on July 15,
saying they wanted greater control over gas distribution than the
government offered.
	   Fujimori, who boasted the project would finance Peru's economic
development into the next century, said he would find new corporate
partners to harvest the gas and vowed to plow ahead with the
project.
	   Indian leaders who had spent two years negotiating project
ground rules with Shell, extracting unprecedented environmental
promises, were stunned by the news and fearful the new partners
will destroy the jungle.
	   ``After hearing of Shell's decision, we fear for the future of
the region and our communities since we do not know how the new
companies are going to receive our demands,'' said a letter sent to
Fujimori and Shell by three groups representing 40 Indian
communities in the Camisea region.
	   The three Camisea gas fields, the largest natural gas reserves
in Latin America, are 350 miles (550 kms) southeast of Lima amid
some of the world's most biodiverse jungle. Primitive Indian tribes
live nearby.
	   Shell had planned to use offshore drilling technology, creating
isolated ``island'' camps in the jungle where equipment and
personnel were flown in by helicopter.
	   No roads were to be built between camps or to cities to prevent
colonizers from flooding the remote region, and workers were not to
be allowed to leave the fenced-in camps.
	   Shell had estimated Camisea would produce gas in 2001.
	   In the letter, Indian leaders demanded that the new operators
adopt similar measures.

U.S. hits five homers in 13-6 win; Cuba routs Italy 20-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The silent U.S. bats finally came to life at the
Baseball World Championships Friday, as a five-homer barrage lifted
the team to its first win, 13-6 over Taiwan.
	   Five-time defending champion Cuba put on an even more impressive
display, crushing Italy 20-0. Cuba amassed 22 hits, including six
home runs, as it won its 34th straight championships game, a streak
that dates to 1986.
	   After totaling just two runs in its first two games at the
tournament, the United States knocked around six different pitchers
and kept alive hopes of a quarterfinal berth.
	   Eric Munson hit two home runs and John Gall, Ryan Ludwick and
Bobby Hill had one apiece in the game at Messina, Sicily, which
pushed the Americans out of last place in Pool A. Gall also added a
single and a double.
	   Chan Chin Fen clubbed two homers for Taiwan (0-3).
	   At Bologna, Omar Linares had two round-trippers for Cuba, which
has won its three games here by a total margin of 48-3 and is tied
atop Pool B with Japan and the Dominican Republic, also with 3-0
records. The hosts are 1-2.
	   Japan beat South Africa 9-2 at Vicenza, while the Dominican
Republic edged Spain 8-7 at Modena. The other Pool B game saw
Panama blank China 7-0 at Rimini.
	   In games played at Palermo, Sicily, Australia (3-0) moved into
sole possession of first place in Pool A by beating Russia 6-2,
Canada surprised South Korea 4-1, and Nicaragua routed the
previously unbeaten Dutch 13-2.
	   Australia rocked Russian starter Andrei Bogatyev for 11 hits in
seven innings. Russia, making its debut at the championships,
dropped to 0-3.
	   David Ruhr sparked Canada (2-1) with a run-scoring triple as the
North Americans handed South Korea its first loss of the
tournament. South Korea was runner-up to Cuba in 1994.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ After her gymnastic training took her far from
home, Sang Lan's parents saw her less and less often _ once a month
for a while, but only three times in the last six years. Their next
visit with their only child will be in a hospital room, where she
lies paralyzed.
	   Sang Shisheng and Chen Xiufeng had turned on the television to
see their daughter compete in the Goodwill Games in New York, and
instead heard the announcer say she had been carried away on a
stretcher.
	   ``I never expected anything this terrible, not once,'' said Sang
Shisheng, her father.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, was left
paralyzed below the waist by a bad landing in a practice vault
Tuesday. She struck the mat with her head when she missed the
landing of a simple vault she has made many times. She fractured
and dislocated two neck vertebrae.
	   Sang is being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors say is her only hope of walking again. Doctors at Nassau
County Medical Center on Long Island initiated the 57-day synthetic
protein treatment Thursday night.
	   On Friday, her parents prepared for their first trip abroad _ to
her bedside. Tears rolled down Chen Xiufeng's cheeks as she thought
about her daughter's future.
	   ``I just dare not imagine it,'' she said the day before they
were to leave for New York.
	   Sang last spoke to her parents by telephone a few days before
she left for the United States.
	   Her parents said they were very proud of her accomplishments,
but also were filled with remorse about not having seen her more
often while she was growing up.
	   ``How can we ever make it up to her?'' Sang Shisheng said. ``She
was separated from her mother and father at such a young age, with
no parental love.''
	   Like most Chinese gymnasts, Sang began training very young, at
age 6. After two years in a sports school in their hometown of
Ningbo, she was accepted by another school away from home, where
her parents got to see her just once a month, her father said.
	   Six years ago, she was chosen for national team training in
Beijing, 740 miles (1,185 kilometers) from Ningbo. Since then,
parents and daughter have seen each other just three times, most
recently in October, he said.
	   ``Thinking back, I do have some regrets,'' Sang Shisheng, adding
that his wife ``doesn't want to go on living'' if their daughter's
injuries prove permanent.
	   ``The biggest worry is that they won't be able to cure her,'' he
said.
	   Vaulting accidents have cut short careers _ and lives _ in the
past. In 1988, American Julissa Gomez crashed into the vault during
a warmup at the World Sports Fair in Tokyo. She was paralyzed and
died from complications in 1991. At the 1989 world championships in
Stuttgart, Germany, Adriana Duffy of Puerto Rico crashed during
vault practice. She remains paralyzed from the waist down.
	   Yelena Mukhina of the former Soviet Union, the 1978 world
all-around champion, became a quadriplegic after she fell and broke
her neck while practicing her floor exercise on the eve of the 1980
Olympics.
	   Sang's father, asked about the experimental drug his daughter is
being treated with, said he had ``total trust'' in U.S. doctors and
was sure they would give her ``the best medicine.''
	   He and his wife are due to arrive in New York on Saturday night,
hours after planned fusion surgery to stabilize their daughter's
spine.
	   Sang's parents speak with the heavy accent of their native
Ningbo, a city near Shanghai on China's east coast. He is a housing
management officer, she works in a steel factory. Together, they
earn about dlrs 150 a month.
	   Goodwill Games officials are paying all travel expenses;
government officials in China and the United States expedited the
paperwork for their journey.
	   ``In terms of our organization, we will do all we can to make
sure that Sang Lan and her family are accommodated in the best
possible way,'' said Harvey Schiller, president of Turner Sports,
the organizers of the games.
	   Schiller, speaking Friday in New York, said top executives at
Turner Sports' parent company Time-Warner Inc., including chairman
Gerald Levin and Goodwill Games founder Ted Turner, ``are united in
support of her.''
	   ``You can be assured that the corporation, along with USA
Gymnastics and the international gymnastics federation, will do all
within our power to see that her future is secure,'' he said.

Former Jet knows what Chinese gymnast is experiencing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEMPSTEAD, New York (AP) _ Dennis Byrd sat at the New York Jets'
training camp Friday, within sight of Nassau Coliseum, where
Chinese gymnast Sang Lan was paralyzed in a practice fall. Byrd
knew exactly what the 17-year-old Goodwill Games athlete was going
through.
	   Nearly six years ago, Byrd collided with teammate Scott
Mersereau in a National Football League game and was temporarily
paralyzed with a fractured vertebra. While he has made a recovery
that was termed ``miraculous'' by many standards, Byrd never played
football again.
	   But at least he can walk and fish and hunt and play with his
children. Doctors say Sang is unlikely to ever walk again.
	   Byrd spent 90 minutes meeting with Sang at Nassau County Medical
Center, speaking to her through an interpreter. Sang is being
treated with SYGEN, an experimental drug that helped Byrd recover
so well.
	   ``I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to take GM1,'' Byrd
said, referring to another name for SYGEN, which helps regenerate
the nerve endings in the spinal column. ``It is very encouraging. I
had a very severe injury and certainly think SYGEN played a role in
my recovery.
	   ``Doctors are characteristically stoic about those things. I'm
glad to see she is on that treatment so quickly.''
	   Byrd had been invited to visit Sang and was accompanied by Zhao
Yuxin, the vice president of the Chinese Gymnastic Association and
secretary general of the Chinese Sports Acrobatics Association.
	   ``It is an emotional time anytime you visit people who have
undergone something so traumatic,'' Byrd said.
	   ``This morning's news was the first time I was able to see
anything of substance about the young lady,'' said Byrd, now an
advocate for spinal paralysis research and treatment. ``I try to
help out however I can.''

Surprising speeds don't upset CART drivers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Don't be confused by all those guys
over 230 mph (370 kmph) on Friday at Michigan Speedway. The
Handford Device, intended to slow the Indy cars, is working.
	   ``The new rules are great,'' said Michael Andretti, a two-time
winner on the 2-mile (3.2-kilometer), high-banked oval. ``The car
feels really good in traffic and really good by itself. If we
didn't have the Handford Device, who knows how fast we'd be
going.''
	   The device is a big, boxy rear wing, devised by Swift
Engineering chief designer Mark Handford to create additional drag
on the cars, thereby slowing them and making them tougher to drive
through the turns.
	   After testing, initial estimates were that the wing slowed the
cars by about 10-15 mph (16-24 kmph) from last year at Michigan and
sister track California Speedway. That's what made the speeds so
surprising in the opening practice sessions for Sunday's U.S. 500.
	   Adrian Fernandez, a winner earlier this year on the 1 1/2-mile
(2 1/2-kilometer) oval at Motegi, Japan, led the way with a lap of
232.004 mph (371.206 kmph).
	   Andretti, winner on the 1 1/2-mile (2 1/2-kilometer) oval at
Homestead in the season opener, followed at 231.051 mph (369.682
kmph). Scott Pruett won last year's U.S. 500 pole with a lap of
233.857 mph (374.171 kmph).
	   Eight drivers, including defending race champion Alex Zanardi,
were above 230 mph (368 kmph) on Friday. Nineteen drivers in 27
cars, including backups, were within 1 second of the top at the end
of the day.
	   Zanardi is going for a record-breaking fifth straight victory
this week. However, of his six victories in 11 races this season,
only one _ on the 1.27-mile (2.03-km) track at Madison, Illinois _
has come on an oval.
	   ``I am happy with what we accomplished today,'' Zanardi said.
``These cars can punch such a hole that you can hit a draft and
pick up 2 miles an hour. That can put you from 20th to first in an
instant.''
	   Andretti said nobody should be panicked by the big numbers.
	   ``I think when we get out there by ourselves (on Saturday in
qualifying), I don't think we'll be running these speeds,'' he
said. ``The pole could be 4 or 5 mph slower than today.''
	   Bobby Rahal, who was fifth on Friday at 230.407, said, ``I ran
about 226 by myself. That shows what the draft does to the cars.
	   ``Drafting is just unbelievable. You can be in turn four and
pick up a draft from a car entering turn one. It's like you're in a
big bowl sometimes.''
	   Speculation heading into the opening of practice was that the
cars, with the new aerodynamic device, were going to be a handful
to drive, particularly with other cars around, because of the big
hole they'd be cutting in the air.
	   ``It's not as bad as they told me,'' Fernandez said. ``On our
own, it feels pretty good. In traffic, you have to be a little more
careful. If somebody gets in front of you, they cut a big hole and
it takes a little longer to get back up to speed.''
	   Paul Tracy, who was third at 230.769 mph (369.230 kmph), noted
that it's a constant battle between the teams and the rulesmakers,
with one trying to find more speed and the other trying to slow the
cars, or at least hold the line.
	   Despite the sizzling speeds and the uncertainty about the
stability of the cars, the only crash in 3 hours and 15 minutes on
the track, including 45 minutes for rookies, came in the final
minute of the afternoon session.
	   Robby Gordon escaped injury when he crashed hard in the second
turn. He immediately climbed out of the car, sat on the wall at the
top of the banking and waved to the crowd. CART officials then
decided to forego the final minute of practice.

Suspected Basque militant says he'll seek asylum in third country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ A suspected Basque militant fighting
extradition to Spain said Friday that he will ask the Mexican
government to help negotiate asylum for him in a third country.
	   Mexican authorities arrested Oscar Cadenas Lorente in December
1996 on a Spanish request and is being held in a maximum-security
prison west of Mexico City. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling on his
request for an injunction against the extradition.
	   In a telephone interview, Cadenas said he fears he would suffer
physical and psychological torture in Spain, ``what's more, there
is no guarantee that my life could be respected.''
	   Cadenas, who is married to a Mexican citizen, allegedly is a
militant in the ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
which began a violent campaign for independence in northern Spain
in 1968.

Milbrett and soccer teammates look for home field advantage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Tiffeny Milbrett remembers the
gold-medal-winning shot very well.
	   After a setup pass from Mia Hamm, Milbrett scored to give the
U.S. women's soccer team a 2-1 victory over China in the 1996
Olympic final and send the crowd of 78,000 fans in Athens, Georgia
wild.
	   ``I didn't hear the crowd at all,'' Milbrett said. ``I was just
focused on putting that ball in the back of that net.''
	   Not as many will be cheering, but the world powers in women's
soccer are meeting again, this time at the 12,000-seat Mitchel
Field in Long Island when the U.S. team plays Denmark Saturday in
the debut of soccer at the Goodwill Games.
	   China plays Norway, the defending World Cup champion, in the
other semifinal. The winners will play in the gold-medal game
Monday night.
	   Milbrett and her teammates will put their 36-match domestic
winning streak on the line against Denmark. They are glad to be on
American soil after swings in China, Portugal and Japan this
season.
	   ``We know how amazing the crowd can be (at home),'' Milbrett
said. ``(In Atlanta), the crowd gave spark and energy like a 12th
man. We're proud and eager to play in front of our fans.''
	   Hamm, who leads the U.S. team with 11 goals and 13 assists in 17
games this season, is back to full strength after missing three
games in May because of a hamstring injury. Milbrett is close
behind with eight goals.
	   Both the United States and Norway have World Cup titles, the
Americans winning the first title in 1991 and Norway winning four
years later.
	   The United States will host the 1999 World Cup, with the opening
games and opening ceremonies at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford,
New Jersey.
	   ``It's a tuneup for next year's World Cup,'' U.S. coach Tony
DiCicco said. ``Norway, China and Denmark will all be in that
field. We're excited because it gives us a chance to test ourselves
against the best.''
	   The United States is 5-3-1 all-time against the Danes, 9-11-1
over 11 years against Norway and 10-3-4 against China.
	   In their last meeting, the United States beat Denmark 3-0 in the
first round of the 1996 Olympics. Since then, the Danes have added
new players to the roster.
	   ``We don't know their personnel as well as we'd like to,''
Milbrett, said. ``That's our biggest concern.''
	   The other challenge is potentially facing Norway, which handed
the U.S. women their worst loss in their 13-year history, 4-1, last
March in Portugal.
	   ``Norway is our archrival,'' Milbrett said. ``I don't know if
anybody on either team likes each other. Everybody looks to knock
off No. 1.''
	   The U.S beat Norway 2-1 in overtime to advance to the gold-medal
game in Atlanta. The Americans beat the Norwegians 3-0 in January
and took the defending world champions too lightly two months
later.
	   ``We went into the game too confident,'' DiCicco said. ``All we
can do is take from it what we can and learn from it.''

Spanish Supreme Court denies dirty war verdict reached
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's highest court on Friday denied
reports that it convicted 12 people, including a former government
minister, of taking part in a kidnapping linked to Spain's alleged
``dirty war'' on Basque separatists.
	   Spanish newspapers reported Thursday, in what they described as
a leaked verdict, that the Supreme Court convicted former Interior
Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo and 11 others of abducting French
businessman Segundo Marey in 1983.
	   But in a statement released Friday, Judge Jose Jimenez Villarejo
said there had been no verdicts. The court has ordered an
investigation into the supposed leak.
	   If the defendants are convicted, the verdict would shore up
widespread allegations that the government of former Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez set up and ran death squads, called Anti-Terrorist
Liberation Groups, known by their Spanish initials GAL.
	   The groups killed 27 people between 1983 and 1987 in a campaign
against the armed Basque separatist group ETA. Eight victims proved
to have no ties to ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people since
1968 in its campaign for Basque independence.
	   The GAL scandal led directly to the defeat of Gonzalez's
Socialist Party in general elections two years ago, after nearly 14
years in office.
	   Most politicians have followed Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's
refusal to comment on the verdict until it is officially released,
although some called on Gonzalez to take responsibility and retire
from politics.
	   A guilty verdict would almost certainly affect the international
status enjoyed by Gonzalez _ one of Spain's most respected
politicians ever.
	   The former premier is the choice of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate the Kosovo conflict.
He also is a possible candidate for president of the European
Commission.
	   Gonzalez has not commented on the reported verdict. In court as
a witness, he denied all involvement of his government and said the
trial was part of a plot to damage him and his party.
	   News reports Thursday said Barrionuevo and Rafael Vera, former
secretary of state for security, would receive sentences of 13
years. Both had pleaded innocent during the 22-day trial that ended
July 14.
	   The remaining defendants _ who all admitted guilt _ would get
lesser jail terms, newspapers reported.
	   Marey's abduction was considered GAL's first operation. He was
released after 10 days, when his kidnappers realized they had
abducted the wrong man.
	   The daily El Pais reported Thursday the court would officially
announce the verdicts next week.

New leader of Japan's ruling party faces uphill fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Japan-Politics
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Supporters cracked open a barrel of sake and the
victor raised his arms in triumph to chants of ``banzai.''
	   For Keizo Obuchi, the celebrating won't last long. After being
elected Friday as president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, he is virtually assured of becoming prime minister _ and
inheriting the woes of a country battling economic malaise and
political upheaval.
	   Even in the euphoria of winning, Obuchi grimly acknowledged that
solving Japan's problems would be an uphill fight.
	   ``In a way, I think this is a start from zero,'' he said.
``Starting from the bottom point, I must make progress.''
	   At the top of Obuchi's list of troubles is the economy.
	   Bad financial news seems to break every day in Japan. On
Thursday, U.S. credit rating service Moody's announced it may
downgrade its rating on the government debt _ a move that could
further hobble Japanese finances.
	   Obuchi has already promised to pump some juice back into the
economy to salvage it from its worst recession since World War II.
His ideas include 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43 billion) in income cuts
and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71 billion) worth of new public works
spending.
	   Even if these work, there will be a number of other problems
awaiting.
	   There is Japan's ballooning national debt and the plague of bad
loans, which have undermined confidence in the financial system and
absorbed badly needed funds from being more productively spent on
new investment.
	   Then there's the question of Obuchi's party.
	   The LDP is suffering one of its toughest periods in its 43-year
history. It is widely blamed for mismanaging the economy. Voters on
July 12 dealt it a stunning blow in elections for the upper house
of Parliament.
	   Now a band of dissident lawmakers in the party are trying to
break the grip of the old guard in a push to win wider public
support. They are threatening to defect or abstain from the
Parliament vote for prime minister.
	   The upstarts don't threaten to derail Obuchi's march to the
premiership, but the dissent undercuts his ability to implement his
policies and creates the image of a fractured party ill-equipped to
confront the country's economic difficulties.
	   His party's weakness also saps its ability to defend against
attacks by the emboldened opposition, which called Friday for
dissolving the Parliament and having elections _ a move that would
jeopardize the LDP's control over the powerful lower house.
	   But some are optimistic that Obuchi and his party feel the
pressure and will respond.
	   ``The LDP can act decisively. It can't afford not to,'' said
Pelham Smithers, a strategist for ING Baring Securities (Japan)
Ltd.
	   Still, Obuchi himself is not popular. Opinion polls going into
Friday's vote showed him lagging far behind his opponents.

U.S. diver wins bronze behind Chinese 1-2 finish

 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Mark Ruiz thought he was in water
over his head against the dominating Chinese divers. He fell short
in the Goodwill Games 1-meter springboard, but not by nearly as
much as he expected.
	   Ruiz, already the best U.S. platform diver at 19, made his first
big splash off the springboard Friday, winning the bronze medal
behind a pair of Chinese men and ahead of an onrushing German.
	   Ruiz, who moved to Orlando, Florida from Puerto Rico six years
ago, was in third place after all six rounds, but he said he no
clue of his standing.
	   ``I don't ever look at the scoreboard,'' he said. ``I thought I
was fourth. All I do is concentrate on my own dives.''
	   If Ruiz had been paying attention, he would have seen Andreas
Wels of Germany scoring 72.00 and 73.47 points on his last two
dives with a string of 8.0 and 8.5 scores, putting the pressure on
Ruiz.
	   But Ruiz nailed his last dive, a reverse 2 1/2 somersault with a
half-twist, scoring 74.40 points to finish with 395.52, just 2.28
ahead of Wels.
	   Zhou Yilin of China was first after each of the first five
dives, but a superb final dive gave world champion Yu Zhoucheng the
gold with 426.24 points, just ahead of Zhou's 421.86.
	   Ruiz was first in this year's national championships and first
in the World Championships trials in platform last year before
finishing sixth in the world meet. He didn't qualify for either the
1- or 3-meter springboard events.
	   ``I wasn't really a serious springboard diver until this year,''
he said. ``Over the past year, I've done so much better in the
springboard, so that now I'm diving consistently. I plan to
continue training in all three events.''
	   America's other teen-age diving hope, Troy Dumais, was fifth
after three dives before scores of 31.62 and 31.50 in the fourth
and fifth rounds. Dumais, 18, second in the 1-meter at this year's
world championships, fell to 10th in the 12-man field.
	   ``I didn't have the confidence in myself to do the dives I
normally do,'' Dumais said. ``I was thinking stupid thoughts,
thinking too much, second-guessing myself.''
	   Dumais said Ruiz was not really far behind the two Chinese men.
	   ``They're dominant because they're consistent,'' he said. ``They
believe they're the best. They are so mentally sound. But if Mark
had hit two dives that he had 6.5s on, he would've won. He was only
25 or 30 points behind.''
	   Brian Gillooly of Kissimmee, Florida was fifth with 367.77
points.
	   The world's top-rated men's beach volleyball team reached the
medal round, thanks to a big comeback.
	   Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira of Brazil rallied from a 6-0
deficit to finish the preliminary rounds unbeaten with a 15-11
victory over Canada's John Child and Mark Heese Friday. Ferreira
had seven blocks, and Brazil scored the last five points.
	   ``After 6-0, we still keep our minds concentrating,'' Marques
said. ``We changed our game. I did some jump serves and para made
some good blocks. After 6-0, if you lose your mind, you will lose
15-0.''
	   Marques and Ferreira won their first two matches by a combined
score of 30-5.
	   Also advancing to Saturday's semifinals were Julien Prosser and
Leo Zahner of Australia, who beat Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez
of Argentina 15-7. A 9-point run gave the Australians a 12-4 lead.
It was the first loss in three matches for the Argentines.
	   The figure skating competition doesn't start for another five
days, but it lost a big name Friday when former U.S. national
champion Nicole Bobek withdrew. Bobek said she neeed more time to
recuperate from a nagging injury and to get reacquainted with coach
Richard Callaghan.

Britain's major museums

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Culture Minister Chris Smith said Friday that the
government will increase state funding for the arts, and restore
free entry to Britain's 11 most important state-owned museums and
art galleries by 2001.
	   Smith said 100 million pounds (dlrs 160 million) would be
offered to the museums and galleries, allowing them to stop
charging visitors for entry. Currently only four, the British
Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and the National
Portrait Gallery have free entry for all.
	   Smith said the money would be part of a 290 million (dlrs 460
million) increase in public subsidy for arts and culture over the
next three years.

Pak's giant eagle gives her share of first-round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's first round &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ Rookie sensation Se Ri Pak capped a late
surge with an eagle on the final hole to grab a share of the lead
after Friday's opening round of the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
	   Winner of two majors already, Pak tuned up for next week's final
grand slam event, the du Maurier, by putting together five birdies
and an eagle for a 7-under-par 65.
	   She shared the lead with defending champion Tammie Green, who is
four months pregnant, along with Alicia Dibos and Becky Iverson.
	   Pak relied on her marksmanship with her irons to close with a
flurry. She hit a 6-iron to six feet on the par-3 16th, then
dropped an 8-iron at No. 17 just three feet (0.9 meters) from the
cup.
	   At the easily reachable 451-yard (410-meter), par-5 closing
hole, she followed a long drive with a 5-iron from 176 yards (160
meters) that wound up seven feet from the hole. Pak then rolled in
the eagle putt to the delight of a large crowd circling the 18th
green.
	   The 20-year-old bettered her acclaimed playing partners. Annika
Sorenstam and Karrie Webb. In what was called a dream grouping,
Sorenstam shot a 2-under 70 and Webb finished at even-par 72 at
Avalon Lakes Golf Course.
	   Moments before Pak's eagle, Green two-putted from the front edge
of the final green for a birdie that capped her 65. Last year's
winner in a playoff with Laura Davies had five birdies on the front
side and added two on the back.
	   Dibos, a non-winner in six years on tour, played in the same
group with Green. She also had five birdies on the front _ on the
same holes Green birdied _ and two on the back.
	   She found a fairway sand bunker off the last tee, blasted out to
60 yards (55 meters) short of the green and chipped to seven feet
before hitting the birdie putt.
	   Iverson, a fifth-year pro who won the 1995 Friendly's Classic,
took advantage of ideal conditions. She was in the second group off
the tee at 7:40 a.m. and had eight birdies on a layout softened by
heavy rain earlier in the week.
	   Iverson made the turn at 2-under after holing a 20-foot
(6-meter) sand wedge, then birdied four of her last five holes.
	   Two shots back after 67s were Leta Lindley, Kris Tschetter,
Michele Redman and Dottie Pepper.
	   Robin Walton aced the 165-yard (150-meter) 16th hole with a
6-iron on her way to a 69, while 1993 Giant Eagle winner Nancy
Lopez had difficulty with her putting in a 72.

	   ELMHURST, Illinois (AP) _ Phil Jackson ended his tenure as coach
of the Chicago Bulls last month by riding off on his motorcycle.
Could Michael Jordan be next?
	   Jordan arrived at the summer basketball camp bearing his name
Friday on a cream-colored BMW motorcycle. Spotting TV cameras at
the back entrance, he zoomed to a spot in front of the building.
	   Brushing his way past reporters, he had no comment on the latest
round of the Bulls' soap opera _ the hiring of Tim Floyd as
director of basketball operations and making him the team's
coach-in-waiting.
	   Jordan has said he won't play for anyone but Jackson and he
doesn't want to play for Floyd. The Bulls _ throwing the ball back
in Jordan's court _ said they will try to get Jackson back,
although Jackson's agent says that isn't going to happen.
	   Jordan said last week he would not announce his final decision
until the NBA's lockout ends.
	   ``The golf game is good,'' was about all Jordan would mutter as
he entered the door at Elmhurst College on Friday.
	   Once inside, Jordan had the young campers enthralled. First, he
made one participant who lost his room key do 10 pushups to get it
back.
	   Then he taught those in attendance the art of free throw
shooting. He even offered a small bribe to the lucky few he called
to the line to shoot in front of the whole camp _ a new pair of
shoes if they made it.
	   ``Don't mind all the cameras,'' he told campers as flashbulbs
from photographers and fans went off all over the gym. ``I'm sure
they're not here to see you guys.''

Floyd shoots another 70 in U.S. Senior Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's play &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Overjoyed with another 70 in the U.S. Senior
Open, Raymond Floyd said he'd gladly take two more.
	   Floyd, in search of his first Senior Open championship, took a
two-shot lead midway through Friday's second round of the
tournament by carding his second straight 1-under-par 70 for a
36-hole score of 140.
	   ``In a minute,'' Floyd quickly replied when asked if he would be
satisfied to repeat on Saturday and Sunday what he accomplished
Thursday and Friday.
	   ``You bet I'm pleased,'' he said. ``I hit a lot of fairways
today, I hit a lot of solid shots. I might have even played better
today than I played yesterday.''
	   Floyd's first-round performance over the par-71 Riviera course
was the only under-par score of the day, and it gave him a one-shot
lead over five golfers.
	   Two of those five _ Bruce Summerhays and club pro Roy Vucinich _
each shot even-par 71 for the second straight day on Friday, giving
them 142 totals.
	   Summerhays would have fared even better had he not bogeyed the
final three holes, but he wasn't dismayed. ``Even-par after two
rounds on this golf course is great. I'm not going to dwell on
it.''
	   The scores midway through the second round were a bit lower than
Thursday, when the average for the 155 competitors was 78.903 _ the
highest first-round average in the history of seniors golf.
	   The field was to be cut to the low 60 and ties along with anyone
within 10 shots of the lead at the conclusion of Friday's round.
The 72-hole tournament continues Saturday and finishes Sunday.
	   Dave Stockton, who played in the same threesome with Floyd, had
a second-round 70 for a 36-hole total of 143. It was only the third
below-par round of the tournament, with the other two belonging to
Floyd.
	   Gibby Gilbert shot his second consecutive 72 to put him at 144.
Gil Morgan, one of the pre-tournament favorites, was next at 145
after also shooting a 72 on Friday.
	   Among the late starters were Hugh Baiocchi, Bob Murphy and Jay
Sigel, all of whom had 71s in the first round.
	   Other late starters were Isao Aoki, Ed Dougherty and Brian
Barnes, who carded 72s on Thursday; Jack Nicklaus, who opened with
a 74 despite soreness in his arthritic left hip; and senior tour
earnings leader Hale Irwin, whose 77 on Thursday was his worst
round of the year.
	   Morgan, second on the earnings list, has won two of the three
previous senior majors and is trying to become the second senior to
win three majors in a year. Nicklaus, now 58, accomplished the feat
in 1991.
	   Floyd, 55, who ranks 16th on the senior tour earnings list with
dlrs 471,692, shot a 70 in the first round thanks mainly to birdies
on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes.
	   He also birdied the 15th and 16th holes on Friday, and would
have repeated his trifecta had he not missed a 5-foot putt for
birdie on 17.
	   ``Raymond's had phenomenal finishes coming in both days,''
Stockton said.
	   ``Fortunately, I've played pretty close to my game plan,'' said
Floyd, who is shooting for his first tournament victory since the
1996 Ford Senior Players Championship. ``I'm very comfortable, I've
been hitting the ball solid. You have to put your ball on the
green.''
	   Floyd said he could have scored even better in the first two
rounds, but didn't because of his putting. However, he stressed he
was quite pleased with what's happened so far.
	   ``We all must remember that par is a fantastic score on each and
every hole in a U.S. Open,'' said Floyd, who had three birdies, two
bogeys and 13 pars in the second round.

<TEXT>
	   SUTTON, Massachusetts (AP) _ It isn't enough for Paul Azinger
and Fuzzy Zoeller to have their names in the Pleasant Valley
Country Club Hall of Honor. They also want to take some of the
course's money.
	   Azinger and Zoeller each shot 6-under-par 65s on Friday to
improve to minus-9 after two rounds of the final CVS Charity
Classic. That put them one stroke behind leader Mike Springer in
pursuit of the dlrs 270,000 first prize. Springer shot a 67 for
132.
	   ``There's a reason that we're regulars,'' Azinger said. ``We all
love this golf course.''
	   First-round co-leader Willie Wood shot a 69 Friday to head into
the weekend tied with Azinger and Zoeller at 9-under 133. Lee
Rinker birdied his 17th hole and eagled his 18th to complete a 67
that pull him into a tie with Nolan Henke at 134, two strokes back.
Henke shot a 65 Friday.
	   Brad Faxon (67), Dave Stockton Jr. (68) and Steve Pate (65) were
at 135, three strokes back.
	   Seventy-nine of the 158 starters made the cut at 1-under after
two rounds on the par-71 Pleasant Valley course in the final
edition of a tournament that dates to 1965.
	   The event will be replaced next year by an LPGA tournament, in
part because of its troubles in finding a desirable spot on the PGA
schedule. This year, for example, many of the top names are staying
away to rest after last week's British Open.
	   ``There's never a good field here, or so you say,'' Azinger
said. ``But there's a reason: They've never had a good date.''
	   That's what makes the event's organizers so grateful that
Zoeller and Azinger keep showing up.
	   ``Fuzzy adds an awful lot to the event by playing in it,''
tournament general chairman Ted Mingolla said. ``He's very loyal.
If he misses a year or two, he's sure to come back.''
	   Azinger, who won the tournament in 1993, was rewarded with a
spot in the Hall of Honor in 1994. He's looking to become the first
two-time winner in the event's history.
	   Zoeller, who has finished second and third here, became the 14th
Hall of Honor inductee on Wednesday night. ``My name is in the Zs
and it took a while to get down the line,'' he joked.
	   Like Azinger, Zoeller said it was be meaningful to win the last
event at Pleasant Valley. But the golfer who hasn't won a
tournament since 1986 said he didn't need to win to make the week a
success.
	   ``I win every day,'' he said. ``I'm the luckiest guy in the
world. I've had two back surgeries and walked away from both of
them.''
	   Zoeller was among the 60 golfers forced to finish the first
round Friday morning because of foul weather that caused a 3-hour,
42-minute delay on Thursday. He had two holes to play, and birdied
No. 18 to drop to minus-3.
	   After a break for breakfast, Zoeller played a bogey-free second
round with six birdies. Azinger had eight birdies and two bogeys,
missing a putt for eagle on the 18th by ``half a roll.''
	   P.H. Horgan III and Wood, who were also among those left on the
course when play was suspended Thursday night, were the first-round
leaders at minus-7. Springer was at 65 and Steve Flesch shot 66.
	   Horgan soon dropped off the leaderboard and finished the day
minus-6 after a 72. ood twice flirted with 10-under on the front
nine, then bogeyed Nos. 11 and 12 before a birdie at 17 to finish
at minus-9.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Armando Reynoso allowed five hits over eight
innings in his first appearance in a year and Brian McRae had three
hits to lead the New York Mets to a 5-0 victory Friday over the
Chicago Cubs in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   The win was New York's fifth straight, while the Cubs saw their
winning streak snapped at five.
	   Reynoso (1-0), who left his last start July 16, 1997, against
the Cubs with tendinitis of the right shoulder, struck out three
and walked two. He was coming off two operations, one on his elbow
and one on his shoulder.
	   New York pitchers have combined for 13 shutouts, the most in the
major leagues. It was the Mets fourth shutout in their last six
games.

Lawsuit filed against agent Joe Cubas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A federal lawsuit accuses baseball agent Joe Cubas
of violating a contract involving the representation of Cuban
defector Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who now pitches for the
New York Yankees.
	   Thomas Cronin of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, accuses Cubas of
reneging on an agreement to pay him one-third of his commission for
Hernandez's dlrs 6.6 million contract.
	   Hernandez confided to Cronin about wanting to defect, according
to the lawsuit. Cronin says he met with Cubas and they drafted a
contract agreeing to share the commission when Hernandez signed
with a major-league team. Cronin then recommended to Hernandez that
he hire Cubas.
	   The dispute became public this week as Cubas spearheads a bid to
buy the Florida Marlins from Wayne Huizenga.
	   ``The allegations are totally unfounded, and we question the
timing of Mr. Cronin's filing of the lawsuit,'' said Cubas
spokesman Rene Guim. ``Mr. Cronin had absolutely nothing to do with
Orlando Hernandez signing with Joe and having Joe represent him.
That will be proven in court.''

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A gunman burst through security barriers at
the U.S. Capitol, killing two Capitol police officers in a furious
exchange of gunfire. The suspected gunman, identified as a past
threat to President Bill Clinton, was shot and captured Friday. A
female tourist was seriously wounded. A U.S. law enforcement
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the gunman
turned up on a Secret Service computer list ``as sort of a
low-level threat'' to the president. A second official said that
based on preliminary work, authorities believe the suspect,
identified as a 42-year white man from the Midwest, was acting
alone when he invaded the tourist-filled Capitol. Sources
identified the suspect as Russell Eugene Weston, formerly of
Vallmire, Illinois, now of Montana. (US-CAPITAL SHOTS)
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Talks with Israel can resume on minor
disputes but not on the crucial issue of withdrawing more Israeli
troops from the West Bank, the chief Palestinian negotiator said.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat suggested earlier Friday that
contacts between the two sides would intensify. Chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat, however, was quick to lower expectations. He said
renewed talks would cover unresolved issues stemming from the
interim peace accords, such as creating a land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the release
of Palestinian prisoners. Erekat said there was no point in holding
more discussions on the scope of the troop pullback because the
Palestinians already have accepted a U.S. plan for an Israeli
withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Attackers firing automatic weapons and
swinging machetes killed more than 100 villagers in a
diamond-mining region in northeast Angola, according to reports.
Survivors accused the former rebel movement UNITA of the massacre,
according to reports Friday. The Luanda-based United Nations
mission overseeing Angola's peace process said its staff in Lunda
Norte province reported that local police said 110 villagers were
massacred and more than 80 were wounded Tuesday night. Survivors
interviewed by Angolan media alleged the attackers were from UNITA,
the former guerilla group that signed a peace pact with the
government in 1994 to end a two-decade civil war. UNITA was
supposed to demobilize its 70,000-strong guerrilla army under the
U.N.-brokered peace deal, but the government claims it still has
armed men hidden in the bush of this vast southwest African
country. (ANGOLA-MASSACRE)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Despite a letter-writing campaign by
high school students, one of Germany's biggest construction
companies has refused to compensate World War II-era slave laborers
who helped build an airstrip for the company. The chief of Zueblin
construction firm, Manfred Nussbaumer, said Friday that his company
merely supervised the construction near Frankfurt, and that the
slave laborers technically worked for a Nazi SS agency. ``We see no
need to pay compensation,'' Nussbaumer said in Stuttgart, adding
that the company acknowledges no guilt. His comments came in
response to a campaign by a high school class and the town council
in Moerfelden-Walldorf, a Frankfurt suburb, to get compensation for
1,700 women, mostly Hungarian Jews, who were forced to build an
airstrip during World War II. (GERMANY-SLAVE WORKERS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With smoking banned on flights within U.S.
borders, the U.S. Senate is now trying to prohibit it on
international flights, upsetting foreign airlines. ``This is good
politics in the United States because there is a strong
anti-smoking lobby,'' Wanda Potrykus, spokeswoman for the
Montreal-based International Air Transport Association, said
Friday. ``However, there is an equally virulent pro-smoking lobby
in Asia and France.'' In a late-night voice vote Thursday, the
Senate added an amendment to a dlrs 47.1 billion transportation
spending bill that would ban smoking on international flights
arriving and departing at U.S. airports. (US-SMOKING BAN)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were mixed Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average barely halting a four-session, 400-point losing
streak dominated by profit warnings from major companies. The Dow,
which slid 195 points on Thursday, closed 4 points higher at 9,837
after swinging from an early 65-point gain to a 70-point loss that
put the blue-chip measure below 8,900 for the first time in a
month. Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq market finishing lower and declining issues
outnumbering advancers overall. The Dow, which closed at a record
9,337.97 just a week ago on Friday, has been hammered this week
amid signs of earnings trouble at four of the 30 companies that
comprise the index: Merck, Hewlett-Packard, DuPont and Boeing.

	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) _ Six South American presidents pledged
to strengthen democracy in their ``Zone of Peace'' to pave the way
for free trade and resolved to push for full economic integration
by 2005. Mercosur countries Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay
said peace and democracy was ``essential'' to full economic
integration. Neighbors Bolivia and Chile also joined in the
declaration of the trade bloc, which groups 204 million people and
economies totaling dlrs 1 trillion. At the gathering in Tierra del
Fuego, South African President Nelson Mandela expressed interest in
greater ties across the South Atlantic, and asked that the rush
toward globalization not leave out poorer, less powerful nations.
Mercosur has taken steps this year to free up bidding in services
and government services, but no progress was reported on accords to
open up key automobile and sugar markets. (ARGENTINA-MERCOSUR
SUMMIT)
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ France Telecom won a Friday
auction to buy 51 percent of the Salvadoran national telephone
company, known as ANTEL. It bid dlrs 275 million, outbidding
Mexico's Telmex by dlrs 4 million. ANTEL's cellular division was
split off earlier and a controlling interest was sold last week to
a Spanish company. Under the sale plan, 25 percent of the company
would be held by the state, 14 percent sold on the local stock
market and 10 percent would go to employees. However the employees'
group purchased only 6.5 percent for dlrs 34.5 million. The
remaining 3.5 percent is to be added to the shares sold on the
local stock market. ANTEL president Juan Jose Daboub said the
French company was to invest between dlrs 400 million and dlrs 500
million to improve service. (SALVADOR-PHONES)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford
Motor Company and Fiat announced Friday that they would cut back
production in an effort to shrink their inventories of unsold
vehicles. Ford said that starting Aug. 3, the company's assembly
line in a Sao Paulo industrial suburb will operate four days a week
instead of five. On Thursday, the local subsidiary of Volkswagen
said it would suspend production for two days in July. Brazil's
auto industry, which also includes General Motors, has a stock of
more than 100,000 unsold cars. Sales started dropping sharply late
last year when the government introduced a series of austerity
measures to counter the effects of the Asian crisis. (BRAZIL-AUTOS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. lawmakers have settled their differences
over a plan to increase the number of foreign computer programmers,
engineers and other skilled workers allowed into the United States.
Proposed changes to immigration law would increase the maximum
number of visas granted yearly to skilled workers from 65,000 to
115,000 over the next five years. The U.S. information technology
industry has lobbied intensely for the increase in so-called H-1B
visas, saying they are suffering shortages of qualified employees.
Under a compromise announced Friday, companies that depend on
temporary foreign help must attest that they have recruited
American workers and that they have not laid off an American
employee to hire a foreign worker. Supporters hope the House and
Senate will pass the plan before Congress goes on its August
recess. (US-SKILLED IMMIGRANTS)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ China made its first offer to open up its mobile
phone and pager industry to foreign competition Friday as part of
its latest efforts to gain membership of the World Trade
Organization. But its trading partners said it still needs to do
more. The United States and other countries said they were pleased
by the telecoms offer and welcomed a Chinese move to eliminate
restrictions on where foreign banks can locate after China joins.
But trade officials studying the Chinese bid at a working group
meeting in Geneva expressed concern that China did not offer to
free up its farming industry. The WTO is the main international
body governing global trade relations and setting fair trade rules.

	   CAP D'AGDE, France (AP) _ A day of protest, drug admissions and
more team officials in police custody marked the 12th stage of the
Tour de France.
	   And yes, they got around to a little racing.
	   Tour riders, upset over the way they are being treated during
the worsening drug scandal, delayed the start of the Tour's stage
for two hours.
	   ``We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going
to behave like cattle,'' Laurent Jalabert of France told Radio
Tour, the station that follows the race.
	   Jalabert, the world's top-ranked cycling the past three years,
led the demonstration before the 12th stage, which was eventually
won by Belgium's Tom Steels.
	   ``The sport is no longer interesting to anyone,'' Jalabert said.
``We won't cycle and that's the end of it.''
	   After a hastily-called meeting and promises of future ones with
members of the International Cycling Union by Tour director
Jean-Marie Leblanc, the riders got on their bikes and started.
	   Leblanc plans to meet Saturday with a member of each team and
Daniel Baal, vice president of the UCI, to discuss the drug
scandal.
	   However, the scandal worsened when Armin Meier, a member of the
Festina team that was on the Tour until last week, admitted to a
French radio station that he used a banned drug.
	   Meier told France Info radio ``Yes, I said that I had taken EPO,
how I took it and why I took it. I'm just the victim of a system.''
	   Meier was one of the nine Festina riders taken for questioning
in the affair after the Tour kicked them out of the race a week
ago.
	   Meier refused to say if his teammates had also taken the
substance.
	   As members of the Festina team were being released from
questioning, officials of another team still competing on the Tour
found themselves wanted for more questioning.
	   The director of TVM team, Cees Priem, and team doctor Andrei
Mikhailov were placed in custody Friday night after being detained
over allegations of drug use by the team.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Nalbert said an investigating judge would
question both on Monday.
	   About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a TVM team car
near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time, but the
affair was rekindled in the wake of the Festina scandal that sent
three of its officials to jail.
	   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said EPO
was found at the TVM team's hotel in Pamiers during a search on
Thursday.
	   Leblanc said the Tour is aware of the investigation of the TVM
team and will expel the Dutch squad ``if the precise elements
reveal that this team didn't respect the rules and ethics of the
Tour de France the International Cycling Union.''
	   Meanwhile, there was finally some racing on the road.
	   The 148-member pack finally began racing 16 kilometers (10
miles) from the official starting point, and two hours after the
official starting time.
	   Steels won the 222-kilometer (137-mile) stage from
Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde in southern France, his second
stage victory of the Tour.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany held a 71-second overall lead over Bobby
Julich of the United States after Friday's stage, which was marked
by a long breakaway by Jalabert after he led the protest.
	   Julich questioned Jalabert's tactics, first by protesting and
then by leaving the pack.
	   ``I don't know what Jalabert was trying to prove but just glad
he animated the race,'' Julich said. ``He is a great champion but
there are 10 more days to go and if he wants to go out and do a big
ego thing because we didn't stop the race, he will pay the price
for making the breakaway.''
	   Jalabert is third in the overall standings, less than two
minutes behind Julich.
	   ``I was in favor of a little bit of a demonstration but no way
was I in favor of stopping the stage at all,'' Julich said.

Brazil prepares largest privatization deal ever in Latin America

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Many Brazilians often must wait
longer than a minute for a dial tone _ and they're the lucky ones
who have telephones in a nation where 18 million people are on a
waiting list for new phone service.
	   The government hopes to improve the situation by selling its
controlling stake in the telecommunications company Telebras, a
sale that promises to be the largest privatization deal ever in
Latin America. The minimum bid in the auction Wednesday: dlrs 11.7
billion.
	   BellSouth of the United States, Telefonica SA of Spain and
Italy's Telecom Italia are among the 76 companies, pension funds
and investment groups who have signed on to bid.
	   Telebras will be broken up into 12 parts: three fixed-line
services, eight cellular phone companies and one long-distance
carrier.
	   The government will sell a 19 percent stake in the company,
which corresponds to about 51 percent of the holding company's
voting capital.
	   Many here expect Telebras, which had a dlrs 3.4 billion net
profit last year, will fetch twice the minimum bid price.
	   ``The biggest dispute will be for the cellular companies where
we could see a premium of as much as 100 percent (above the minimum
bid),'' Communications Minister Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros told
reporters Thursday.
	   Much is riding on the privatization during this election year
and the sale has many critics, including the left-wing Workers'
Party, which accuses the government of giving away the state-run
company.
	   When the model for the privatization was announced early last
year by the late Communications Minister Sergio Motta, he said
Telebras would sell for around dlrs 30 billion _ almost three times
the minimum bid.
	   The main reason for the lower minimum bid price is that emerging
market stocks, like Telebras, have lost much of their shine in the
wake of the Asian financial crisis.
	   But opposition presidential candidate Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da
Silva, sees another reason _ and has accused Cardoso of selling
Telebras cheap in order to use kickbacks to finance his re-election
campaign.
	   Cardoso has denied the allegations and has even taken da Silva
to court over them.
	   Opponents have filed 40 actions before judges nationwide seeking
to stop or delay the privatization.
	   The government has set up a team of 400 lawyers to undo the
injunctions as fast as they pop up.
	   ``If there's a delay it will probably be something like a week
long, and then things would go ahead,'' said Alexandre Gartner, a
telecom analyst at the Bozano, Simonsen bank. ``I don't see a delay
that could make privatization impossible.''
	   Bracing for violence on Wednesday, police plan to close off the
area around the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange before the auction
and 1,500 officers were ready to hold off protesters.
	   But despite the size of the privatization, the protests will
probably be small, if only because most people are tired of poor
service and hope privatization might finally get them a telephone.
	   Telebras can't meet the demand for phones in a country of 160
million people with only 20 million phones _ a ratio of 11.3 phones
for every 100 people.
	   If all goes as planned, the new owners of Telebras will have to
install about 10 million new lines by the end of 1999 and by 2005
customers should have to wait no longer than a week for their new
phones to be installed.

Despite president's popularity, hard-liners control Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iran-Mayor &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ By toppling the reformist
mayor of Tehran, hard-line rivals of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami have scored a telling victory. It won't be their last.
	   To overcome the ultra-conservatives, Khatami, a moderate cleric,
must change the system that grants limited power to the popularly
elected president and absolute authority to the unelected religious
establishment.
	   He has little room to maneuver, however.
	   The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls
the armed forces, the intelligence services and the broadcast
network.
	   He also dominates the judiciary, which on Thursday sentenced
Tehran's moderate mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, to five years in
jail in what was widely seen as a political trial.
	   Khamenei was appointed by a 70-member Assembly of Experts, which
is controlled by the hard-liners. His allies also dominate the
Majlis, or parliament, and control the screening process for
candidates to parliament and to the Assembly of Experts.
	   Khatami's only hope for significant change is to rely on his
popularity and a groundswell of public pressure to do away with
that screening process.
	   Moderates in the Majlis are expected to propose changes in the
process before October's elections for the Assembly of Experts. But
whether their efforts will succeed is uncertain.
	   Khatami's supporters have carried out several violent protests
in the past year, but they have been contained by hard-liners.
There are fears that a growing sense of public frustration could
lead to more violence if Khatami is not allowed to implement
reforms.
	   Meanwhile, the battle between the ultra-conservatives and
moderates continues.
	   Besides initiating the Karbaschi trial, hard-liners recently
impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, another Khatami ally.
They approved a different Khatami supporter to that post Wednesday
in a bid to avoid an open confrontation with the president.
	   The mayor was convicted of corruption, but most Iranians believe
that his crime was challenging a religious establishment not used
to being questioned since it toppled the U.S.-backed shah in 1979
and established its own strict rule.
	   Khatami has eased the social code, allowing men and women to
socialize without being harassed by police. But the impeachment of
the interior minister came in retaliation.
	   The president has allowed political gatherings, but militants
have attacked the meetings.
	   Press freedoms are encouraged under Khatami, but the hard-line
judiciary has intensified its campaign against newspapers taking
too many liberties.
	   Several newspaper have been fined and the daily Jameah, an
outspoken paper that was testing the limits of the new freedoms,
was closed.
	   Overtures toward the United States aimed at lessening nearly 20
years of mutual hostility have been sharply criticized. Khamenei
and other hard-line leaders have vetoed any resumption of ties.
	   Khatami's efforts to overhaul the ailing economy are also being
blocked.
	   Large sections of the economy are in the hands of powerful
bonyads, or foundations that own everything from five-star hotels
to auto plants and control nearly all trade.
	   They are accountable only to the supreme leader, Khamenei.
	   The hard-liners' stranglehold on power has been apparent from
the early days of the Islamic government. Among the first to
realize it was the late Mehdi Bazargan, who headed a short-lived
provisional government that took over after the shah was toppled.
	   ``They have put a knife in my hand, but it is a knife with only
a handle. Others are holding the blade,'' Bazargan said shortly
before resigning in November 1979.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians have appealed to
relief organizations to speed medical supplies to Kosovo villages
coping with an influx of refugees from recent fighting. Meanwhile,
U.S. diplomacy accelerated in the search for peace.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Friday with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to explore ways to reach a cease-fire and
arrange talks with the government on Kosovo's future.
	   Negotiators are trying to reconcile the ethnic Albanians'
aspirations for independence for the Serbian province, where they
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1, with the Yugoslav government's refusal to
grant more than autonomy.
	   ``One has to help work on something that will ultimately be
something that both sides will accept,'' said Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to neighboring Macedonia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for full independence for
the southern province of 2 million people, has said it would refuse
to recognize any agreement worked out with Rugova.
	   The search for peace has taken on new urgency since heavy
fighting broke out around the town of Orahovac, 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina, the capital. Serb police drove off
the Kosovo Liberation Army on Wednesday after a six-day battle.
	   Thousands of civilians left the area, fleeing to KLA-controlled
villages where food, medicine and other supplies already were in
short supply.
	   In Malisevo, a Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold about 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Pristina, Dr. Rama Morina was trying
to cope with the thousands of refugees in an overcrowded, poorly
equipped clinic that was down to only four IV bags.
	   He said six women had given birth in the past few days, some on
the floor because the shortage of beds.
	   ``There are many sick children and no help is coming,'' he said.
``It's a catastrophe.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began a crackdown on Albanian militants in late
February.

Environmental group tried to buy Soviet nuclear warhead, newspaper

reports

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The environmental organization Greenpeace tried to
buy a Soviet nuclear warhead from a military bunker in eastern
Germany, The Independent newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``It would have been the biggest nuclear event since
Hiroshima,'' the liberal broadsheet quoted William Arkin, the
former head of Greenpeace's Disarmament Research Unit, as saying.
	   The newspaper said that Greenpeace offered dlrs 250,000 to a
Soviet lieutenant to deliver the unidentified warhead, which the
organization would have used to emphasis the danger of ``loose
nukes'' being lost by the Soviets.
	   The plan, codenamed Operation Loose Cannon, was well advanced,
the newspaper said, when the Russian officer disappeared and the
bomb was never delivered.
	   The newspaper quoted unnamed intelligence sources who were
skeptical that a lieutenant - with two soldiers he had enlisted to
help him - could have breached Soviet security to steal the weapon.
	   There was no immediate comment from Greenpeace.
	   The newspaper quoted Arkin, a former U.S. army intelligence
officer who is the author of several works on nuclear
proliferation, as saying that he held three meetings with the
lieutenant, who was based at Altengrabow, southwest of Berlin.
	   ``We planned to line up a scientific team to verify the bomb's
authenticity, and then we were going to unveil it in front of the
world's media to show that loose nukes were a problem, that
disarmament was necessary and that controls on existing weapons
needed to be tightened up,'' the paper quoted Arkin as saying.
	   The newspaper said Arkin also promised the officer safe passage
to Sweden. The newspaper did not explain how Arkin planned to do
this.
	   The Independent said that the dlrs 250,000 payment was
authorized by Greenpeace's chairman David McTaggart and Steve
Sawyer, executive director, although the Greenpeace board of
directors were not told.
	   ``There were two obvious primary concerns: making sure the thing
was totally disarmed, and making sure our people didn't get
killed,'' the newspaper quoted Sawyer as saying.

Once bustling Red Sea port idled by border conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN STOLK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASSAB, Eritrea (AP) _ In the mean morning heat, this once
bustling Red Sea port in Eritrea is nearly empty of ships, and
containers destined for neighboring Ethiopia are stacked high on
the quays.
	   Assab and its 3,200 employees are idle as the border conflict
between Eritrea and Ethiopia stretches into its third month.
	   ``We have seven berths, 18 cranes and a place for 25 ships at a
time,'' said port operations manager Tesfay Telle, describing its
capacity to move goods between trucks and ships.
	   Landlocked Ethiopia has shifted all its exports and imports to
the port of Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden and has cut microwave
lines that linked by phone the 45,000 residents of Assab to the
capital, Asmara.
	   Recently, hundreds of Ethiopians protested in front of city
hall, demanding repatriation. About 40 percent of the 2,500 dockers
who worked in the port were Ethiopians.
	   ``We need to go. We don't want food or anything,'' said Yosief
Efrem. ``I mean, we are suffering. We are dying. ... We want to go
to our country.''
	   City official Hassan Romadan said those Ethiopians who wanted to
leave were free to do so.
	   ``We are studying the best way with the military. We have to
ensure your safety, we don't want to be responsible for your
deaths,'' he said. ``We cannot just send 5,000 people over the
border like that.''
	   Ethiopia has deported several thousand Eritreans it claimed were
spies. Many were prominent businessmen and traders in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa.
	   The deportees were bused out of the county and dropped at the
border near Assab. One, a 56-year-old teacher, died July 15 of
dehydration and exhaustion.
	   Before the simmering border conflict flared into fighting May 6,
about 300 trucks a day used to rumble through Assab carrying goods
to and from ``71,'' the nickname for the border crossing between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, 71 kilometers (43 miles) to the west.
	   ``About 98 percent of the cargo we were handling was transit
cargo for Ethiopia,'' Tesfay said. ``The only ships coming now are
those of the big shipping lines to pick up their empty containers.
Sometimes there is cargo for Eritrea, but it's only maybe one ship
a week.''
	   Ethiopia's threat to bomb Eritrea's second port, Massawa, has
had the effect of a naval blockade. Both countries signed a ban on
air strikes June 15 that has been respected.
	   After heavy fighting in the area of ``71,'' speculation grew
that Ethiopia planned to seize Assab.
	   Opponents of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi are outraged
that Eritrea, which was part of Ethiopia until 1993, was granted
independence. They are also upset about losing its two ports.
	   But the private Indian Ocean Newsletter reported in its June 27
issue that officials in Djibouti, a former French colony, are
talking about the likelihood of a Djibouti-Ethiopian union.
	   Nico Debie, an occasional resident who works for the Fisheries
Ministry, says without the sailors and truck drivers, the port is
dead at night, and the prostitutes are bored.
	   It is not clear how Eritrea will manage without the revenue
generated by the port. But Tesfay is optimistic.
	   ``There are great future prospects for the port of Assab,'' he
said. ``When the situation has changed to a peaceful condition, I
think the business problem will be solved. Ethiopia will come again
to this port. The service is good, the tariffs are reasonable. We
can start tomorrow.''

Mexican government backs off official's call to debate abortion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One week after Mexico's Health Secretary
suggested a debate on legalizing abortion, the government backed
off the proposal following heavy criticism from Catholic and
conservative groups.
	   ``It is not the government's posture to submit this issue to a
debate,'' Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida said Friday.
	   Labastida said Health Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente had not
meant to open a debate on the sensitive issue in remarks made June
17 to a group of congresswomen and men.
	   ``This issue (abortion) should be reviewed and debated with
objectivity and seriousness,'' de la Fuente said.
	   His remarks sparked a demonstration Monday by members of the
National Pro-Life Committee in front of de la Fuente's offices with
signs reading: ``No to the legalization of the culture of death.''
	   All Mexican states currently have laws limiting abortion, though
some permit it in circumstances ranging from protection of the
woman's health to economic problems.
	   Mexico's population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic but only
nominally observant.
	   An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 women die each year from illegal
abortions in Mexico, according to Sen. Higinio Martinez Mirando,
president of the Senate Health Committee.
	   The Papal envoy to Mexico, Archbishop Justo Mullor Garcia, said
earlier this week that ``it is horrible to discuss this topic,
because it violates the word of Christ and supposes that man has
power over life.''

An ancient 'garden city' outside bustling Shanghai

	   SUZHOU, China (AP) _ A whitewashed wall shuts out the clatter of
modern China. Ponds and lush greenery create a private world in the
Humble Administrator's Garden, transporting the visitor to a
timeless serenity before car horns and cell phones.
	   Built in 1509 for an imperial bureaucrat, this lavishly misnamed
complex sprawls across 13 acres (five hectares) dotted with
pavilions for viewing the moon, composing poetry or drinking tea.
	   Such gardens are Suzhou's fame, legacy of a 900-year reign as a
center for trade and silk weaving. Once the preserve of the rich,
they now are open to anyone with the price of admission.
	   A pleasant little city of canals, leafy streets and 600,000
people _ one hour west of Shanghai by train _ Suzhou is small,
green and ancient, the mirror image of its giant, aggressively
modern neighbor.
	   By the 1700s, when Shanghai was still a fishing village, Suzhou
had been around for nearly 20 centuries. Its golden age dawned in
the 10th century with the opening of the Grand Canal linking the
booming Yangtze River delta with Beijing to the north.
	   East of town stands the Water Gate, which connects Suzhou to the
southern end of the canal and filled imperial coffers with tolls on
barges laden with silk, spices, tea and grain. Barges still trundle
up and down the canals, though long ago supplanted by trucks and
trains.
	   For centuries, buyers as far away as Europe coveted the luxury
fabrics produced in Suzhou by armies of sweatshop laborers. So
highly did China value its monopoly on silk-spinning worms that to
export one alive was a crime punished by death.
	   At the Suzhou Silk Museum on Renmin Road, visitors can watch
weavers make brocades and velvet on old-fashioned looms so complex
that some must be operated by two people. In a back room, silkworms
in bamboo trays dine on mulberry leaves, filling the air with a
murmur of relentless munching like the patter of raindrops.
	   At the nearby Temple of the Northern Pagoda, an eight-story
pagoda gives a panoramic view of the city.
	   Suzhou's small size and wide, flat streets make it ideal to
explore by bicycle over a few days. Bicycles are for rent at the
Cui Fu Yuan Restaurant on the corner of Renmin Road and Dajin Alley
or at the Suzhou Hotel on Shiquan Street.
	   Locals recommend starting the day with the West Garden Temple
and Garden for Lingering in the northwest, saving gardens on the
east side for afternoon. Admission prices range from 7 to 20 yuan
(85 cents to dlrs 2.40). Most gardens, temples and villas are
closed by 4:30 p.m.
	   The gardens are in classic Chinese style _ compact and
walled-in, with greenery but few flowers. Unlike more naturalistic
Western esthetics, the Chinese gardener's art demands the taming of
nature as water, foliage and rocks are molded into artificial
landscapes.
	   The results include intimate grottos, ponds teeming with golden
carp and miniature scenes of mountains, caves and forests.
	   Most highly regarded is the small but charming Garden of the
Master of Nets, where a glassed-in parlor and reading rooms embrace
a pond. A gazebo juts out over the water.
	   A group of artists has set up shop in a side pavilion selling
paintings and woodblock prints. At night, the garden puts on a show
of classical Chinese music and dance. Tickets are 60 yuan (dlrs
7.20).
	   The grandest spot is the Humble Administrator's Garden, built
for bureaucrat Wang Xianchen and declared a national treasure by
the Chinese government. Its pavilions house antique furniture and a
collection of ``spirit rocks'' cut into bizarre shapes by water and
other natural forces and prized by connoisseurs.
	   A courtyard mansion next door is home to the Suzhou Museum, with
a collection of paintings, calligraphy, ceramics and other
artifacts from the 7th-century Sui Dynasty to the present.
	   One of the oldest gardens is the Blue Wave Pavilion, built 10
centuries ago. It has a collection of furniture made of tree roots
and stone tablets inscribed by Confucian scholars through the ages.
	   Dining in Suzhou runs the gamut from expensive tourist
restaurants to street vendors. Shiquan Street offers a wide
selection. Regional specialties include seafood and river fish.
With beer or wine, dinner can cost 50 to 200 yuan (dlrs 6 to dlrs
25) per person.
	   In warm weather, cooks set up shop on the sidewalk, where diners
pick from trays of seafood, meat and vegetables.
	   Shiquan Street is good for shopping, as is Lindun Street near
the Suzhou Museum. Stores sell silk, teapots, porcelain, jewelry,
fans and carvings in wood, stone and jade.

Backpacker `bibles' become best-selling guidebooks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY408-NY409 &QL; 
 &UR; By DENIS D. GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Australians scour their pages for the
cheapest guesthouses in Bangkok. The Japanese look them up to find
the best beer in Prague. Even well-heeled Americans, who wouldn't
be caught dead with a backpack, now tuck them into their designer
luggage.
	   Still the staple of low-budget, ready-to-rough-it travelers,
Lonely Planet guides have also moved into the mainstream among the
world's best-sellers in the field.
	   And the couple that started them 25 years ago as shoestring
travelers are now millionaires heading a media empire that includes
more than 350 titles, as well as a television series, a photo bank
and popular Internet site.
	   Growing at an annual average of 20 percent in recent years,
Lonely Planet notched dlrs 21 million and 2.8 million books in
global sales in the year ending in mid-1997.
	   ``We came along at just the right moment,'' says owner-director
Tony Wheeler. ``What are now pretty ordinary places were still
considered weird and wonderful. And tourism as a whole was taking
off in the early 1970s.''
	   That's when British-born Tony and his Irish wife Maureen tramped
from England through Asia and down to Australia, arriving with 27
cents and a camera.
	   Asked by friends how they managed, the couple responded with a
hand-stapled ``Across Asia on the Cheap,'' which made them enough
money to research the first Lonely Planet guide, ``South East Asia
on a Shoestring.''
	   Dubbed the ``yellow bible'' because of the cover color and soon
to appear in a 10th edition, the book became a hit with young
Westerners who didn't mind riding decrepit buses, lodging in sweaty
back alleys or getting occasional cramps from eating street-stall
food.
	   ``We've sort of moved on with our first audience. I'm also not
24 any more and I'm not penniless,'' said 52-year-old Tony in a
telephone interview from his headquarters in Melbourne, Australia.
	   While the guides still highlight the rock-bottom place to stay
in Chiang Mai, Thailand _ the Banana Guest House for 40 baht (dlr
1) a night _ they also note chic bistros in Paris and the price of
center orchestra seats at New York's Metropolitan Opera (dlrs 115
and up).
	   ``There's a serious intent to our books. We are interested in
history, art, the political situation,'' Wheeler says. ``At the
same time, there's an irreverent, flippant, humorous side. We've
managed to combine the two.''
	   The frank political and human rights overviews have gotten
Lonely Planet in trouble with authorities from Indonesia to Chile.
One of its writers was deported from Vietnam and the country guide
is banned in Myanmar, formerly called Burma.
	   ``If you don't upset some people, you're not trying hard
enough,'' Wheeler says.
	   The guides also draw fire from conservationists, who say they
attract travelers to tribal regions, fragile environments and other
once little-visited areas. Wheeler's guides were early promoters of
adventure travel and eco-tourism, especially in Third World
countries.
	   ``Alternative tour guides have significantly contributed to put
new destinations on the world tourism map and to pave the way for
mass tourism development,'' says Anita Pleumarom of the Tourism
Investigation and Monitoring Team, a Bangkok-based watchdog group.
	   ``What can you say? We've been an influence in some of these
places,'' Wheeler responds. ``But people would go there anyway. I
worry about it in some respects but I don't lose sleep over it at
night.''
	   The criticism _ and popularity _ stems in part from the detail
the books provide. The author of eight guides, Joe Cummings says
later editions of his best-selling one to Thailand required up to
five months on the road and three months of writing.
	   Unlike most others, its 844 pages direct travelers to the
remotest corners, which some conservationists would prefer remained
untouched by tourism.
	   Another successful ingredient, the Wheelers say, has been their
hands-on involvement with the product.
	   This year, Tony, sometimes accompanied by his wife and two
teen-aged children, will have ``tried out'' Lonely Planet guides in
Central America, walked around Tibet's sacred Mt. Kailash and
researched future books by sailing deep into the Pacific from Chile
and hiking around Corsica.
	   ``At one point we thought we'd run out of guide books. But they
seem to pop up all over the place,'' Tony says. ``We're going to do
this as long as it's fun.''

Mexico's colonial past lives on in Taxco

	   TAXCO, Mexico (AP) _ Rolling green hills bend sharply into stern
peaks along the central Mexican highway. A curve to the left, then
right, then an enchanting view: a cascade of whitewashed buildings
and red roofs running down the hillside.
	   Long isolated from other cities, Taxco has tried hard to change
very little over the centuries. One of the oldest mining sites in
the Americas, its treasures attracted early Conquistadores. Today,
famed silver arts _ reborn with the help of an Amercan expatriate _
draw travelers to the town of cobblestoned steets and colonial
ambiance.
	   Taxco holds a charm lost _ if ever known at all _ in the
built-up vacation resorts along Mexico's coasts. Though less than a
hundred miles (160 kilometers) south of the Mexico City metropolis,
Taxco is an escape from modernity.
	   Though travelers may have heard about wildfires that recently
clouded Mexico's southern skies, the arrival of the rainy season
has extinguished the blazes and cleared the air. Most of the rain
comes in the form of afternoon showers.
	   Couples enjoy the twilight breeze on benches in the town's
central plaza, beside the towering twin belfries of the
240-year-old Santa Prisca Cathedral. Painters sell images of Taxco
and Indians peddle brightly colored crafts of wood and clay. Arm in
arm, local girlfriends stroll around the square, discreetly hoping
to catch the eyes of passing boys.
	   Marrying a native son or daughter is the goal of most
Taxquenens, according to town historian Javier Ruiz Ocampo. They
wish to spend their lives in the small city and continue living in
its traditions.
	   Taxco's roots date to before the Spanish conquest, when Indians
called it Tlachco _ or place of the ballgame _ and, according to
legend, paid tribute to their Aztec rulers with gold bars.
	   Within a year of conquering the Aztecs in 1521, Hernan Cortes
made his mining claim in Taxco. By the end of the century, Taxco
silver was spread across Europe.
	   Over the coming centuries, adventurers sought treasures of their
own. French-born Don Jose de la Borda struck a fortune in the early
1700s, and in thanks built the Santa Prisca, an ornate,
gold-trimmed Spanish Baroque offering where the baron's own son
served as priest.
	   A competition of miners' tributes saw more than a dozen other
churches built, Ruiz Ocampo explains while sitting in a cafe patio
overlooking cathedral domes and red-tile roofs.
	   The presence of so many grand churches in the city of 140,000
people is one reason a strong religious fervor sweeps Taxco in the
week before Easter, he says.
	   Each year, members of secret societies pay penitence for their
own sins or those of the world by whipping themselves with studded
lashes or bearing 100-pound bundles of thorny stalks across their
bare shoulders in a nightly parade before thousands of silent
tourists and worshipers.
	   The spectacle of hooded men on the steep stone alleyways, the
scent of incense heavy in the air, conjures images of a time long
past.
	   The mood lightens in late May for the Jornadas Alarconianas, a
festival of plays, literary readings and dances celebrating writer
Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, a 17th-century Taxco son.
	   In November, the city honors its source of wealth with the Feria
de La Plata, or Silver Fair, when silversmiths put their finest
pieces on show and the national prize is awarded to the best silver
artist.
	   The art of silver work had died in Taxco during Mexico's
19th-century war for independence, when Spanish barons destroyed
their mines rather than lose them to the rebels.
	   In 1929 _ a year after the highway from Mexico City reached
Taxco _ William Spratling, an architecture professor from Tulane
University, arrived and saw the chance for a silver arts
renaissance.
	   Spratling recruited goldsmiths to teach local men. Today, 31
years after Spratling's death, his former students run many of the
hundreds of silver shops lining the narrow streets.
	   Taxco residents continue to pay homage to their adopted son. A
silver bust of Spratling sits in the town's silver museum,
alongside images of De la Borda and Ruiz de Alarcon. A museum
behind the Santa Prisca holds Spratling's collection of silver art
and pre-Columbian figures.
	   History is only part of the flavor enjoyed in Taxco. Inexpensive
restaurants along the streets offer typical Mexican dishes, usually
for less than dlrs 5 (45 pesos). Lucky diners can enjoy the view of
the central plaza from upstairs balconies. Regional favorite dishes
include barbacoa _ roasted goat _ and pozole, a traditional morning
stew of pork and corn.
	   In the fall, local vendors in the cramped city market sell salsa
de jumil, made from ground beetles that swarm in a cloud onto a
nearby mountainside every year and are said to have medicinal
properties.
	   The town's 17 hotels, which usually charge about dlrs 20 or less
(180 pesos) a night, offer a range of services. The upper limit _
dlrs 100 to dlrs 150 a night (890 pesos to 1,335 pesos) _ is the
Hotel Monte Taxco which has rooms overlooking the city, a golf
course, horseback riding and suspended cable cars that take guests
from the mountain-top inn, high over a rugged canyon and down to
the city's edge.
	   Taxco from the 1930s through the 1960s had been a getaway for
Mexican and American celebrities before its popularity was outshone
by Acapulco, 175 miles (280 kilometers) to the west, and other
tropical resorts developed with the advent of air-conditioning.
	   However, the charm of the time-forgotten city _ complete with
its year-round mild temperatures _ continues to entice travelers
fortunate enough to find her.

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   TRAVEL: Taxco, pronounced ``TAS-co,'' is located about 100 miles
(160 kms) southwest of Mexico City. There is no airline service,
but modern highways make reaching the city easy by car or bus.
Comfortable bus service, with reclining seats, video movies and
snacks are available from Mexico City for dlrs 7 (62 pesos) and
from Acapulco for dlrs 13 (115 pesos). Credit card reservations are
accepted through Estrella de Oro, (52-5) 549-8520 or 549-8524.
Remember to buy your return ticket ahead of time as buses out of
Taxco fill up early. Package tours with round-trip service and
hotel accommodations are available through travel agencies.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CLIMATE: Taxco's temperatures are normally comfortable
year-round, with the hottest period between April and May averaging
in the mid- to upper-80s (30 to 32 C). Fortunately, the town's
inland location keeps the humidity low. Rains during the summer
typically are only afternoon showers.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LODGING: Hotels near the center of the city are the best
bargain, with simple but comfortable rooms available for about dlrs
20 or less (180 pesos) a night. The four-star Hotel de la Borda,
which offers views of the city and relatively easy access to the
town's center, runs about dlrs 50 (445 pesos). Rooms at the
five-star Hotel Monte Taxco, which sits at the edge of a city on
top of a surprisingly steep road, range from dlrs 100 to dlrs 150
(890 pesos to 1,335 pesos).
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TRANSPORTATION: Parking within the center of Taxco may
complicate travel by private car. The best option is to leave autos
at hotel parking lots and rely on either taxis, usually converted
Volkswagen bugs, or the local ``combis,'' which are VW vans serving
as small buses. Taxi fares are typically only a couple of dollars,
depending on distance, and combi service is even more economical.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CURRENCY: American dollars are accepted at some businesses, but
travelers will get a better exchange rate if they use Mexican
pesos. The rate recently has floated at around 8.9 pesos to the
dollar.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOCALS: Shoppers will find that Taxco merchants and peddlers are
not nearly as aggressive as in other tourist destinations. The
locals are proud of their courtesy. Many speak English, and a few
stores advertise their clerks' fluency in French or German.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   RESTAURANTS: Local fare is quite affordable and tasty, typically
costing less than dlrs 5 (45 pesos). Dinners at more upscale
restaurants catering to tourists can range up to dlrs 25 (225
pesos) or so. Traditional meals such as tacos, enchiladas and
pozole are easily found, along with steaks, seafood and pizzas.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   INFORMATION: For more information call the Tourist Information
Office at (52-762) 2-07-98, which has staff workers who speak
English, French and German. Maps and images of Taxco and
information in Spanish are available on the Web at
http://taxco.silver.net.mx/taxco/.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Want to try operating a dock crane? How about
guiding a freighter through Puget Sound?
	   You can do both and more _ at least in a virtual way _ at
Odyssey, the dlrs 14.2 million maritime museum that opened on the
waterfront July 1. The 44 hands-on, interactive exhibits offer a
close-up look at trade, shipping, commercial fishing, marine
recreation and environmental activities.
	   Odyssey is one of only two contemporary interactive maritime
centers in the United States. Nauticus, in Norfolk, Virginia,
focuses on the Navy. Odyssey concentrates on the role of the
maritime community in daily life.
	   The 30,000-square-foot (2,800-square-meter) facility on Pier 66
expands on an idea promoted in the 1970s by a group called
Waterfront Awareness that operated a booth on Pier 57 and sought to
answer visitors' questions.
	   ``People need to be able to access the waterfront and understand
what goes on here,'' says Ralph Johnston, Odyssey's executive
director.
	   ``Odyssey tells the stories of the working men and women
throughout the Northwest who pilot the ships, load our exports,
fish the North Pacific seas, chart our waters and protect our Sound
every day.''
	   Visitors to the museum's four galleries use robotic controls,
view radar scans of area waters and listen in on radio traffic
among boats in Elliott Bay.
	   The Ocean Trade gallery looks into the Northwest's role in
international trade.
	   The adventures and hazards of commercial fishing are the topic
at the Harvesting the Sea Gallery. The Waterlink Gallery, in the
museum's 4,000-square-foot (370-square-meter) entrance, features
two 35-foot-tall (10.6-meter) kinetic sculptures overlooking
Elliott Bay.
	   ``The main goal is to realize the importance of our connection
to the water,'' Johnston says.
	   The museum also offers occasional tours of real ships that dock
at the pier.
	   In addition to city, county, state and federal funding, 800
donors contributed 40 percent of the money for the museum.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Odyssey, The Maritime Discovery Center, is located on Pier 66,
2205 Alaskan Way, Seattle.
	   Admission: dlrs 6.50 adults, dlrs 4 students and seniors,
children under 5 free.
	   Hours: Sunday through Wednesday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Thursday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
	   Phone: (206) 374-4000.

 &UR; Eds: Garlic festival is July 24-26; ToyFest is Aug. 28-30 &QL;

	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Garlic Festival marks 20th year of celebrating the pungent herb
	   GILROY, California (AP) _ Garlic farmer Val Felice remembers the
time a driver stopped by his field to ask directions, then wrinkled
her nose. ``What's that terrible smell?'' she demanded.
	   That was before the Gilroy Garlic Festival, which made the town
famous and helped whet Americans' appetite for the ``stinking
rose.'' Nowadays, visitors still sniff, but no longer in disdain.
	   More than 120,000 people are expected to follow their noses July
24-26 to Gilroy for the 20th celebration, eager to savor the
pungent herb in dishes from soup to nuts. Not to mention such
offbeat concoctions as garlic wine, chocolate-dipped garlic cloves
and garlic ice cream.
	   Since 1979, 2.2 million people have attended the garlic gala,
one of the nation's biggest food festivals.
	   Organizers give the festival much of the credit for the increase
in Americans' fresh garlic consumption over the past two decades,
from one head per person per year to three.
	   Gilroy, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of San Francisco,
is just the place to honor Allium sativum, the boldest member of
the lilly family. Most of California's crop is grown in the Central
Valley, but Gilroy still boasts many a fragrant field and remains a
major processing center.
	   Even decades ago, the town's aroma was noteworthy. Gilroy is
``the only town in America where you can marinate a steak just by
hanging it on the clothesline,'' quipped humorist Will Rogers.

 &UR; Arcade's demolition marks end of an era
	   ASBURY PARK, New Jersey (AP) _ Bruce Springsteen immortalized
the 103-year-old Palace Amusements in his 1975 song ``Born to
Run.''
	   Now city officials say it's time for the endearing and
dilapidated Asbury Park icon to come down. City code enforcers
condemned the building after it's floor partially collapsed.
	   The Palace, with its peeling green facade and painted clown
faces, has been vacant since 1988. For many years, the block-long
building was home to a Ferris wheel, carousel and shooting gallery.
	   From 1986 to 1988, it housed a rock 'n' roll museum, which
celebrated local musicians such as Springsteen, Southside Johnny
and the Asbury Jukes.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Spa reopens in town once famed for mineral waters
	   EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, Missouri (AP) _ During this spa resort's
heyday, you had to have a doctor's prescription to come here.
	   These days, visitors only need an appointment.
	   Excelsior Springs, a small town 30 miles (50 kilometers)
northeast of Kansas City, has been known for its mineral water
wells since 1880.
	   In the 1920s, the town had 5,000 residents and was a bustling
place, with more than 350,000 visitors a year and 10,000 jobs, says
Vicky Bates, who runs a spa in a building called the Hall of
Waters, which also houses city offices.
	   In the 1930s, there were 11 bathhouses, 40 boarding houses and
20 clinics. Until recently, the only bath house was in the Hall of
Waters.
	   The Elms Resort and Spa, a large limestone building dating to
1888, reopened July 20 with modern spa services, said Marcy Miller,
assistant to the hotel's general manager.

 &UR; Toy town: A Brigadoon of sorts for the young at heart
	   EAST AURORA, New York (AP) _ You're only young once, right?
	   Not necessarily. Not during one weekend each August, when
ToyFest transforms this picturesque village into a sort of mythical
Brigadoon and awakens the sleeping child in its grown-up visitors.
	   Set in the cradle of the American arts and crafts movement,
which later became home to toy maker Fisher-Price, ToyFest is a
three-day celebration of playtime, imagination and all things toy.
	   Even the 200 or so volunteers who plan and run things refer to
themselves as the ``little people,'' after the tiny figurines that
inhabit Fisher-Price playhouses and vehicles.
	   While Fisher-Price, a subsidiary ofMattel Inc., is one of many
sponsors, ToyFest is an independent event that wasstarted 12 years
ago with a trio of volunteers and has grown into a spectacle
attracting upwards of 50,000 visitors each day.
	   Its goal is to preserve the town's toy heritage.
	   Highlighted by an extravagant two-hour parade, an antique toy
show and sale, rides and entertainment, this year's festival runs
Aug. 28-30 and is built around an outer-space theme.
	   Private collectors will lend Star Wars memorabilia and space
exploration models for display at the Toy Town Museum, a year-round
exhibitor of historic toys and interactive exhibits.
	   The 8,000-square-foot (740-square-meter) museum, opened in 1996,
also features a permanent on-loan collection of Fisher-Price toys,
beginning with the earliest, wooden figures that were pulled along
on wheels. Toys from other manufacturers, includingBarbie and
Raggedy Ann and Andy, are on display as well.
	   Admission is free to the museum and other ToyFest attractions at
the insistence of the organizers. They're intent on keeping the
weekend family-friendly at a time when summer has stretched
entertainment budgets thin and back-to-school needs fill shopping
lists.
	   ``The whole weekend is free,'' says Deanna Korth, director of
the Toy Town Museum.
	   The museum, which receives no public money, supports itself in
part with the sale of commemorative toys, reproductions of earlier
Fisher-Price toys, produced each year for ToyFest. This year it's
the ``Space Blazer'' originally made in 1953. A total of 5,000 will
be made.

Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary buys Lamborghini, statement says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Continuing Volkswagen's luxury shopping spree
after buying Rolls-Royce earlier in July, the German automaker's
subsidiary Audi AG said Friday it had signed a contract of sale
acquiring the Italian sportscar maker Automobili Lamborghini SpA.
	   ``Lamborghini symbolizes superlative standards of sporting
performance,'' Dr. Franz-Josef Paefgen, Audi's chairman, said in a
statement after concluding terms in London with previous owners,
Malaysian holding company Mycom Setdco and V'Power Corp., an
Indonesian firm controlled by Tommy Suharto, son of the deposed
Indonesian leader.
	   The statement did not say what price the former owners got for
Lamborghini, but news reports in June put the proposed price at
dlrs 40 million and said that Lamborghini will likely be integrated
as foreign subsidiary, similar to Audi's operations in Hungary.
	   In a statement from Lamborghini, company president Vittorio Di
Capua said the deal was an important step to widening the company's
perspectives, and said that the workforce of 310 welcomed the
takeover by Audi.
	   At the beginning of 1998, Audi entered into negotiations to
cooperate technically with Lamborghini, but on June 12, Volkswagen,
Audi's parent company, said the group had signed a letter of intent
to acquire the Italian company.
	   In 1997, Lamborghini built 209 Diablo, Diablo SV, Diablo VT,
Diablo Roadster and Roadster SV models. The company is also
involved in the development and production of engines for offshore
boats.
	   Lamborghini, which had been losing money, drove back into the
black two years ago, but its plans to expand the range of models
for a broader market share have been hampered by lack of financing.
	   Volkswagen has also sought recently to broaden its base with the
purchase on July 3 of the British luxury car maker, Rolls-Royce
Motor Co., owned by Vickers PLC, for about $700 million. At the
same time, Vickers agreed to sell its high-performance engine maker
to Audi.

UN trying to negotiate return of aid groups to Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is trying to negotiate
the return of international aid organizations to the Afghan capital
and was to meet with the Taliban in Pakistan on Saturday, U.N. and
Taliban officials said.
	   No immediate breakthroughs were expected from the meeting, where
U.N. officials will relay concerns about the expulsion and the
humanitarian situation in the country to the Taliban representative
in Islamabad.
	   Bronek Szynalski, the World Food Program's regional director,
was to urge the Taliban representative, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, to
readmit the groups, U.N. officials said Friday.
	   The Taliban representative in New York, Noorullah Zadran,
expressed the religious militia's eagerness to resume talks during
a meeting Friday with the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Sergio
Vieira de Mello, de Mello said.
	   During the meeting, de Mello urged the Taliban to readmit the
aid groups and stressed the international community's concern about
the impact of the lost assistance, U.N. officials said.
	   ``Their presence in Kabul is vital,'' de Mello said in an
interview after the meeting, noting that about 75 percent of the
humanitarian aid in Kabul had been affected by the exodus.
	   About 200 international staffers from 38 aid organizations
pulled out of the Afghan capital Monday rather than obey a Taliban
order to move into war-damaged student dormitories.
	   The aid workers said they feared for their safety at the
dormitories, and didn't have the money to make extensive repairs.
	   Relations between the Taliban army and international aid groups
have been strained since 1996, when the religious militia swept
into Kabul, a city of about 750,000, and imposed its harsh version
of Islamic law.
	   The Taliban closed schools for girls and forced women off the
job. International aid workers balked at discriminatory practices
that denied women equal access to health care and education.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross weren't covered by the
edict and continue to work in Kabul, though at reduced levels.
	   Zadran said he hoped a settlement could be found. If the
negotiators truly want to help the Afghan people, they will be
``trying simply to listen if they can overcome whatever has
happened in the past two three days,'' he said in a phone
interview.
	   Zadran said he recommended that donors and representatives of
the aid organizations themselves be involved in negotiations,
rather than just the United Nations and the Taliban.

Floods kill 1,145 in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Floods from torrential rains have killed 145
people in three Chinese provinces, pushing the nationwide flood
death toll to 1,145, state media said Saturday.
	   The latest casualties were reported in Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi
in the south and center of the country, among the provinces worst
hit by the seasonal summer rains that have fallen unusually early
and heavily this year.
	   The majority of deaths have resulted from drownings, collapsing
houses, lightning, mud flows and landslides from mountain torrents,
the official newspaper China Daily said.
	   The floods in the three provinces forced the emergency
relocation of 900,000 people since last Friday and have destroyed
250,000 houses and damaged another 780,000, the newspaper said.
More than 3 million people in Hunan have been affected, it said.
	   One of the worst-hit counties was Huangmei, in Hubei, where
floodwaters two meters deep (6.6 feet) stranded 600,000 residents
and halted traffic on a 48 kilometer (30 mile) stretch of highway,
the newspaper said.
	   The floods also affected 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres)
of cultivated land and caused direct economic losses estimated at
at least 9.2 billion yuan (dlrs 1.1 billion), the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vice President Al Gore praised Russia's new prime
minister, saying he had an impressive understanding of his
country's troubled economy and the danger posed by the spread of
nuclear weapons technology.
	   ``In a very short period of time, he has established a full
command of the facts,'' Gore said of Sergei Kiriyenko at a news
conference on Friday. ``I'm impressed with his programs.''
	   Kiriyenko, who was named prime minister less than four months
ago, called their discussions ``very concentrated and fruitful.''
	   Gore, who left Friday night for Washington, and Kiriyenko signed
agreements designed to protect Russia's plutonium stockpile and
find new jobs for scientists in defense industries.
	   The plutonium agreement calls for building a new plant to
reprocess plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel for
civilian nuclear power plants. Under the other agreement, Russia's
``defense cities,'' or isolated research communities struggling in
the new economy, will be converted to civilian use.
	   Gore and Kiriyenko also discussed Russia's economic crisis.
	   Kiriyenko insisted that Russia is not pursuing unpopular
economic reforms to please the International Monetary Fund or the
United States.
	   ``We are doing this for ourselves,'' he said. ``This is being
done because there is no alternative.'' He called the Russian
parliament's resistance to the government program a ``normal part
of politics.''
	   The two also set the agenda for a Moscow summit between
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, which is planned for the
end of August or early September. No details were released.
	   Gore has long co-chaired a joint commission on science and
technology previously headed by Kiriyenko's predecessor, Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The commission is aimed at ensuring the safety of
Russian defense facilities, especially nuclear materials and
technologies.
	   In his meetings with Kiriyenko, Gore raised two topics of
long-term concern to the United States: the spread of Russian
missile technology to Iran and Russia's long-stalled ratification
of the START II arms reduction treaty.
	   Gore noted Iran's test of a missile this week that could strike
Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Russian government has said it is
making every effort to prevent Iran from acquiring such technology
but has had trouble controlling the actions of private companies.
	   Gore also called on the Russian Parliament to ratify START II,
``so that the United States and Russia can begin negotiating
further reductions during START III.'' The United States Senate
ratified START II in 1996.

Environmental group tried to buy a Soviet nuclear warhead,
</HEADLINE>
newspaper reports
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to add further details, clarifies grafs 1-4

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The environmental organization Greenpeace tried to
buy a nuclear warhead from a Soviet officer based in East Germany
for dlrs 250,000, The Independent newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The liberal broadsheet said that in the summer of 1991
Greenpeace offered the money to a Soviet lieutenant to deliver the
unidentified warhead. Greenpeace planned, the newspaper said, to
publicize the warhead's theft from its bunker in Germany to
emphasis the danger of ``loose nukes'' being lost by the Soviets.
	   ``It would have been the biggest nuclear event since
Hiroshima,'' the newspaper quoted William Arkin, the former head of
Greenpeace's Disarmament Research Unit, as saying.
	   The plan, codenamed Operation Loose Cannon, was well advanced,
the newspaper said, when the unnamed Russian officer, who was based
at Altengrabow, southwest of Berlin, disappeared. The bomb was
never delivered.
	   The newspaper quoted unnamed British intelligence sources who
were skeptical that a lieutenant - with two soldiers he had
enlisted to help him - could have breached Soviet security to steal
the weapon.
	   There was no immediate comment from Greenpeace.
	   The newspaper quoted Arkin, a former U.S. army intelligence
officer who is the author of several works on nuclear
proliferation, as saying that he held three meetings with the
Soviet officer.
	   ``We planned to line up a scientific team to verify the bomb's
authenticity, and then we were going to unveil it in front of the
world's media to show that loose nukes were a problem, that
disarmament was necessary and that controls on existing weapons
needed to be tightened up,'' the paper quoted Arkin as saying.
	   The newspaper said Arkin also promised the officer safe passage
to Sweden. The newspaper did not explain how Arkin planned to do
this.
	   The Independent said that the dlrs 250,000 payment was
authorized by Greenpeace's chairman David McTaggart and Steve
Sawyer, executive director, although the Greenpeace board of
directors were not told.
	   ``There were two obvious primary concerns: making sure the thing
was totally disarmed, and making sure our people didn't get
killed,'' the newspaper quoted Sawyer as saying.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Surgery was scheduled Saturday for a
Chinese gymnast paralyzed during a practice vault at the Goodwill
Games.
	   Doctors will try to stabilize the spine of Sang Lan, 17, in a
six-hour operation at Nassau County Medical Center, according to
Dr. Brock Schnebel, the games' chief medical officer.
	   Sang's parents are expected to arrive from China late Saturday.
Schnebel said Friday night that all final consent forms had been
arranged for the gymnast through the Chinese team.
	   Schnebel said Sang's condition was unchanged from when she was
brought to the hospital following Tuesday night's accident. The
1997 Chinese national vault champion struck the mat with her head,
fracturing and dislocating two neck vertebrae and leaving her with
no movement in her legs. Doctors said it was unlikely she would
walk again.
	   ``She's gaining in her undertsanding of what is happening, and
is maintaining a good attitude,'' Schnebel said. ``As you can
imagine, this would be very difficult for anyone _ especially a
teenager.''
	   Sang was visited for 90 minutes Friday by Dennis Byrd, a former
defensive lineman for the New York Jets who suffered injuries
similar to the gymnast but regained the use of his legs.
	   Sang is being treated with SYGEN, an experimental drug that
helped Byrd recover so well.

Lithuania routs Puerto Rico to win Goodwill bronze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Saulius Stombergas scored 19 of his 28 points in
the first half Friday night and Lithuania crushed Puerto Rico
119-75 to win the Goodwill Games bronze medal.
	   It was Lithuania's first appearance in the basketball
competition in the Goodwill Games and its third bronze medal in a
major international tournament. It finished third in both the 1992
and 1996 Olympics.
	   Puerto Rico was the defending Goodwill Games gold medalist.
	   Lithuania, which lost to the United States in the semifinals,
took control right away against Puerto Rico. The lead was 18-4 in
the opening 4{ minutes as Stombergas had 10 points, including two
3-pointers, and Gintaras Einikis had six.
	   The lead was as much as 21 points in the first half and
Lithuania went up 55-36 at halftime. Lithuania, which shot 69
percent (47-for-68) from the field, pulled away steadily, with the
largest lead 112-66 with 2:34 to play.
	   Danius Adomaitis was 9-for-10 from the field and had 22 points
for Lithuania, which made 10 of 17 3-point attempts and finished
with a 40-18 rebound advantage.
	   Eddie Casiano led Puerto Rico, which lost to Australia in the
semifinals, with 23 points.

Mets sweep Cubs; Braves down Pirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Carlos Baerga drove in four runs as the New York
Mets swept a doubleheader for the second time in three days Friday
with a 7-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs.
	   The Mets, who swept Milwaukee on Wednesday, have won six
straight games and moved within 1 1/2 games of the Cubs for the
wild card.
	   In the first game, Armando Reynoso pitched eight shutout innings
to win his first appearance in a year and Brian McRae had three
hits in the Mets' 5-0 victory.
	   Mets pitchers have combined for 13 shutouts, the most in the
majors. It was the Mets fourth shutout in their last six games.
	   New York trailed 3-2 in the eighth inning of the second game
before scoring five runs in the last two innings. The Mets took the
lead in the eighth on RBI singles by Mike Piazza and Lenny Harris
off Terry Adams (7-6).
	   The Mets added three more in the ninth on a bases-loaded walk to
Todd Pratt and a two-run single by Baerga.
	   Dennis Cook (6-3) got one out for the victory. Mel Rojas, traded
from Chicago last year, protected a one-run lead in the eighth.
 &UR; Braves 3, Pirates 0
	   In Pittsburgh, John Smoltz pitched a three-hitter for his first
shutout in nearly a year, and Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer
to power the Atlanta Braves past the Pirates 3-0.
	   The Braves' 68-35 record is the best in club history through 103
games and includes a 6-1 record against the Pirates, who had won
six of seven. The Braves have outscored the Pirates 37-11 and have
outhomered them 12-4.
	   Galarraga's two-run shot in the fifth off Chris Peters (4-8) was
his 33rd of the season and his 30th against the Pirates, including
three this season. He had a two-homer game in Pittsburgh on April
8.
	   Galarraga drove in all three Braves' runs, putting them ahead
1-0 in the first with a force-play grounder following Tony
Graffanino's one-out double and Chipper Jones' single. Graffanino
went 2-for-4 while batting second in the Braves' order for only the
fourth time this season.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Marlins 4, 12 innings, 1st game
	   In Philadelphia, Scott Rolen hit a two-run homer in the 12th
inning as the Phillies rallied for a win over the Florida Marlins
in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   After Bobby Abreu's one-out single, Rolen hit his 19th homer on
a 1-1 pitch by Antonio Alfonseca (2-2).
	   The Marlins have lost six straight.
	   Wayne Gomes (9-3) pitched the 12th inning to earn his major
league-leading ninth relief victory as the Phillies (52-48) rallied
for their 30th come-from-behind win this season.
 &UR; Brewers 10, Expos 7, 1st game
	   In Milwaukee, Mark Loretta homered and tied his career high with
four RBIs and Dave Nilsson and Jose Valentin hit home runs as the
Brewers beat the Montreal Expos in the first game of a
doubleheader.
	   The loss extended the Expos' losing streak to a season-high
eight games.
	   Plate umpire Jim Quick ejected Brewers starting pitcher Jeff
Juden after Shane Andrews hit a solo home run with two outs in the
fifth. Juden had a running feud with Quick about called pitches
that escalated into the pitcher's second ejection of the season.
	   David Weathers (3-4) came on and gave up a run-scoring single to
Derrick May and Vladimir Guerrero's 22nd home run.

Floyd shoots second straight 70 in U.S. Senior Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with completion of second round &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Overjoyed with another 70 in the 19th U.S.
Senior Open, Raymond Floyd said he'd gladly take two more.
	   In search of his first Senior Open championship, Floyd took a
two-shot lead halfway through the tournament by carding his second
straight 1-under-par 70 on Friday for a 36-hole score of 140.
	   ``In a minute,'' Floyd quickly replied when asked if he would be
satisfied to repeat on Saturday and Sunday what he accomplished in
the first two rounds.
	   ``You bet I'm pleased,'' he said. ``I hit a lot of fairways
today, I hit a lot of solid shots. I might have even played better
today than I played yesterday.''
	   Floyd's first-round performance over the par-71 Riviera course
was the only under-par score of the day, and it gave him a one-shot
lead over five golfers.
	   Two of those five _ Bruce Summerhays and club pro Roy Vucinich _
each shot even-par 71 for the second straight day on Friday, giving
them 142 totals.
	   Summerhays would have fared even better had he not bogeyed the
final three holes, but he wasn't dismayed.
	   ``Even-par after two rounds on this golf course is great,'' he
said. ``I'm not going to dwell on it.''
	   Next at 143 were Dave Stockton, who had a 1-under-par 70 in the
second round, and Isao Aoki, who had a 71.
	   Four shots off the pace entering Saturday's third round of the
72-hole event were Gibby Gilbert and Brian Barnes, each of whom had
their second straight 72; Hugh Baiocchi, who had a 73; and Vicente
Fernandez, who had a 71.
	   The scores were a bit lower than on Thursday, when the average
was 78.903 _ the highest first-round average in the history of
seniors golf.
	   Pre-tournament favorite Hale Irwin rebounded from a 77, his
worst round of the year, to shoot a 68 in the second round _ the
best score through two rounds of the tournament.
	   Irwin's total of 145 was five shots off the pace. He was tied
with Gil Morgan, who ranks second behind Irwin on the senior tour
earnings list and was also considered a pre-tournament favorite.
	   Also at 145 were Jose Maria Canizares and Bob Murphy.
	   ``I kept it in play today and made some great saves,'' said
Irwin, who had three birdies in the only bogey-free round of the
tournament. ``It was a great round. I probably need one more of
those. At least I got myself into position.''
	   In the group at 146 were Jack Nicklaus, who at 58 is attempting
to become the oldest winner of the Senior Open, and John Mahaffey,
who shot 70 in the second round.
	   Nicklaus, who had a 72 in the second round, said his arthritic
left hip didn't bother him nearly as much as it did Thursday.
	   ``I started out this morning, I didn't think I could walk the
first two, three holes, then whoosh, it went away,'' he said. ``It
didn't bother me at all the last 12, 13 holes.''
	   However, his play did.
	   ``I played better than I played yesterday. I still don't think I
played very well,'' Nicklaus said. ``I had opportunities all day
long and didn't do much. And I putted atrociously.''
	   The field was cut to the low 63 at the conclusion of Friday's
round. It took a score of 154 _ 12-under-par _ to qualify. Among
those missing the cut were defending champion Graham Marsh (155),
Hubert Green (155), Larry Laoretti (156), Peter Oosterhuis (156)
and Chi Chi Rodriguez (159).
	   Marsh had a double bogey-6 on the 18th hole including a whiff.
	   Floyd, 55, who ranks 16th on the senior tour earnings list with
$471,692, was under par in the first round thanks mainly to birdies
on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes.
	   He also birdied the 15th and 16th holes on Friday, and would
have repeated his trifecta had he not missed a putt for birdie on
17.

Lawsuit filed against agent Cubas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A federal lawsuit accuses baseball agent Joe Cubas
of violating a contract involving the representation of Cuban
defector Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who now pitches for the
New York Yankees.
	   Thomas Cronin of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, accuses Cubas of
reneging on an agreement to pay him one-third of his commission for
Hernandez's dlrs 6.6 million contract.
	   Hernandez confided to Cronin about wanting to defect, according
to the lawsuit. Cronin says he met with Cubas and they drafted a
contract agreeing to share the commission when Hernandez signed
with a major-league team. Cronin then recommended to Hernandez that
he hire Cubas.
	   The dispute became public this week as Cubas spearheads a bid to
buy the Florida Marlins from Wayne Huizenga.
	   ``The allegations are totally unfounded, and we question the
timing of Mr. Cronin's filing of the lawsuit,'' said Cubas
spokesman Rene Guim. ``Mr. Cronin had absolutely nothing to do with
Orlando Hernandez signing with Joe and having Joe represent him.
That will be proven in court.''

Rahal has love-hate relationship with Michigan Speedway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Bobby Rahal isn't shy when describing
how he feels about driving at Michigan Speedway.
	   If he qualifies Saturday for the U.S. 500, it'll be his 23rd
race on the 2-mile (3-kilometer) superspeedway.
	   ``It's one of those places I always thank God when I walk out
of,'' Rahal said. ``The place is a speedrome if there ever was one.
It's one of those places you really don't look forward to going to,
because it's so fast and the risk factor is so high.
	   ``And yet, when you get there and get going, the next thing you
know, you're caught up in it and you want to be the fastest.''
	   While he has never won a 500-mile (800-kilometer) race at
Michigan, Rahal has come close, finishing second in 1988 and 1990.
During last year's U.S. 500, he was running second before a crash
knocked him out of the race.
	   ``I was passing him (Dennis Vitolo) high and he moved just
enough,'' Rahal said. ``That was all she wrote. I knew it was going
to be big. I hit a ton. The car was definitely strong _ strong
enough to win. It was a lot of fun while it lasted.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FINALLY: &LR;  It was beginning to look like Christian Fittipaldi
was not going to get a chance to test his Swift-Ford with the new
Handford Device, a wing-like aerodynamic piece designed to reduce
car speeds on superspeedways.
	   The device will be used in a race for the first time in Sunday's
U.S. 500.
	   Fittipaldi was supposed to test at Michigan last month but was
thwarted by rain. On Friday, he went out in the first practice
session with his primary car, which developed a gear box problem.
He then went to his backup car and was forced out with an engine
problem. In addition, Fittipaldi had a new crew chief as Pedro
Campuzano was filling in for Kevin Chambers, who was out due to
illness.
	   The Brazilian driver finally was able to test the device during
the afternoon practice. Fittipaldi had the 10th-fastest lap in the
session at 228.419 mph (365.470 kmph)
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NEW SYMBOL: &LR;  The New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol for
Championship Auto Racing Teams Inc., is changing from OPW to MPH,
effective Monday, CART officials announced Friday.
	   ``MPH is a natural choice for a company such as ours,'' said
Andrew Craig, CART chairman and chief executive officer. ``At the
time of the initial public offering, we knew that MPH would become
available to us. We are delighted to make the change.''
	   CART, which went public early this year, is the first
race-sanctioning organization to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
	   Other auto racing-related companies listed on stock exchanges
include Penske Motorsports Inc. Co., (NASDAQ: SPWY), Speedway
Motorsports Inc. (NYSE: TRK) and International Speedway Corp.
(NASDAQ: ISCA).
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG BUCKS: &LR;  The winner of the pole position for Sunday's race
will take home an extra dlrs 285,000 if he should also be lucky
enough to capture the 250-lap race.
	   The Marlboro Pole Award rewards dlrs 10,000 to the pole winner
at each race. If the pole-sitter goes on to win the race, he
collects an additional dlrs 15,000. If he doesn't win, the dlrs
15,000 rolls over until someone wins from the pole. That bonus
payoff is now up to dlrs 285,000.
	   The last time a driver won from the pole was in 1997 when Alex
Zanardi took the checkered flag at Cleveland.
	   In the 17-year history of 500-mile races at Michigan Speedway,
only four drivers have won from the pole. They are Jimmy Vasser
(1996), Mario Andretti (1984), Michael Andretti (1987) and Rick
Mears (1991).

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Surgery was scheduled Saturday for a
Chinese gymnast paralyzed during a practice vault at the Goodwill
Games.
	   Doctors were to try to stabilize the spine of Sang Lan, 17, in a
six-hour operation at Nassau County Medical Center, according to
Dr. Brock Schnebel, the games' chief medical officer.
	   Sang's parents were expected to arrive from China late Saturday.
Schnebel said Friday night that all final consent forms had been
arranged for the gymnast through the Chinese team.
	   Schnebel said Sang's condition was unchanged from when she was
brought to the hospital following Tuesday night's accident. The
1997 Chinese national vault champion struck the mat with her head,
fracturing and dislocating two neck vertebrae and leaving her with
no movement in her legs. Doctors said it was unlikely she would
walk again.
	   ``She's gaining in her undertsanding of what is happening, and
is maintaining a good attitude,'' Schnebel said. ``As you can
imagine, this would be very difficult for anyone _ especially a
teenager.''
	   Sang was visited for 90 minutes Friday by Dennis Byrd, a former
defensive lineman for the New York Jets who suffered injuries
similar to the gymnast but regained the use of his legs.
	   Sang is being treated with SYGEN, an experimental drug that
helped Byrd recover so well.

Myanmar opposition leader blocked on another trip outside Yangon

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi were engaged in a standoff on a
highway Saturday morning, nearly 24 hours after police stopped the
democracy campaigner's car as she tried to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi, an aide and two drivers spent the night inside her
white sedan surrounded by barbed wire barricades, sand bags and a
contingent of soldiers about 32 miles (51 kilometers) west of the
capital.
	   This is the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner's third attempt this
month to travel outside Yangon to meet members of her political
party, the National League for Democracy.
	   The military government has stopped her every time. It has said
Suu Kyi is deliberately trying to destabilize the country with her
actions, but denied she is under house arrest or other unlawful
restrictions.
	   During an earlier attempt to travel freely outside the capital,
more than 30 soldiers lifted the Nobel laureate's white sedan with
her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   On the previous two trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was
reached where the military brought the party member Suu Kyi was
attempting to meet to her car.
	   Suu Kyi's intention this time was to travel to Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta where
local authorities are more repressive than in some other parts of
Myanmar.
	   She was stopped near Anyarsu village at about 10:15 a.m. Friday
by local police who called the military authorities.
	   Her goal, as in previous journeys, was to meet with members of
her party voted into parliament in a 1990 election the military
refused to honor despite pledging before the poll it would hand
over power to the winners.
	   That was before the NLD captured 82 percent of the seats.
	   She has been telling them not to obey a military order that the
lawmakers report to the authorities twice a day. The military
ordered them to report under the ``Habitual Offenders Act'' a law
reserved for those considered heinous criminals by the government.
	   She also hoped to give encouragement to families of party
members who have been jailed by the military government.
	   Suu Kyi's party has sent an official letter of protest about
using the Habitual Offenders Act against her party's
representatives to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the military
government.
	   He has not replied.
	   Of the 392 NLD members of parliament 181 are either in jail,
exile, been disqualified by the military-run election commission,
been forced under pressure to resign from the party or have died.
	   The NLD has said the rest are living under constant harassment
by the military.
	   The military denies the charges of harassment and says it never
intended to hand over power to the election winners.

Two policemen critically injured by landmine near Cambodian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two Thai policemen on a joint training
exercise with the military near the Cambodian border were
critically injured when they stepped on a landmine, the Bangkok
Post reported Saturday.
	   The officers stepped on the mine Friday in northeastern Surin
province about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border.
	   Cambodia is one of the most heavily mined nations on earth, and
for many years the main base of the radical Marxist Khmer Rouge
guerilla group, which laid mines as a primary means of defense, was
located just across the border from Surin.
	   Four Thai soldiers have been injured by landmines near the
Cambodian border this month.

Landslides kill eight, flash floods claim three lives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A pair of landslides two hours apart
killed eight people and injured six others in northern Vietnam, a
local government official said Saturday.
	   The first slide, at 7 a.m Friday, buried houses of three
families from the Hmong ethnic minority, said an official from the
Sapa district People's Committee in Lao Cai province. Six people
were killed and two injured.
	   One body has been recovered and search efforts were continuing
for others.
	   Two hours later at the same place, two local tourists were
killed by another landslide and four others were injured as they
tried to flee the scene, the official said. The two bodies have
been recovered.
	   The slides occurred after a week of heavy rain on a road built
on the slope of the mountains, halfway between the provincial town
of Lao Cai and the resort town of Sapa.
	   An estimated 2,000 cubic meters (70,000 cubic feet) of dirt and
rocks still were blocking traffic to and from Sapa on Saturday, and
continuing rain was hampering search efforts.
	   Meanwhile, flash floods killed three people in another northern
mountainous province, Lai Chau, pushing the death toll there to six
since early this month.
	   Nguyen Van Trung, an official of the Phong Tho district People's
Committee, said Saturday that two flash floods killed three people
in the district Wednesday.
	   Trung said small bridges and irrigation projects were washed
away and rice paddies were inundated. Damage was estimated at 2.5
billion dong (dlrs 200,000), a huge amount of money for a poor
district.
	   While some northern provinces are suffering from floods, the
center is suffering from heat and drought, which have dried up many
reservoirs.

Thai police hunting for Myanmar drug lord buying gold in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in northern Thailand have
launched a manhunt for a drug lord from Myanmar who has been buying
up huge quantities of gold with his narcotics money, local papers
reported Saturday.
	   The United States government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward
for the capture of the drug lord, Wei Hsueh-kang, who leads the
United Wa State Army.
	   The Wa are an ethnic group, and the UWSA has taken over much of
the opium business from another drug lord, Khun Sa, who surrendered
to Myanmar authorities in 1996.
	   The UWSA has also signed a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar
military which allows them to traffic in drugs. Myanmar's military
government has said Wei is a ``respected ethnic leader.''
	   Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of opium, the raw
material for heroin. The UWSA owns an empire of businesses in
Myanmar with a corporate headquarters in the capital Yangon.
	   Critics have said the military government is using UWSA
drug-generated investments to prop up the country's collapsing
economy.
	   Police said Wei recently entered northern Thailand through the
town of Mae Ai and has spent millions of baht (dlrs hundreds of
thousands) buying gold in the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai,
according to the Bangkok Post.
	   He was arrested by Thai police in 1987 and charged with
smuggling 680 kilograms (1,496 pounds) of heroin, but fled back to
Myanmar, then known as Burma, after being freed on bail.
