 U.S. OVES AHEAD ON RADAR FOR WIND SHEAR AT N.Y. AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-four years after a crash near Kennedy
Airport in New York alerted the world to the danger of wind shear,
New York City is finally expected to get a new radar to spot the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Every other major airport in the nation already has the
wind-shear detection system, but the Federal Aviation
Administration had been thwarted in its efforts to install it in
the New York area because of opposition from Long Island residents
and former Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who championed a system
built by a Long Island company that used a different technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with D'Amato out of office, the FAA is moving again to
install the system locally, this time in Brooklyn rather than Long
Island. But the Interior Department does not like the FAA's new
proposed location, a 1.8-acre site it owns within Floyd Bennett
Field, because the field is part of the Gateway National Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department says that building the radar, which
would detect wind shear at both Kennedy and La Guardia airports,
would be an illegal use of the park. But the FAA, in a decision
dated Monday, said that the 110-foot-square portion of the site
that it would use for the radar had no recreational value because
it was entirely surrounded by a heliport leased to the New York
Police Department for the next 25 years, and was already closed to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   The $6 million radar is a 37-foot ball on top of an 82-foot
tower, which a National Park Service spokesman said might frighten
people and prevent them from visiting the park.
</P>
<P>
   Among 47 such radars that are being erected around the country
in response to the crash at Kennedy, all but six are in full
operation, and New York's will be either last or second to last,
depending on the progress of construction near Midway Airport in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The radar ``sees'' air by sensing movements in dust or water
vapor. It looks for a phenomenon called ``microburst,'' in which
the wind blows straight down and then fans out horizontally, like
water being poured from a pitcher onto a tabletop. An aircraft
approaching a microburst would first encounter headwinds, then a
downdraft, and then tailwinds.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence can lead pilots to drop too low and hit short of
the runway, which is what happened on June 24, 1975, when Eastern
Air Lines Flight 66, a Boeing 727 inbound from New Orleans, burst
into flames and virtually disintegrated as it hit light stanchions
on approach. Much of the debris was strewn over Rockaway Boulevard.
One hundred and twelve people on board died.
</P>
<P>
   A wind-shear crash near New Orleans in July 1982 killed eight
people in their homes as well as all 145 people on the plane. The
most recent major wind-shear crash was of a USAir flight near
Charlotte, N.C., in July 1994, which killed 37.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials say privately that the system is needed urgently
in New York, but that they do not want to get in a public argument
with the Interior Department. If they cannot agree, the Justice
Department would decide. The FAA hopes to construct the system this
year and put it into operation by the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, called terminal Doppler weather radar, emits
electromagnetic energy like all radars. Because of that, no one
seems eager to have the radar as a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Park Service, Manny Strumpf, said:
``I'm not going to get into a shouting match with the FAA. We don't
know whether or not there is a safety issue here.'' But the
question, he said, is ``whether or not it appears ominous to
visitors.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Ken Caminiti spent Monday night in a hospital
near the Astros' spring headquarters and might be headed for some
time on the disabled list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After finally getting over a tough bout with the flu, Caminiti
developed an acute sinus infection that landed him at Osceola
Regional Hospital. He was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The infection was treated intravenously with antibiotics. The
possibility that the Astros might put Caminiti on the disabled list
to start the season has more to do with his lack of playing time
than anticipation of his infection lingering.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old third baseman has been out of the lineup for a
week and has played in 12 of the Astros' 25 Grapefruit League
games. Caminiti has just 28 at-bats this spring. Manager Larry
Dierker and general manager Gerry Hunsicker are concerned that
might not be enough action to get Caminiti ready to start the
season on time.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros decide to disable Caminiti, it can be retroactive
to the last exhibition game he played. He would have to miss at
least six days, meaning he could be activated April 10 when the
Astros play the Brewers at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're looking at something that appears to be a
long-term problem,'' Hunsicker said of Caminiti's infection. ``But
I think we're running out of time to get him ready. Starting him on
the disabled list is a distinct possibility. We're going to
evaluate the situation and probably make a decision by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio, who has been rooming with Caminiti
this spring, has doubts about how the gutty third baseman would
respond to starting the season on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that would go over real well with Cammy,''
Biggio said. ``Good luck on that one. This thing has been kind of
up-and-down. He was pretty bad the first night, and then he felt
better the next day. But the third day he was right back to where
he was. He was in a lot of pain. He's been sucking down
painkillers. You could just see how miserable he was (when he went
to the hospital).''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Caminiti starts the season on the disabled list, Bill
Spiers would be the opening-day third baseman, and Russ Johnson
would start the season in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hunsicker told Johnson on Tuesday he would be heading
back to Class AAA New Orleans whenever Caminiti returns. That
didn't go over too well with Johnson, who earlier in the day lost
out to Alex Diaz for the final spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping I'd make it this time, but it didn't work out.
Same thing, different year,'' said a frustrated Johnson, who
already has spent two seasons at New Orleans. ``I don't know what
to think. I guess they don't think I'm good enough to play for the
Houston Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a first-round draft pick in 1994, believes he has
accomplished all he can at Class AAA, and earlier this spring he
suggested that Hunsicker trade him if the Astros couldn't find a
spot for him on the major-league roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel out of place here,'' he said. ``But I'll keep
playing as hard as I can. I may not be good enough for them, but
I'm going to be the best I can be, and I know that's good enough to
play in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, it's the same thing. They send me down, and it's
like they take the heart right out of me. I'm bitter right now, but
I'll continue to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker understands Johnson's frustration, but he has no
intention of giving Johnson away for the sake of making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a frustrating time for Russ,'' Hunsicker said.
``He has a family to support, and he's looking for some stability.
Unfortunately, it's not going to happen for him right at this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears Caminiti's situation might give Johnson
an opportunity to be on the big-league roster, if only for a few
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not often that composers live long enough to see
their operas enter the repertory and to hear successive generations
of singers perform them. Strauss, who died in 1949 at 84, was one
of the few. Consider this: He coached the soprano Marie Wittich,
who created the daunting role of Salome in 1905, and conducted the
great Ljuba Welitsch in it nearly 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini, who lived to be only 65, had similarly rich
experiences. The year of his death, 1924, Lucrezia Bori, in her
prime, was acclaimed at the Metropolitan Opera as Mimi, a role
introduced by Cesira Ferrani in Turin 28 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But few composers in the second half of this century have been
as fortunate. Carlisle Floyd is a notable exception. In 1955 Floyd,
then a 28-year-old junior faculty member at Florida State
University, supervised the premiere of his opera ``Susannah''
there. The next year it was produced by the New York City Opera
under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf. It garnered for Floyd, who
writes his own librettos, the New York Music Critics' Circle Award
and an invitation to present the work at the Brussels World's Fair
in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure ``Susannah,'' adapted from the biblical story of
Susanna and the Elders and relocated to an isolated mountain region
of Tennessee in an unspecified present, has joined the repertory.
There have been more than 800 performances around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night it finally receives its Metropolitan Opera
premiere, with Renee Fleming in the title role. And seated in the
audience with the composer will be Phyllis Curtin, the soprano who
created the role 44 years ago, who performed it at City Opera the
next year and in some 30 other productions through the late '60s
and who remains, as Ms. Fleming put it recently, ``the benchmark''
for all who follow.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a rare gathering of creator and colleagues. And two
days ago, after the final dress rehearsal at the Met, in another
meeting of historic resonance, Floyd sat down with the two
cherished Susannahs to reflect on it all.
</P>
<P>
   These two important sopranos are separated by nearly three
generations. Ms. Curtin, 77, is living in retirement in Great
Barrington, Mass., though she continues to teach in summer at the
nearby Tanglewood Music Center. Ms. Fleming, recently turned 40, is
at the peak of her vocal artistry and popularity. It was surely her
interest in this role, which she first sang in 1993 with the Lyric
Opera of Chicago, that enticed the Met to present it.
</P>
<P>
   (This production by Robert Falls is jointly sponsored by the
Lyric Opera and the Houston Grand Opera. James Conlon conducts.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the success and popularity of ``Susannah,'' some critics
and connoisseurs have deemed it a regional work by a regional
composer. Floyd uses an operatic style that has been called verismo
with a small v, meaning not exactly an extension of the school of
Puccini and his contemporaries, but a realistic, contemporary
American equivalent. The harmonic language of ``Susannah,'' though
sometimes touched by anguished dissonance, is unabashedly tonal;
the melodic content is beguilingly lyrical and strewn with tunes
that evoke Appalachian folk music. At 90 minutes, it tells its
story concisely and directly.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Curtin, the directness is emotional and musical as well
as dramatic. ``I don't think there is anything mysteriously
psychological in this whole piece,'' she said. The depictions of
the rural characters, the fundamentalist preacher who comes to
town, the evocations of the square dance and the frenzied revival
meeting: it is all ``right there,'' she said, ``completely honest
and deeply moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curtin is confounded by those who dismiss the opera as
``Southern and folksy,'' thinking it incompatible with grand opera.
``Americans go along with the provincial Italian locale of
`Cavalleria Rusticana,''' she said, ``and they take delight in `Der
Rosenkavalier,''' which is steeped in the protocols of 18th-century
Viennese aristocratic life.

 NEW YORK: aristocratic life.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Southerners like Floyd, born in Latta, S.C., the son of an
itinerant minister, and Ms. Curtin, from Clarksburg, W.Va., the
opera's judgmental, fundamentalist characters, wary of the outside
world, fearful of differences, are familiar. ``These are the folks
I went to school with and caught the itch from,'' he said. ``I came
to really care for them.'' Ms. Curtin recalled that a family
friend, who worked for the welfare bureau, went into the hollows to
try to talk parents into vaccinating their children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming, who was born in Pennsylvania and grew up near
Rochester, may lack a geographical tie to the region of the opera,
but not a musical one. ``When I was 12, I played on the piano and
sang Susannah's lullaby, `The Trees on the Mountains,' all the
time,'' she said. ``I wanted to perform it in a student recital.
But my mother said I was a little young to be singing about the
`man who made me love him, then left me alone,' and my heart that
`wants warmin' and my baby who wants a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like the biblical Susanna, the operatic character is a
hearty, naturally sensual young woman, going on 19, who is
surprisingly centered considering the trauma of her childhood: An
orphan, she has been brought up by her older brother, Sam Polk, a
trapper with a weakness for drink (Jerry Hadley in this
production). One day, some church elders see Susannah bathing naked
in a creek by her home. Outraged, they report to the town's new
minister, Olin Blitch (Samuel Ramey).
</P>
<P>
   The town turns against her, and Little Bat, a smitten adolescent
who hangs around her house, is bullied into saying that Susannah
has allowed him to ``love her up.'' The lie serves to confirm
general suspicions about her. ``That pretty a face must hide some
evil,'' the sniping Mrs. McLean says.
</P>
<P>
   Olin Blitch visits Susannah one night while her brother is away,
intending to pressure her to repent. Instead his loneliness bursts
forth, and he entices the broken young woman into a sexual
encounter. Realizing it is her first, the guilty minister tries to
turn town opinion without revealing his own sin. It is too late.
Sam kills Blitch and escapes to the mountains, leaving Susannah
shaking with bitter laughter and completely ostracized. What will
she do? ``Live on that farm for the rest of her life and feed her
chickens,'' Ms. Curtin is convinced.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense discussions among the composer, Ms. Fleming and
Ms. Curtin involved the question of why Susannah does not resist
Blitch's seduction. And is it even a seduction at all?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming thinks Susannah is initially enchanted by Blitch
when he arrives at the square dance. ``It's like Elvis Presley has
walked in,'' she said, ``and he chooses her as a dance partner.
She's flattered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Curtin believes that Susannah was never consciously
attracted to the preacher, and is soon crushed anyway by his craven
hypocrisy. After days of being ignored yet gossiped about, Susannah
seeks comfort from her brother, saying simply, ``I cain't wait till
pretty things looks pretty agin.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Floyd said, ``this line is the definition of
depression. It's like she is waiting for a curtain to be lifted on
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming recalled: ``The first time I sang the role, I had
trouble understanding why Susannah gives in to the minister. She
sings, `I'm so tired, I just can't fight no more.' What does she
mean? It didn't make sense. I was younger then. Now I'm older,
wiser, and have suffered more knocks. I get it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming points particularly to the speech in which Susannah
tries to tell the minister that the talk of something improper
between her and Little Bat is a vicious lie. ``I never spent sich a
week as this,'' Susannah says, deeply pained and finally angry. But
the minister answers, ``That's the sin in your heart, that weight
you speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Susannah realizes that everything is hopeless, Ms.
Fleming said. ``What's the point? She is just utterly exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd believes that seduction is the wrong term for what
happens. There are two people, both defeated, he explained: she by
the false accusations; he by his hidden desire and the effort of
being so righteous all the time. ``They are drawn together out of
human and momentary weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Ms. Fleming said, lighting up. ``That's a wonderful way
to put it. That's why  &UR; you &LR;  wrote the opera.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have suggested that the way the townspeople
browbeat Little Bat into accusing Susannah is a metaphor for
McCarthy-era witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said the parallel was not conscious. ``I'm too practical a
man of theater; it just struck me as right,'' he said. ``But I did
write the work during the McCarthy years, and I lived through the
terrors. At Florida State an accusation was tantamount to guilt. We
faculty had to sign a pledge of loyalty or lose our jobs. It
affected me and informed me emotionally. And there it is in the
opera. But I can't say I put it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd left Florida State in 1976 for the University of Houston,
where he remained until his retirement. This has been a banner year
for him: in the fall the New York City Opera presented a gritty,
well-received production of his 1970 opera, ``Of Mice and Men,''
probably his second-most-performed work and most musically
adventurous score. His 12th operatic work, ``Cold Sassy Tree,'''
based on a novel by Olive Ann Burns, is scheduled for a premiere by
the Houston Grand Opera in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Susannah'' remains his milestone. ``The soprano Patricia
Racette told me that she is in opera today because as a girl she
was moved by a performance of `Susannah,''' he said. ``Comments
like that are the balm of my old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no video document of Ms. Curtin's Susannah, VAI
Audio recently released on compact disk a 1962 performance of the
opera from New Orleans with Ms. Curtin and two of her favorite
colleagues, Norman Treigle as Blitch and Richard Cassilly as Sam.
Ms. Fleming listened to every recording of Ms. Curtin in the role
that she could find. ``It means a lot to me that Phyllis Curtin
will be in the audience,'' Ms. Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   The heritage continues, as it should, Floyd said: ``The young
soprano Emily Pulley, who is covering Susannah for these
performances at the Met, told me that she is studying Renee.''  &QL;

DEVELOPER AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONTRIBUTOR MISUSED FUNDS, AUDIT
FINDS

(ATTN: Mass.)  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A real estate developer who has raised hundreds of
thousands of dollars for President Clinton and the Democratic Party
has been accused by federal officials of misappropriating $1.4
million from a troubled housing complex in the South Bronx even as
the tenements fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which holds the mortgages for the Jose DeDiego Beekman
Houses, is moving to seize the complex of 38 buildings and 1,238
apartments in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 25 years, the complex has been owned by Gerald
Schuster, general partner of the Continental Wingate Company, a
real estate company in Needham, Mass., that has rehabilitated
dilapidated buildings in New York and Massachusetts with federal
subsidies, tax breaks and low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
   According to an audit by the Inspector General's Office at HUD,
Schuster and his companies siphoned $1.4 million in funds from the
complex to pay company employees and to repay loans to his own
companies. Some of the funds were also diverted to other
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the audit were referred to the U.S. Attorney's
Office, which notified Schuster in a March 25 letter that it was
considering civil action in connection with the allegations. The
U.S. Attorney has not filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, HUD officials, who had taken control of the
Beekman Houses more than two years ago, also told the tenants that
the agency ``would formalize ownership of the properties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has taken these actions in the best interests
of the tenants and taxpayers,'' said Peter Ragone, a spokesman for
HUD. ``HUD is committed to insuring that all New Yorkers in
federally supported housing have access to a decent, clean and safe
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Eisner, a spokesman for Schuster and Continental Wingate,
said that the allegations of misappropriation of funds were
``without merit.'' He said the company had not even seen the audit
of Beekman Houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of our knowledge and ability,'' Eisner said, ``we
are in full and complete compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuster and his wife, Elaine, have contributed to, and raised
enormous sums for, the Democrats in Massachusetts and nationally.
Last year, Clinton attended a $5,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner at
the home of the Schusters in Boston.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starting in the early 1970s, Continental Wingate and its limited
partners renovated the 38 buildings that Beekman Houses comprises
with federally subsidized mortgages and later rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But in December 1996, Continental defaulted on six of the eight
mortgages for Beekman Houses. HUD then paid off $27.4 million in
loans and took control of the complex. Since then, HUD has spent
more than $15 million replacing windows and stoves, rehabilitating
500 kitchens and 450 bathrooms and making the buildings more
secure.
</P>

   Norma Allen, president of Tenants United for Better Living, said
that conditions had improved at the buildings recently. ``HUD has
been a treat,'' she said. ``We didn't know we were entitled to all
the services we're now getting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Allen and another resident of the complex said the
problems at Beekman Houses were more complex than simply a bad
management company.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighborhood was plagued by drug gangs in the 1980s and
suffered from the federal government's declining support for
housing for poor people. One woman blamed HUD's negligence for
allowing conditions to deteriorate.

PACT SETTLES SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE'S RIGHTS TO WATER 0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water for Scottsdale, water for endangered species, water for
pastures and crops and vindication for the people of Geronimo _ all
these will flow from a key Arizona Indian water-rights settlement
signed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Carlos Apache settlement will provide the impoverished
east-central Arizona tribe with rights to nearly 68,000 acre-feet
of water _ enough to serve 300,000 people a year. And, it will free
more than $50 million in economic development funds approved by the
Legislature and Congress nearly seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes' water rights have been in limbo since its
reservation was established in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the pact sets
the stage for the settlement of other Indian water-rights claims,
including the giant Gila River General Stream Adjudication, which
would settle nearly 65,000 water rights claims across central and
southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, a former Arizona governor, said he is hoping
legislation will be introduced in Congress by the end of this year
to resolve the Gila River claims, which were first filed in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now move forward and quickly to settle the remaining
water-rights disputes,'' Babbitt told nearly 50 state, federal,
tribal, city and farming representatives at a signing ceremony in
downtown Phoenix only hours before congressional authorization for
the San Carlos Apache was set to expire.
</P>
<P>
   For Velasquez W. Sneezy Sr., the tribe's vice chairman, signing
the settlement was a symbolic end to more than a century of
conflicts with Anglo culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this settlement proves that the San Carlos Apache
people still have the spirt of the warrior. This victory is going
to motivate our younger people . . . to plan for the future,''
Sneezy said of his 12,000-member tribe, whose per-capita income is
less than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   David Hays, recently nominated by President Clinton as deputy
secretary of the Interior, called the signing ``an end to the war''
between the San Carlos Apaches and other water users.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pact does not settle a continuing dispute over
water between the San Carlos Apaches and Phelps Dodge Corp., which
leases tribal water for its giant copper mine at Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   And it comes during the worst recorded drought in tribal
history. San Carlos Lake is predicted to go dry by May, unless the
state and federal government intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Carlos Apache tribal council three weeks ago petitioned
Gov. Jane Hull to declare the dwindling lake a disaster area, but
so far the governor has not acted.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal attorney Joe Sparks said nearly 4 million pounds of fish
are at risk, as well as feeding grounds for three nesting pairs of
bald eagles and two pairs of Peregrine falcons. The lake is a
world-class sports fishing destination.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement must be approved by Dec. 31 by Maricopa
County Superior Court Judge Susan K. Bolton. It would then become
part of an overall settlement of disputes over Gila River water
dating to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is approved by the courts, the tribe plans to move
forward with its plans to lease water to Scottsdale and Carefree.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana said water from the tribe will
ensure Scottsdale's ability to add an additional 100,000 residents
in the coming decades. The city's population currently is nearing
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the lease to the high-end northeast Valley cities
will provide the tribe with the money it needs to buy it allocation
of Colorado River water from the Central Arizona Project.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no way to deliver that CAP water to the
reservation, Sparks said, one possible use would be to substitute
it for water the San Carlos Irrigation District currently receives
from San Carlos Lake.
</P>
<P>
   If the water in the lake does not have to be sent downstream for
agriculture, the tribe would be able to store it for recreation,
fishing and wildlife uses, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, once the court approved Tuesday's settlement, it will
enable the tribe to begin using a $50 million economic development
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tribe's plans for the money are long-term economic and
environmental restoration efforts, including: new pasture and crop
lands; nurseries of trees to replant forests devastated by runaway
logging; cold-water fisheries and hatcheries for commercial fish;
and the re-introduction of endangered native Apache and Gila
trout. &QL;

COPS ON THE HEART BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police patrol cars have been equipped with
portable defibrillators that will allow officers to treat heart
attack victims in a potentially life-saving move that puts the
small city of San Fernando on the cutting edge of emergency
response.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other Los Angeles County police agencies, in Monrovia
and Glendora, equip squad cars with the life-saving devices. And
nationwide, only about 30 police departments send officers on
patrol with defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a benefit to our community,'' said Police Chief
Dominick Rivetti, noting that as recently as December a heart
attack victim in San Fernando died before paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to our first save. We know it's coming.
It's just a matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   With an average police response time of less than two minutes,
Rivetti said there is a greater chance for his officers to
encounter life-and-death situations on the street than for officers
in larger cities. The department serves nearly 24,000 residents in
a 2.4-square-mile city neighboring Los Angeles. Rivetti estimated
his officers encounter as many as six heart attack victims a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology complements our response time, and our response
time complements the technology. It's a real good marriage,''
Rivetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby agencies that do not equip officers out with
defibrillators offer a variety of reasons. Officials for the
Glendale Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department said they prefer to rely on firefighters and paramedics
to treat cardiac arrest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department opted not to buy the
defibrillators because reviews showed it is necessary to arrive
within five minutes of a heart attack to put the defibrillator to
use, said LAPD spokesman Osmund Bouligny.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD response time in the San Fernando Valley averages eight
minutes but reaches nine minutes in the Foothill and Devonshire
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major concern was the time, and our basic response time is
longer than the Fire Department's,'' said Bouligny.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing four pounds, the defibrillator purchased in San
Fernando is the size of a laptop computer and has easy-to-use
features, such as a computerized voice that guides users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one more tool in our toolbox,'' said Sgt. Alan
Cowen, who oversees San Fernando's defibrillator program.
</P>
<P>
   The machine essentially restores the victim's heartbeat by
delivering an electric shock to the heart via the chest. The
defibrillator is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard and sold by
Laerdal Medical Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Though long used by paramedics and fire departments, the
defibrillator has been put to use in police departments only within
the last year, said Cowen, adding that now airlines also carry
defibrillators for overseas flights.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 1,000 people die each day of cardiac arrest, said
Cowen, a former deputy fire chief and paramedic chief for the Los
Angeles Fire Department, which provides paramedic services to San
Fernando from two stations outside city limits.
</P>
<P>
   He said about 950 of the 1,000 could have been saved if a
defibrillator had been available within a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando City Council appropriated $13,000 _ $3,000 each
for three defibrillators, plus training expenses _ on the
recommendation of a police advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything dealing with public safety, the City Council has
never refused,'' said San Fernando Mayor Jose Hernandez. ``If you
can save one person, that's money well spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though defibrillators are not yet widely used by police
departments, the council did not question the necessity, said
Hernandez, who a day earlier had taken his wife to the hospital
because of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you'll need this type of service,''
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivetti praised the council's willingness to take a chance on
the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council provided the leadership and resources and
faith in our officers to give them the equipment to use,'' said
Rivetti, who oversees 37 regular officers and 40 reserve officers,
all of whom have been trained to use the device.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The trophy case no doubt was already being
dusted.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke Blue Devils might have been practicing acceptance
speeches. The comparisons to past teams with similarly overwhelming
greatness were streaming in.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell's San Francisco. Lew Alcindor's UCLA. Bill Walton's
UCLA. Bobby Knight's 1976 Indiana. Christian Laettner's Duke.
</P>
<P>
   With every Blue Devils victory in the march through March _ by
20, 30 points _ two words consistently echoed across the college
basketball landscape.
</P>
<P>
   With every burly spin by Elton Brand or sweet swish by Trajan
Langdon, the words draped themselves around the Devils like the
freshly clipped basketball nets they were supposed to wear as
victory necklaces Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Best ever?
</P>
<P>
   The Devils wore the words well. They never wavered. They looked
unbeatable. They were 37-1. They won 32 straight. They were the
first Atlantic Coast Conference team to sweep to a 16-0 league
record.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow it was the Blue Devils who were dusted on a
Connecticut Monday night that was as cool and refreshing as the
gulf breezes outside Tropicana Field and the jolly smile on Khalid
El-Amin's face.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was a shocking Duke loss and a fascination with
finding a reason why the Devils finally cracked.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils were so good _ the best ever, many thought _
that the 77-74 loss to Connecticut had to be self-inflicted. Didn't
it? It had to be one of the greatest upsets ever. Didn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to other great teams that failed at the brink of
glory were made. Images of Villanova shocking Georgetown in 1985
and North Carolina State dropping Houston in 1983 were flashed
across television screens.
</P>
<P>
   The critical traveling call on Langdon with 5.4 seconds
remaining was likened to past blunders such as Michigan forward
Chris Webber's timeout that wasn't in 1993 and the bungled pass of
Georgetown's Freddie Brown to North Carolina's James Worthy in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski's decision to give the ball to
Langdon in the final seconds was questioned like other fateful
moments _ Houston's Akeem Olajuwon drifting to the top of the lane
as Lorenzo Charles sneaked behind for the winning bucket in 1983,
or Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim failing to call time out after
Indiana's Keith Smart hit the go-ahead shot in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a blunder. This was not a questionable decision
or the fates finally laughing back.
</P>
<P>
   And if this was a shocker, the shock is that we did not see it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of UConn's national championship win Monday, we
can realize now that we saw exactly what the basketball world
expected to see. We saw a showcase for one of the best college
basketball teams ever.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jim Calhoun's Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people were saying so many great things about Duke, I
understood because I was saying a lot of the same things,'' Calhoun
said. ``They are truly a great basketball team. But I knew we were
a great team, too. I'm not shocked at what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing about Duke's loss should be considered
self-inflicted, because nothing about Connecticut's amazing effort
in Monday's win was different from what it had showed all year.
</P>
<P>
   While the basketball world marveled at the talent and depth of
the Blue Devils, Calhoun was fielding a team that had maybe the
best pure scorer, toughest point guard and best defender in the
NCAA Tournament _ Richard Hamilton, El-Amin and Ricky Moore.
</P>
<P>
   While depth was considered Duke's strength, Connecticut got more
minutes (43-24), more points (17-8) and more rebounds (8-1) from
more players off its bench (4-3) Monday night, as the Huskies had
done all year.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke was rolling to a 37-1 record going into Monday
night's championship, Connecticut was 33-2 before Monday, with one
of the losses coming when Hamilton and center Jake Voskuhl were out
with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding plays in the championship game will be replayed for
years and perhaps even called Duke blunders. There was the
traveling call on Langdon and his crash to the ground later in the
desperate final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not blunders or mistakes at all. They were plays
that showed just how great Jim Calhoun's Connecticut was in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The travel didn't just happen; Moore made it happen by wrapping
himself around Langdon with arms and legs flailing and the great
Duke guard cracking. El-Amin coolly hit back-to-back free throws.
Then Moore again harassed Langdon until the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. Positively. Absolutely. I want Trajan Langdon to
take the last shot,'' Krzyzewski later explained about the final
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he did. And he should have. Langdon was one of the
best players on a truly great team _ truly great.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Calhoun's Connecticut was better. And maybe we even
should call it one of the best ever.

GIULIANI SAYS CRACKDOWN ON DRUNKEN DRIVERS CUTS ACCIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first month that the New York Police
Department began seizing the cars of drunken drivers, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Tuesday that the program had been a successful
deterrent, leading to drops in arrests for driving while
intoxicated and in related automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mayor said, the police have impounded cars
in less than half of the cases in which they arrested drivers on
charges of being intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Between the start of the program, on Feb. 22, and last Thursday,
342 people were arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated,
but the police seized only 164 vehicles, or about 48 percent of
those involved in arrests, according to Police Department
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 178 vehicles that were not seized under the program after
drunken driving arrests, 149 belonged to individuals other than the
accused driver, 12 were leased cars, six were rental cars and 11
were marked as evidence of other crimes, such as car theft.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that the police will confiscate far fewer
than the 5,000 cars that some officials had predicted would be
seized this year. Between March 25 and Tuesday, 47 more people were
arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated and 17 cars were
seized, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday morning at a police auto pound in
Brooklyn, Giuliani said that overall arrests for drunken driving
had declined more than 25 percent compared with the same period
last year. Drunken driving arrests had dropped 7 percent in 1998
when compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said the number of accidents caused by drunken
driving had declined to 110 from 179 in the same one-month period
last year, or about 38.5 percent. ``The results have been really
very, very impressive,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also offered new statistics to support the toughest
aspect of the program, that even cars belonging to first-time
offenders are seized. He said first-time offenders had caused 80 to
90 percent of drunken driving fatalities in the United States last
year. And he said first-time offenders had caused the only two
drunken driving fatalities in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is to take a 3,000-pound weapon out of the hands
of what is in fact a violent criminal, somebody who drives drunk,''
said Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who attended the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group
whose cars were among the first seized under the new program, said
Giuliani had overstepped his authority by starting the policy
without seeking a change in forfeiture laws from the state
Legislature. .

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ High Wire Act has joined the field for
Saturday's Santa Anita Derby, and although he isn't the horse to
beat, he is the one to catch.
</P>
<P>
   The John Shirreffs-trained gelding zoomed to a seven-length lead
and finished third behind Prime Timber and Exploit when he was
ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye in the March 13 San Felipe Stakes. The
son of End Sweep will be the only confirmed front-runner in the
1[-mile Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll ride him Saturday was undetermined Tuesday, with Chris
McCarron a possibility if he doesn't end up with General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   High Wire Act, owned by 505 Farms, has won two of three starts.
He encouraged Shirreffs by working 7 furlongs in 1:252/5 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bob Baffert withdrew Finder's Gold, who worked 6
furlongs in a slow 1:13 on Monday. The trainer still has favorite
Prime Timber and General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Others expected to be entered Thursday morning: Desert Hero,
Honest Lady and Capsized.

PHOENIX POLICE HONOR ONE MAN WHO USED WEAPON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One man is called a hero after he blasts 14 rounds into a car of
three Mexican nationals suspected of killing a Phoenix policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The police union gives him a $500 reward and a certificate for a
replacement gun at an emotional ceremony Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another man opens fire, along with police, on a suspect in the
shooting death of a girl in a north Phoenix apartment complex on
Peoria Avenue three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police never even released his name.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the rules for good Samaritans when police officers
are in distress?
</P>
<P>
   It's actually quite simple, says Sgt. Mike Torres, a Phoenix
police spokesman. The citizen's actions must be legal and police
must need the help.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Vertigan, who was transported to and from Tuesday's
ceremony by a police escort, acted legally in firing on the car
with the men who are accused of killing Officer Marc Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects aimed his weapon at Vertigan. Vertigan's
help also was important to police because Atkinson was alone in his
police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Vertigan's help, police were able to quickly nab
Felipe Petrona Cabanas, his cousin Oberline Cabanas Salgado and
Oscar Martinez Garcia. Each was indicted on counts of first-degree
murder, aggravated assault and drug charges by a Maricopa County
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The man on Peoria Avenue also felt in danger and had legal
justification to fire on Samuel Rotondo. Rotondo was indicted for
first-degree murder in the shooting death of 11-year-old Rebecca
Ray last December. But the civilian shooter's actions weren't
needed since there were many police officers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police also didn't know if the man was friend or foe, and his
gunfire presented problems because it came in a heavily populated
area, Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases, the help is not potentially dangerous for
innocent bystanders and saves an officer's life.
</P>
<P>
   Like the case of Officer Lyn Butcher, who had her pistol
wrestled from her by a man she had stopped at a DUI checkpoint
March 22. He fired three or four rounds at her but was distracted
by a man who charged at him after seeing Butcher in distress.
</P>
<P>
   That man turned out to be 24-year-old Francisco Diaz Sedilla,
who also was honored with Vertigan and presented with a $1,000
reward. Butcher later sobbed as she was embraced by Diaz and said,
``Without him I would be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, a gardener who moved to Phoenix four years ago from the
Mexican state of Jalisco, said the rules of engagement for taking
on a bad guy who could have killed a police officer were easy for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw a woman on the ground and a big man over her firing
shots,'' Diaz said. ``I don't care who the woman is, in that type
of situation I will help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who was unarmed, charged 34-year-old Parviz Amin Zavosh of
Scottsdale, who fired two shots in Diaz's direction, narrowly
missing his leg, Diaz said. Zavosh then fled in his vehicle and was
killed by police later at his home in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the two officers prompted city officials to
commit two patrol officers to each vehicle citywide during the most
dangerous times, from 3 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Skip Rimsza said 77 more police officers will be hired at
an anticipated cost to the city of $3.5 million annually. Rimsza
said that the city would be applying for a matching grant to the
federal Department of Justice and that ``we could really struggle``
if state funding is cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every city in this state should go to two-officer cars,''
Rimsza said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a given, said police officers from around the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As for citizens getting involved to help officers, they say
common sense is of utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, the last two in Phoenix have turned out well, but I
don't recommend anyone taking the law into their own hands,'' said
Sgt. Dave Moyers of Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. ``The most
important thing for citizens is to be another set of eyes and ears
for license numbers, description of the suspects and what direction
they went.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Andy Vidaure, a state DPS spokesman, noted that a state
statute requires citizens to help officers if the police ask them
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult call, though, for a citizen to say if
they should jump in or not,'' Vidaure said. ``Especially if
handguns are involved because that can get real ugly real fast. If
a citizen feels up to a situation physically and wants to lend a
hand, they need to be sure and announce that they are there to help
the officer.'' &QL;

GOING STRONG AT 85 
A CARDINAL'S VOW 
BOOK STARS ON TV

<P>
   NEW YORK _ How big would the round table at the Algonquin Hotel
have to be to hold the crowd at Budd Schulberg's birthday party?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious answer is, bigger than it is. After all, Schulberg
collaborated with F. Scott Fitzgerald in his 20s, wrote the script
for ``On the Waterfront'' in his 30s, managed prizefighters in his
40s _ and celebrated his 85th birthday on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Algonquin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there with Dorothy Parker, not early when she was part
of the round table, but later,'' Schulberg said. ``I went there
with Bill Faulkner.'' And, improbable as it sounds, considering the
Algonquin's elegant reputation, he put up a heavyweight, Archie
McBride, there before a 1955 bout at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list for the party was ``a cross-section of people
I've known over the years,'' Schulberg said. They included
Christopher Plummer, who appeared in the 1958 film ``Wind Across
the Everglades,'' which Schulberg wrote and produced; Jason Robards
Jr., who won a Tony Award for his role in Schulberg's play ``The
Disenchanted''; Patricia Kennedy Lawford (``I worked for her
brother, Bobby Kennedy,'' he said); Phyllis Cerf Wagner, whose
first husband, Bennett Cerf, published Schulberg's first book,
``What Makes Sammy Run?'', and Elia Kazan, who directed ``On the
Waterfront.'' Also on hand were Schulberg's wife, Betsy, and their
children, Benn and Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday cake had two Oscarlike statues on top, and
Schulberg invited Kazan to join him in blowing out the candles.
Kazan, whose 90th birthday is six months away, received an honorary
Academy Award last week that reignited the controversy about his
having named names in the 1950s, when the House Un-American
Activities Committee was investigating Communist influences in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that in all the brouhaha of these last weeks, there was
so much emphasis on that political situation that people lost sight
of the work he'd done,'' Schulberg said. ``His pictures, 15 or 16
of them, are artistically four stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulberg also said that he had promised to ``stay in shape to
punch Rod Steiger in the nose for his comments about Kazan.''
(Before the Oscars, Steiger made the rounds of talk shows,
denouncing the decision to give Kazan the Oscar.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it jokingly,'' Schulberg said. ``It was a positive sort
of an evening.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinal's Vow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor looked out at the television cameras and
reporters during a special Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Tuesday night and made a not-so-solemn vow:
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise I will never, never again write a letter saying this
will be my final anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few months the cardinal has been dropping hints
that he would step down imminently, and when he invited all the
priests in the archdiocese to Tuesday night's ceremony (the Chrism
Mass, which celebrates the priesthood), he wrote them that it might
be the last one he would perform as cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal submitted his resignation to the pope on his 75th
birthday in 1995, as required by church law, but it was not acted
upon.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he will turn 80, at which point he will lose his
vote in Vatican councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you expect me to announce my retirement and my
successor, all I can do is give you the phone number of His
Holiness,'' O'Connor said Tuesday night _ and went on with his
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Book Stars on TV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of everyone at the QVC television shopping
network, where ``book'' is a verb used to describe the act of
cajoling big-name guests into agreeing to go on the air, one of the
hot sellers during the program ``Live on Fifth Avenue'' on Sunday
was not a lava lamp or a cubic zirconium necklace, but a book.
Something with pages that could be read.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Library Desk Reference, to be specific. Some
850 copies were sold in 2 minutes 54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul LeClerc, president of the library, noted that the Desk
Reference has long been the biggest seller at the library's gift
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he surprised that the library's $799 chairs _
made-to-order reproductions of those in the main reading room _
drew hundreds of calls to QVC. ``One person who recently came here
for a visit obviously shared my passion for the chairs and promptly
ordered 12 for his dining room,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 31:
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Russian peacemaking and the unabated Serbian
assault on Kosovo on Tuesday left the United States and its NATO
allies understandably frustrated. After a week of bombing raids,
the alliance's air offensive against Serbia has not produced the
quick capitulation by Slobodan Milosevic that President Clinton and
European leaders hoped to see. As additional warplanes were ordered
into combat this week, and tactics were adjusted to target Serbian
army forces on the ground in Kosovo, it is reasonable to wonder if
NATO commanders prepared a sufficiently intense and extensive
aerial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from NATO headquarters in Brussels suggest that
military planners there and at the Pentagon presumed several nights
of limited missile attacks and bombing runs against Serbian targets
would convince Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo. His
history of retreating when under fire might have added to that
expectation. But as President Clinton and other NATO leaders direct
the fight against Serbia, they must now insist that more air power
be brought into play, even if some NATO members are uneasy about a
more aggressive aerial offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the first objective of air strikes had to be the
destruction of Serbia's air defenses, military planners should have
prepared to accomplish that job more quickly so aircraft and
helicopters could move against Serbian tanks, artillery and ground
forces in Kosovo. The ferocity of the Serbian sweep across Kosovo
seems to have surprised NATO, which only this week made its first
efforts to attack these Serbian ground forces in the field. NATO
commanders have now wisely decided to conduct round-the-clock air
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Milosevic is clearly not interested in a diplomatic
solution to the Kosovo crisis. If he were, he would have made much
better use of Tuesday's visit to Belgrade by Russia's prime
minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Diplomatic efforts must continue, and
Russia's historical ties to Serbia can make it an important
interlocutor. But no progress will be possible until Milosevic
takes a more serious approach to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's diplomatic offer Tuesday was unacceptable. He said
he would withdraw some forces from Kosovo, allow the resettlement
of some refugees and resume negotiations over the province's future
if NATO halts its air strikes. Western leaders were right to reject
the proposal. Instead of partial withdrawals, Milosevic should be
talking about immediately withdrawing all Yugoslav troops and
police from Kosovo. Instead of starting negotiations afresh, he
should be talking about ways to carry out the internationally
sponsored plan for Kosovo's autonomy under the protection of a
large multinational force. Until he does so, NATO must muster all
the air power it can and use it against Milosevic's murderous
troops.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 31:
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Amadou Diallo was killed in a hail of 41 police
bullets almost two months ago, the unarmed West African's death has
become a racial benchmark in New York City. The shooting has
provoked the arrests of more than 1,200 demonstrators at
police &UR;  &LR; headquarters. It has forced changes in police policies,
including an overhaul of the Street Crimes Unit, where the four
policemen worked, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made his first
efforts to meet with black leaders and even hear out some of his
most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as this divisive case moves into the legal system,
with second-degree murder indictments of the policemen expected
Wednesday, a troubling debate about the Diallo legacy is spreading
into the public dialogue. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir are talking about a slight uptick in shootings and murders in
New York City, and Safir has questioned whether ``this whole
atmosphere'' after the Diallo shooting might be affecting the
ability of the police to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is also sending a message that protesters and the
media coverage of the Diallo affair could be dangerously
distracting the police, sapping their confidence. One unfortunate
implication is that only the old way worked and that tampering with
past police practices could mean a return to the destructively high
rates of crime and fear in the city. Do it our way, this message
suggests, or suffer.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts have argued that vigorous policing does not
need to ignite community anger or limit civil rights, that security
does not require bullies or necessitate verbal and physical abuse.
A recent report from the Vera Institute of Justice in New York City
makes that point expertly with a study of two police precincts in
the South Bronx where crime is down but so are civilian complaints
about verbal or physical abuse by police.
</P>
<P>
   The institute found that the success of these precincts in
dealing with their communities depended heavily on the attitude of
the commanding officers. In these two areas, the precinct
commanders not only followed department policies for ``respectful
policing,'' they also went beyond the requirements with more
training and careful managing of personnel. For example, when there
were civilian complaints, these two commanding officers took them
seriously, often talking about the problems directly with the
officers involved. Younger officers charged with complaints or even
``displaying attitude problems'' were paired with officers
experienced in policing without antagonizing the public.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which deserves more study at 1 Police Plaza,
concludes that these successful precincts prove that ``large
reductions in crime can be achieved while practicing respectful
policing.'' The city should not be forced to choose more crime or
more civilian complaints. We deserve neither.

BARNES WINS IN LANDSLIDE FOR KC MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
   
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kay Waldo Barnes celebrated her 61st birthday
Tuesday by winning election as Kansas City's first woman mayor.
</P>
<P>
   She defeated two-term Councilman George Blackwood by a decisive
59 percent to 41 percent in a race that gave voters a choice
between maintaining the city's current direction, or trying to
improve basic services while controlling spending.
</P>
<P>
   The vote with, 100 percent of precincts reporting, was 45,146
for Barnes and 31,319 for Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who will be inaugurated April 10, campaigned as both an
experienced politician and an outsider with fresh ideas and a
creative approach to the city's problems. She spent more than a
year laying the groundwork for an aggressive, well-financed and
well-organized campaign, and she led in the polls since December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about the election results and deeply
appreciative of the opportunity to serve as mayor of Kansas City,''
Barnes said Tuesday night. ``I take the responsibility very
seriously and will do everything I can to be the kind of mayor of
whom the city will be very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood said simply:``I gave it my best shot. Everybody worked
real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' victory will go down in the history books because of her
gender. That fact appeared not to be lost on women voters, who
backed Barnes by better than a 2-to-1 ratio in a mid-March poll
conducted by The Kansas City Star. The poll had Barnes and
Blackwood attracting about the same amount of support from men.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blackwood trailed Barnes in the polls, in the two weeks
before the primary his campaign became more focused as he salvaged
a second-place finish among six candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed the course and, as the weeks passed, his campaign
gained momentum, especially as he emphasized how he would carry
forward the agenda of Mayor Emanuel Cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver, who never publicly endorsed Blackwood but who supported
his candidacy, declined to comment Tuesday night on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks since the primary, Barnes and Blackwood had
endured intense campaign schedules, participating in dozens of
debates, fund-raisers and small group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They clashed over many issues, particularly the mayor's role in
the Kansas City School District, the city's approach to
neighborhoods, and strategies for cutting the city budget.
</P>
<P>
   They traded potshots over their television commercials. But in
person they were always cordial to each other, and they each shared
strong connections to the city's power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has spent 30 years building a management consulting and
public-speaking business. She also was a pioneer in Kansas City's
women's movement, serving as one of two women on the 13-member
Jackson County Legislature from 1974 to 1978 and as one of two
women on the nine-member Kansas City Council from 1979 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her re-election bid in 1983 and got out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she was appointed to the city's Tax Increment Financing
Commission, which reviews tax breaks for major developers. She was
chairwoman of the commission until 1998, and people impressed with
her leadership style encouraged her to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes quietly began exploring the idea more than a year ago and
began campaigning in earnest more than six months ago. She had more
than 1,600 campaign contributors and picked up most of the major
endorsements. She even enlisted the help of her famous cousin,
retired CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   In her campaign, Barnes said her priorities included ending the
perception of corruption at City Hall, improving basic neighborhood
services and controlling spending to rein in the city's $881
million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood, 59, ran his campaign as though he were the incumbent,
describing the positive aspects of Kansas City and stoically
sitting through Barnes' criticisms during debates and forums.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackwood did engage Barnes through his campaign
commercials, making light of her record as a council member and
attacking her for participating in closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood's general election campaign concentrated on such
issues as economic development and public safety. His platform
recommended forming a committee to study whether to change the
Kansas City Board of Education from an elected body to one
appointed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes heavily criticized him for interfering with the school
district rather than supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood got off to a rough start in the general election race
when he appeared at a campaign event with alcohol on his breath and
accepted a ride to his next stop from a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   But he rebounded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   His latest campaign finance disclosures showed that he had
raised almost as much money as Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Barnes apparently offered the right combination
of qualities. She was a fresh face with a hands-on background at
City Hall. Her enthusiasm on the campaign trail didn't hurt,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw her as new but experienced,'' political consultant
Jim Bergfalk said. ``I don't believe anybody who was new and
inexperienced could have won.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 31:
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the University of Connecticut's basketball players did
not read the script for a Final Four tournament that everyone in
St. Petersburg, Fla., was calling the Duke Invitational.
Unfortunately for Duke, its players had memorized the script and
come to believe in their own inevitability. So had Duke's semifinal
opponent, Michigan State. On Saturday, the Spartans played
aggressive defense but seemed rattled on offense and intimidated by
Duke's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the UConn Huskies brought a different attitude to
Tropicana Field. Theirs was a team intent on proving that an old
baseball saying _ a hungry player will beat you _ applies to
basketball, as well. Too much has been made of the stumbles of
Duke's star, Trajan Langdon, in the last seconds of the game. The
Huskies won because they had already delivered over 39 minutes of
obsessive team defense, a well-balanced offense and a streak of
clutch shooting by Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   UConn came away with its first NCAA championship, and Duke,
surprisingly, nailed down an odd distinction, too. The Blue Devils
have now lost six championship finals, more than any other team.
That's a deceptive statistic, of course. It means that year after
year, Duke is in the race for No. 1, and the Blue Devils won
consecutive championships in 1991 and 1992. They play the game very
well down in Durham. But this year the team from Storrs
demonstrated that even a storied opponent is vulnerable to hubris
and the superior effort of a team with equal talent and even
greater hunger. &UR;  &LR;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 31:
</P>
<P>
   When federal officials in Washington shut down all animal and
human experimentation at the nation's largest Veterans Affairs
medical center last week in Los Angeles, it was a welcome sign that
government agencies may no longer be willing to tolerate the
potential abuse of mental patients by scientists in the name of
drug research. The joint action by several different agencies
halted 500 different experiments at VA hospitals and clinics in Los
Angeles _ in the very city where the suicide of a patient at the
beginning of the decade helped to trigger concerns about drug
research.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Lamadrid killed himself in 1991 by jumping off the roof
of a building at the University of California at Los Angeles. He
was a former student there, one of dozens of schizophrenic patients
under study to see what the effect would be if their medications
were withdrawn. That procedure and another, in which patients are
given drugs specifically intended to make their symptoms worse so
that doctors can study them as they occur, are two of the most
controversial forms of drug research. Patient advocates charge that
both have been used at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, which is one of the largest research institutions
in the United States, with a sorry record for the casual way it
monitors mental patients under study.
</P>
<P>
   The federal clampdown was based not on any specific abuses of
patients but on the medical center's failure to provide adequate
safeguards for patients involved in human experiments and the
required monitoring and reporting. Dr. Kenneth Kizer, under
secretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Dr.
John Feussner, its chief research and development officer, deserve
credit for calling a halt until the defects are corrected. The
Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously cut off
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   In states like New York and in the federal arena, where a
commission appointed by President Clinton has just finished
drafting its recommendations, efforts are under way to improve the
system for monitoring human research. The lesson just provided by
the Department of Veterans Affairs should guide them all. In
research on a population as fragile as the mentally ill, it cannot
be assumed that patients are being treated well. When they are not,
or one cannot be sure they are not, the process should be shut
down.

   NEW YORK _ Albert Gollin, a sociologist and public opinion
researcher who earned an international reputation for his studies
of newspaper advertising and readership trends, died March 24 at
his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   His death came after a long battle with multiple systems
degeneration, also called Shy-Drager syndrome, related to
Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Gollin was given the Distinguished Career Award for the Practice
of Sociology from the American Sociological Association in 1994
and, in 1998, the Distinguished Achievement Award by the American
Association for Public Opinion Research; he was president of the
organization in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gollin was born in Chicago on Dec. 8, 1930. He received a B.A.
in psychology at Queens College in 1952 and a Ph.D. in sociology
from Columbia University in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   His research career began in 1958 as a study director at
Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research. He later
spent 14 years at the Bureau of Social Science Research in
Washington. There, he conducted research on the sociological
characteristics of Peace Corps volunteers, as well as those who
participated in the 1963 March on Washington and the 1968 Poor
People's Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had an interest in civil rights,'' said his first
wife, Gillian Lindt, a professor of religion and dean of faculty
emerita at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Gollin joined the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, a trade
association in New York City that was then part of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association, as an associate research
director.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gollin retired from the Newspaper Association of
America, which was created by the merger of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association and several other trade groups in 1992. At
the time of his retirement, he was vice president and research
director.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a senior resident fellow at the Freedom Forum Media
Studies Center at Columbia University during the 1995-96 academic
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Gollin is survived by a son, Mark of
Seattle, and a daughter, Karin of Manila, a grandchild, three
stepchildren and four step-grandchildren.

THE NETS EXTEND LEASE ON BASEMENT APARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It is happening slowly, like the drip of syrup
from a maple tree. But after what the Nets have been through, that
is reason enough to get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the athleticism, the depth and the energy that
everyone had expected of them when this shortened season began some
two months ago, the Nets played inspired basketball Tuesday night
for the second straight game and for one of the few times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they came up empty in the victory column _
tightening their grip on the Eastern Conference basement _ losing
to the Orlando Magic, 100-98, when Horace Grant sank a 16-foot
baseline jumper with 16 seconds left. But the team that has shocked
and disappointed New Jersey with its dismal, inconsistent play
seems to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the season goes until Aug. 15, we might get there,'' Coach
Don Casey said. ``You see the improvement, but they need a little
reward for it. It's not just about closing the gap. They need a `W'
for their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who played well in losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers
last Saturday, came within inches of winning Tuesday night when
shots by Stephon Marbury and Chris Carr bounced off the rim in the
final moments. Inbounding the ball after Grant's jumper, the Nets
went to Marbury, hoping that he could create against Darrell
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 seconds left, a dribbling Marbury faced the Magic's
cat-quick guard and sized up his options at the top of the key.
Making his move with about eight ticks left on the clock, Marbury
drove to his left and got off a contested layup that was just a bit
too strong off the backboard. A scramble ensued, and Carr grabbed
the ball two feet in front of the 3-point line on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking victory, he took a dribble, stepped behind the 3-point
line and launched his shot. It was close, but it was off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two seconds left in the game,'' Carr said,
defending his decision to go for 3 points ``You've got to take a
shot at the win. We had already made an attempt to tie and failed,
so I thought I'd go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a bit disturbed by Carr's move, Casey did not dwell on it
_ ``In the kid's mind, the three wins the game, so at least he's
thinking in the right direction,'' he said _ because the good the
Nets (5-24) did far outweighed Carr's questionable judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In coming up just short of winning at the Orlando Arena, the
Nets threatened to do what few teams have.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic, which, at 22-9, has the best record in the Eastern
Conference, is 16-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were the Nets, without their injured star Keith Van
Horn, who missed his second straight game with a sprained right
ankle, moving the ball crisply and shooting a torrid 60.5 percent
to take a 56-49 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who cooled off significantly in the second half,
shooting a mere 30.2 percent, put the Magic on the brink of defeat
with outstanding balance, teamwork and defense. They fought off
many challenges to keep their lead at 81-79 heading into the fourth
period.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles led five Nets in double figures with 18 points and
4 of the club's season-high-tying 16 steals. Marbury scored 7 of
his 17 points in the final 3 minutes 22 seconds, on two driving
layups, including one that gave the Nets a 98-96 lead with one
minute remaining, and a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   And the banged-up Jayson Williams turned in another fine effort,
contributing with 16 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson, who hit a 19 footer to answer Marbury's go-ahead
basket four seconds later and tie it at 98, led Orlando with 28
points, 9 of which came in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly ageless Dominique Wilkins followed with 17 points
in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, having finally seen a spark from his new team, summed
it up for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a confidence booster for us,'' he said.
``We played hard, we played smart. We did everything we were
supposed to do. We played great defense. They just won.''

L.A. DRIVERS SORE AS GAS PRICES SOAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Motorists waited in long lines at discount gas
stations and others called off holiday trips as gas prices have
risen by an average of 15 cents a gallon across Southern California
in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Experts blame the increase on refinery problems in Northern
California and a vow by oil-producing countries to reduce their
output of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the average price for a gallon of regular self-serve
unleaded was $1.33 in Los Angeles, up from $1.19 two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But prices are changing day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Arco, which normally has among the lowest prices at some
locations, was selling a gallon of regular for $1.38, up from $1.30
a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas prices are nuts,'' said Linda Mader who languished in
line for 15 minutes at a Costco service station in suburban Van
Nuys where a gallon sold for just $1.31. The prices are so high
Mader said she has called off a trip to Palm Springs for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The hike also took a toll on civility as some customers fumed,
glared and prodded their fellow customers to hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I come into work it's why, why, why?'' said
station attendant Jeshua Aguilar, 19. ``Why are the prices so high?
Why are you ripping us off? And I tell them it's like this
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of gas prices is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have analysts saying all sorts of things, that it will go
as high as $2 a gallon or it will go down,'' said Jeff Spring,
spokesman for the Automobile Club of Southern California. ``There
will be a point where people will pay greater attention to how they
drive to save on gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Energy Commission, a state agency
that monitors energy supplies, the price should begin to fall by
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not be concerned about getting gasoline,'' said
Claudia Chandler, an assistant executive director of the
commission. ``(Prices) are already leveling off and probably by
next week you'll start to see it drop. By the end of April, we'll
probably be back to our seasonal normal levels'' of about $1.12 per
gallon for regular.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of oil-producing countries to cut production by about
2 million barrels a day has not had that much impact on California,
which gets most of its oil from Alaska, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 13 gasoline refineries are now back to 96 percent of
their normal production and supplemental shipments began arriving
this past weekend, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be soon enough for Jeffrey Nelson, who stopped Tuesday
at a Chevron station in Warner Center where regular was fetching
$1.48 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do short trips like I used to _ where it was more
economical for me to drive rather than fly _ because the gas prices
have risen so much,'' said Nelson, a 42-year-old New Yorker in town
to work with some recording artists he manages.
</P>
<P>
   When he left New Jersey three weeks ago, a gallon of regular was
89 cents, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Automobile Club of Southern
California, some stations are pushing $1.50 for a gallon of regular
and in the San Francisco Bay Area the average price of a gallon of
regular is $1.61, following three refinery problems there including
a fire at a Chevron facility last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply fill up the tank, Randi Riddle of suburban
Woodland Hills said she now takes whatever amount of gas $20 will
buy her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry but what are you going to do?'' said Riddle,
a preschool assistant director. ``I quit smoking when they raised
the price of cigarettes. Now what, am I going to have to quit
driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said she is concerned by reports that some motorists
are topping off their tanks almost on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid that they're not going to find the same price
for gas tomorrow as they did today,'' she said.

THE FINAL WORD BELONGS TO SPREWELL AND EWING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one but the brazen Latrell Sprewell would have had
the nerve. Out of foolishness or faith, Sprewell grabbed a Reggie
Miller miss and sprinted wildly down the floor, leaving his
teammates behind.
</P>
<P>
   It was basket or bust with 1 minute 20 seconds left in the game.
With two defenders in front of him, Sprewell darted to the left of
a backpedaling Miller and swooped in for a driving layup to finish
off an electrifying moment seldom before seen from a man in a
Knicks uniform. Cheering his every stride along his reckless path,
the crowd at Madison Square Garden fell head over heals for
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   And when the crazy end was over, so did Patrick Ewing. He
embraced Sprewell as the teammate who took the burden off his
hulking shoulders in an uplifting 94-93 victory on Tuesday night
over the loathed Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a poised victory against a team that mattered, in an
ending that didn't leave Ewing as the tragic figure again. Ewing,
who scored a season-high 37 points and was involved in a first-half
confrontation with Jalen Rose that nearly developed into a melee,
was buoyed by Sprewell's 18 points. Sprewell's flashy drive for a
layup was part of a 6-0 run the Knicks needed to surge past the
Pacers and douse Miller, who scored 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had a chance to win it with 7.9 seconds left. But his
shot bounded off the rim. Rik Smits grabbed the rebound in front of
Ewing, who had missed a jumper just seconds early as he fell to the
ground. Smits passed to Travis Best, whose 19-foot jumper bounded
off the rim. Again, the Knicks botched the rebound and gave the
rookie Al Harrington a chance to win it at the buzzer. But his tip
fell off the rim and the 19-year-old from Paterson, N.J., lay in
disbelief on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost so many close ones like this,'' said Sprewell,
whose layup closed the Knicks within 1 point before he hit two free
throws to give the Knicks the lead with 1:01 left. ``To be a part
of this is a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from their mindless retaliations in Saturday's
loss to the Lakers, the Knicks kept their heads under duress in the
second quarter. Instead of getting sucked into the chaos, Ewing
held back from pummeling the lanky Rose with 2:57 left in an
intense first half.
</P>
<P>
   After going down hard in Ewing's shadow for a rebound, Rose,
sprawled on the floor, lifted his right foot to trip Ewing as he
stepped over him. Ewing popped up, scowled and rushed toward Rose,
who had his fists up, as if saying, ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rose backing into the right corner of the court with Ewing
in front of him, referee Dick Bavetta got between the two and
received a broken nose for his effort.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Rose threw a punch at Ewing that did not land.
Ewing shoved, but apparently did not throw a punch at Rose or at
Dale Davis, who entered the scene. Davis and Ewing began shoving as
Coach Jeff Van Gundy wedged his diminutive figure in between the
two big men.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently learning their lesson from previous fight experiences
with Miami, none of the Knicks were seen leaving the bench. Once
the situation was defused by the officials, Rose, who had been
defending Sprewell, was ejected from the game for a punching foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two games that the Knicks were
involved in an on-court scuffle. Against the Lakers, the Knicks
lost their heads and ended up with Chris Dudley and Kurt Thomas
tossed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rod Thorn, the league's vice president of
operations, fined Thomas $5,000 for tossing Dennis Rodman on his
head in Saturday's game and Dudley $2,500 for throwing a ball and
hitting Shaquille O'Neal. For his part, shoving Dudley, O'Neal was
fined $3,500, which indicated the league felt the shove was more
aggressive than Dudley's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, Ewing held back and played on. He led the
Knicks to 19 first-half points and helped provide his team with a
54-51 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, already down an injured Antonio Davis, had to figure
out how to overcome the weariness they were feeling in playing
their third game in three nights and how to manage undermanned.
</P>
<P>
   They handled it well to begin the third quarter. Using Smits to
spring outside of the slow-moving Dudley, who started next to Ewing
for the second game in a row, the Pacers went ahead 63-58 in the
opening four minutes of the third quarter. A couple of jumpers by a
very lively Ewing and the Knicks regained the lead by 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   A brief back-and-forth ended with Sprewell head-faking his way
into the lane for a 15-foot runner at the shot-clock buzzer with
2.9 seconds left in the third quarter. His play gave the Knicks a
74-73 lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He was at the top of his profession _ 10
feet high, technically, but a career's worth of success in cosmic
measurement. In a moment like this, an egomaniac might blurt
something about being king of the world, or dance around like the
proverbial decapitated chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun thought about somebody else. After Connecticut
outplayed Duke, 77-74, for the national college basketball
championship Monday night, there were a few strands of net hanging
from the rim, a civilized version of two ears and a tail in
bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
   He could have claimed all the spoils for having devised a
defense that helped his team finish three points ahead of Mike
Krzyzewski's team. Even though this burly basketball lifer had
never coached in the Final Four, he must have had something to do
with the victory, no?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the victory did exorcise Christian Laettner's
shot that killed Connecticut in the 1990 East Regional, after
Krzyzewski changed the play after a second timeout. This time, with
Laettner in attendance, Calhoun sent his co-captain, Ricky Moore,
out to stop Trajan Langdon one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ladder and the scissors, Calhoun clipped a fragment of
net but left something hanging from the rim, left it for the man
with ``the best seat in the house,'' Calhoun would say in a husky
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The last piece was for the family of Joe McGinn, who was once
his manager but came down with kidney disease so severe that he
died on March 9, at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   This moment of generosity was not something he had scripted a
day or two earlier _ no crafted victory speech in his jacket
pocket. As he climbed the ladder, he suddenly thought of Joe
McGinn, whom he had counseled through his terrible last years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like,'' he said later in the steamy locker
room. ``I was called in from the outfield when I was 15, and found
out my father died of a heart attack. My coach then helped me get
through it. That's how I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not going to change, he insisted. He is still going to be
this self-styled ``stubborn Irish guy'' from Boston. He did not
need to win the Final Four to feel good about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now he joins the roster of coaches who won this jamboree:
Valvano. Haskins. Rupp. Richardson. Thompson. Massimino. Tarkanian.
Pitino. A couple of unrelated Smiths. A couple of unrelated
McGuires. Coach K. All the others. And somebody named Wooden, who
won it 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it now includes my name, but it doesn't validate me,''
Calhoun said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood that stuff,'' he added. ``It's like all
that baloney about the Super Bowl, where you lose four of them and
you're a loser. Does this mean you're better off going 10-8 and
getting knocked out in the first round?''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said he was the same person after 554 victories and 257
losses in 27 years. He specifically mentioned Eddie Sutton, who has
taken four teams to the tournament but never won it. The lifers
don't get to be lifers without knowing some stuff, do they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches cheat sometimes,'' Calhoun disclosed to an amazed
audience from the media. ``We do. We tell you things, and you use
them. You know that. I kept talking about how great Duke was _ and
they were. But I told my team, `This is the first time all year
that I'm telling you, they are as good as you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also told his players they could beat Duke. He schmoozed with
30 or 40 coaches, and thought he could throw in a lot of players,
make Duke run. His ace card was the sense of being an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun is from the distinctly nonscale American International,
and learned to coach at Northeastern, a bootstrapper's school in
urban Boston. When his Connecticut team overwhelmed a game Eastern
Michigan team a few years ago, Calhoun raved about the heart of the
two little opposing guards. They were his kind of guys.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he counted 17 of his former players in the stands _
men who took time off from their jobs in business or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Gwynn, Lyman DePriest, Spider Ursery, Scotty Burrell, Ray
Allen, all of them,'' Calhoun said. ``Howie Dickenman, who used to
be my assistant, who laid the groundwork by recruiting a lot of
these guys, was here.''
</P>
<P>
   They filed into the borrowed office to hug the man who had
yelled at them so many times. Calhoun said he felt ``humbled'' by
the night, and the presence of his old boys, and in his celebration
he remembered to save a souvenir in honor of his late team manager,
the one with ``the best seat in the house.''

COUNT ON DUKE IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As we turn to next season, a morsel to consider:
Connecticut's victory over Duke on Monday not only capped '99, it
may have sealed 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut star and Final Four MVP Richard Hamilton probably
will bolt for the NBA _ his value will never be higher, just ask
Miles Simon _ while Duke's defeat may cause center Elton Brand to
return for his junior year. (He wants a title.) In addition, the
loss likely convinced point guard William Avery to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   If Brand and Avery return, you can hand Duke the trophy Oct. 15.
Here's a preliminary look at next season's contenders.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET 16: Auburn: The Tigers were no one-hit wonder. Although
they lose the element of surprise, Chris Porter, Scott Pohlman and
Doc Robinson will keep them in the Top-25 all season.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse: The inconsistencies of '99 will evaporate as the
starting five returns. Jason Hart, Etan Thomas and Ryan Blackwell
will help the Orangemen compete for the Big East title.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga: Like Auburn, the Bulldogs return most of their top
players _ only point guard Quentin Hall and center Jeremy Eaton
depart _ but they'll be a targeted team. The key is coveted coach
Dan Monson: If he returns, the Bulldogs will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Temple: If forward Lamont Barnes bolts for the NBA, Temple joins
the pack. But if Barnes returns, the Owls become a Final Four
contender with Pepe Sanchez, Mark Karcher, Kevin Lyde and coach
John Chaney's zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   Texas: Center Chris Mihm and power forward Gabe Muoneke give the
Longhorns a superb frontcourt. Replacing scorer Kris Clack won't be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's: Assuming forward Ron Artest heads for the NBA, the
Red Storm will have a solid frontcourt and brilliant backcourt
(Erick Barkley and Bootsy Thornton). If Artest returns, put St.
John's in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Florida: The Gators lose one-eyed wonder Eddie Shannon, but Mike
Miller, Brent Wright and Ted Dupay return with highly touted
recruit Matt Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State: Even if Mateen Cleaves returns, the Spartans
will have trouble duplicating their Final Four run. Morris
Peterson, Andre Hutson, A.J. Granger and Duke transfer Mike
Chappell will find, as Stanford did this year, that it's tougher
the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ELITE EIGHT: Kentucky: Not even the Wildcats can lose a senior
class of Heshimu Evans, Scott Padgett and Wayne Turner and not feel
it. But by March, coach Tubby Smith will have Kentucky rolling
behind Tayshaun Prince, Desmond Allison, Jules Camara, Michael
Bradley and Jamaal Magloire (if he doesn't turn pro). The
recruiting class, as always, is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona: The Wildcats lose All-America point guard Jason Terry
but replace him with heralded recruit Jason Gardner. They lose
all-conference center A.J. Bramlett but replace him with Wake
Forest transfer Loren Woods. Add sophomores-to-be Richard
Jefferson, Ruben Douglas and Michael Wright, and it's time for a
serious tournament run.
</P>
<P>
   Utah: The Utes lose point guard Andre Miller but return everyone
else of consequence, including starters Alex Jensen and Hanno
Mottola, top reserve Tony Harvey and the nation's best coach, Rick
Majerus.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State: The backcourt (Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd) is
good enough to get the Buckeyes through the draining expectations
that follow Final Four seasons. Coach Jim O'Brien's system is
superb, and center Ken Johnson may become the nation's top shot
blocker.
</P>
<P>
   FINAL FOUR:
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina: The Tar Heels return eight of their top nine,
including Ed Cota, Jason Capel and Max Owens on the perimeter. Kris
Lang and center Brendan Haywood, a future Lottery Pick, form a
gifted front line. Add top recruit Jason Parker, and UNC appears
poised for its second Final Four under coach Bill Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois: A surprise pick, for sure, but the Illini have a
superb coach (Lon Kruger), a young team _ point guard Cory Bradford
is the vortex _ and a massive influx of talent. They'll be next
year's version of Ohio State _ a worst-to-Final Four turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas: Yes, they're back. After a subpar year, the Jayhawks
have most of their best players back and welcome top recruit Andrew
Gooden. He'll join Jeff Boschee, Eric Chenowith, Lester Earl and
Kenny Gregory to form an experienced and athletic core.
</P>
<P>
   Duke: If Avery and Brand return, watch out. The Blue Devils lose
Trajan Langdon, but Chris Carrawell, Shane Battier and Corey
Maggette return with experience and purpose. Add the nation's top
recruiting class _ Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy, Casey Sanders and
perhaps Carlos Boozer _ and Duke will have 10 McDonald's
All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The ridiculous report of the week comes from
ESPN.com, which said there was speculation at the Final Four that
UCLA coach Steve Lavin's job was in jeopardy. Despite the
first-round loss to Detroit, Bruins officials are happy with
Lavin's performance, his recruiting, the way he represents the
program and the fact he's not Jim Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins the Pacific-10 every couple of years, makes a few
Final Fours and stays out of trouble, Lavin will coach UCLA as long
as he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Harrick: Jim Sr. is a finalist for the Georgia job _
he'd be a good fit in the SEC _ while Jim Jr. wants the Pepperdine
gig. The Waves could do better, much better.
</P>
<P>
   Top recruit Carlos Boozer, whose finalists are UCLA, Duke and
St. John's, could announce his decision this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: UCLA will play Cal State Northridge on Dec. 5 at
Pauley Pavilion. Get your tickets now _ or get them 10 minutes
before tipoff.

CELTICS TAKE STING OUT OF HORNETS

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Team pictures Wednesday night. Everyone smile,
please.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino almost had to summon the airbrush artists after a
near collapse in the final five minutes Tuesday night. But he was
here-to-there smiles later after the Celtics woke up when it
counted and left town with a rewarding, albeit
tougher-than-it-shoulda-been 109-99 victory over the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The victory is the second in three games and perhaps could
signal an end to the Era of Negativity that engulfed the team last
week. Kenny Anderson was terrific, Paul Pierce rolled back the
clock all the way to February, and Antoine Walker played another
strong all-around game. It was a dramatic 180 from the Celtics'
last visit here three weeks ago, when they were humiliated by an
undermanned and injured Charlotte team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans must have thought back then, `What is that CBA team
doing in this building?' '' said Anderson, who was 9 of 13 from the
field and had 22 points, including a team-resuscitating trey with
94 seconds to play. ``We're a different team. We've grown. I think
for that game, when we were here, we were like 18 years old. A high
school team playing against men. This was more like 25. We've
grown. We're making strides.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to argue otherwise, especially if team video
ace Frank Vogel sneaks into the tape vault and erases the final
five minutes. Until their late skid, the Celtics played almost
flawless basketball. They put on an offensive clinic, as evidenced
by the shot distribution: all five starters had no fewer than 10 or
more than 13. That's unselfish basketball. They harassed the
Hornets with their press, getting 22 points off 14 turnovers. They
shot 58.6 percent, a season high, and delivered the kind of game
Pitino hoped to see sooner and much more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we wanted to play,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also snapped Charlotte's eight-game home winning
streak and was Boston's second straight on the road, where only
recently the Celtics had been sheep in sheep's clothing. The
new-look Hornets, with Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, also had won
six of seven and even were talking about making the playoffs after
a 1-8 start. But the team the Celtics saw Tuesday night, even
though it shot 58 percent, played a lot more like the team from
earlier that prompted the Churchillian Derrick Coleman to note
``there goes the season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came here the first time, they were playing well and
we were down and we just outworked them,'' said Charlotte guard
David Wesley, one of five ineffective Hornets starters. ``The
reverse happened this time. They outworked us. They outplayed us.
We came out flat and didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Boston big guys were Pierce, who had a shot-from-guns
first quarter (12) and finished with 19. He was going to the
basket, drawing fouls, looking like the Rookie of the Month that he
once was not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get my explosiveness back,'' said Pierce, who
was 7 of 12 from the field. ``I'm just mad it took me so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker (15 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 stitches courtesy of
a Brad Miller elbow) was into serious shot avoidance; he took only
one in the first quarter, a trey, and drained it. Vitaly Potapenko
had 14 points, including two big hoops in the fourth right before
the Hornets made their run. Tony Battie had 12 off the bench as the
Celtics had seven players in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   But all the good things _ and there were a lot of them _ nearly
got blown away when the Hornets' reserves went to work. A Walker
layup gave Boston a 98-84 lead with 5:43 left and also brought
about vapor lock. Five unsuccessful possessions resulted in 10
straight Charlotte points. It was 98-94 with 2:08 left and Pitino
was not a happy camper.
</P>
<P>
   Battie made a free throw to make it 99-94 and then Miller, fast
developing cult status after games of 24 and 25 points this past
week, was called for traveling. Anderson, who was 2 of 17 from
international waters entering the game, then stepped up and hit The
Big One, which got the lead back to 8.
</P>
<P>
   The locker room was a much happier place than it was three weeks
ago. Those smiles you see Wednesday night will be real, at least
for now.

BOTTLED WATER NOT SO PURE, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans pay a premium for bottled water but
consumers who think their favorite brand is cleaner than tap water
might consider a four-year study that found contaminants exceeding
drinking-water standards.
</P>
<P>
   The National Resources Defense Council released the results
Tuesday to counter what the watchdog group contends are misleading
claims by an industry that has seen Americans' average annual
consumption of bottled water nearly triple over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Firing back was the International Bottled Water Association,
whose members produce 85 percent of the nearly 3.5 billion gallons
consumed in this nation annually, claiming the study was alarmist
and actually showed bottled water is safe.
</P>
<P>
   While not asserting that bottled water is unsafe for most
consumers, the resources group called on the Food and Drug
Administration to strengthen federal regulations and improve
monitoring and public disclosure. NRDC officials noted that public
water systems face far tougher regulations, including more frequent
testing for bacteria and chemical contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if consumers are paying a premium price then they
have a right to know what's in that bottle and that it's minimally
regulated,'' said Lawrie Mott, a senior scientist for the NRDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that people should not consume bottled
water,'' she added. ``We're not a mini FDA. We did snapshot testing
to shed light on a problem that we think deserves serious
consideration and reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry group countered that bottled water is one of the
most highly regulated products under the FDA and there have been no
confirmed reports of illness or disease linked to bottled water
during the agency's 37-year regulatory authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to continue making sure that our product is
viewed as being safe. All bottled water in compliance with FDA
regulations is safe,'' said Zail Dugal, spokeswoman for the bottled
water group based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about drinking water quality, however, has helped spur
bottled water sales _ a black eye for public water systems that,
according to the NRDC, bottled water companies emphasize to
encourage consumer thirst for their product.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, concern over tap water is particularly high,
following disclosures that chlorine-treated water can cause
miscarriages and a proposed state standard for hexavalent chromium
that could force the closure of some San Fernando Valley
groundwater wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you hear about the horrible things in
drinking water. It certainly made a difference for me,'' said Nan
George, who purchased bottled water Tuesday while shopping with her
mother at a grocery store in suburban Woodland Hills. ``If there
was no difference, I would go back (to tap water). But I'm
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goodwin of Topanga said his family has become accustomed
to bottled drinking water, favoring the taste and preferring what
they consider a cleaner, safer source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better water. I would have to have it proven to
me that the tap water was just as good,'' he said after packing
bottled water into the back of the family van following a shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers who spend
between 70 cents and $5 a gallon for bottled water compared with
the average residential rate of 1 cent for five gallons should know
what might be in their favorite brand, the study's authors said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings included:
</P>
<P>
   _ After testing more than 1,000 bottles, 23 of the 103 brands
were contaminated at levels violating California limits for arsenic
and trihalomethanes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Testing for microbiological purity turned up samples from 18
of the 103 brands that exceeded guidelines adopted in some states,
the European Union and recommended by the bottled water industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ In all, at least one sample of 34 of the 103 brands tested
exceeded a state standard for bacterial or chemical contamination,
a microbiological purity guideline or both.
</P>
<P>
   The study is available on the NRDC Web site at www.nrdc.org.
Copies are also available for purchase by calling (323) 934-6900
Ext. 313.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottled water is sold with pictures of mountains and glaciers
and all sorts of claims of purity,'' said Dr. Gina Solomon, a
specialist in adult internal medicine and senior scientist for the
resource group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair number had a positive result that popped up on one test
and when we went and bought another batch of the same water to see
if it seems to be a continuing problem or intermittent problem
there were a lot of waters where the problem appeared to be
resolved,'' she explained. ``So what that indicates to us is that
bottled water quality is spotty. There's no guarantee about
purity.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Solomon noted that the results showed bottled water is safe in
general but could pose a health risk to people with weakened immune
systems, such as people with AIDS and patients undergoing
chemotherapy and kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the same results differently, bottled water industry
officials contend the study overstated the contamination concern.
They charge that the NRDC applies a variety of standards and that
only two samples exceeded FDA standards, both for fluoride levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRDC report confirms that our product is essentially
safe,'' Dugal said. ``It can be marketed that it is safe and tastes
good.''
</P>
<P>
   California's top drinking water official said the study could
help improve the image of tap water that has suffered despite the
state's claim to some of the nation's most stringent regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 40 percent of the people in California drinking
bottled water and people frankly shouldn't really lose their trust
in municipal water systems,'' said Dave Spath, chief of the
Division of Drinking Water, which regulates 8,600 public water
systems. ``If you're going to promote your product for being better
than drinking water, then you have to produce a product that
exceeds the standards for public water systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although bottled water took a public relations hit, DWP
officials were not gloating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to talk about our water and people should feel safe
and secure in the fact that our tap water meets the strictest
standards for tap water in the country,'' said spokesman Lawrence
Lokman.

KINGS ZING THE BRUINS

By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with lesser competition, faced with a prime chance to move
a giant step toward clinching a playoff spot, the Bruins Tuesday
night played every bit like an eighth-place team in search of an
identity, a reason to win, some meaning in a long season that is
drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   What they got, in the end, was a rude awakening: A 2-1 loss to
the lowly LA Kings, delivered with 66 seconds left in overtime from
the stick of Oli Jokinen.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost playoff time and the Bruins have caught a rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we need points,'' lamented losing goalie
Byron Dafoe, his own undefeated streak snapped at six games (3-0-3)
in the latest fault at the Vault. ``If that's not incentive enough,
I don't know what is _ end of story.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale of late has been the Bruins' inability to lay waste to
those who are there for the trashing. Saturday night, they held a
2-0 lead over the Maple Leafs and saw that dissolve into a 2-2 tie.
Thursday night, with the beat-me, kick-me, whip-me Blackhawks in
town, they grunted and groaned along for a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like any way to tune up for the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   The loss prevented the Bruins from opening up a 7-point lead
over the Panthers and Rangers for the eighth _ and final _ playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference. In their last three games, they've
booted away 4 points, the gemstones that might have pulled them
into a seventh-place tie with the sagging Sabres (81 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said team captain Ray Bourque, who was on the ice when
Jokinen backhanded in the OT killer, ``could come back to haunt
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when there was help to be had at the trading
deadline, the Bruins decided not to add to their lineup. They were
gaining on the competition (i.e. Rangers and Panthers), some of
their kids were contributing, the front office liked the pulse it
thought it felt. Suddenly, the beat of momentum isn't there,
especially when the competition ranks, like the Kings, among the
lower echelon. And there is no help beyond what is right here,
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like our games against Toronto or Chicago,'' said
coach Pat Burns, whose postgame news conference was among his
briefest of the season. ``We could have eliminated two teams with a
win. We just didn't shoot tonight. I say it in practice all the
time _ shoot! shoot! shoot! We want to make a pretty play.''
</P>
<P>
   Overhandling the puck was only part of the issue vs. the Kings.
For the most part, the clubs engaged in 60 minutes of shinny,
skating freely up and down the ice with few, if any, aggressive
encounters along the boards or in the corners. It was a classic
no-hitter, and the Fleet boo-birds (some of them Celtic holdovers?)
began to get testy and more vocal by early in the second when it
was clear neither side would do battle. Had they been skating
waiters, porting glasses full of water, not a drop would have been
spilled.
</P>
<P>
   If one side could be rated better than the other, the Kings
would get the edge. Unimpeded, they were able to force the puck
deeper into the Boston end, part of the reason they held a 20-15
shot lead after 40 minutes. Maybe they didn't bury their chances,
but at least they were getting them, and they were getting them
without much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Byron wasn't on top of his game,'' bemoaned Burns, ``this
would have been really ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's only goal came off the stick of Sergei Samsonov,
negating a 1-0 LA lead at 12:09 of the third. Parked in the right
circle, he wristed home his 21st of the season after linemate
Dmitri Khristich fed him a soft backhander as Khristich approached
the goal line. The goal ended a 10-game scoring drought for
Samsonov, last season's rookie of the year who has slumped as a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took the 1-0 lead earlier in the third, at 5:40, when
captain Rob Blake crossed the blue line and nailed a long slapper
off right wing. Backing up on the play, defenseman Don Sweeney saw
the shot deflect first off his stick and then break in off Dafoe's
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The LA winner came with the Bruins scrambling in their end,
Jokinen sweeping in his shot with help from Craig Johnson. Red
light on. Up with the boos. Fade to silence as the disgruntled
crowd headed for Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were the better team out there, and we're playing
for more than they are,'' said Dafoe. ``Everyone seems to know the
Boston Bruins have trouble getting up for teams that are lower in
the league, and then we play unbelievable against the best teams in
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news in the playoffs _ provided they get
there.

GONZALEZ TO BOSSES: DON'T FENCE ME IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Juan Gonzalez returns to Texas tomorrow,
seemingly a baseball superstar who now has it all.
</P>
<P>
   But on second thought...
</P>
<P>
   Should the American League MVP do more in 1999? And will
Gonzalez be asking for more from Rangers management? More than just
the additional financial riches that will soon flow his way?
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers' chartered jet from Florida smokes tire rubber
on the D/FW runway tomorrow night, Gonzalez will not be burdened
with most of the extra baggage from years past.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, for the most part, is the reputation of a brooding, sullen
man-child. Acceptance by the Rangers' fandom was slow, but Juan has
finally won them over, and not just with offensive might. Over the
years, he showed he cared about playing right field, and about
hustling ``almost'' all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Juan when he first got here \Rin 1991\S and watching
him over the last couple of years, I'd say he's 90 to 95 percent
arrived as the complete ballplayer,'' said first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no reason why it shouldn't be 100 percent. To me,
it is not acceptable for a superstar like him to loaf on an
occasional play in right field. To not hustle after a ball. Or to
not run hard to first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, returning to the Rangers after five seasons in
Baltimore, has appointed himself this spring the designated ``Juan
cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be on his butt every time I see that temporary
lack of hustle,'' Palmeiro said. ``Juan is the best. I want him to
always give his best.''
</P>
<P>
   This is good. Juan listens to Rafael, even if Juan doesn't
necessarily like what he hears.
</P>
<P>
   But then comes a separate question. Will the Rangers' hierarchy
be listening to Gonzalez, even if team president Tom Schieffer
doesn't like what he's going to hear?
</P>
<P>
   A new long-term contract for Gonzalez within the next year, if
not sooner, is a given. The money will be stacked higher than a
Gonzalez moonshot to the bleachers. At age 29, Gonzalez still
hasn't reached his prime baseball years, is now in better physical
condition than ever, and has won MVP awards two of the past three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, however, the money. That's Tom Hicks' worry.
</P>
<P>
   Much more interesting will be another of Gonzalez's contract
``requests.'' It is too early to call it a ``demand,'' but
eventually this may become one.
</P>
<P>
   To re-up with the Rangers, Juan wants architectural relief at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, move in the left-field fences, and therefore remove that
miniature ``Death Valley'' for right-handed power hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lose home run balls out there every season; balls that are
over the fence almost anywhere else are caught in Arlington,''
Gonzalez said yesterday. ``When I lose homers, I think we lose. The
team loses.''
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested to Juan that the dimensions might cost him 10
homers a season. ``No,'' he answered. ``Fifteen, maybe 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ... the amount is significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told my agent \RJim Bronner\S that when we start
talking seriously about a new contract, I want the left-field
fences to be a big part of the negotiations,'' Gonzalez said.
``This is a major concern for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer, standing on the press-box roof here yesterday, smiled
broadly when told of Gonzalez's ``request.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is a guy who has always been fair with us, and we've
always been fair with him,'' noted Schieffer, choosing his words
carefully. ``But having said that, we also aren't going to move in
the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, this might become interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When The Ballpark was in the planning stages eight years ago,
Gonzalez was a budding home-run monster. But with a 390-foot power
alley to left field, and almost 370 to straightaway left field, the
park was not built with Juan's future in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, more than ever, pitching is a problem throughout
baseball,'' Schieffer said. ``With more right-handed power hitters,
we made left field the deep part. With less left-handed power, we
put the porch in right field. And since we built the park, the
pitching ranks have thinned even more. As it has turned out, I feel
the dimensions are perfect for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, one of the reasons Mo Vaughn became a prized
free-agent signee in Anaheim was because the Angels agreed to pull
in the fences. Gonzalez certainly noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will listen to Juan, but I also don't see this eventually
being a deal-breaker on Juan's part,'' Schieffer added.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. But while money is a given factor in the
negotiations, a possible tug of war over the ballpark blueprint is
an extra and entertaining dimension.

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The pressure apparently got the best of Mavericks
coach Don Nelson last night.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was ejected in the second quarter of a 98-78 loss to the
Minnesota Timberwolves for vehemently protesting the lack of a call
on a play that knocked Mavericks guard Erick Strickland out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Strickland released an 18-foot jumper from the
right wing that missed, but he was knocked to the floor by
Minnesota's Tom Hammonds. Nelson quickly hopped from the bench and
used vulgar language to referee Tommy Nunez, who slapped Nelson
with a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson followed Nunez onto the court and continued with
more spicy language, Nunez tagged him with another technical and
Nelson collected his first ejection of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland was helped off the court and did not return to the
game after a diagnosis of back spasms. Assistant coach Donnie
Nelson coached the Mavericks for the balance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson refused comment after the game, but Donnie Nelson
said his father's blowup was a way of ``protecting'' Strickland and
a sense of frustration from this disastrous season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any one of \Rthe three referees\S saw it,''
Donnie Nelson said. ``I don't think they don't make a call like
that on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the official that was right next to the call
\RNunez\S was looking into the paint. Probably what happened was
none of them saw the call. ... he \RDon Nelson\S was standing up
and protecting his player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (10-22) have lost three games in a row and eight
of their past 10. Tomorrow night, they are host to the worst team
in the NBA _ the Los Angeles Clippers _ in what has suddenly become
a game that could define this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an explanation,'' said guard Steve Nash, who had
three points and 10 assists. ``We've hit the wall, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland will be re-evaluated today, but said the incident was
somewhat scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he tried to avoid me, but ended up hitting me in the
lower part of my body, and he also took my legs,'' he said.
``That's what scared me more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were playing their fourth game in five days, and
Minnesota ran the weary-looking visitors ragged. The Timberwolves
built a 28-point lead early in the fourth period (88-60) on
back-to-back baskets by Kevin Garnett as the Mavericks played
nonchalant after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With eight players scoring, the Mavericks distributed the ball
nicely and actually had a 24-22 lead. But the Timberwolves scored
the first 10 points of the second quarter as the Mavericks went
more than four minutes with scoring. Dean Garrett had six points in
the run, which was capped by a hammer-dunk by Hammonds.
</P>
<P>
   With Strickland out, and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams (stomach flu)
and Robert Pack (hamstring) back in Dallas nursing ailments, the
Mavericks were down to nine healthy bodies in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves were also hurting, playing without starters Joe
Smith (ribs) and Anthony Peeler (calf) and reserves Malik Sealy
(ankle) and James Robinson (back).
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent led the Mavericks with 16 points and 11 rebounds, and
Shawn Bradley had 13 points. But after losing by 20 or more points
for the second time in the past three games, the Mavericks are
clearly a team at the crossroads.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A coed softball game erupted into a bench-clearing
brawl, with the adult players swinging punches and baseball bats at
one another, and one man drawing a gun, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived to break up the fights Monday, they were
surprised to find that at least three of the combatants were
off-duty LAPD officers.
</P>
<P>
   One off-duty officer drew his gun in self-defense after more
than one person attacked him with baseball bats, said Detective Ed
Heissel, in charge of the Crimes Against Persons unit at the Los
Angeles Police Department's Devonshire station.
</P>
<P>
   The brawl at the Petit Avenue park in suburban Granada Hills was
under investigation, and no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, president of the Los Angeles Parks Commission,
called the conduct outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets you angry. You work very hard to offer this kind of
recreation for people,'' he said. ``There is no place in the league
for this kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Los Angeles police officers were treated at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries, Heissel said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the fighting erupted after a referee's call
sparked an argument, and an off-duty police officer told the mother
of an opposing player to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next depends on whom you talk to: members of the
Quakes or the Aztecs team, which won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs is made up of civilian players from a park league.
The Quakes include civilians and at least four Los Angeles police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Heissel and an Aztecs player said the disagreement began after a
referee changed his call from ``safe'' to ``out'' in the last
inning _ giving the win to the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   Aztecs player Pauline Castillo said, ``One gentleman from the
Quakes got in (the umpire's) face and started cussing at him.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother in the stands watching her son play for the Aztecs
yelled ``Kick him out of the game!'' Castillo said. The Quakes
player confronting the umpire then yelled back to the mother,
telling her to ``shut up,'' witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The son of the mother got upset and the whole fight started.
He said, Don't be talking about my mom like that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one-on-one to begin with and then all the guys started
going in,'' Castillo said, adding that at one point three Quakes
were fighting with four Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the off-duty officers' account, about 14 Aztecs
rushed toward the off-duty officers playing on the Quakes team,
Heissel said. ``There were a lot of people on the winning team
involved in assaulting the officers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the off-duty officers called 911 on his cell phone,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fist-fighting and kicking stopped for a few minutes, and
then started again in the parking lot as the off-duty officers
left, Heissel said.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo said that at one point a Quakes team member held an
Aztecs team member's arms down while another Quakes member ``kneed
him in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   An LAPD officer retrieved a gun from his vehicle and pointed it
at the crowd and then at a female Aztecs player, Castillo said. He
held the gun within inches of the female's forehead, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Freeze! LAPD,' with his gun pointed to the people,''
Castillo said, adding that he never showed a police badge.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Commander David Kalish said the case will be thoroughly
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being investigated as a criminal matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Singer, a park recreation supervisor for the Mid-Valley
District, said ``brouhahas happen'' at parks with yelling, pushing
and shoving.'' But he was upset to learn that it had escalated to a
gun being drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're adults. But in a way, they're like children. When kids
get into a fight, adults break it up. When adults get into fights,
who in the heck breaks it up?'' Singer said.

FOLEY FINDS A MISSION IN MOTHER'S ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Glenn Foley always was looking for charities
to donate time and money to. Six months ago, one found him.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Foley, the mother of the Seahawks' newest quarterback, was
rushed to the hospital on Oct. 5. It was thought she was having a
stroke. Tests instead showed she was going into kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of charity work before,'' Foley said Tuesday
during a break in the Seahawks' four-day quarterbacks camp. ``All
of a sudden, this one hit us right in our face with my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention weighing heavily on the hearts and minds of
Foley, his wife, Jen, and their close-knit families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was very physically and emotionally draining,'' Jen
said. ``It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   This story has a happy but hectic ending.
</P>
<P>
   Sue had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease in 1970,
just after Glenn was born. PKD causes cysts to grow on the kidney,
which enlarges the organ and hinders its filtering ability. It is
the most common of the life-threatening genetic diseases and, at
this time, does not have a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Sue had one kidney partially removed in 1970, and last October
the other started to fail. She needed a transplant to live and had
only weeks to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Each of her four sons volunteered, including Glenn, which would
have meant the end of his football career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Mom, what's the difference? I don't care if I play
football again,''' Sue told the Hartford Courant at the time. ``I
told him, I told all of them: No way. ... I never gave it a second
thought. I mean, this is not the same thing as asking somebody for
a ride to the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sue got the needed kidney from her husband, Ed, who
like Glenn played quarterback at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to and following the Nov. 5 double
surgery where doctors removed a football-sizekidney from his mother
and replaced it with a healthy organ from his father, Foley would
fly from New York to Boston after practicing with the Jets to be
with his parents. Then he would fly back in time to be at practice
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy. Glenn had a lot of stuff on his shoulders,'' Jen
said. ``His mom's disease progressed so quickly, no one was
expecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and Jen already had started the Glenn Foley Wings
Foundation earlier in the year. A 3-handicap golfer, Foley had won
money in celebrity tournaments, only to give it to a designated
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of donating to this charity and that charity, we
decided to start our own charity,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's battle with PKD gave the new organization its
cause. Cliff Foley, Glenn's older brother, also has the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this happened,'' Jen said, ``it was very clear this is
what we were meant to educate people on.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Foley's entire family is involved in Wings. But it is Jen
who has it soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one who really has taken this thing and is running
with it,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is with the Seahawks, who obtained him two weeks ago
in a trade with the Jets, the Wings Foundation has become
bicoastal.
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn was busy with practice Tuesday, Jen was setting up
her new office in Bellevue. The other office is in Moorestown, N.J.
The goal is to raise at least $200,000 for a PKD Foundation
educational grant, and to raise awareness of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great. The awareness of PKD is about to
blossom,'' Glenn said. ``Now we can go coast-to-coast with it and
hopefully raise a lot of money.''

HINCHCLIFFE MAKES GOOD USE OF HARD-EARNED CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Brett Hinchliffe admires Jim Abbott in the way
any other major leaguer would.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' the Mariners right-hander said. ``I watched
him the other day, that was the first time I'd seen him live. You
can't bunt on him. He's incredible. Then he bats, and he got a
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, people have asked Hinchliffe if he looked up to
Abbott for a different reason. Abbott, a veteran left-hander with
the Milwaukee Brewers, was born without a right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe, a rookie who has pitched his way onto the Mariners'
roster this spring, was born with a webbed left hand. The
hereditary condition is known as syncactylism. He was spared
another symptom, the loss of a muscle in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe, who worked four innings in the Mariners' 9-5 victory
over the Arizona Diamondbacks Tuesday, was born with five fingers
on his left hand. But, recognizing the webbed condition, doctors
amputated his middle finger and inserted that bone in his thumb.
Hinchliffe has two bones in the thumb, allowing him to grip things
and giving him better mobility. His second and third fingers are
stubby, but both have joints and one has full mobility, and his
pinkie is normal.
</P>
<P>
   The scars from the operation are obvious, and Hinchliffe's left
wrist and hand are significantly smaller than his right. He has
thought about asking his glove manufacturer for a specially
designed model, but the one he has is fine. He has to tighten the
strap around his wrist, and occasionally a hard line drive will
knock the glove loose. But appearances aside, Hinchliffe's hand
functions normally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, things were said,'' Hinchliffe said. ``But
for the most part I wasn't really teased that much at all, at least
not that I can remember. It wasn't too bad when I was growing up,
because I could do everything and play all the sports. Guys
respected me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those sports caused Hinchliffe trouble last spring. He
sprained his ankle playing basketball, leading to the first of four
setbacks that made him something of a mystery man to manager Lou
Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle injury, a detached retina, food poisoning and an
uncle's funeral back home in Michigan kept Hinchliffe out of action
during the exhibition season. He went 10-8 with a 4.00 earned run
average for Class AAA Tacoma, but a late-season bone spur kept him
from getting a September call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the caravan this winter, and people asked, `Who are
some of the young pitchers coming up?''' said outfielder Charles
Gipson, Hinchliffe's best friend on the team. ``I told everyone,
`Brett Hinchliffe,' and they're all like, `Who's that?' But I've
seen him throughout the minor leagues _ he's got good stuff, lots
of pitches, works hard. It was a matter of just getting the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance came this spring, and Piniella said Hinchliffe has
pitched ``as well as anyone we've had in camp.'' Including two
innings in a charity game, Hinchliffe has allowed three earned runs
in 17 innings for a 1.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown the M's a major league fastball, slider, curveball
and changeup, the last of which he can use to get left-handers out.
The 24-year-old also has shown major league confidence, displaying
an uncommon ease around Piniella and pitching coach Stan Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a throw day the other day, and Stan and I talked to him
the whole time,'' Piniella said. ``He was very relaxed, threw the
ball to both sides of the plate, worked on his breaking ball. You
can't do that with too many young kids. They're more intense and
focused on what they're doing. With Hinchliffe, he was intense and
focused, but also relaxed enough to talk to us and give us feedback
while he threw.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe said he benefited from being in camp last year,
absorbing the atmosphere and learning how major leaguers acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I came into camp and I was all relaxed and ready to
go,'' he said. ``Last year I might have been nervous, but for some
reason, this year I'm just not. I don't know, it's just a different
feeling. I feel like I belong. I feel like I'm part of the team,
and that's why I'm so relaxed and so calm out there. It's a good
feeling to actually keep a smile on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's easier to smile when you've never allowed a
major league run. In fact, Hinchliffe has avoided trouble almost
all spring, which is why catcher Tom Lampkin reminded him to keep
it together after allowing a pair of solo homers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get everybody out all game,'' Lampkin
said. ``You have to rebound and pull yourself out of it. He seems
to me to have the type of personality that will enable him to do
that, but we'll have to see when the season starts. Because he's
going to be tested this year, there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor league pitching coordinator Bryan Price said Hinchliffe
always has had confidence. But it's taken him seven minor league
seasons to get a shot in Seattle because, at 6-foot-5 and only 190
pounds, Hinchliffe was raw when he entered the system and needed to
mature physically. Now, his physical tools allow him to approach
the game the way he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give the hitters too much respect,'' Hinchliffe said.
``A lot of young guys give hitters too much respect, and they're
afraid to throw their fastballs. But the hardest pitch to hit is a
well-located fastball, either inside or outside. I like to
establish that early.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe was slated to be the Mariners' fifth starter until
reliever Mark Leiter went down with a shoulder injury. Piniella
said Hinchliffe could fill Leiter's relief role for the first few
days of the year, then make a start April 14, the first day Seattle
needs a fifth starter. Or, he could stay in relief and Ken Cloude
could start.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Hinchliffe isn't counting on anything. Asked what
number he'll choose if he can drop No. 68 _ the highest still in
camp _ he laughs and says he won't think about it until he's flying
into Sea-Tac.
</P>
<P>
   But the last survivor in his row of lockers in the M's spring
training clubhouse doesn't think he's a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gipson, ``He's just showing Lou what he already knew
himself.''

POSTGAME ERUPTION PUNCTUATES LATEST SONIC SLEEPWALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sonics center Olden Polynice has seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   The bench. The mediocre play. The team's barely above-average
record.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Sonics took a 95-87 pounding from the San Antonio
Spurs at the Alamodome Tuesday night, Polynice gave his duffle bag
a beating. Polynice, the team's energizer on the court, displayed
different emotions while slamming several personal belongings into
his luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics lost for the second time in three games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little ticked off right now. (Expletive) 15 and 14?''
Polynice said, referring to the Sonics' record. ``I'm mad because
we're losing. I didn't come here to lose. I had other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none of those included sitting on the bench for long
stretches, which is what Polynice, Billy Owens and Hersey Hawkins
did Tuesday. Frustrated by another slow start, Sonics coach Paul
Westphal made good on his word to shake up the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   So rookies Vladimir Stepania and Jelani McCoy were inserted with
Dale Ellis when the starting unit missed 10 of its first 12 shots.
The Sonics fell behind 27-14 after the first quarter, and fought
from behind the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never led.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the bad start tonight killed us,'' Westphal said.
`` ... It's a frustrating thing to have happen to you. Fatigue may
have played a part but you can't make excuses. You have to make
shots in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The team outrebounded a much bigger Spurs team, 47-41, but shot
just 38 percent from the field. Westphal used McCoy for 16 minutes
and Stepania for 23, partly because the pair of 6-foot-10 rookies
gives the team size up front. A bigger reason, though, for the
apparent youth movement is McCoy and Stepania seem to sometimes
play with more hustle and energy than the starters put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do,'' said McCoy, who had eight points,
five rebounds and four blocks. ``We outrebounded them. We hustled.
The shots just didn't go down. But we're going to keep playing
hard. That's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear the Sonics will continue to dig out of their
funk with younger players getting quality minutes. Westphal said as
much, and his rotation is starting to show that.
</P>
<P>
   Owens never re-entered the game after playing seven minutes in
the first quarter. Hawkins played 31 minutes, and Polynice saw just
23 minutes, which included just four in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to win games. I didn't come here for transition,''
Polynice, who finished with 10 points and nine rebounds. ``If
that's what's happening, it's news to me. Coaches make decisions
and we have to abide by them. But I came here because I thought
this team had a chance to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are trudging through this 50-game season just trying
to make the playoffs. Tuesday's game was their third in three
nights. It also was disappointing after the Sonics beat Dallas
rather easily Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, against the Spurs, the Sonics' shots mostly fell short.
They even missed 13 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with three games in three nights,'' said
Ellis, who scored 14 points in 27 minutes. ``If we don't play a
game, then we're practicing for two hours. What difference does it
make?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer must be effort.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 68-60 late in the third, the Sonics made their last run
with young legs on the floor. During one sequence, McCoy blocked
Tim Duncan's shot, rebounded a miss on the other end and scored on
a dunk that got the Sonics within 68-65.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Sonics threatened, San Antonio responded behind
Duncan, who finished with a game-high 26 points and nine rebounds.
Duncan's dunk with 1:45 left in the game put the Spurs ahead 90-79,
and killed any chance of a Sonic rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics found the basket in the first quarter. They just
couldn't put a tennis ball through it. Owens and Gary Payton both
missed their first three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Payton struggled. He missed his first five shots before
finishing with 15 points on 5-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate after we played so well (Monday),'' forward
Detlef Schrempf said. ``They took us out of what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   These Sonics have been out of it all season.

CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers entered March like lambs
and are coming out like lamb chops.
</P>
<P>
   Working the grill Tuesday were the Houston Rockets, who served
up the Clippers' 26th loss in 29 games, 104-95, in front of 9,188
at the Sports Arena. While the Clippers were digesting their 10th
loss in the past 11 games, the hungry Rockets (22-9) polished off
their eighth consecutive victory and 12th in the last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we could pay tribute to the Clippers' usual-and-abbreviated
bursts of pluck, but the only spin doctor who could adequately
treat this lingering epidemic is named Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   One rare Clippers constant is the relentless effort of undrafted
rookie forward Tyrone Nesby. Matched against Houston's Scottie
Pippen _ who happens to be the defensive standard for NBA small
forwards _ Nesby hopped around for a career-high 24 points and five
steals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets _ whose Hall of Fame frontcourt is marking time
in style before being retired to the Hall of Fame _ are expected to
win game like these.
</P>
<P>
   In their corner was 15-year veteran Hakeem Olajuwon, who had
nine of those 17 against Clippers rookie Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were required to withstand the Clippers'
interpretation of the transition game _ going from bad (Monday in
Denver) to worse. But _ before this one could get coyote ugly _
Nesby decided it was time for a few demonstrations of Clippers
chutzpah. He converted two interceptions into breakaway dunks, the
first a spectacular, double-dump reverse that was a 10 in anybody's
book.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby spruced up the resume even more by jamming Olowokandi's
missed jump hook to tie the score at 19 with 2:09 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Darrick Martin found rookie Cuttino Mobley's defense
to his liking and scored 12 of the Clippers' 22 first-quarter
points. The Rockets managed 23.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter was a showcase for Othella Harrington,
Houston's low-post sub who worked Lorenzen Wright for 11 points as
the Rockets outscored the Clippers, 30-17, taking a 14-point
advantage into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, whose recent history suggests their motto should
not be ``May the fourth be with you,'' decided against rolling over
and playing dead.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Hudson, who was liberated from the CBA one week ago,
drilled a 3-pointer at 9:30 of round four to pull the Clippers to
within seven. Maurice Taylor followed with a bucket, but the
Rockets exhaled into a working _ and winning _ margin behind a pair
of heart-stabbing 3s by guard Brent Price.

DISARCINA NEEDS SURGERY, SETTING OFF CHAIN OF EVENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, out since Feb. 21 with a broken bone
in his left forearm, will have surgery Thursday and will be out
three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels had reasoned that if their shortstop had to
suffer an injury, it came at the right time because he had time to
recover and be ready sometime around opening day. Instead, it's
just another injury in a series of injuries that have hurt the
Angels in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the news on DiSarcina, the Angels traded third
baseman Dave Hollins to the Toronto Blue Jays for shortstop Tomas
Perez. Perez, 25, has played in 178 major-league games during the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also released reliever Rich DeLucia, which comes as a
surprise to some. DeLucia, along with Shigetoshi Hasegawa, was
expected to be a key set-up man for closer Troy Percival. Last
season, DeLucia, 33, was 2-6 with a 4.27 ERA in 61 games.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the Angels are planning to make another move soon,
probably for a starting pitcher. That would allow them to move Omar
Olivares from the starting rotation and into DeLucia's spot in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it real odd,'' DeLucia said. ``Deep down I know it's
about money. They can say whatever they want about health. I felt
good this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing DeLucia before 9 a.m. today, the Angels are
responsible for only one-quarter of DeLucia's $700,000 salary, or
$175,000. Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said the move was
strictly a coaches' decision.
</P>
<P>
   The news DiSarcina will be out until possibly August comes at
the worst possible time for the Angels, with opening day less than
a week away. DiSarcina had hoped that after being re-examined and
X-rayed this week, he'd be able to shed his cast and begin working
out.
</P>
<P>
   A return to the field within the first two weeks of the season
was anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had a CT Scan performed by Dr. Lewis Yocum on Monday,
which showed the bone is not completely healed. Following a
consultation, DiSarcina agreed to have surgery, which will include
having a plate screwed into the ulnar bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a setback in the way we viewed our team at the
outset of spring training,'' Angels vice president Tim Mead said.
``We'll make things work out. Truly it's a very resilient, gritty
team. Knowing Gary's coming back is something we will all look
forward to. But there's a lot of work to do before then.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez played most of last season at Syracuse, the Blue Jays'
Triple-A affiliate, hitting .252 with three homers and 37 RBI in
116 games. He also played in six games with the Blue Jays, hitting
.111 (1 for 9).
</P>
<P>
   As for sending Hollins away, the Angels have answered one of
their biggest questions of the spring _ who will start at third
base? Troy Glaus, 22, will be the opening-day starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Troy Glaus is ready to be a successful third
baseman on the highest level and we wanted to afford Dave the
opportunity to play every day somewhere,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins had an injury-plagued 1998, playing in 101 games and
hitting only .242. But he had shoulder surgery during the
offseason, battled through a spring hamstring injury and began
playing well in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, 32, has a .262 career average in nine major-league
seasons.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Kukes, Albania) _ In the darkness, the little
villages in the rolling hills and river valleys around the Kosovo

_ to beat the 5 a.m. deadline set by Serbian forces. Even as some
60,000 ethnic Albanians streamed into this border town, mostly from

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Major League Soccer Commissioner Doug Logan
said Tuesday he will meet with Galaxy midfielder Mauricio
Cienfuegos and his agent, Corey Clemetson, on Thursday in an effort
to settle Cienfuegos' contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos and fellow Salvadoran Raul Diaz Arce of San Jose have
been at odds with the league over their contracts since training
camp opened in February.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cienfuegos and Diaz Arce ended camp-long holdouts March 20
to attend their clubs' season openers. However, both vowed to sit
out Saturday's Galaxy-Clash game and likely head home to El
Salvador if an agreement isn't reached this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson, who represents both players, says little progress has
been made in the past week, despite Logan's claims that a
substantial offer is on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made both players aggressive offers to extend their
contracts out a number of years,'' Logan said during a conference
call. ``We are hopeful we can reach an agreement before the week is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan said renegotiating contracts isn't something he's inclined
to do, but he is willing to make an exception this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no incentive on our part to go out there and rip up
the contracts,'' Logan said. ``Otherwise, the integrity of the
relationships with players in this league would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, we want them to stay with us a long time. But at the
end of the day, they have to make up their minds, and they have to
make their choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson wouldn't comment on the offers, but laughed at Logan's
comment that they were ``aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we haven't made much progress in the last
week,'' Clemetson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson acknowledged that Diaz Arce has left San Jose to be in
Los Angeles with Cienfuegos until Thursday's meeting. Cienfuegos,
however, is still practicing with the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to find a way to get the deal done,'' Clemetson
said. ``Both players are hoping they can be in uniform this
weekend, but we don't know if that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make every effort possible for Mauricio and
Raul to work something out. But it's their decision, and it has to
be something they are both happy with.''

IN NAME, IT'S TIME FOR RAMS TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italic) Today's episode of The Sporting Muse, which once again
casts a suspicious eye at the NFL: (end italic)
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL does indeed return to Los Angeles, there's some
business that needs to be considered by the league and any group of
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cleveland reacted when Art Modell took the Browns to
Baltimore, a grass roots movement is needed to reacquire the name
``Rams'' from the infidels who took the team to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   This is a win-win proposition. L.A. would get back a name that
had deep meaning when the franchise played in the Coliseum, before
it shuffled off to sleepy Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams played for NFL titles with fellas named Van Brocklin,
Waterfield, Fears and Hirsch. The Rams were coached by George
Allen. The Rams produced more modern-day heroes like Merlin Olsen,
Deacon Jones, Roman Gabriel, Dick Bass. The Ram helmet logo once
had as much meaning in L.A. as the script Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis owners would make beaucoup dollars through new
merchandising for a name that the city would feel is its own, as
opposed to one it got second-hand. ...
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's expansion committee is scheduled to make its visit to
tour the Coliseum and Carson in late April. It wants to have a site
recommendation to return to the membership at a meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
   It will likely be then that the league will want an ownership
group to take form. A league source said the committee fully
expects prospective owners beyond the current suspects to step up.
...
</P>
<P>
   The NFL keeps saying that any expansion to 32 teams would be its
last for quite some time. Forgive my skepticism, but the league
would be very short-sighted financially if it stuck to that policy.

<P>
   The franchise fee in Los Angeles is expected to be around $650
million, and $500 million if Houston gets a team on the rebound.
Add those two numbers together and you have a billion reasons for
the league to go from 32 to 34 teams as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Two more teams at a modest $1 billion combined would produce a
one-time bonus of $30 million-plus for each current team. That
would far outweigh any loss in TV revenue through sharing with more
partners.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL were to time things correctly, it could have two more
teams ready to go just as it can exercise an option in the current
TV deal. Assuming that TV rights fees will continue to climb faster
than a missile, the league could get a boost to make up for
expanding to 34. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are calling UConn's win over Duke Monday for the
NCAA title a huge upset. But it doesn't come close to N.C. State or
Villanova, who were real underdog winners. The Huskies were ranked
No. 1 for two months and came into the tourney a No. 1 seed. The
``upset'' notion stems from the heavy consensus on Duke, which led
oddsmakers to make Duke a double-digit favorite just to even out
the flow of bets.
</P>
<P>
   UConn deserved to win. Not only did Jim Calhoun discover a way
to frustrate Duke offensively, but his players played it to
perfection. And for once, the best game of the tourney turned out
to be its last. ...
</P>
<P>
   Billy Packer's all-time NCAA Tournament, running as part of an
ad in Sports Illustrated, produced a title game between the 1968
UCLA team and 1976 Indiana. Packer gave the Bruins the nod by two.
That had to take at least a year off his life. ...
</P>
<P>
   Matt Doherty is the new Notre Dame coach. And to think the
former Kansas assistant could have had the Long Beach State job
just a few years ago. He must be miserable about this shift of
fate. ...
</P>
<P>
   I am shocked, shocked I tell you, to learn that Jim Harrick is
pursuing the head coaching job at Georgia, just as I will be
shocked when he pursues the Clippers' job once Chris Ford is freed
from bondage. ...
</P>
<P>
   Interim Lakers coach Kurt Rambis inherited one major problem
from Del Harris too many players and not enough minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are one of the league's deeper teams, but 12-man
rotations are impossible in the NBA. To his credit, Rambis has met
the problem head on by saying there's no solution. ``I can't play
12 guys,'' he said Sunday. ``At best, I can have a nine-man
rotation, and there are nights when I'll use just eight.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more confounding habits of Del Harris was a
keep-everyone-happy substitution pattern that didn't work very
well. Travis Knight, who started 23 games this season, now shares
the end of the bench with Sean Rooks and J.R. Reid, who was having
a nice season with Charlotte (11.9 points, 6.3 rebounds) before
coming west with Glen Rice. ...
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to Tommy Lasorda? Once upon a spring, Dodger
fans would receive gushing daily reports on Dodger Blue. But with a
new general manager and manager in charge, Lasorda has been muzzled
for the first time in perhaps his life.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that his brief impact as GM last year won't be
felt. According to spring reports, Wilton Guerrero (traded to
Montreal for Carlos Perez), united with his brother Vladimir on the
Expos, is having a great spring. And Paul Konerko, now with the
White Sox, also has performed well. The White Sox plan to bat
Konerko as DH fourth behind Frank Thomas, meaning Konerko will have
high RBI potential.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado also signed Brian Bohanon to a $9 million contract
after a fine half-season in the Dodgers' rotation. This one will
likely blow up in the Rockies' face. Bohanon is a junkball pitcher,
and the altitude in Denver is notorious for flattening breaking
pitches. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's great that the Arrowhead Pond earned the rights to host
this year's Frozen Four, the NCAA hockey championships. But
considering three of the four finalists hail from New England
Maine, New Hampshire and Boston College it seems a long way to go
just to learn that the Pond has the worst ice in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The one name in the tourney everyone will know is Maine's Steve
Kariya, the younger brother of the Ducks' Paul. To show you what
kind of season it's been for the Kings, Dave Taylor's alma mater,
Clarkson University, was eliminated in its regional. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is no truth to reports that Raiders owner Al Davis, after
seeing the crowd at the Cuba-Orioles game Sunday, opened
negotiations with Mr. Castro about a new stadium. How does one say
private seat license in Spanish? ...
</P>
<P>
   I hope Fidel knows that all those major league scouts and
personnel people who attended the Orioles' game as ambassadors
wanted to bring home more than a box of cigars. ...
</P>
<P>
   Mark your calendars: Los Angeles is bidding for the 2012 Olympic
Games. The group seeking the games, which includes 1984 Olympic
organizers Peter Uebberoth and John Argue, has officially launched
its campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC will make a decision in 2005. That gives the L.A. group
ample time to line up college scholarships for children of IOC
member, jobs for family members and large quantities of their
favorite alcoholic beverage. ...
</P>
<P>
   I just want to know what Elia Kazan has to say about Major
League Baseball playing a game in Cuba. Has he called his contacts
in the state department and read them the Orioles' lineup?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _As if twisting weather prophecy, the Los Angeles
Clippers decided to enter March like lambs and come out like lamb
chops.
</P>
<P>
   Working the grill Tuesday were the Houston Rockets, who served
up the Clippers' 26th loss in 29 games, 104-95, in front of 9,188
at the Sports Arena. While the Clippers were digesting their 9th
loss in the last 11 games, the hungry Rockets (22-9) polished off
their eighth consecutive victory and 12th in the last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   One Clipper who may prevent the team from hiring Kevorkian as
spin doctor is undrafted rookie forward Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   Matched against Houston's Scottie Pippen - the gold-medal
standard for defense among NBA small forwards -- Nesby hopped
around for a career-high 24 points and five steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pippen is cool,'' Nesby said, who added shoe time to showtime.
``He said he like my game and told me to keep workin' hard. I asked
him if I could wear his shoes. He said he'd send some down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of talent in (Maurice) Taylor and Nesby,''
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich, being gracious in victory, said.
``The Clippers are a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and according to a recent survey, most NBA accidents occur
in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Rockets -- whose frontcourt (Pippen, Hakeem
Olajuwon and Charles Barkley) is marking time in style before being
retired to the Hall of Fame -- are expected to leave huge
footprints in games like these.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's big three combined for just 37 points, but rookie
guard Michael Dickerson went airborne for 19, while Brent Price
(19) and Othella Harrington (17) combined for 36 off the bench.
Price hit two from downtown to sabotage the Clippers' latest
fourth-quarter conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor had 21 points for the Clippers, but extended his
rebounding slump by recording a lonely one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps exacting a measure of revenge for the NFL's recent
expansion announcement, the mature Rockets blasted off to a 17-9
lead, fueled by their experience edge in the Great Nigerian
Showdown.
</P>
<P>
   In their corner was 15-year veteran Olajuwon, who had nine of
those first 17 against Clippers rookie Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very mobile,'' Olowokandi said of Olajuwon, his low-post
role model. ``He's sort of like the Michael Jordan of the big
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this one could get coyote ugly -- Nesby decided it was
time for a few demonstrations of Clipper chutzpah. He converted two
interceptions into breakaway dunks, the first a spectacular,
double-dump reverse number that even the Russian judge would reward
with a ``10.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to do a 360,'' Nesby said, ``but I decided to keep
it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just tryin' to get our guys pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   He spruced up the resume a bit more by jamming Olowokandi's
missed jump hook to tie the score at 19 with 2:09 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers trailed by 14 at intermission, went down by 22 in
the third period, then rallied to enter round four down by only 11.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's 15-foot runner pulled them to within five at 84-79 with
9:06 to play, but Price countered with two heart-stabbing
3-pointers to restore order.

 NEW QUAKE FEARS IN TAHOE REGION  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The discovery of unmapped seismic faults in the
Lake Tahoe region has increased concerns that major earthquakes
could strike at any time over a wide area between Reno and the
lake's west shore.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have used a variety of techniques to locate the
faults, including tough treks through the rugged terrain of the
area's mountains, sophisticated satellite measurements of ground
deformation, and deep-water soundings that turned up evidence
showing that Tahoe's lakebed has been scarred by past quakes that
created huge underwater landslides and canyons.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, researchers at the University of Nevada in Reno
have warned that as small villages and once-isolated resort
communities expand into large urban centers, the potential damage
from future quakes demands more careful regional planning and
tougher building codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been excited and somewhat shocked to see how many active
faults we've found that haven't been mapped before,'' said Mary M.
Lahren, an earthquake researcher at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``These could cause major damage to dwellings and business and
could disrupt transportation, communications, and gas and power
lines,'' said Richard Schweickert, chairman of the department of
geological sciences. ``Seismic activity could have serious impacts
on lake clarity and could also affect the nearby Reno-Carson City
metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the newest sonar technology for underwater soundings, a
team headed by James V. Gardner at the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park surveyed the lakebed last summer and found vivid
evidence that earthquake faults on both sides of Tahoe cleave the
lakebottom itself and have most probably been active in the past
10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant of those newly mapped features,
Lahren said, is a long and complex fault zone in Earth's crust that
runs from Truckee through Dollar Point on the northwest shore of
the lake and continues beneath the lake to Sugar Pine Point and
beyond. The scientists are calling it the West Tahoe Fault.
</P>
<P>
   Another active fault zone extends from the southwestern suburbs
of Reno through Mount Rose and Incline Village and into the deepest
parts of the lake, Lahren said. It is now called the North Tahoe
Fault.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by Schweickert, Lahren and seismologist
Kenneth Smith concludes that the newly mapped faults are longer
than researchers have previously thought. Because the length of a
fault is directly related to the power of an earthquake, this means
``that the question of possible earthquake magnitudes needs to be
re-examined,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the possibilities are real for large
earthquakes, with magnitudes of 7 or more, the researchers believe.
</P>
<P>
   Only last October, a magnitude 4.9 quake hit just north of
Incline Village. The same area was struck with a magnitude 6.5
temblor in 1966 and a magnitude 6 event in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the potentially damaging faults lies deep beneath
the ground, where a large part of Earth's crust is being
continuously deformed over a vast area stretching across 500 miles
of mountain and desert, from the Colorado Plateau in eastern Utah
to the eastern flanks of the Sierra. The region is known as the
Basin and Range Province, and it's moving.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Geological Survey, geophysicist Wayne Thatcher
recently created an array of 63 ground stations across the entire
province to measure ground motion by taking signals from the
high-precision satellites of America's Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in the journal Science earlier this month,
Thatcher and his colleagues found that for 125 miles or so, the
crust in the western part of the Basin and Range abutting the
Sierra is being steadily squeezed at a rate of 21/2 miles a year
northwestward against the more stable crustal block of the Sierra.
That's an inexorable crunch easily powerful enough to fracture the
deep crusts into seismic faults.
</P>
<P>
   In Reno, Schweickert, Lahren and Smith recently briefed
officials of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency on the implications
of the research. The faults that run beneath Lake Tahoe, they said,
must be considered active because Gardner's new map of the lakebed
clearly shows that the fault traces cut through young sediments on
the bottom, and that large earthquakes in the relatively recent
past have apparently triggered huge landslides into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong evidence, Schweickert said, that quakes have
ruptured the ground throughout the Reno-Tahoe region repeatedly
during the past, and that they could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Schweickert said in an interview, ``is that we
have no way to tell how frequently large quakes have occurred on
each fault in the past, so we can't estimate their recurrence rate
in an effort to see the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reno group now hopes to take a stab at that kind of loose
prediction by taking core samples of the sediments and landslides
on the Tahoe lakebed. Organic matter in the samples would allow
them to use techniques based on radioactive carbon to determine the
dates when past quakes have struck _ and thereby to peer into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Schweickert said, ``we have to let people know
there's a significant earthquake hazard in the region, but we can't
tell them when the next one will come.''

 ANALYSIS: CATHOLIC WEEKLY SPURRED PROTEST OF `SISTERS' PARTY  &HT;     By DON LATTIN  
 and ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ For years, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence
have celebrated their anniversary on Easter Sunday. Some years,
they even got permits for their outrageous parties from the city of
San Francisco.
<P>
   So why are the Sisters and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
suddenly at each other's throats _ and both accusing the other of
intolerance and bigotry?
</P>
<P>
   What has changed in the Bay Area media equation is that the
archdiocese now has its own newspaper, a tabloid sent each week to
110,000 Catholic households in San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic San Francisco gave the church hierarchy a way to rally
the faithful _ with more circulation than some local dailies.
</P>
<P>
   When the Board of Supervisors granted the Sisters a permit to
close a block of Castro Street on Easter Sunday, the newspaper ran
a stinging column titled ``Bending Over Backward to Ridicule the
Faith,'' written by Wade Hughan, vice chairman of the conservative
Catholics for Truth and Justice. It gave readers the phone numbers
of Mayor Willie Brown and four members of the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call Reverend Amos Brown (who is both a Baptist preacher and a
city supervisor) and ask him if men dressed in habits with
crucifixes around their necks ridiculing our church is an
appropriate way for San Francisco to officially celebrate Easter,''
Hughan suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Enough Catholics called to inspire the mayor and two supervisors
to suggest that the city and the Sisters choose a date other than
Easter. On Monday night, the board refused, with Supervisors Brown
and Alicia Becerril dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco Archbishop William Levada serving as the
paper's publisher and spokesman Maurice Healy as associate
publisher, the archdiocese was able to bypass the Bay Area media,
including newspapers some church leaders see as having an
ambivalent _ or even hostile _ attitude toward the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a growing feeling over the years that while
almost any expression is allowed in San Francisco, religious
expressions are suppressed,'' Healy said. ``Now there is a way to
relieve that tension.''
</P>
<P>
   The current dustup over the Sisters was a flash point _ and the
newspaper a convenient way to channel the Catholic hierarchy's
frustration with the gayest city in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a rupture culturally and spiritually, it's because
there's a chasm between the Catholic Church and the gay
community,'' said the Rev. Jim Mitulski, co-pastor of the mostly
gay Metropolitan Community Church in the Castro neighborhood. ``The
controversy over the Sisters has been an unfortunate way to talk
about much more important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay people who have faced ostracism from the Catholic Church
have their own suspicions about the church's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all of a sudden the archbishop would freak out over this,
I don't know,'' said gay community activist Tommi Avicolli Mecca.
``Why this issue? Why a street closure in the Castro, of all
places, where outrageous things happen all the time? It's not
downtown. It's not in front of his church.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy replied, ``What's driving this is, Catholics have been
watching the Sisters engage in these activities for years on TV and
have been offended and haven't been able to express our feelings in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, San Francisco Catholics have simmered as their
influence declined in City Hall, while the political power of the
gay and lesbian community continued to grow. More than a quarter of
the Board of Supervisors are lesbian or gay. Its president, Tom
Ammiano, one of the most powerful people in City Hall, is among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishops used to be invited to give the benediction at City
Hall events. Now they issue press releases complaining about the
mayor presiding over mass weddings of gay and lesbian voters
gathered under that same rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new mayor's penchant for flamboyance has now turned out to
have a far more subversive purpose,'' Levada wrote in his March 19
column in Catholic San Francisco. ``It is linked to a relatively
new, broad-based campaign to change the legal definition of
marriage to include same-sex unions. ... The good order of society
itself requires us to draw a line to protect the institution of
marriage and the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecca is one of many gay activists who suggest that the church's
position on the Sisters is an opening salvo in its support of the
Knight Initiative, the measure on the state's spring 2000 ballot
that would make it impossible for same-sex couples in California
ever to legally marry.
</P>
<P>
   Mitulski said that with all the brouhaha, it has been easy to
forget that some of the most devout Catholics are gay. Half of his
500 congregants count themselves as Catholic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Christians and we're gay and we're happy to celebrate
Easter, and then we're going down to the (Sisters') party,''
Mitulski said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that both the Archdiocese of San Francisco and the
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence will come out as winners when this
round of March Madness comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Church opposition to their Easter party has given the Sisters
priceless national publicity, guaranteeing a huge turnout for their
Castro Street extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   But the church has also let it be known that there is more than
one powerful voting bloc _ that the Catholic faithful, along with
the Castro's devotees, can make themselves heard.

   1. A FARE TO REMEMBER A person climbs into the back of a dimly
lit taxi. The only eye contact is through the rear-view mirror.
Negotiating a turn, the driver asks a question, prompting the
passenger to start talking. The client senses a need to respond and
within minutes is sharing his innermost thoughts. Only after the
taxi ride is over does the passenger learn that his catharsis has
been videotaped for ``Taxicab Confessions.'' The series documents
real and earnest hidden-camera interviews during late-night drives.
The producers-directors attest that ``everything'' has transpired
in their cabs - laughs, tears, drugs, violence and sex. It's the
passengers' candidness about their real lives that mesmerizes
viewers. By Maryam Heinen. From The Hollywood Reporter. 1,000 words
+ photo. 2. PETER, PAUL AND MARY HELP KEEP FOLK ALIVE The members
of legendary folk group Peter, Paul and Mary may all be over 60,
but they are still keeping the spirit of the '60s alive with music
and political activism. Their new retrospective album, ``Songs of
Conscience and Concern,'' resists the temptation to include hits
like ``If I Had A Hammer'' and ``Where Have All The Flowers Gone.''
Instead, the collection features less known harmonic gems, songs
chosen from the trio's 20 previous albums, to reflect the social
and political issues of today. By Tamara Conniff. BPI. 900 words +
photo. 3. NICKELODEON : THE CHANNEL THAT CHANGED KIDS TV Two
decades ago, certain truths about children's television were held
to be self-evident. Namely, that boys wouldn't watch TV shows whose
main characters were girls; that shows based on toys would be a
commercial success; and that a cable channel devoted to children
was not likely to become a major player in the TV industry. Then
Nickelodeon was born on April 1, 1979. As the network prepares to
celebrate its 20th birthday, it is the top-rated cable network in
the U.S., a distinction it has claimed for four years in a row. By
Don Aucoin. From The Boston Globe. 1,600 words + photo. 4.
CONFUSION REIGNS A damaging battle is about to break out in the
consumer electronics industry on a scale not seen since the VHS and
Betamax standards for VCRs fought it out in the early 1980s. Rival
alliances plan to launch two incompatible music formats. Both will
come with draconian anti-copying measures that may discourage
potential purchasers. By Barry Fox. New Scientist. 300 words. (N/A
Brazil, Australia, New Zealand.) 5. KELSEY GRAMMER'S SHRINK RAP
These are the very best of times for ``Frasier.'' The TV show has
thrived and gained even higher ratings. And few people are more
surprised than Kelsey Grammer, Frasier Crane himself. Interview by
Andrew Ryan. From TV Guide Canada. 1,300 words + photo. 6. DERMOT
MULRONEY WANTS HIS NAME BACK Dermot Mulroney's biggest hit was ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' (1997.) ``I think that movie is the
ultimate comedy,'' he says, ``because you had characters played by
Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz fighting over me ...'' The film's
success led to some new opportunties for Mulroney. Interview by
Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
GWEN VERDON STILL HEARS THE MUSIC Gwen Verdon has been successful
on stage, in films and on television and has an armful of awards.
Along the way, she taught Marilyn Monroe how to walk, served as
muse to great director/choreographer Bob Fosse and was in a string
of Broadway hits. It's rare for musical performers to find work
after they pass the song-and-dance age, but this 74-year-old isn't
finished yet. By Michael J. Bandler. 1,300 words + photo
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
GWYNETH PALTROW WOULD LIKE HER LIFE BACK AT 25, Gwyneth Paltrow
virtually stole the Oscor show. She has been described as the ``new
Grace Kelly'' and ``the Meryl Streep of the '90s.'' Paltrow, who
has worked non-stop for the past three years in England, Italy and
Canada, says she has been trying ``to get my life back.'' By Ivor
Davis. 1,300 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.) 9.
PETE POSTLETHWAITE TAKES THE LEAD You've probably seen Pete
Postlethwaite's craggy face somewhere for the English actor has
played an impressive array of supporting roles in an eclectic range
of films, including Spielberg's ``The Lost World'' and the hit
drama ``In the Name of the Father,'' for which he received a best
supporting actor Oscar nomination. Now the 52-year-old character
actor is breaking new ground with his first romantic leading-man
role in ``Among Giants.'' By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,200 words +

 &HT;    Albanian exchange student, 18, seeking asylum in U.S.
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Genti Sulaj is 18 and hopes next week to be
working two jobs and saving some money.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to establish credit and buy things with the money he
earns.
</P>
<P>
   It's the American way.
</P>
<P>
   But Sulaj is from Albania, and what he wants most is to help pay
for his family's escape from the turmoil and strife that surrounds
them.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, who has made his home the past several months
with Miamisburg (Ohio) residents Charles and Frances Holloway, is
seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees flee NATO bombings of Kosovo, Sulaj is consumed with
gratefulness, concern _ and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels bad I'm here and my family's there,'' Sulaj said.
``It bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents and sister live in Tirana, the capital of Albania,
but are safe for now. Sulaj received a brief phone call from them
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj doesn't allow his fears to stop him. He is awaiting a
hearing on his request for asylum, has his work papers in order and
should receive his Social Security number any day.
</P>
<P>
   With that, he can begin working at Lowe's and the Olive Garden
restaurant. He has bought a 9-year-old car and plans to pay it off
in three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj has been in the country since spending the last half of
his senior year in high school as a foreign exchange student in
Idaho. Instead of returning to Albania, he got off his plane May 22
in Cincinnati and boarded a bus to Dayton. Once in Dayton, he asked
around and found local shelters that took him in.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Holloway was introduced to Sulaj at The Other Place
daytime shelter after she inquired about finding someone to help
her with some hourly work.
</P>
<P>
   She said Sulaj, who speaks four languages and whose plight
touched her heart, opened her eyes to international war and strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening over there, I could bounce it off if it
weren't for Genti,'' she said. ``But I've talked to his mother.
I've talked to his sister, and I think they have more love in their
hearts than a lot of American families who seem to have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's phone call relieved Sulaj for the time being, but he
also worries about other people he has met in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   One friend's family remains in Pristina, Kosovo, in the heart of
the bombing, and he has not heard from his parents. ``He is very,
very upset,'' Sulaj said. ``He is very, very worried. He is going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj said many young people he knew in Albania fled months ago
into Greece and Macedonia. ``This thing has been going on a long
time. It didn't start with the bombings,'' he said. ``Nobody stood
up against what was going on. Now the world is finally standing up,
and it's good. Somebody has to rise up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Holloway tries to help Sulaj focus on becoming
independent and turning his dreams into reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were driving down the highway the other day and he got
really sad,'' Holloway said. ``I asked him, 'Genti, what's the
matter?' He said, 'I'm having the time of my life in America and my
family is in the situation they're in. It seems so unfair.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Genti, you're still their rock. You're still
their hope.''

COLUMN: COURT RIGHT TO UPHOLD INDIAN HUNTING AND FISHING RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper, Wyo., Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(mk) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Last
week, American Indians finally won one at the U.S. Supreme Court _
unfortunately, a rare event. It was a significant but narrow 5-4
victory that upheld an 1837 treaty between Mille Lacs Band of
Chippewa Indians and the United States. Had the Chippewa lost this
case, hunting and fishing rights of all other tribes off their
reservations would have been jeopardized.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ruling should have been unanimous. The issues were that
clear. The Chippewa had filed a lawsuit against the state of
Minnesota seeking an injunction to keep the state from enforcing
hunting and fishing restrictions against band members. The Chippewa
won at the federal district level and again at the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1837 treaty, 12 bands of Chippewa Indians ceded land to
the United States, which later became the states of Minnesota and
Wisconsin, in exchange for money, goods and grain. Article V of the
treaty guaranteed ``the privilege of hunting, fishing, and
gathering the wild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and lakes
included in the territory ceded ... during the pleasure of the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pivotal issues in the case, of course, was the phrase
``during the pleasure of the president.'' In February 1850,
President Zachary Taylor issued an executive order revoking the
tribe's hunting and fishing rights and ordering the Chippewas to be
removed from the ceded lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court notes, in agreement with the court of appeals,
that the ``president's power, if any, to issue the order must stem
either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself.''No such
authority was granted by Congress. No such authority is granted by
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writes for the majority of the
court: ``Because the parties have pointed to no colorable source of
authority for the president's removal order, we agree with the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that the 1850 removal order was
unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's attorneys argued that even if the removal order in
the executive order was unauthorized, the revocation of fishing and
hunting rights in the president's order was, nevertheless, valid.
That is, the fishing and hunting revocation clause could be
separated from the illegal portion of the executive order and stand
as good law. Wrong, says the high court: ``We think it is clear
that President Taylor intended the 1850 order to stand and fall as
a whole. The 1850 order embodied a single, coherent policy ... The
order tells the Indians to `go,' and also tells them not to return
to the ceded lands to hunt and fish.'' The removal order was
invalid, and thereby any part of that order is also invalid, the
high court states.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota also argued that a later treaty with the Chippewa,
entered into in 1855, relinquishes the tribe's hunting and fishing
privileges on the lands ceded to the United States in 1837. Not so,
says the court: ``The 1855 Treaty was designed primarily to
transfer Chippewa land to the United States not to terminate
Chippewa ... rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing Minnesota made a third and final
argument. They claimed that when Minnesota was admitted to the
Union in 1858, the Chippewas' hunting and fishing rights were
thereby extinguished. The Supreme Court makes it clear that it
disagrees: ``Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it
must clearly express its intent to do so ... There is no such
'clear evidence' of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa
Treaty rights here.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional act that admitted Minnesota into the Union
makes no mention of treaty rights at all. Therefore, states the
high court, Minnesota's admission to the Union has no impact on the
1837 treaty rights to hunt and fish on the ceded land.
</P>
<P>
   This decision is significant, not only for itself, but for the
fact that it overrules a portion of an earlier ruling, Ward vs.
Race Horse, wherein certain treaty rights granted to tribes were
terminated when Wyoming became a state. The logic of that 1896
ruling relied on the notion that a state when admitted to the Union
had the same sovereignty over natural resources as the 13 original
states.
</P>
<P>
   The 1896 Supreme Court saw a conflict between a state's
sovereignty over natural resources and treaties which granted
tribes the right to hunt, fish and gather on state land. This court
sees no conflict: ``Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with
state management of natural resources. Although states have
important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources
within their borders, this authority is shared with the federal
government when the federal government exercises one of its
enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas dissented. They
argue that President Taylor's executive order regarding the
termination of hunting and fishing rights had the authority of law
_ even if the removal order was invalid. Fortunately, they were in
the minority. And American Indian tribes finally got an even break.

 &HT;    Aim '10-20-Life' law accurately
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _Prevention. Stopping crime before it
happens. Instructing all with criminal intentions that gun violence
in Florida will bring certain, dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, and asserting only altruistic motives, the
Legislature last Wednesday passed ``10-20-Life,'' a bill requiring
minimum-mandatory sentences for gun crimes. The Senate vote was
39-0; in the House, it was 106-11. Gov. Bush, who campaigned on a
promise to crack down on gun-toting criminals, said, ``Our
neighborhoods and cities will be safer with this legislation,'' and
he will sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   This legislation will increase minimum-mandatory sentences for
both violent crimes and drug trafficking. Beginning July 1, those
who commit such felonies while in possession of a gun are supposed
to receive a 10-year minimum sentence. If the felon fires the gun,
the mandatory sentence is 20 years. If anyone is injured, the
mandatory sentence is 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   During debate, the House members who voted against the measure
expressed concern that prosecutors probably would apply it most
often to minorities, especially young black men. Perhaps to counter
such argument and direct prosecutorial discretion, the final bill
legally defines ``possession'' of a gun as ``carrying it on the
person, or having it within immediate physical reach with ready
access with the intent to use the firearm during the commission of
the offense, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Also perhaps to cancel perceptions of intended bias, the bill
includes a monitoring feature. After July 1, 2000, state attorneys
must report to the governor and the Legislature how every case in
which a gun was fired was resolved, identifying defendants by age,
gender, race and ethnicity. Note: No such monitoring is required of
cases in which a gun was possessed but not fired. Otherwise, the
law on its face seems to have acknowledged possibilities for
prosecutorial abuse and included provisions to influence fairness.
</P>
<P>
   To educate the public, the bill allots up to $500,000 for the
Department of Corrections to publicize it. Given the current
availability of guns, I hope a public education campaign will
extend beyond the next fiscal year and focus significantly on
children as young as elementary-school age. Thoroughly informing
youths, especially poor, minority kids living in drug-infested
neighborhoods, is critical. Mired in circumstances where gun
violence is common, too many of these youngsters are conditioned to
believe that having a gun and using it is a personal choice without
serious legal penalties. Hence, every responsible adult has an
obligation to cite cases that will disabuse them of that notion as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For example, under the law an 18-year-old man caught in his
apartment ``trafficking'' in cocaine and in possession of a gun
could get 15 years for the cocaine and 10 years for the gun _ a
potential total of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the consequence of this law to a minor who commits a
felony with a gun and, based on prosecutorial discretion, is tried
as an adult. Consider also that for indictment purposes, gun
possession when a gun is ``within immediate physical reach ... with
the intent to use'' is a subjective call by officials, many of whom
view all blacks and Hispanics as likely criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue that such concern about possible negative
consequences of ``10-20-Life'' is unwarranted should look to
California, where this law is in effect. Blacks and Hispanics have
received 88percent of all the 10-year sentences for possession.
They received 100 percent of the 20-year sentences. Even if we can
swallow the lopsided stats in the first category, does anyone
really believe only black and Hispanic criminals were guilty of
felonies where a gun was fired?
</P>
<P>
   As this 10-20-Life becomes Florida law, let's hope its positive
intent of crime prevention prevails. More important, let's hope
that these inflexible rules are applied as intended _ without
discrimination.

</P>
<P>
   The couple is hotting up, as my father calls it. My sister and I
slurp faster on our malteds. We're kneeling on the back seat of our
Nash Rambler. Our view of the couple in the car behind is more
interesting than Yvonne De Carlo risking all for her man on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   We are habitues of the drive-in, my sister and I, and excellent
judges of technique. We recognize the long-arm-stretch that ends
with a grab at a breast and observe the slow sinking of the now
intertwined couple until they disappear completely.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't long before we've also sunk from view, into the nest of
blankets and pillows we've brought from home, our teddy bears
tucked beside us, there in the dark cave of our car.
</P>
<P>
   I wake as swelling music signals the big scene when Yvonne De
Carlo rescues her pirate boyfriend. My mother and father have
melded into a single lump in the front seat. He begins nibbling at
her neck. She laughs. I sigh and fall back into sleep. My parents
kiss and hold hands more than anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   When we get home father will carry me into the house and tuck me
into bed. I pretend to sleep through this part but I think he
knows. ``Look,'' he says, ``here is a pirate lady. Let's take her
in and put her to bed. Maybe she'll stay forever if we spoil her
rotten.'' I giggle but try to make it sound like a snore.
</P>
<P>
   The carved ship on my bed's headboard becomes the pirate vessel
from the film but I see it through the window of a Nash Rambler.
Yvonne De Carlo is giggling as a pirate nibbles her neck.
</P>
<P>
   It's years later, 1963, and I'm in a drive-in again. We're
parked in the back row, in our slot, our friends ranged along each
side. We are here every week _ the Saturday night sexual tease. The
object of this game is to get the maximum titillation without
becoming bad girls. We've learned how to do this by watching
Annette Funicello keep Frankie Avalon interested but out of her
panties.
</P>
<P>
   Bad girls wear too much lipstick, eye shadow, high heel shoes,
clothes made of synthetic fabrics. Their handbags are plastic. Boys
talk about them. They mysteriously drop out of school.
</P>
<P>
   We wear dungarees and penny loafers and carry leather handbags.
Our lipstick is a thin layer of Tangee natural. We put Vaseline on
our eyelids instead of eye shadow. Sometimes one of us mysteriously
drops out of school. We don't like to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen the bad girls are writhing around in bikinis while
Annette sits sedately on the beach in a one-piece. At the end of
the movie Annette always has the best guys and the bikini girls
come to bad ends.
</P>
<P>
   A kiss is OK after a couple of dates, we reckon, and maybe some
above-the-waist petting if you're going steady. We spend hours
defining these limits and rules. Like, is a fraternity pin closer
to being engaged than a class ring and therefore license to go a
bit further? We'd all have made excellent 14th-century
ecclesiastics debating the fine points of morality.
</P>
<P>
   Picture it _ rows of steamy-windowed cars filled with desperate,
sweating, frustrated couples. In our own particular car the windows
have got steamier as spring has progressed. We started off with
above-the-neck petting, progressed to above the waist and are
weekly adding more body bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me not fall into temptation,'' alternates with a more
realistic, ``Let me not get pregnant,'' my mantras.
</P>
<P>
   It's years later, the 1990s, and I'm gazing at the drive-in. The
screen has folded over itself, one of the side posts loose from the
ground. A few speaker posts still stand crookedly amid the weeds.
The refreshment stand looks like someone is using it for storage.
The ticket booth has disappeared in the widening highway.
</P>
<P>
   As I look over the ruin I can see again bugs caught in the
flickering light. I catch a whiff of the mixed smell of cooling
engines and popcorn and cheap perfume; our brave laughter flung
into the dark as we shaped our dreams inspired by the stories on
the dazzling screen.
</P>
<P>
   I stare at the screen, looking for some hint of our stories'
endings.
</P>
<P>
   Did the protagonists get a happy finish with rising music and
smiles and pretty sunsets, or was it to be one of those dark modern
dramas with only loss and confusion at the end?
</P>
<P>
   How did it all turn out?

 &HT;    Shut up and eat, already!
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A new law makes it a misdemeanor in Brooklyn,
Ohio to use a cellular phone while driving unless you have both
hands on the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   I'd take that one step further by banning cell phones in
restaurants, or by creating cell phoning and no cell phoning
sections in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I have a cell phone. I'll admit it at the risk of ruining
my redneck reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one thing that yanks my chain, it's these
inconsiderate nincompoops who talk on their cell phones while they
do lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Folks, when we go out to eat, we don't want to be interrupted by
you calling home to see if mamma needs another Roma tomato from the
store. Tell the waitress if you want biscuits or cornbread and then
shut up and eat.
</P>
<P>
   There are emergency occasions when it would be acceptable to use
your cell phone in a public place. Like, say, if you were being
hacked to death. But calling your broker doesn't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   William Roberts of Austin has come up with a fun way to thumb
his nose at rude cell phoners. The retired chemist/engineer is so
fed up with jerks who yap on their cell phones in restaurants that
he's thinking about having business card-size notes printed up that
say:
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time you dine
</P>
<P>
   Get a burger and fries
</P>
<P>
   TO GO
</P>
<P>
   And eat in a $%&AMP;
</P>
<P>
   Telephone BOOTH.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he'd hand the cards out to these chuckleheads who talk on
their cell phones in restaurants. Good for him. If Superman could
change clothes in a phone booth, why couldn't a mannerless cell
phoner dine in one?
</P>
<P>
   Roberts got the brainstorm for the card after a couple of recent
cell phone encounters. The first occurred at a place called
Texspresso.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his lady friend, Linda Wheeler, sat down for coffee
when they couldn't help but hear the man in a coat and tie sitting
at the next table over. This guy was conducting business in a loud
voice on his cell phone, like this was his office.
</P>
<P>
   As Roberts and Wheeler began chatting, the guy on the cell phone
got ticked off. See, Roberts' and Wheeler's conversation was making
it hard for him to hear on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started looking over at us as if to say, 'Why don't you
shut up. I'm having a business conversation here,' `` Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the guy with the cell phone got up and walked 15-20
feet away, now yelling into his cell phone, with his finger in his
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's an idiot,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   On to round two: About a week ago, Roberts and Wheeler were
having dinner at the Hill Country Pasta House. A woman and two
teenagers were at the next table. Roberts says the three spent
dinner making and fielding calls and passing the cell phone around
the table ``so everyone could blather.''
</P>
<P>
   This began with the cell phone ringing. Roberts said the male
teenager, probably 18, answered the phone, talked a while, then
handed the phone to the female teenager, probably 16, who talked a
while, then handed it to the woman, who talked a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``That went on the whole meal,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to shove that cell phone where it won't ring no more.

 &HT;    Lent separates strong from weak
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When I was a kid, the Lenten season was an annual
test of character _ one I habitually flunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you giving up for Lent?'' was a hot question among my
classmates at Ascension Grade School in the '60s. It was what
passed as a big-picture issue, one that compelled us to dissect the
larger questions: Should you give up Swizzle sticks or Pez? The
Time Tunnel or It's About Time? (The former was a 1967 drama about
time travel through history; the latter a 1967 sitcom about time
travel to the Stone Age.)
</P>
<P>
   This was a no-brainer, as far as I was concerned. ``I really
like The Time Tunnel ,'' I said, ``so I'm giving up It's About
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barb looked at me as if I were some unholy hybrid of Bathsheba
and Mary Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should give up something that's hard to give up,'' she
said severely, posing as St. Barbara just as if I hadn't caught her
cheating off my test paper the week before.
</P>
<P>
   My first foray into Lenten sacrifice had been dropping Mighty
Mouse from my Saturday morning cartoon lineup, but Satan proved too
strong. I sat at the top of the stairs and watched, as if God
wouldn't notice my cheating if I were far enough removed. The same
thing happened two years later, when I struggled in vain against
temptation while my siblings watched The Beatles cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lent taught us the lesson of God's infinite forgiveness. There
may be no mercy for those who whispered during Mass or forgot their
chapel veil, but there was grace for us sinners who broke our
Lenten vows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up my before-bed snack,'' recalled Jim, ``but then I
started on an antibiotic for my bronchitis that says I can't take
it on an empty stomach, and I had to fudge a little (with fudge
ripple ice cream, it turns out).''
</P>
<P>
   Picking what to give up was an art in itself; you had to hit on
something that hurt, but not too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up swearing but I never swore,'' said Kate. ``Well, I
couldn't give up chocolate . And Bewitched? Are you kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Catholic church in those pre-Vatican II years, Lent
was full of loopholes. Only the extravagantly pious gave up whole
categories, like candy or TV. Most chose specific subcategories:
Reese's peanut butter cups, for instance, but not Smarties; bubble
gum, but not chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the Lenten sacrifice is already assuming a quaint
air, like the Latin Mass. The trend now is to regard Lent as a time
of community service and volunteerism. The emphasis is not on
giving up, but on giving.
</P>
<P>
   That's all very well for adults, for whom life sometimes seems
like one long Lenten season. Give up candy? Rarely touch the stuff.
Give up potato chips? Cut down on cholesterol years ago, doctor's
orders. Give up TV? Who has time for it?
</P>
<P>
   Our kids are a different story. Schooled in the gospel of
instant gratification, bombarded with messages to
consume-consume-consume, they could stand to give up a little.
Won't that Easter-basket chocolate taste heavenly after 40 days of
deprivation? Won't that TV show seem more enthralling? They need to
learn they can live without one or two of those many things they're
so sure they can't live without.
</P>
<P>
   The best message in this Lenten season came, ironically enough,
during that orgy of opulence, the Oscars. As Roberto Benigni
accepted his best actor statuette, he thanked his parents for ``the
greatest gift _ poverty.'' His bountiful spirit conveyed his
meaning far better than his faltering English: It is in giving up,
and doing without, that we truly learn to give.

 &HT;    Being humbled before riding pros makes one ponder life
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Either a preacher or a pool shark lectured me once
on the benefits of a humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
   If those benefits exist, I'm first in line.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in my life, I know what it feels like to be
the slowest person in class. I have a new appreciation for people
who fall behind and can't catch up.
</P>
<P>
   I now know what the hand-wringing softies are talking about when
they warn that failure injures a student's self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   My Kevlar-reinforced leather glove had the VFR 800's throttle
pinned open on Texas World Speedway's grandstand straightaway. A
peek at my vibrating speedometer was proof that the few
modifications and special racing fuel had been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   A 157 mph, I felt like I was flying.
</P>
<P>
   Man, oh man, was I wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The next moment one of the instructors screamed past me like I
was on a riding lawnmower. The instructor, who may have been the
one who recently won a Daytona motorcycle race, casually turned
around in his seat and gave me the signal to follow him.
</P>
<P>
   He dipped down off the banking into turn one with his left knee
hanging out and his bike leaned over at an angle I would have
admired except my orders were to follow and learn. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed with him through turn one but began to fall behind in
turn two. Coming out of the turn three, I could see the
instructor's right leg jut out as he flicked his bike into turn
four.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the instructor evidently gave up on me. Like one
of those ``Star Trek'' scenes, he disappeared in a warp-drive blur.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I came out of turn 12 and back onto the grandstand
straightaway, the instructor had probably helped four other
sportbike students, eaten lunch and finished a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the instructors are professionals. What about the other
students?
</P>
<P>
   When you are leaned over in a curve thinking that you are about
to violate all known laws of physics and discover the meaning of
life after the fact, it's really an ego buster to have a string of
your fellow students swing around you as though you are road kill.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I came close to keeping up with my classmates was
when it started to drizzle. I kept going as hard as I could and
everyone else slowed down. Stupidity occasionally has its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   When the track dried out, I again was toast.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than building confidence in my riding skills, I could
feel my confidence slipping away lap by lap.
</P>
<P>
   Without mirrors to tell who's behind you or brake lights to tell
if someone in front is slowing down, riders are instructed to raise
their left arms when slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   I felt I should ride the entire course with my left arm raised.
Perhaps I could duct-tape a mannequin's raised left arm to my
riding suit and save the energy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, that afternoon I raised my left arm coming into turn 12
and took the hot-lane pit exit. I parked next to my truck and sat
there contemplating my ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   My buddy soon rode up, killed his engine, flipped up his
faceshield and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   We have ridden thousands of miles on motorcycles but neither of
us had ever been on a sportbike race track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loading my bike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good idea,'' I said. ``If I take any more laps I may stop
riding motorcycles altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportbike school dropouts. Will our self-esteem ever recover?
</P>
<P>
   The next day I told another buddy who has been a champion
motorcycle racer how bummed out I became when other riders blew
around me.
</P>
<P>
   He said I should get over it and get better.
</P>
<P>
   Man, this merit system can be tough.

   It may be a bit late in the Lenten season, but the Discovery

Fourteen back-to-back episodes will focus on decidedly upscale
preparations that may be worth looking at rather than cooking.
Witness swordfish with crabmeat-sesame crust and mirin cilantro
sauce. Soft shell crawfish are a delicacy favored by these chefs.
Crab napoleon and smoked salmon tartare sound comparatively simple.

   Study: brown bread tied to good health
</P>
<P>
   Mom was right _ brown bread is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   A study of more than 30,000 Iowa women, aged 55 to 69, showed
that those who reported eating more whole grains _ including
whole-wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal and other unprocessed food _
were less likely to die in any given year. Although white bread is
fortified with some vitamins, it is no substitute for brown bread
nutritionally, the researchers said. ``Whole grains contain a wide
variety of nutrients and other constituents that are lost in
refining and that may be beneficial for health,'' they wrote in the
American Journal of Public Health .

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the general public in Havana wasn't allowed
to attend the game March 28 between the Cuban national team and the
Baltimore Orioles. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only invited guests were allowed into the historic game at
Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano, and even they had to thread their
way through a heavy security cordon that included dozens of
plain-clothed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the media, the government decided to keep tight
control over who could attend, distributing tickets to Communist
Party faithful through schools, youth organizations and unions.
Some tickets were parceled out to workers and civil servants as
rewards for meeting production quotas and other state goals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fans who attended, electrician Leonardo Marquez, said
he was given his tickets as a reward for being productive. ``The
people here were all invited,'' Marquez told a New YorkTimes
reporter. ``It's for the protection of the foreigners here. We were
told to behave ourselves.'' Another fan, Roman Garcia, who didn't
get a ticket, denounced the government's decision, saying: ``I
always go to the stadium, even when there are only 50 to 100 people
in the stands. But I can't go because I don't have an invitation. I
feel tricked and disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question that will be of interest to a lot of young
people. Is the rock singer who goes by the name of Marilyn Manson
the same person who played Paul on ``The Wonder Years'' about a
decade ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: That rumor goes around from time to time, but shock-rocker
Manson (real name: Brian Warner) says it isn't true. He also denies
other frequently recurring rumors, including the one saying he was
a child actor on ``Mr. Belvedere,'' and another claiming that he
died of a drug overdose in Phoenix. The part of Paul Pfeiffer on
``Wonder'' was played by Josh Saviano, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Delta Air Lines changed its policies about boarding
priorities for passengers traveling with children? We used to be
able to board at the same time as first-class passengers, but on a
recent trip from Phoenix to Atlanta we were told that isn't the
policy now, and those of us with children were to board only when
our row was called. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the policy indeed has
changed. It's part of a procedure Delta has instituted to expedite
the boarding process ``in order to ensure on-time performance.''
All passengers _ and that includes children _ board from the rear
of the aircraft by row number when the gate agent makes the
announcement. The exception is people holding first-class tickets
and other priority passengers, who can board earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is fat-free cream cheese possible, when most if not all
of the fat in milk is in the cream?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the ingredients list on the packaging of these products
and you'll see words like nonfat milk, whey protein, cultured skim
milk solids, skim milk, xanthan gum, carrageenan (a gum) and so on,
said Judy A. Harrison of the department of foods and nutrition at
the University of Georgia. This is your clue as to how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfat milk is used instead of whole milk or cream in the
production process of such products as fat-free cream cheese and
fat-free half and half. Milk proteins and gums, many of which are
plant-derived, are added to the nonfat milk to give the resulting
product texture or body similar to the original food product,
Harrison added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can an Internet user get a list of e-mail addresses of
U.S. senators and U.S. representatives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the 540 members of the 106th Congress (including five
non-voting delegates), the latest information shows that 386 had

   Q: Whatever happened to the diplomat who claimed immunity after
a traffic accident in Washington a year or two ago in which a young
woman died? He had been drinking and was speeding, as I recall.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Gueorgui Makharadze, second-ranking member
at the embassy of the Republic of Georgia in Washington. The
accident, which killed Joviane Waltrick, 16, and injured four other
people, occurred in January 1997 when Makharadze's leased 1997 Ford
Taurus slammed into a line of cars waiting at a traffic light in
northwest Washington. Authorities said Makharadze was speeding
after a dinner during which he drank too much wine.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary step, the Republic of Georgia waived
Makharadze's diplomatic immunity so he could face criminal charges.
He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated
assault and was sentenced in December 1997 to seven to 21 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrick's family agreed last October to settle a lawsuit
against the Republic of Georgia and other defendants for ``well in
excess'' of $250,000 (the exact amount was not disclosed).
Waltrick's mother, Viviane Wagner, said she planned to use the
money to start a nonprofit foundation to educate the public about
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was reached, Tedo Japaridze, Georgia's
ambassador to the United States, wrote to Wagner expressing sadness
for what happened, and adding that he realized ``no compensation is
possible'' for the loss of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My family will be going on a skiing vacation north of
Vancouver, B.C., in December, driving into Canada from Seattle.
What are the entry requirements for U.S. citizens?
</P>
<P>
   A: No visa is required by Americans to visit Canada. Proof of
identity and citizenship (such as birth certificate or passport or
naturalization papers) is required, however, and passports or birth
certificates are preferred. Those bringing children must provide
the children's identification (i.e. birth certificate) and a letter
of permission from a parent or guardian if the child is traveling
with someone who does not have legal custody. It is recommended
that anyone traveling to Canada check with the nearest embassy or
consulate for more details. For online information, check this

</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about a flare-up in the former Soviet Union
mentioned two ethnic groups, the Ingush and the Ossetians. I'm not
faimilar with them. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ingushetia is a republic in southwestern Russia. The majority
of the population is Ingush, one of the many Muslim mountain
peoples in the Caucasus. Their history has long been related to the
Chechen mountain peoples, who also are Muslim and whose language is
closely related to Ingush. But after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet
Union, the Ingush and the Chechen dissolved the union that had been
imposed on them after the 1920s, and formed two separate republics,
Ingushetia and Chechnya. Encyclopedia Britannica describes the
Ingush society as one based on clan and tribal relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ossetians live in a region in Caucasia divided between the
North Ossetian Autonomous Republic of the Russian Federation and
the South Ossetian Autonomous Federation of the Georgian Republic.
Ethnically they're of mixed Iranian-Japhetic (Caucasian) origin,
Britannica reports. Their language belongs to the Iranian group of
the Indo-European family of languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that 30 companies are used to calculate the Dow
Jones industrial average, and they are changed from time to time.
What were the 30 companies making up the original Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there were only 12 companies when Charles Henry Dow
published his first industrial stock average on May 26, 1896. Those
1896 components: American Cotton Oil; American Sugar; American
Tobacco; Chicago Gas; Distilling &AMP; Cattle Feeding; General
Electric; Laclede Gas; National Lead; North American (utility);
Tennessee Coal &AMP; Iron; U.S. Leather, preferred; and U.S. Rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The number rose to 20 in 1916. The 30-stock average made its
debut in 1928 and the number has remained constant ever since, even
though the companies within the index occasionally have been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first average computed from the 1896 list, by the way, was
40.94.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that more than $4 million has been collected
in President Clinton's defense fund, and more is expected. Is he
required to pay taxes on this money?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one we could reach at IRS would comment on the record. All
we were told is that the subject of legal defense funds is not
addressed in the tax code, and ``it would be inappropriate to
discuss the tax situation of any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I cracked an egg for a recipe, it had two yolks. What
causes this, and is it rare? The recipe turned out fine, by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   A: A hen normally ovulates one yolk a day, but occasionally two
yolks may be released and, on very rare occasions, there may be
three, said Michael P. Lacy, poultry scientist at the University of
Georgia Extension Service. So a two-yolk egg can't be considered a
rare occurrence, even though it's not usual. Lacy explained that it
happens when two yolks are ovulated at the same time, or close to
the same time, and are picked up simultaneously by the hen's
oviduct. (Think human pregnancies that result in fraternal twins,
whose development process begins when the mother's ovaries release
two eggs at about the same time).
</P>
<P>
   Lacy said double-yolked eggs are more common in young hens
because their oviducts are highly active, and meat-type chickens
are more prone to laying them than egg-laying strains. Also, some
strains of chickens produce higher incidences of double-yolk eggs
than others, he added.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the Dew Line and North Warning
System. Can you tell me anything about a warning system called Pave
Paws, built in the 1970s to detect ICBMs from the U.S.S.R.?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're happy to, but it appears not to involve detection of
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to the
Dictionary of the Modern United States Military. Pave Paws _ whose
formal name is the Precision Acquisition of Vehicle Entry,
Phased-Array Warning System _ is an early-warning radar system
designed to detect sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The
military dictionary says its radars have a range of 3,450 miles and
are capable of counting re-entry vehicles as well as predicting
where they would impact.
</P>
<P>
   Since it can take 10 minutes or less for a SLBM to hit the
United States, depending on the point of launch, Pave Paws radars
are tied in to NORAD (North American Air Defense Command), the U.S.
Strategic Command and the National Military Command Center to
enable a quick military response if needed. The dictionary lists
these locations for Pave Paws radars: Robins Air Force Base in
Georgia (since installation, it has been mothballed); Otis Air
National Guard Base in Massachusetts; Goodfellow Air Force Base in
Texas; and Beale Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the lone member of Congress who did not vote to
support the U.S. effort in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the only dissenter on the
resolution to to express House support for U.S. troops engaged in
military operations against Yugoslavia. Her office explained that
the freshman congresswoman is ``deeply concerned about the safety
of our troops,'' but her vote was in objection to the language in
House Resolution 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its wording, today's resolution extended far beyond
expressing support for our troops,'' Lee said in her statement,
dated March 24. ``The first clause of today's resolution asks the
Congress to abdicate its responsibility for declarations of war
and, instead, embrace the notion that the president can authorize
the commitment of U.S. troops to war without congressional
approval. This is a notion which the Congress must reject for
constitutional reasons: It is completely impermissible for the
president to commit troops to war, a right given only to the
Congress by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action a day before the start of hostilities, 41
senators voted against a resolution supporting NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On current episodes of ``This Old House,'' Norm Abram is
walking around with his right arm in a sling. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: A publicist at WGBH-TV in Boston, the station that produces
the program, said Abram tore his rotator cuff in a water-skiing
accident. No further details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the 30 companies chosen that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dow Jones &AMP; Co. explains that the editors of The Wall Street
Journal select the components. They take a broad view of what
industrial means, too: In essence, it's almost any company that
isn't in the transportation business or isn't a utility, because
there also are Dow Jones averages for those kinds of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a new company for the DJIA, the editors are said to
look among substantial industrial companies with a history of
successful growth and wide interest among investors.
</P>
<P>
   The components aren't changed often. It isn't a ``hot stock''
index, after all, and the newspaper's editors believe that
stability of composition enhances the trust that many people have
in the averages. The most frequent reasons for changing a stock are
that something is happening to one of the components, such as being
acquired, or that another company may become more representative as
a market barometer, or that a different sector of the economy
should be represented. Whenever one stock is changed, the others
are reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Dow Jones industrial average stocks were
changed was in March 1997, when Woolworth, Westinghouse Electric,
Texaco and Bethlehem Steel were deleted, and Hewlett-Packard,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Traveler's Group and Wal-Mart were added. The
last changes before that came in 1991.

   Q: A short item in the newspaper reported that Cesar Chavez was
inducted into the U.S. Labor Department's Hall of Fame as its 22nd
member. Who are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the Labor Hall of Fame honorees, in addition to
Chavez: Mary Anderson, Cyrus S. Ching, John R. Commons, Eugene
Debs, David Dubinsky, Arthur Goldberg, Samuel Gompers, William
Green, Sidney Hillman, Mother Jones, Henry J. Kaiser, John L.
Lewis, George Meany, James P. Mitchell, David A. Morse, Philip
Murray, Frances Perkins, A. Philip Randolph, Walter Reuther, George
W. Taylor and Robert F. Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame posthumously recognizes Americans deemed to
have improved quality of life for U.S. workers by pushing for wage
increases, safer working conditions and more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Q&AMP;A has printed this information in the past, and I
saved it, but now I can't find it. How do I get a presidential
greeeting sent to my grandmother, who will be 80 soon? She's a big
fan of President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't printed it lately, so we're glad to oblige for you
and many other readers who have asked us to repeat it. In addition
to birthday greetings for Americans 80 or older, anniversary
greetings are sent to couples celebrating 50 or more years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Requests must be put in writing and sent by mail to White House,
Attn: Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or faxed to
202-395-1232.
</P>
<P>
   You should request a card at least six weeks prior to the
occasion. For recorded information, call 202-456-2724.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact the national headquarters of the Republican
Party in Washington? I want to express my support of the party's
new stance on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Republican National Committee, 310 First St. S.E.,
Washington, DC 20003. Or send an e-mail communication to the RNC at
this address: info(at)rnc.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you discuss the meaning and origin of the business terms
bull market, bear market and blue chip? I hear them often, but
without any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Bull market'' refers to a prolonged rise in the prices of
stocks, bonds or commodities. Bull markets usually last a few
months and are characterized by high trading volume. Various
theories are advanced about how the expression started, but the
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the most likely
one is that ``bull'' refers to a bull's habit of tossing its head
upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear market'' is a prolonged period of falling prices. A bear
market in stocks usually is brought on by the anticipation of
declining economic activity, and a bear market in bonds is caused
by rising interest rates. The most plausible origin, according to
the Morris Dictionary, is that ``bear'' comes from the old axiom
about ``selling the skin before you've caught the bear.'' A trader
who operates in this fashion once was known in England as a
``bearskin jobber.'' An alternate explanation involves an attacking
bear's habit of thrusting its paws upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue chip'' refers to the common stock of a nationally known
company that has a long record of profit growth and dividend
payment and a reputation for quality management, products and
services. Think IBM, GE and Du Pont, for example. Blue chip stocks
typically are relatively high priced and low yielding. The
expression was borrowed from gambling: The most valuable counters
in poker are the blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle something about my favorite country singer,
Clint Black? A co-worker said he's from New Jersey, but I could
swear he's a native Texan, like I am. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brace yourself. Black was born Feb. 4, 1962, in Long Branch,
N.J., according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.
But he grew up in Houston, the youngest of four brothers. And it
was in Houston where he started playing the harmonica at 13, and
shortly thereafter used songbooks to teach himself to play the
guitar. You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, there was a move to convert the United States
to the metric system. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It went into hibernation _ encouraged, but not put on the
front burner, and never officially canceled, either. The federal
Metric Conversion Act of the mid-1970s was supposed to make metric
the accepted system in the United States. Even well before that _
the Metric Act of 1866 _ the metric system was given the official
OK by the federal government. But it has never caught on, even
though Americans deal with 2-liter Coca-Cola bottles and liter wine
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conversion to metric in this country was never
mandated, and no deadline was set for voluntary compliance, most
people have stuck with the tried-and-true. It's confusing, that's
for sure. Consider a breakfast oatmeal container with this on its
label: ``42 oz.; 2 lbs. 10 oz.; 1.19 kg.'' The cereal's nutritional
values are calculated in grams, but cooking instructions use
standard American-style measure. Go figure.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ My first foray into Lenten
sacrifice had been dropping Mighty Mouse from my Saturday morning
cartoon lineup, but Satan proved too strong. I sat at the top of
the stairs and watched, as if God wouldn't notice my cheating if I
were far enough removed. The same thing happened two years later,
when I struggled in vain against temptation while my siblings
watched The Beatles cartoon. Lent taught us the lesson of God's
infinite forgiveness. There may be no mercy for those who whispered
during Mass or forgot their chapel veil, but there was grace for us
sinners who broke our Lenten vows. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ My Kevlar-reinforced leather

Speedway's grandstand straightaway. A peek at my vibrating

fuel had been worth it. A 157 mph, I felt like I was flying. Man,
oh man, was I wrong. This is a story of being humbled. (Nethaway,

<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A new law makes
it a misdemeanor in Brooklyn, Ohio to use a cellular phone while

step further by banning cell phones in restaurants, or by creating
cell phoning and no cell phoning sections in restaurants. (Kelso,

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _Prevention. Stopping
crime before it happens. Instructing all with criminal intentions
that gun violence in Florida will bring certain, dire consequences.
To that end, and asserting only altruistic motives, the Legislature
last Wednesday passed ``10-20-Life,'' a bill requiring
minimum-mandatory sentences for gun crimes. The Senate vote was
39-0; in the House, it was 106-11. Gov. Bush, who campaigned on a
promise to crack down on gun-toting criminals, said, ``Our
neighborhoods and cities will be safer with this legislation,'' and
he will sign it into law. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

cartoon lineup, but Satan proved too strong. I sat at the top of
the stairs and watched, as if God wouldn't notice my cheating if I
were far enough removed. The same thing happened two years later,
when I struggled in vain against temptation while my siblings
watched The Beatles cartoon. Lent taught us the lesson of God's
infinite forgiveness. There may be no mercy for those who whispered
during Mass or forgot their chapel veil, but there was grace for us
sinners who broke our Lenten vows. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)
MOVED.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ My Kevlar-reinforced leather
glove had the VFR 800's throttle pinned open on Texas World
Speedway's grandstand straightaway. A peek at my vibrating
speedometer was proof that the few modifications and special racing
fuel had been worth it. A 157 mph, I felt like I was flying. Man,
oh man, was I wrong. This is a story of being humbled. (Nethaway,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A new law makes
it a misdemeanor in Brooklyn, Ohio to use a cellular phone while
driving unless you have both hands on the wheel. I'd take that one
step further by banning cell phones in restaurants, or by creating
cell phoning and no cell phoning sections in restaurants. (Kelso,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _Prevention. Stopping
crime before it happens. Instructing all with criminal intentions
that gun violence in Florida will bring certain, dire consequences.
To that end, and asserting only altruistic motives, the Legislature
last Wednesday passed ``10-20-Life,'' a bill requiring
minimum-mandatory sentences for gun crimes. The Senate vote was
39-0; in the House, it was 106-11. Gov. Bush, who campaigned on a
promise to crack down on gun-toting criminals, said, ``Our
neighborhoods and cities will be safer with this legislation,'' and
he will sign it into law. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

Once in a Blue Moon dinner party. On Wednesday, the moon will rise
full for the second time in the month, a celestial event that
occurs, as they say _ for obscure reasons _ only once in a blue

There is nothing necessarily second rate about a meal put together
primarily from the pantry shelf. (Parham, Atlanta

these days, a guide that fits into a pocketbook could come in

   BLUENOTE-RECORDS _ Blue Note records, the prestigious mainstream
jazz label for which nearly every important innovator in the music
has recorded, marks its 60th anniversary by dispatching several of
its hottest young artists on a nationwide tour. Dubbed the ``New
Directions'' tour, it arrives April 1 in Atlanta at an unlikely
venue _ the East Atlanta rock 'n' roll bar, the Echo Lounge _
underwritten by Camel cigarettes and co-promoted with Esquire
magazine. The talent, which includes saxophonist Greg Osby (an
oldster at a mere 37), is top-notch, and is packaged in a
fashionable manner that emphasizes a certain kind of hip, black
male image. We'll chat with two of the players _ Osby and
vibraphonist Stefon Harris _ Blue Note's prez, Bruce Lundvall, and
industry observers to look at not only the music (crisp, acoustic
jazz with an analytic awareness of tradition) but what the music
represents, and where these ``new directions'' are actually
leading. Also: try to get a word out of Camel about its sponsorship
amid these anti-tobacco times, and puzzle over the ironies of that.

INTERNATIONAL VENTURE TO OFFER ONLINE PURCHASING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to move more business-to-business
purchasing transactions to the Internet, a pioneer in the field
plans to announce partnerships on Monday with two giant
international telecommunications carriers to create a global
trading network.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, a small software company in Walnut Creek, Calif.,
plans to announce partnership agreements with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone and British Telecommunications intended to enable
businesses to use the Internet to automate the purchasing process.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, which already has a relationship with MCI Worldcom
in the United States, has developed software systems that enable
companies to transform their purchasing interactions into real-time
trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems have long been envisioned by proponents of
so-called electronic data interchange, or EDI systems, which were
intended to replace purchase orders and bills of laden with online
digital documents. But the emergence of the Internet as a global
standard in the last five years has vastly accelerated the pace of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that this is the future,'' said Jay M.
Tenenbaum, chief scientist of Commerce One. ``After 20 years, about
100,000 companies are using EDI systems. But the fact is that more
than a million companies are on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much new Internet business-to-business commerce
activity is a computer-to-computer translation language known as
XML that is being rapidly adopted by many companies, from start-ups
to corporate giants like IBM and Microsoft. XML simplifies and
automates the process of business-to-business interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One executives say that the company's new partnerships
will sharply increase the efficiency of doing business
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``NTT is going to work with major players in Japan,'' said Mark
Hoffman, the chairman and chief executive of Commerce One. ``Now it
is possible to reach all of the big suppliers in Japan in one fell
swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Commerce One had built a leading position as
a result of its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce One has ended up being in the catbird seat,'' said
Stan Dolberg, an analyst at Forrester Research, a research and
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``They are well down the road
to figuring out that this is the killer application.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their agreements, both NTT and British Telecom will
deploy a Commerce One software program known as Marketsite. The
software is meant to automate the steps of selecting, ordering,
processing, shipping and paying for products.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One executives called theirs an ``open'' commerce
system, meaning that it is possible to participate either by
purchasing software from Commerce One or a rival, or by creating
the software independently, Tenenbaum said.

MAKER OF INEXPENSIVE COMPUTERS REPORTS A FLOOD OF ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Latman believes there is no such thing as a free lunch _
or a free PC.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is why he is selling the Webzter Jr. personal
computer for $299 (not including a monitor, which he will gladly
sell you for an additional $99).
</P>
<P>
   And at that price, Latman is getting orders for more machines
than his 49 employees can churn out.
</P>
<P>
   When his Seattle company, Microworkz Computer, announced two
weeks ago that it would sell inexpensive systems without ads or
gimmicks, his phone lines and World Wide Web site were quickly
jammed with inquiries and orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no free PC,'' he said. ``It's a fallacy in the mind of
Bill Gross.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the widely covered announcement by Gross'
FreePC.com, a start-up company that plans to give away computers to
people willing to have the PCs continuously display ads aimed
specifically at them. Becoming eligible to receive one of the Gross
PCs, though, involves filling out a personal questionnaire _ and
not everyone who registers will get a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I ask a million people for personal information so I can
use it to sell to them?'' Latman said. ``No. I don't believe in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Latman said he had already received orders for 50,000 of the
$299 machines, which he intends to start shipping on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the demand for the Webzter Jr., Latman plans to add 80
employees and another 60 contract workers to assemble the machines,
which use a Cyrix 300 MII chip and various off-brand components,
include a 3-gigabyte hard disk and 56 kilobit-per-second modem.
Microsoft Windows 98, the industry-standard operating system that
retails for about $100 and comes already loaded on most more
expensive personal computers, is not included with the Webzter Jr.,
which is promoted primarily as a Web-surfing device. (Windows 98
does come with the $99 CD-ROM drive that Microworkz offers as an
attachment to the Webzter Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   With a profit margin only about $36 per PC, it will take a lot
of sales to turn this into a successful business. But Latman, a
former bond trader at Merrill Lynch, insists that it can be done.
And that is not the only point, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profitability is great,'' he said. ``But the question is, how
do we put computers in the hands of all the children?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the affordability equation, he said, involves software.
So Microworkz is trying to strike deals with software publishers to
include free versions of their programs with these starter PCs, in
hopes of creating future paying customers. The Corel Corp., for
example, has agreed to offer its Word Perfect software as part of
the deal. And the Internet service provider Earthlink Network is
using the future-customer rationale to offer Microworkz users a
free year of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Latman insists that his company will work through its backlog,
so that everyone who has ordered a $299 PC so far will get one. By
the end of the year, he hopes to be able to meet demand in this
country and start marketing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the hot toy under the Christmas tree this
year,'' he said.

MARKET PLACE: FOR NEW YORK'S SILICON ALLEY, A TIME TO SHINE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of symbolic modesty _ or maybe impatience _
Candice Carpenter took the subway rather than a limousine back to
her office from the Wall Street headquarters of Goldman Sachs
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   She was returning after watching the stock of iVillage, the
Internet company she co-founded, open for trading the day after its
initial public offering, quadrupling its initial price of $24
before closing at $80.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that got me excited,'' Ms. Carpenter said of coming
back to iVillage's offices at 170 Fifth Ave., ``was walking the
halls and seeing the kids so delirious that their hard work had
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next few months there are likely to be a lot of
delirious executives and employees as more than a dozen of New
York's Internet companies try to go public. The Mining Co., for
example, another prominent member of the group, saw its stock more
than double after shares began trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings, of course, will create a windfall payoff for the
work put into these companies, with their young programmers and
producers holding options worth _ on paper _ tens of thousands, or
even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the company founders who really have the right to be
delirious. Ms. Carpenter and Scott Kurnit, chief executive of The
Mining Co., each now have paper wealth of more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Along with financial rewards, the successful public offerings
come as more than a little vindication for Silicon Alley, the
collection of entrepreneurs trying to make a go of Internet
businesses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They have had to fight harder for respect and for financing than
their Silicon Valley rivals on the other side of the continent. The
technology mainstream considered the New York companies too lavish
in their spending, too focused on content by writers and designers
_ and simply too far from Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all that. The success of iVillage's offering
indicates that there are no hard feelings now between Silicon Alley
and the great wired masses of Internet stock buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most New York Internet companies going public
are online extensions of the city's traditional industries. There
are media companies like iVillage, which provides women's services;
Mining, an Internet directory that relies on human guides, not
machines; and Star Media, an online service for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   There are offshoots of Wall Street, including Wit Capital, an
online investment bank, and Multex, which distributes
brokerage-firm research. The advertising business is represented by
Razorfish, an interactive agency, and Media Metrix, a company that
measures the audience size of World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in other New York industries, like publishing and
fashion, are spinning out online divisions. These include
Barnesandnoble.com from Barnes &AMP; Noble, the bookseller, and Iturf,
an offshoot of Delia's, a maker of clothing for teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has become the center of the Internet content
business,'' said Fred Wilson, a principal with Flatiron Partners, a
venture capital unit of Chase Manhattan. ``People said that all the
technology plays and all the infrastructure plays have been done.
Now it's time for what you can build on top of the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some companies going public here would be just as
natural in Silicon Valley, including Juno, an e-mail service
financed in part by News Corp., and Mapquest, which makes
electronic maps.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to base in New York was ``a real gamble,'' said Kevin
O'Connor, chief executive of Doubleclick, an online advertising
network that went public in February 1998 and has a value of $3.2
billion, the most of any Silicon Alley company. After starting his
business in Atlanta in 1996, he considered moving to California,
but chose New York because ``we're a tech company and a media
company, but mostly a media company.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, as technology stocks plummeted and investors
shunned public offerings, many Silicon Alley companies feared they
would never achieve their goals of going public. But the dark days
lasted only a few weeks, and two small New York Internet companies,
Earthweb and Theglobe.com, went public in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than validation for Silicon Alley, the herd of public
offerings could simply mean that investors are so addicted to
Internet stocks that they will buy anything, even something as
improbable as a technology company based in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the iVillage offering went forward, at twice the
projected price, mere days after the company's former chief
financial officer accused Ms. Carpenter of overly aggressive
accounting. IVillage says it stands by its financial reports, which
were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``IVillage is a lesson that the companies with the highest
profile in the media earn the highest valuations, even in the face
of accounting questions,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing director
of Broadview, a New Jersey investment bank. ``In the absence of any
rational metric with which to value a company, investors are
betting on the future, and that means image and brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are quick to caution that for any investor with a time
horizon longer than the life of a fruit fly, nearly all of these
companies are highly speculative. Even the biggest and most
established, like iVillage, are swimming in red ink with no clear
way to profits in sight. Some other companies are so small and
unproved that in earlier days they would have hardly qualified for
a bank loan, never mind a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Whether good for investors or not, the money flow benefits the
New York economy as some entrepreneurs apply profits from these
offerings to start new companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wealth is the next-generation seed capital that will be
reinvested in startups and will help strengthen the whole ecosystem
of new media in New York,'' said Brian Horey, a partner at
Lawrence, Smith &AMP; Horey, a venture capital firm, and a founder of
the New York New Media Association. ``Over the last 30 years, this
has turned Silicon Valley into an enormous economic flywheel.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of those at iVillage, though, the talk is less of
pushing that flywheel than of pumping money into the local economy
in different ways: buying an apartment, taking a vacation, paying
for a nice wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first meeting where we talked about the
options, and they told us they might be worth a thousand dollars
some day if the company grew,'' said Kate Hanley, a producer at
iVillage since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like, `Yeah, but we want a raise.' A lot of us had no
idea what an IPO was. Now, I've learned what a limit order is.''

INTERNET COMPANIES INTRODUCE A NEW MATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of companies, online and off, are blossoming because
of the Internet's fertile new soil for conducting commerce and
serving customers. But the blush may be rapidly fading from the
rose for many Internet-only businesses built on the increasingly
dubious strategy that whatever millions of dollars they lose today,
they will later ``make it up in volume.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``volume'' argument, which has become a mantra in the
Internet economy, comes in a couple of common varieties.
</P>
<P>
   A ``content'' company like the women's Web site iVillage, for
example, was able to raise $292 million in its first day on the
stock market last week, giving the company a market valuation of
$2.22 billion _ an astonishing figure, considering its widely
publicized financial problems and its underwhelming popularity
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet content companies, it did this by selling
investors on the notion that it would eventually generate high
enough traffic to the site that advertisers wanting to pitch goods
and services to the gold-mine women's market would someday support
iVillage's cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the volume concept for Internet retailers relies on a
two-step strategy: Their rock-bottom prices, often below cost, will
attract customers and revenue. Then, once they accumulate enough
volume in traffic and transactions to be considered competitors,
profit will eventually come from advertisers as well as from
various undisclosed financial arrangements with distributors and
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The volume model has always had its detractors, most of whom
have been painted as hopelessly parochial neo-Luddite party
poopers, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of industry watchers and executives have
begun to question how a volume-driven Internet can survive, let
alone grow, when its native businesses can bring themselves to
utter the ``P'' word only in the negative. ``No profit for the
foreseeable future'' is now a boilerplate disclaimer in the
prospectus of an Internet company preparing an initial stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially bewildering when most Web-based retailers seem
unconcerned that the Internet, with its ability to provide quick
and easy price and feature comparisons for products, is the perfect
profit-margin-killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Using the inscrutable mathematics with which many Internet
retailers conduct business, closing the sale is the important
thing, even if rock-bottom pricing means that they lose money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is a common practice for Internet-only companies
that sell computers and consumer electronics to have two price
lists _ one for customers who shop through price-comparison
services and another, significantly higher, set of prices for
customers who arrive from other precincts on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And these retailers often do not make good on the lower prices
they promise. An increasingly common tale is the one told by
Michael Tchao, a technology consultant who thought he bought an IBM
Think Pad computer _ twice _ by using one of the leading
price-comparison sites.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, the lowest-price retailers, as determined by
the comparison site, confirmed his order, then reneged, stating
that the computers were no longer available. To no avail, Tchao
reminded both that they were still advertising the computer exactly
as he had ordered it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will ship Tchao a computer at the price
advertised. Yet both are now in possession of every bit of personal
information, including his credit card number, that would be
required to make Tchao look like an actual customer in their
databases. This is valuable information for Internet businesses
that would have their companies valued on popularity rather than on
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The story nicely illustrates an idea articulated by Mark
Anderson, a technology consultant and publisher of the Strategic
News Service newsletter (www.tapsns.com), in a recent issue devoted
to the shaky strategy of volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of making it up on volume when you are losing on
every product line is a tried-and-true recipe for something other
than success,'' Anderson wrote. And most Internet companies, he
added, do not and apparently cannot erect the traditional barriers
to competition _ like trade secrets, proprietary technology and
extreme start-up costs _ that would someday allow them to corral
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the harder one looks, from weird stock valuations to
venture funding mania to basic business models,'' he wrote, ``the
more one begins to feel that from a financial perspective, there is
no `there' there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the acceptance of these wacky concepts is driven by the fact
that to date there is only one consistent method of making money on
the Internet _ the initial stock offering in which companies and
their investors sell the public on the possibility of future
growth, achieving valuations that are hundreds, sometimes thousands
of times any earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Then they sell the overpriced stock to day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is, unfortunately, the business that is making the most
sense so far,'' said Anderson, who calls the Internet stock game a
scam, and adding, ``Siphoning funds from losers' gas tanks is an
old game, but one which has never been played for such high stakes
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between this game and existing business practices
is stunning even to executives who are moving into the Internet
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who sell things know it is generally a good idea to
sell them for more than you pay for them,'' said Barry Diller,
chairman of the television and shopping concern USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet mogul-in-waiting, Diller is fighting to acquire the
search-engine company Lycos Inc., for a price that some investors
do not find very attractive in this era of sky-high valuations of
www.anything.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The margin of error is zero when speculation drives up stocks
to disconcerting levels,'' Diller said. ``Which reality do you pay
attention to? Stock? Or building a real business?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Anderson said, ``If the point is not simply to
bilk a bunch of losers, is there real, profitable business to be
done?''

BIG AND SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE BATTLE ONLINE  
 STARS ARE RIGHT FOR WEB-SITE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the first megabookstore rolled into the suburban
strip mall, small independent booksellers have cried foul, accusing
the chains of big-foot practices. Now the wailing can be heard in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The independents are rankled over advertising deals that
Internet search engines like Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Hotbot, which is
a unit of Wired Digital, and Alta Vista have forged with the two
biggest online bookstores _ Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com, a
joint venture of Barnes &AMP; Noble and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Under those deals, a user's Web search, almost regardless of the
topic, will yield a list of search results accompanied by a banner
ad for Amazon or Barnesandnoble.com _ whether a book on that topic
exists or not.
</P>
<P>
   Even more grating, the independents say, is that when someone
searches specifically for an independent bookseller by name, they
may still be served up an ad for Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com.
In some instances, the ads actually purport to carry a book about
the independent bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   Search on Lycos for Bookstreet, an independent bookseller in
Ukiah, Calif., for example, and you get a hot-link ad _ one that
requires just one click to move to the advertiser's Web site _ that
says ``Books about Bookstreet at Barnesandnoble.com.'' Likewise, a
Yahoo search for Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., brings up a hot
link to ``Books about Powell's Books at Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the approximately 3,000 independents that sell books
online contend that the practice is fraudulent: Often such books do
not exist. It is also anti-competitive, they contend, comparing it
to someone from Barnes &AMP; Noble walking into a small bookstore and
pasting up ads to lure customers away.
</P>
<P>
   John Conroy, vice president of Soda Creek Press, a small
publisher that operates the 1bookstreet.com Web site, said that
many of the independents have discussed the issue informally among
themselves, but had not decided on a course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble insists that nothing sinister is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banner technology does not discriminate,'' Ben Boyd, a Barnes
&AMP; Noble spokesman, said. His company's advertising deals with the
search services simply call for a banner ad to pop up, whatever the
topic entered into the search box. ``If you type in 1-2-3 the same
thing happens.'' (He's right. Such a search elicits this hot link:
``Books about 1-2-3 at Barnesandnoble.com.'')
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is parallel to complaints earlier this year by
Estee Lauder and Playboy Enterprises, which each filed lawsuits
against Excite on similar grounds. Estee Lauder is suing, for
example, because a search for ``Estee Lauder'' on Excite brings up
banner ads for an online retailer, the Fragrance Counter. In its
ads, the Fragrance Counter portrays itself as a reseller of Estee
Lauder products, which it is not.

   Stars Are Right for Web-Site Move
</P>
<P>
   The timing has nothing to do with April Fool's Day, but this
Thursday is a particularly propitious date for the Astrology Zone
Web site to make its debut on Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network
(www.astrologyzone.go.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter is conjunct the sun that day; this happens once a
year,'' said Susan Miller, the astrologer behind the site. ``That
day, it gives more power, brings more benefit. Jupiter expands what
it touches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrology Zone has developed a devoted following on Time
Warner Inc.'s Pathfinder Web site
(www.pathfinder.com/twep/astrology). But Ms. Miller had been
looking for a new home for her stargazing service since last year,
when Time Warner began shifting its Internet priorities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although executives at Go Network apparently chose the April 1
start-up date without recognizing its astrological significance,
Ms. Miller was negotiating with one eye on her charts. She was
emphatic, for instance, that both Time Warner and Go Network sign
the transition contracts before March 10, when Mercury went
retrograde _ a notoriously difficult planetary period.

 For release: Tues., March 30, or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Bob Dole needs a job.
 &HT;    The last few months haven't been pleasant ones, as parents and
grandparents have watched their children learn far more than any of
them needed to know about sex and our political leaders.
 &HT;    I had thought, or at least hoped, that this phase was over once
the impeachment hearings ended and wannabe-Speaker Bob Livingston
(R.-La.) dried his eyes and packed his bags for home. House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.) had fessed up about an
adulterous affair and Right-to-Lifer Rep. Bob Barr (R.-Ga.) had
been outed for having paid for an abortion.
 &HT;    But no, along came Bob Dole, of all people, looking straight at
me and my grandson in my living room and talking about erectile
dysfunction.
 &HT;    I have no doubt that this has been a problem for some men since
the time our ancestors lived in caves. But, considering the
extremely short life span of cavemen, I presume that it wasn't a
matter of major concern to the community at large.
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, to judge by Bob's television commercial for
Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and its much-hyped product Viagra, this
problem is not only a matter for concern to the individual
affected, but also an important issue for the rest of us.
 &HT;    As I understand it from Bob's comments, erectile dysfunction _
or, as he more casually refers to it once he's warmed to his topic,
``E.D.'' _ can be caused by many serious illnesses, as well as
depression and other emotional problems. These tragic conditions
call for a doctor's help, not pharmaceutical treatment of one of
their symptoms.
 &HT;    Bob also fails to mention that age frequently plays a part in
this condition. If it didn't, why would all of us marvel at Tony
Randall fathering two babies in his late 70s, and why would Larry
King bother to announce, when his wife became pregnant, that he
hadn't used Viagra?
 &HT;    And what about the end of the commercial? Bob begins the ad by
saying ``Courage _ something shared by countless Americans. Those
who risk their lives, those who've battled serious illness.'' He
picks up this theme at the end by urging us to ``get educated''
about E.D., and telling us that, ``It make take a little courage,
but I've always found that everything worthwhile does.''
 &HT;    Is he referring to his impressive war record and his courage
under fire? Is he _ or are the scriptwriters for the commercial _
subtly equating courage in battle and the courage it takes to get
information about impotence?
 &HT;    I would hope not. Because to do so would be to mock the tears my
aunt shed in 1942 when she found out that her 19-year-old son had
gone down with his ship in the Pacific. It would be to cheapen the
struggle my cousin Frank had when he returned home, leaving a leg
and his future on the fields at Normandy.
 &HT;    It would even be to cheapen the horrific injuries which cost a
young Bob Dole the use of one arm and years spent in rehabilitative
therapy.
 &HT;    And the former senator isn't the only one likely to be affected
by the ad. After all, his wife is now mounting her own candidacy
for the Republican presidential nomination in the election of 2000.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Dole should speak to her husband about this Viagra
business. She needs the support of the religious right to win the
Republican nomination, and her husband's public discussion of
private matters could be problematic in those circles.
 &HT;    There are also gender issues involved here, obviously. Can you
imagine if Tipper Gore or any other wife of a presidential
candidate were to do a commercial for birth-control pills or some
feminine-hygiene product? I guarantee you that the old double
standard would be at work, and people wouldn't be laughing.
 &HT;    Bob Dole has had his turn _ now it's Elizabeth's, and she'll
find it a lot easier if her husband isn't on television talking
about their sex life. If his Washington law firm isn't keeping him
busy enough, maybe she can recommend him to the Red Cross personnel
office.
 &HT;    At the very least, she should ask him to push Pfizer to air its
ads at night, instead of during the morning news programs. After
all, it seems to me that more people are thinking about this
problem when children are already in bed, rather than over the
family breakfast.
 &HT;    As for me, I'm just glad my grandson is only 4 years old and
didn't ask me what the two words meant!
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based

MICROSOFT'S SETTLEMENT TALKS HINGE ON PC MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They will not be at the table on Tuesday when the Justice
Department and state attorneys general are scheduled to meet with
Microsoft in Washington for settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States' personal computer makers _ and Microsoft
Corp.'s relationship with them _ will be the main topic of
discussion as the two sides warily approach each other to see if
there is some way to settle the antitrust suit against Microsoft,
according to lawyers close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get settlement talks started, Microsoft sent the
government a framework document of less than four full pages last
week. But if the negotiations are to move ahead, the lawyers said,
Microsoft is going to have to go far beyond that initial step.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, they say, must be willing to open up its pricing and
marketing contracts with the manufacturers in ways that
fundamentally alter its relationship with personal-computer makers.
The current relationship too often leaves the manufacturers, a
government official said, in the position of being ``captive
distributors for Microsoft software and the high-tech equivalent of
indentured servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is skeptical about how much power over PC makers
Microsoft is willing to concede. On the assumption that settlement
talks will fail, the Justice Department has recently been trying to
persuade industry executives to testify as rebuttal witnesses when
the trial resumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, officials have focused in
particular on urging Theodore Waitt, the chairman and co-founder of
Gateway Inc., to testify for the government, a lawyer close to the
case said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gateway declined to comment on whether Waitt
might testify.
</P>
<P>
   The framework document from Microsoft mentioned easing the
contract restrictions on computer makers, such as allowing them
greater freedom in presenting software products from Microsoft's
rivals on the first desktop screen that users see when they turn on
their machines.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has already eased some of those restrictions under
pressure from the government and the industry, leaving little that
was new in the document, according to lawyers who have seen the
Microsoft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft would not be expected to put a complete
offer on the table even before negotiations had begun. In broad
terms, Microsoft, according to people close to the company, has
told the government that overhauling its relationship with PC
makers would amount to a change in the competitive structure of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is far from the structural reform that has been
mentioned as the kind of legal remedy that might be sought by the
government if it wins the case. Structural options include measures
like breaking up Microsoft or forcing it to license the software
code for its industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In their public statements, the 19 states that have joined the
federal government's suit against Microsoft have been particularly
intent on seeking sweeping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But one state attorney general in the case observed that the
PC-maker-focused approach ``could be in the ball park for
addressing our concerns about restoring competition in the
industry.'' But he added that what Microsoft has proposed so far is
``barely in the stadium, way off in left field in the bleacher
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has held detailed discussions with PC makers
about steps to make them less beholden to Microsoft. As a result of
those consultations, the government, according to a lawyer close to
the case, has compiled a list of what it considers necessary steps.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he says, wants to see Microsoft publish the
prices it charges personal-computer makers for the Windows
operating system. Under this concept, the only variation allowed in
prices would be volume discounts for large purchasers, which are
standard practice in any industry. But the major producers like
Compaq, Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard would receive the same
price.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft could not do, under this proposal, would be to
offer a PC maker the incentive of an additional discount on the
Windows price if it also agreed to bundle in other Microsoft
products _ like its Office suite of productivity programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another focus of the government's concern, the lawyer close to
the case says, is in the confidential ``market development
agreements'' that Microsoft has with PC makers. The secret pacts
often include a couple of hundred items, according to one industry
executive, some of which are tied to Windows pricing. The items can
include discounts of 25 to 40 cents on the Windows price, the
executive said, for preferred presentation of Microsoft logos or
product icons on the company's machines.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers that ship millions of PCs a year, he noted,
those small incentives can add substantially to profit.
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants to make sure that Microsoft cannot
threaten to put a PC maker out of business by cutting off its
Windows license, a threat Microsoft made to Compaq in 1996, when
the company's consumer group wanted to replace Microsoft's Internet
Explorer Web browser with the browser produced by Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has replied that its browser is a part of its Windows
operating system, and thus Compaq was violating its Windows
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to concede as much as possible without
altering its fundamental business model,'' said David Yoffie, a
professor at Harvard Business School. ``The question is whether
that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal that extends beyond PC makers would be to force
Microsoft to publish its program code for the Windows operating
system but without requiring that the code be licensed to other
companies. Under this concept, the published code could not be
reused, resold or redistributed.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, it would not undercut Microsoft's profit from
Windows, but would give Microsoft's competitors in software
development the same access to the inner workings of Windows that
Microsoft's own programmers have, a lawyer close to the case said.

<P>
   The business mastermind behind one of the hot trends in
computing today is not Bill Gates or Michael Dell, and not some
Internet whiz kid from Silicon Valley or Seattle, but an anonymous
middle manager from Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has been the
driving force behind the phenomenal success of computer hunting
games, led by Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter. It was
Westmoreland who, by all accounts, prodded the software industry to
make hunting games and then promoted them heavily at Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' observed Robert Kotick, chairman of Activision
Inc., whose Head Games unit created two best-selling Cabela games.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting game phenomenon is a sure sign that personal
computing is moving to the masses. These digital diversions are
priced below $20, less than half the cost of classic personal
computer games like Doom, Quake or Starcraft.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting games are also an early wave of what industry
analysts call casual games, easier to play and more mundane in
appearance than the special-effects-on-a-screen adventures
preferred by what the industry considers hard-core gamers _ male
techies in the 16-to-35 age range. Computer Gaming World, the bible
of computer game purists, once criticized Deer Hunter as ``boring''
and ``repetitive'' with ``lame'' graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors games _ whose audience, though still mainly male,
is often older and less technophile than the market for devout
gamers _ took off last year, as personal computers priced below
$1,000 became commonplace and the proportion of American households
with computers rose to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 20 top-selling computer games last year were
low-cost hunting titles, according to PC Data, a research firm. And
so far this year, the latest versions of Deer Hunter and Cabela's
Big Game Hunter are high on the best-seller lists, and more sequels
are in the works. Even a spoof of hunting games, Deer Avenger, in
which deer stalk people, has recently entered the top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting games have prompted an elitist backlash, derided as
``red neck,'' ``Bubba'' or ``trailer park'' software. Yet others
see the hunting-game phenomenon as simply a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is a personal medium, and as it is more widely
available and affordable, its use will reflect the diversity of
society,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the
Future, a research group in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Bubba software is
one aspect of that diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, commercial success tends to breed respect, even
if grudgingly. At the start of this year, Jeff Green, a columnist
for Computer Gaming World, conceded that the industry first made
fun of Deer Hunter, then scrambled to copy it. ``You don't have to
admire the game itself,'' he wrote, ``but you got to love anything
that makes the entire gaming industry, press included, look
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Westmoreland, Wal-Mart's computer software buyer,
faced considerable skepticism a few years ago when he first
suggested the idea of inexpensive games for a mass market of
newcomers to personal computers. Kotick of Activision recalled a
meeting with Westmoreland in a Las Vegas hotel room during the
Comdex computer trade show in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Westmoreland's concept was sharply at odds with the
prevailing thinking and culture of the PC game business. The major
game companies regarded video games, running on the console
technology of Sony, Sega and Nintendo, as the mass-market channel.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers, by contrast, were viewed as the preferred
technology for hard-core gamers. PC games, with multimillion-dollar
production budgets and priced in the $40 to $50 range, strove for
Hollywood-style special effects best displayed on turbocharged,
cutting-edge PC's.
</P>
<P>
   So at that 1996 meeting, Kotick listened in disbelief to
Westmoreland's suggestion. ``He described his grand vision of
under-$20 software, and I looked at him as if he had three heads,''
Kotick recalled. ``I almost walked out of the room on him. But he
was absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   By last June, Kotick was ready to reverse field and plunge into
the market for low-cost PC games, as Activision purchased Head
Games Publishing of Minneapolis, producer of Cabela's Big Game
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   But Westmoreland had found a more receptive audience when he met
in Minneapolis with executives of the Wizardworks unit of GT
Interactive Software in April 1997. Seeing the large sporting goods
sections in Wal-Mart and the falling price of computers,
Westmoreland began to think that an inexpensive hunting game for
PC's could be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You make me a deer-hunting title, and I'll get
behind it,' '' recalled Paul Rinde, a senior vice president of
Wizardworks.
</P>
<P>
   Wizardworks, based in the Midwest, was perhaps less influenced
than game developers elsewhere by the industry penchant for
Hollywood-style productions and cutting-edge computing. Like most
software publishers, Wizardworks taps a network of contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Rinde visited Anthony Campiti, president of
Sunstorm Interactive Inc. in Indianapolis. Sunstorm was a
six-person software developer working on PC versions of simple
games like pool and darts, and when Rinde suggested a deer hunting
game, Campiti had his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked,'' Campiti recalled, ` ``How in the world can you make
a game about sitting in the woods for three hours, doing nothing?'
''
</P>
<P>
   But Wizardworks was offering Sunstorm a job it needed. So
Campiti, not a hunter, started researching the subject. He talked
to hunters, read hunting magazines and gained respect for the
sport. ``I learned there is a lot of skill involved in hunting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campiti ended up designing a simple hunting-simulation game in
which the virtual hunters can use decoy calls, cover their scent
and choose their weapons (rifle, shotgun or bow). It was called
Deer Hunter, and it proved a stunning success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, everyone is a genius,'' Westmoreland said. ``Did
the sales of Deer Hunter surprise me? Of course. But what did not
surprise me was that there was a big market for casual gaming
software, priced below $20, waiting to be tapped.''
</P>

   U,F,: - BC-COMPUTER-HUNTING-2NDT, -  &QL; 
 &UR; BC-COMPUTER-HUNTING-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: be tapped.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rinde agrees that the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing installed base of PCs and expanding demographics
have created the casual gaming market. The hunting games are just
the beginning,'' Rinde observed. ``This is PC game software for the
rest of us. People who don't care about being transported to the
year 3000 and battling aliens on the planet Zorak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The casual game market,'' Rinde added, ``is for people who
want to do much the same things on the computer _ hunt, fish, play
cards, whatever _ that they do in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The other lesson of the hunting game phenomenon is that as
software becomes more a mass-market product, the mass-market
retailers _ more than specialized computer stores _ may become the
vital channel of distribution. In short, Rinde said, ``Wal-Mart can
make a title, if they get behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bubba market is not without its ironists. Wal-Mart
shoppers have also helped make the satirical ``Deer Avenger'' game
a best seller. ``There's a good-sized crossover market of Wal-Mart
customers who do have a sense of humor,'' said Brian McCann, the
game's creator and a writer on the television show ``Late Night
With Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond mockery, McCann contends that his game is simply more
compelling to play, with its ``kill scenes'' in which a deer can
use everything from slingshots to bazookas to zap the virtual
humans. ``It's far more rewarding than watching a deer slump over
sadly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The business model in the casual game market is a world apart
from the glitzy, fantasy war-and-strategy games. Production
schedules tend to be four months instead of two years, and
production budgets generally range from $150,000 to $200,000
instead of $2 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost economics are opening the door in the PC game
market for the first time in years to tiny start-ups with bootstrap
financing. One such fledgling venture is Rise Software in Rogers,
Ark. Its assets so far are story boards for a few games and hopes
of success.
</P>
<P>
   Its founder and chief executive is a 32-year-old entrepreneur
who started puttering with PC's as a 12-year-old and who may have
some useful experience and acquaintances in the industry. His name:
Robert Westmoreland, whose last day at Wal-Mart will be this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going down the road myself, trying to capitalize on this
emerging market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not discuss his product ideas, except to say they would
not be hunting games.

 Net Gaming Ban Faces Long Odds  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative U.S. Senator Jon Kyl is rolling the dice again in
his personal crusade to rid the Internet of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican shuffled the deck last week, introducing
a watered-down version of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act _
which failed to pass the full Congress last year. Kyl is betting
the new version will establish a national law banning online
wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is addictive, accessible to minors, subject
to fraud and other criminal use,'' Kyl said in a statement. ``We
need to update the law to help it keep up with technology and close
the loopholes that have allowed this activity to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   He faces steep odds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new version eliminates a thorny provision that
would have punished virtual bettors with fines of up to $500 and
jail terms as long as three months, many in the online gambling
business question whether the legislation will dampen the
proliferation of virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion industry has mushroomed from a dozen companies
two years ago to about 200 today. Most of the virtual casinos are
based in exotic locales such as the Caribbean and Central America,
far from U.S. law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the California attorney general's office in
Sacramento acknowledged it would be difficult to pinpoint
individuals gambling online. Internet service providers, meanwhile,
are balking at being thrust into the position of enforcing the law
by blocking their customers from gaming sites.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gambling bill also faces opposition from the
influential horse racing industry; American Civil Liberties Union;
and the ISP Consortium, a Minneapolis organization that represents
300 Internet service providers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is regulation that protects the consumer _ not
outright prohibition,'' said Sue Schneider, chairwoman of the
Interactive Gaming Council, a Vancouver, British Columbia, group
promoting online gambling. ``Kyl's bill is malarkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its earlier incarnation, Kyl's latest bill would punish
individuals running gambling sites with prison terms of four years
and fines of up to $20,000. The ban does not apply to state
lotteries and off-track betting that employ computer systems
unavailable to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it exempts sites for popular sports ``rotisserie''
leagues, in which consumers pick professional athletes and bet on
their statistics. ``The bill is filled with holes; it's Swiss
cheese,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are designed to appease powerful lobbying groups,
but probably won't carry the bill through Congress, gambling
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is always a politicized issue,'' said Sebastian
Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Cummings Associates, a New
York gambling consulting firm. He said if Kyl's latest bill fails,
as many expect, other legislation will follow and a bill eventually
will pass. ``Lawmakers will eventually find a way,'' Sinclair said.
``This is just part of the process.''

   _CHECK THIS OUT: Starting today, Web-heads will be able to
choose from more than 2,000 books on the world's first virtual
library.
</P>
<P>
   NetLibrary (www.netlibrary.com) _ the first comprehensive
collection of electronic books, periodicals, journals, technical
papers and multimedia content _ can be downloaded for free via the
Internet. By the end of the year, 8,000 to 20,000 titles will be
available. NetLibrary plans to add another 10,000 books annually.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers McGraw-Hill, MIT Press and Cambridge University
Press; several universities; and library consortiums including the
Colorado Alliance, OhioLink, Palinet, the University of Texas
system and the University of Phoenix system have contributed to the
e-book endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing comparable to what we are offering,'' said
Tim Schiewe, netLibrary's president and CEO. ``Users will be able
to peruse thousands of books for free from just one site.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder, Colo., company does not foresee competition from
Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com, both of whom have established
winning formulas for selling new hard- and softcover books directly
to consumers. Both companies are branching into other markets, such
as CDs and videos, and have discussed forging business alliances
with NetLibrary, according to Schiewe.

   _OUR MOTTO: If New York is ``the city that never sleeps'' and
Atlanta is capital of the New South, then what do we christen
Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine (www.salonmagazine.com) pondered that question
and asked its readers to come up with a snappy slogan about the
valley of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their suggestions: ``I came, I saw, IPO'';
``Public or Perish''; ``Sleep is for the weak''; and ``If at first
you don't succeed, go for a second round.''
</P>
<P>
   All noble contenders, but none quite measured up to the winner:
``Quality is job one-point-one.''

   _AUTHOR, AUTHOR: The rags-to-riches-to-rags story of Apple
Computer has always had a Shakespearean appeal to business writers.
Few high-tech companies have elicited such dramatic prose,
microscopic analysis and detailed reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Two more entrants in the growing library of Apple books _
Michael Malone's definitive ``Infinite Loop'' and Owen Linzmayer's
no-frills ``Apple Confidential'' _ delve into the social and
political forces that turned a garage startup into an American
icon.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's 584-page tome, subtitled ``How Apple, the World's Most
Insanely Great Computer Company, Went Insane,'' offers
painstakingly Halberstam-esque insight into the minutiae behind the
Cupertino legend and what went wrong (hence the thick volume).
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who is host of a PBS interview program and editor of
Forbes ASAP, unearths dozens of nuggets.Among them: How Steve Jobs
on several occasions ``ripped off'' money and ideas from Steve
Wozniak, his best friend and Apple co-founder. When Woz found out,
he wept and kept Jobs at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Linzmayer gives readers a bird's eye view of the once
high-flying computer-maker. In 244 pages, the free-lance journalist
provides plenty of photos, charts, time lines and illustrations
dating to Apple's origin in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Insight is sparse, but Linzmayer's book is an excellent textbook
for Apple historians.

 NEXT RUNG Of TECH EVOLUTION  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A refrigerator that makes your grocery list. A microwave that
doubles as an Internet shopping and banking terminal. A wallet-size
card that keeps track of your daughter's homework. A TV that knows
what you like to watch and automatically records your favorite
shows.
</P>
<P>
   These technologies may sound like science fiction, but some are
available now, and many more are in the works in research labs in
Silicon Valley and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, companies such as Xerox, Hewlett-Packard,
Philips, Electrolux and NCR hope to introduce a host of smart
wireless devices that could make the PCs of today seem as clumsy as
a phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to a point where computing is invisible,'' said
Mark Bregmann, who heads a group at IBM dedicated to what the
company calls pervasive computing. ``We're talking about a post-PC
era where people will have access to information and services with
easy-to-use appliances anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects PCs to disappear. The idea is to make the
computers, or ``information appliances,'' in our lives ubiquitous,
as much in the background as electricity is today. The
microprocessors embedded in our cars, clocks and VCRs operate this
way _ we don't notice them until they don't work.
</P>
<P>
   The next step: making intelligent devices that can communicate
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your phone talked to your TV, the TV could turn down the
sound when you answered the phone. If your microwave talked to your
VCR, it could pause the tape when the popcorn's ready,'' said Mark
Weiser, chief technologist at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser, credited with inventing the concept of ``ubiquitous
computing,'' is part of a team that's transforming ordinary metal
staples into tiny communication devices. The smart staples could
keep track of where you put things and help you find lost
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea he's researching: electronic wallet-size cards that
could keep track of information such as your child's school
assignments or soccer practice schedule, the menu at your favorite
restaurant, movie times and ski conditions. Each card would have
one purpose, so you'd never have to search for information.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser sees the cards as part of a future of ``calm computing.''
It isn't the computer that's calm, though. It's you, because
everything is working to make your life easier.
</P>
<P>
   In this all-digital future, you might drive a car that can be
tuned remotely, find the nearest Chinese take-out using your
portable global positioning system, and live in a house where your
microwave provides nutritional tips based on your eating habits and
your alarm clock checks the traffic before waking you up.
</P>
<P>
   But as technology moves into this more personal terrain, some
worry about the privacy implications of creating a digital record
of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think for a second that companies aren't going to
exploit the information they have about you,'' said Larry Ponemon,
a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, cq who is an expert on privacy
and business ethics. ``With these conveniences, we're providing
lots of potentially important information about ourselves that
could be used to sell you things or change your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it essential that consumers have the option of
turning off data collection, but Ponemon urged that some sort of
third party keep an eye out to make sure businesses that collect
data stick to their promises.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if all these computers are really necessary and if
they will fulfill the promise of making life easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are very, very difficult to make work right,''
said Martin Reynolds, a research fellow at Dataquest in San Jose.
Reynolds uses the example of a device he rigged up in his home that
is supposed to turn things off if a room is empty. The problem is,
if people are sitting on the living-room couch not moving, it shuts
off the lights and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get mad at me,'' Reynolds said. ``There's a fine line
between technology for technology's sake and technology for
convenience's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the smart microwaves and alarm clocks may be years
away, less-ambitious devices are being rolled out this year.
</P>
<P>
   Philips Electronics will soon be selling a satellite TV receiver
that incorporates technology invented by TiVo, a Sunnyvale startup.
TiVo's Personal Television Service learns what kind of shows you
like to watch and automatically records them. TiVo (www.tivo.com)
will be offering a receiver and the service to consumers this
month. Replay Networks (www.replaytv.com) of Palo Alto will release
a similar digital VCR next month that allows you to create your own
``channels'' of your favorite shows. Both devices let you control
live TV broadcasts as if they were videotape; for example,
``pausing'' when the phone rings and then resuming watching.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently introduced a high-tech answer to
tearing pages out of magazines or clipping news articles _ a
handheld scanner. The CapShare lets you store information and
images by casually swiping the scanner over a page. You can then
send what you scanned via infrared to a printer, handheld notebook,
PC or personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   More exciting gadgets are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Screenfridge.  &LR; Down to your last egg? No problem. Just sweep
the carton over your refrigerator's bar-code reader and another
dozen will be on the way. Swedish appliance-maker Electrolux last
month unveiled what it is billing as the first Internet-connected
refrigerator. When you scan a item's bar code, the fridge creates a
digital shopping list to transmit to your grocer. The company plans
to introduce the appliance in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Microwave bank.  &LR; NCR is betting consumers will warm to the
idea of a microwave oven that can surf the Web. The Dayton, Ohio,
software-maker last year showed off a prototype of a microwave that
it says puts banking and shopping where consumers want them _ in
the kitchen. The oven also has a TV and a bar-code scanner for
making a digital shopping list. For now, it's still a work in
progress in NCR's lab.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Screen phone.  &LR; Wouldn't it be nice if you could get onto the
Internet without the hassle of booting up your PC, starting Windows
and dialing up your Internet service provider? The screen phone, a
telephone-like appliance that can sit on your kitchen counter, is
one of many devices that could provide one-button Internet access.
Cidco has been selling such a device for almost a year; Alcatel
will release one this summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Hot tub remote. &LR;  It's a cold, rainy day and you're on you way
home. You think about how nice the hot tub would feel about now.
You push a button on your cellular phone and it turns on the heat
and the bubbles and when you get home, you can just hop into the
tub. IBM is researching a system it internally calls LifeWorks,
where the appliances in your life could share information. Such a
system might make it possible for you to call up your phone
messages on your TV or turn up the thermostat at home from your
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this seems like Buck Rogers, but it's doable,'' said
Mitch Stein, senior manager of consumer systems and software at
IBM. What has to happen is that standards have to be set so devices
can share data, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks building a future of smart devices will be
so easy. Eli Zelkha, managing partner at Palo Alto Ventures, a
consulting and venture firm, said the key problem isn't the
technology _ it's making it work for people. He recalled how
researchers in Paris recently developed what they thought was a
superior vacuum cleaner. It had sensors to determine what kind of
floor it was on and would move differently according to each
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Then they asked French housewives to try the new machine. And
instead of liking the sensors, they were frustrated, because they
had their own ways learned over time and now habit, of pushing the
vacuum according to what type of floor they were cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``After awhile, they were ready to throw the vacuum against the
wall,'' Zelkha said. What has to happen, he said, is that machines
should adapt to people, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machines should be in the background as slaves, rather
than in the foreground as something we worship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving all this? One thing is the Internet. Consumers
want access to the information and services on the Net, and they
want it available when they're away from their PCs. At the same
time, computer chips are becoming so small and so cheap that it's
possible to put lots of them everywhere _ in clothes, cars,
appliances, even eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the idea of wearable computers has fascinated many
researchers, who've fashioned prototype after prototype of
enormous, geeky eyeglasses with a screen attached. Sometime soon,
wearable computers could become palatable to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is talking with an Italian eyewear-maker about
finding a way to make a good-looking pair of computing glasses.
Even if they're not high fashion, the glasses might be used by
surgeons, warehouse workers and others who may need to receive
information but keep their hands free.
</P>
<P>
   The computer giant, which is also working on badges that would
let you identify yourself to your computer without using a
password, sees such innovations as crucial to its ability to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try hard to differentiate yourself in commodity
businesses like PCs or laptops,'' said Fred Kitson, manager of
visual computing at HP Labs. ``People can easily use appliances
like toasters and mixers. The idea is to evolve computers in that
direction.''

Web twinkles with astrologers' readings 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows the best use of the Web isn't research, nor is it
finding out if it's going to rain tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The most important use of the Web is getting your horoscope.
Otherwise, why would there be so many different horoscope sites on
the Web? The good thing about that sort of astrological richness is
you are almost sure to find just what you want to hear from one
site or another.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our journey through the stars with a site for the
astrologer Sidney Omarr.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you'll find sites for Omarr scattered across the Web,
but one of the best places to find him is on The Washington Post
site at www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/columns/horoscope.htm.
This is a very straightforward site. No added features, no fancy
stuff like compatibility matching or horoscopes for the entire
year. Just the identical predictions you'll find in the morning
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If it's fancy and elaborate you want, then check out Jonathan
Cainer's site at www.bubble.com/WEBSTARS/. Cainer is a British
astrologer, and his predictions appear in the United Kingdom's
Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just his European nature, but Cainer seems more
entertaining and bolder in his predictions than most astrologers.
And his site does offer _ besides the standard daily horoscope _
extras such as year-ahead forecasts, weekly forecasts and a way to
check your horoscope for the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Astrology Net at serv2.astrology.net/ is more elaborate. There
are special romance and compatibility forecasts, general
information about astrology, live chats, a gift store (there are
plenty of commercial offers on this site), lists of famous people
who share your sign, monthly forecasts and the standard daily
forecasts (you can even specify whether you'd like the short
version or a longer one). The astrologer in residence here is Kelli
Fox, well known in astrology circles.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really into astrology, the sites mentioned might not
suit you. After all, you probably want something more precise.
While there are sites on the Web that offer that service, many of
them charge, so you may want to compute your own horoscope using
your place of birth and the time of day you were born.
</P>
<P>
   The next site called Astrodienst at
www.astro.ch/homepage/indexe.ht is primarily a pay site, but it
does have a nifty feature. You'll be able to find the latitude and
longitude (along with time zone information) for almost any city
you can name.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, even if you think flipping a coin is about as accurate
as astrology and a lot less weird, you still may want to bookmark
this site.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of school assignments and other grown-up chores require
time zone or geographical information.

AlphaSmart's a `cool,' lightweight word processor 
By Jennifer Hill  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever carried around a laptop computer knows even
the lightest machine becomes a heavyweight over time.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some concern that I began searching for portable
options for my son to use for writing at home and school.
</P>
<P>
   Although he seems comfortable carrying most of his current
valuable earthly possessions and a revolving library of six to
seven books in a load that probably weighs a little less than a
baby hippo, I was reluctant to add to his daily backpack load.
</P>
<P>
   While cruising Web sites about technology and learning, I kept
coming across references to the AlphaSmart keyboard. So I surfed on
over to the company's site at www.alphasmart
</P>
<P>
   .com/, where I discovered you can obtain a loaner keyboard for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The loaner came about four days after filling out the forms,
just in time for a trial run working with the initial outline of my
son's science fair project. And, for good measure, there also was a
poetry assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it? How does it work?'' greeted its emergence from the
box. Both boys, who were immediately intrigued, deftly and easily
handled the footlong keyboard. It really is amazingly light.
</P>
<P>
   Its trim size is due to the fact it is a word processor, not a
laptop computer. But what it does, it does well.
</P>
<P>
   The AlphaSmart has eight files. File 1, which automatically
opens when the unit is turned on, will hold 16 pages of
single-spaced text. (The screen is four lines long.) Files 2-5 are
eight pages long, 6 and 7 are six pages, and 8 is four pages. The
total storage capacity is 64 pages of single-spaced copy, or
128,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   With this arrangement, more than one family member can use the
AlphaSmart by working in different files, or one person can work on
several entries, or organize one long one.
</P>
<P>
   The shape and size of the keyboard make it easy to type on, but
I do wish it had a handle. I had visions of it flying out of the
crook of my son's sweatshirt-covered arm when bumped in the normal
jostling of life at school.
</P>
<P>
   And while a company spokesman assured me it could survive knocks
to the floor from a table or desk, she did draw the line for times
when the AlphaSmart meets concrete. And I wonder what effect the
ubiquitous woodchip dust at my children's school might have. (I
know for a fact this dust has the ability to creep inside tied
shoes, rendering once-white socks a permanent shade of greige.)
</P>
<P>
   Transferring a file from the AlphaSmart to your Mac or PC (it's
compatible with both) is simple. My 12-year-old was able to do it
unassisted the third time he used the machine.
</P>
<P>
   To transfer a file, you start your word processing software on
your desktop and open up a new file. Then you unplug the keyboard
cable from the keyboard and plug it in to the AlphaSmart. Press
``send'' on the AlphaSmart keyboard, and the file begins to
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the words appear on the screen of old Mac is what the
magic of technology is all about. As his Japanese-style poem about
Clyde, his frog, flowed onto the screen, my son uttered a soft but
sincere ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That softly uttered exclamation also signaled to my mom antenna
that if he had one, he would likely use it, even at school, because
it was, after all, cool.
</P>
<P>
   Three AAA batteries provide about 120 hours of use.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the AlphaSmart may be its price. At
$229-$249, it makes portability affordable for many would-be users.

Get your mouse and er, mop, it's time for spring-cleaning 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have no business writing a column about spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   If you had to pass a test to use a mop or a broom, they wouldn't
give me a license. I have Evelyn to thank for my generally clean
house. She shows up with mysterious cleaning apparatuses and keeps
things halfway decent.
</P>
<P>
   There is one kind of spring cleaning that I understand. Your
computer is just as likely to accumulate dirt and grime as your
house. But the gunk in your computer can do more than embarrass you
in front of friends. It can actually ruin that expensive box of
chips.
</P>
<P>
   So today, in honor of spring, we'll do some cleaning that could
save you money and will surely make your computer last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your mouse. It's easy to clean, and that may
give you the confidence to tackle some of the other chores. We'll
start our mouse surgery by turning the patient upside down. You'll
see a retaining ring of plastic around what looks like a rubber
ball. Remove the ring by following the instructions printed on the
plastic (usually that means turning the ring to the left, but it
varies from mouse to mouse). Now remove the small ball and wash it
with a mild soap solution, rinse it and dry it. Then look inside
the mouse. You'll see that the ball rests on small rollers _
usually three of them. Take a cotton swab, moisten it with rubbing
alcohol and clean the rollers. Let everything dry and reassemble
the mouse. If it is more than a few months old, you'll notice it
works much better now.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you are filled with confidence, let's do something some
of you have never tried before: Open the case to your computer.
It's really not all that bad. Since the way you open up the case
varies from computer to computer, you'll need the manual. Truth is,
even without the manual, you can probably figure out how to open it
just by looking. Make sure you unplug that sucker before you do
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the case off, look at the exhaust vent for the
small fan. Dust can clog the screen that protects the fan. If that
happens and air flow is restricted, the inside of your computer can
get as hot as an oven. The chips can easily fail if you leave them
half-baked. So cleaning the exhaust grille can save you money and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the top is open, also take a look at the circuit board
itself. Is it covered with dust? If so, then you may have a short
circuit just waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. The circuit board has tiny connections (called
traces) that run along the surface. The distance between these
traces is so small that even a particle of dust can bridge them.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Here's what. Some dust particles are actually pretty
good conductors of electricity. So the dust can bridge two traces
and cause a short circuit. Your computer will let you know about
that with an impressive smoke signal, and that kind of smoking is
definitely bad for its health.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to clean a dirty circuit board is to use a small
vacuum that's held well above any components so you don't bump into
them and ruin them. Another way _ not nearly as good _ is to use
one of those cans of compressed air that are sold in computer and
camera stores to blow the dust away. Evelyn could tell you why
that's not the best way _ you are just moving the dust from one
area to another.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing. I know some of you won't feel comfortable
opening up the case to your computer. That's fine. I don't feel
comfortable with a mop, so I hired an expert. You can do the same
thing and take your computer in to have the innards cleaned by an
expert.
</P>
<P>
   But, honest, this is easy. It ain't brain surgery. At worst,
it's mouse surgery.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Putting online buying to the test 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at Yahoo! Internet Life have a standing feature that
takes a look at whether electronic commerce (which is just a nice
way of saying ``buying things on the Web'') is really the wave of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The piece in the April issue discusses the question of whether
it is easier to buy something on the Internet or the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   The first comparison looks at bagel buying. The old way, in this
case, is heading to the neighborhood bagel store. Total time and
cost for 24 bagels and cream cheese: 24 minutes, $26.50.
</P>
<P>
   The new way involved searching for a bagel store online. A site
called bageloasis.com delivered overnight: cost $59, plus delivery.
Time: Eleven minutes to find a site and order, one day to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: The old way is better (assuming you live near a
bagel store).
</P>
<P>
   A more apt comparison looks at book buying. Amazon.com and
Barnes and Noble have received a lot of attention for the prices at
their retail book sites, but lesser-known sites such as
www.buybooks.com and www.spree.com have even cheaper prices. Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full,'' the book used in the comparison, sold
for $14.48 at BuyBooks. Traditional retailers, such as Crown Books,
offered the same book at $17.37.
</P>
<P>
   The piece concluded by saying that online sites, once you add
shipping costs, are more expensive than Crown's prices, but
shopping for books online takes very little time and no gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue also gives fanatics a chance to locate the grave
sites of the rich, famous or interesting. The site,
www.findagrave.com, lets you search by location, name or claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the listings include directions to the cemetery. For
some, including Duane Allman's, pictures of the grave site are
included.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps connect your business with money
</P>
<P>
   An online site for venture capital could become a one-stop
shopping site for companies looking for growth tips and growth
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Online, www
</P>
<P>
   .vcapital.com, is a Chicago- and San Francisco-based company
with a Web site that connects growing companies with money. Venture
capital is money invested in young companies. Investors in
early-stage companies get a larger stake. The companies, in turn,
get money that lets them develop product and hire employees. In
return for their money, early investors often take an active role
in the day-to-day running of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched in January by Len Batterson, a Chicago
venture capitalist and an original investor in America Online.
Batterson created the site to speed up the early stages of picking
and choosing. The site claims it can cut the early
information-gathering stages from an average of 20 weeks to four.
</P>
<P>
   The funds, while open to all companies, will focus on the
Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Southern California. Venture
Capital Online said those areas have the potential to blossom into
another Silicon Valley or Route 128 near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Online is a network of 26 venture capital firms
that manage more than $3 billion in assets, including Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, Apex Investment Partners, Tribune Ventures, Kline Hawkes and
Technology Funding.
</P>
<P>
   A feature called ``Venture Capital Clearinghouse'' screens the
entrepreneur's request for money, matching it with venture
capitalists based on their likes and dislikes, and provides a
summary of your business plan.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term plan is to turn the site into a kind of online
community of people running start-up companies and the people that
help fund them, including market research, educational information,
multimedia features and live chats.
</P>
<P>
   Until March 31, the site charges a $99 fee to refer a business
plan to venture a capitalist.

Yahoo! devotes issue to music, Net 
By Charles Hadaad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming an increasingly big part in both the
marketing and distribution of music. Read what rocker David Bowie
has to say about music and the Internet in the April issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life. Says Bowie of the Net, ``This is for real. It
will change everything that we know _ absolutely everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is just one element in Yahoo!'s April issue, which is
devoted to music and the Internet. Other articles include a look at
the war between the music industry and a group of upstarts trying
to set the standard for how music is distributed through the Net.
Many music publishers and distributors think the Net will forever
change the way you buy recordings, because it is fast and it also
does something marketers like _ encourages impulse buying.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Tonka cars, the favorite of many a kid, have gone digital. The
company now offers a computer CD version of its cars. In ``Tonka
Garage,'' kids can build their own cars and crash them. You can
also convert images of cars to trading cards, decals and other
things that can be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   A companion game, ``Tonka Raceway,'' lets you create racetracks
and then race the cars you've created. Or you can pick cars and
trucks to race from a list of 30 already created for the game.
Published by Hasbro Interactive, these games are available only for
PCs running Windows 95 or a higher version of the operating system.

PC Camera refuses to take a trip on Serial Bus 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is an account of a well-meaning attempt to review a $100
computer gadget. It turned into a saga we'll call ``Oklahoma Warner
and the Bus of Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philips USB PC Camera is one of those little egg-shaped
devices that sits on the desktop and transmits moving pictures to
your computer. The interesting thing is it uses the Universal
Serial Bus, or USB, connection, an appendage with which all
up-to-date computers are equipped. Having never used my USB, it
seemed a good thing on which to report.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the first mistake. First times never work
for me.
</P>
<P>
   The documentation, actually, provided a fair omen. It consists
of a printed manual with setup instructions in six languages and a
separate yellow card with a big red STOP sign that says to ignore
the manual and do it this way instead.
</P>
<P>
   It took both sides of this 4x8-inch card to go through the 31
steps for installing the camera and its software. It is very hard
to do 31 consecutive things right. I found the best procedure was
to accomplish the first 15, then take a nice long nap before
assaying the final 16.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the little devices showed up in the right places in
the Device Manager, and it came time to set up the software for the
camera. The software, of course, said the camera wasn't correctly
attached and wasn't responding.
</P>
<P>
   Rebooting seemed like a wise thing to do, but it wasn't. The
computer wouldn't reboot. It would get a little way along the route
to daylight and then quit. Worst of all, when it reached that
point, it would not allow itself to be turned off. Pushing the
on-off button had no effect at all; it had to be unplugged. Upon
detaching the camera, the problem went away.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the bottom of the yellow card, below the 31st step, it
says if the computer won't start when the camera is connected, ``It
is very likely that your BIOS is not compatible with the USB
standard.'' Why my BIOS would have a USB and not be compatible with
its standard is one of those imponderables like the meaning of life
or income tax codes.
</P>
<P>
   So I called tech support at Gateway. This is an operation in
constant flux; it never works the same way for more than a month at
a time. After pressing numerous buttons, a recording basically told
me everyone was busy and I should go away and quit bothering them.
It shunted me into something called Automated Tech Support, where a
recorded voice said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are running Windows 95 on your desktop computer, press
1. If you are running a laptop computer, press 2. If you are
running a Destination computer, press 3.'' I'm doing none of the
above. I'm running Windows 98. A patient man would no doubt have
tried No. 1, but I decided to take another nap.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arising, I went to Gateway's site on the Web and found the
BIOS updates which are, allegedly, the right ones for my computer.
There are two of them. Why two? I only need one. Which one? Ah,
wouldn't life be dull without these little mysteries? I downloaded
both, and opened up one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for upgrading the BIOS don't run to 31 steps,
but they involve changing jumpers back and forth on the motherboard
and warn you if you do this wrong, you will have performed a
frontal lobotomy on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, standing here in the cave, I have to grab the
idol off the pedestal and replace it with another so swiftly that
the secret mechanism won't drop the ceiling on me. The howls of
outraged natives echo from the mouth of the cave.
</P>
<P>
   I'd better have another nap.

Popular iMac serves as bait for game developers 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bait is an iridescent gumdrop of computer. The prey? Game
developers, many of whom stopped publishing for the Mac years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is hoping its popular new iMac computer will lure
developers back to the Mac platform.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether developers are taking the bait,
but Apple Computer should get an A for effort. The company is
pulling out the stops to win over game developers, seeing them as
key to an effort to win a greater share of the home market.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers are expressing renewed interest in the Mac.
What's caught their fancy is twofold. The iMac has been a
commercial success, the best-selling single computer, and it was
designed for games.
</P>
<P>
   iMacs include technologies that developers like. For example,
there's a strong, if not state of the art, graphics accelerator.
This technology enables graphically detailed games to run faster.
</P>
<P>
   These computers also use a new standard for peripherals called
Universal Serial Bus, which is favored by many developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Matthew Manuel, a senior Disney Interactive
programmer, recently told MacWeek magazine. ``The iMacs are sort of
like game consoles. They're much easier to optimize for games.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's campaign to win over game developers involves
more than just new technology. The company is going out of its way
to schmooze them.
</P>
<P>
   The company turned out in force at the recent Game Developers
Conference in San Jose, Calif. It had a large booth featuring iMacs
and its new blue-and-white iridescent G3 computers.
</P>
<P>
   Running on these computers were some of the top games, including
``Myst II'' and ``Quake II.'' It was an impressive display that
attracted a crowd of developers all day long.
</P>
<P>
   And, to sweeten the pot, Apple Computer gave every developer
attending the conference a free package of software development
tools for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Apple Computer's effort is not overwhelming so
far, but it is beginning to win back some important developers that
were on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis, for example, was uncertain about whether it was going to
publish a Mac version of its latest version of ``SimCity'' a year
ago. Now, a Mac version has been announced.

 Looking for Mr. Goodbar? Try the Internet  
 By Deborah Solomon   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the rapid pace of area code changes across the country,
keeping track of friends and relatives is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some phone companies, realizing that they can capitalize on
people's desire to stay in touch, have started offering national
directory assistance for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about 95 cents per call, consumers can get one or
two phone listings for any city in the country, without having to
know the area code.
</P>
<P>
   But if paying a buck to find your Uncle Phil seems too steep,
there is a cheaper way _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of search engines have cropped up on the Web, offering
people a free way to find old college flames, long-lost friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But not all directory-assistance sites are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Some have a limited database and can be more frustrating than
fruitful. Others can give you listings for a person's 10 last-known
addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Two sites that stand out from the rest are 555-1212.com and
InfoSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Both are free and offer thorough white and yellow pages,
international directories and country codes.
</P>
<P>
   At 555-1212.com, users can look up area codes for any city in
the country. The site keeps up with new area codes and also offers
maps of the region a user is looking up.
</P>
<P>
   InfoSpace.com and 555-1212 also do reverse lookups, meaning that
if you only have a phone number, you can plug it in and find the
name and address to match. InfoSpace goes one step further,
offering ``celebrity searches.'' However, searches for David
Duchovny and Francis Ford Coppola produced no matches.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to do a more thorough search on a person can tap
into InfoSpace's public records database. The site charges for the
information but provides users with bankruptcy records, liens,
lawsuits and credit information.
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines also offer their own directory assistance.
Both Excite and Yahoo have people searches, but the databases did
not produce results as thorough as some other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But these sites also offer to look up the e-mail address of the
person for whom you're searching, a handy tool to have.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting for businesses on the Web also is easier than trying to
figure out where they are based or find the right Yellow Pages for
the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At BigYellow.com, users can plug in a company's name and get a
listing of the corporation's business units. And rather than
getting a generic main number, clicking on the link brings up the
full name, phone number and address of that particular sector.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sites are helpful and, if nothing else, offer a good
starting point for finding phone numbers. However, with the
availability of information on the Internet, there may no longer be
an excuse for not calling Uncle Phil.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Americans become increasingly comfortable shopping online,
it's a pitch many succumb to: Buy an Elmo toy or a Stephen King
novel through our Web sites, and part of the purchase price will go
to the charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already like to shop online,'' said Sissy Brunk, who
patronizes one of the half-dozen sites making this pitch. ``It
makes you feel good that while you are shopping, a little bit goes
to a worthy cause.'' By stopping at www.igive.com, she is convinced
she is helping a children's charity she admires.
</P>
<P>
   Like credit cards that promise to give a sliver of whatever
amount is charged to a favorite cause, these Web sites appeal to
Americans' charitable side. They claim to have raised hundreds of
thousands of dollars for groups ranging from the Humane Society to
Hands on San Francisco, a volunteer group.
</P>
<P>
   But once you buy Elmo online, what happens to the few dollars
you thought was speeding its way to a good cause? While many
charities are getting checks directly from these sites, it is
impossible to know in every case. It may not end up in the
charity's hands as fast as you imagined _ if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Amounts may fall below some trigger point the retailer or Web
site has set before it will send a check. Money may not be credited
to the charity because of computer glitches. Or shoppers may fail
to follow somewhat burdensome instructions. IGive even carries a
disclaimer, deep in the electronic fine print, that it may be
impossible to guarantee that the charity gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks illustrate some pitfalls:
</P>
<P>
   _ IGive prides itself on letting shoppers name any cause they
fancy, and since the site was born in November 1997, they've
identified more than 4,300 of them. But in interviews, the site's
founder said not even half met the $10 threshold required by IGive
that a charity needs to raise through shoppers' purchases before
the site will cut a check. And IGive has not verified half of those
that qualify. The upshot: fewer than a quarter have been paid or
can expect a check soon. IGive, which said that it has written
checks for $200,000 of the $300,000 earmarked for charity, said
that it will do its best to make sure every charity gets its money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another site, www.charityweb.com, divides any money that has
been pledged to 20 causes that ostensibly have ``peace, life and
love'' in common unless shoppers e-mail other instructions. Those
20 include a Stanford University day-care center, where the site's
founders, a 1996 Stanford MBA and his wife, send one of their
children. The day-care center is one of only two causes that have
received money, only a couple of hundred dollars, so far. The
founder, Kurt Hansen, said that he included the center because he
is on its board but that the site is largely composed of causes he
has no connection with.
</P>
<P>
   _ One site that was full of promise only weeks ago,
www.charitymall.com, has temporarily shut down. Another,
www.socialgoods.com, has been absorbed by a rival,
www.4charity.com. These disruptions raise questions as to what will
happen to money already pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Some charities choose not to participate and object to how their
names are sometimes being used. American Red Cross, for instance,
agreed last year to conduct pilot programs with three new Web sites
that seemed to have financial backing and reputable managers:
Shop2Give.com, 4charity.com and Toysrweb.com. Recently, it bowed
out of the pilot program after it failed to generate the desired
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   And until contacted by a reporter, the Red Cross was unaware
that it was also listed on two other sites, igive.com and
MyCause.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dilutes the brand, and it can be very confusing,'' said
Bill Blaul, a Red Cross spokesman. He said the group will probably
ask the Web sites to desist, a request that might not be honored
given the experience of at least one charity that tried to wriggle
off the lists.
</P>
<P>
   To the entrepreneurs behind the Web sites, these hiccups are
just growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   These sites, serving as a middleman between the retailer and the
charity, promise a stream of revenue to charities. Typically, the
money the sites say will go to charity comes from commissions they
earn from online retailers like Amazon.com and J. Crew in exchange
for referring customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites keep part of the commission, but those that send
it all to charity can still make money by selling advertising and
product placement, finding corporate sponsors or hawking
information about shoppers' habits to market researchers. Many
sites promise not to reveal personal information without
permission, though it is too early to know whether they keep their
word.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet holds huge potential for charities. Nonprofits can
use it to reach donors as never before, e-mailing them about
initiatives, creating forums where donors can meet, and inviting
donations at a fraction of the cost of mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, for example, lets visitors to its site
learn about relief efforts and make online donations. It was also
one of the first to post most of its tax return on the Web _ all
but top executives' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of these shopping sites say they, too, are helping
reinvent charity. ``We have become part of the fabric of a large
number of nonprofits,'' said Robert Grosshandler, who founded IGive
in Evanston, Ill., after selling his software company. IGive, 18
months old, appears to be the oldest site, and perhaps the largest,
claiming 43,000 registered shoppers doing what it calls
``Technogiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites' popularity is growing as charities tell donors to
check them out, as shoppers tell other shoppers about them and as
people surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great medium for this kind of giving,'' said
Fiona Swerdlow, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a research
firm in New York. ``It should be something that appeals to a lot of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention charities. ``This kind of thing helps a lot,''
said Lenna Silberman Scott, a spokeswoman for Families of Spinal
Muscular Atrophy in Libertyville, Ill., which said the $600 it has
received out of the $1,300 it has been promised from IGive will
help fund research and provide wheelchairs and other medical
equipment to families in need.
</P>
<P>
   The shop-for-a-cause sites are quick to promote this lofty role.
But the half-dozen or so that have opened in recent months are all
very much for-profit businesses, although two that send all of the
commissions to charity say they are seeking nonprofit status. Some
were created by successful entrepreneurs, some by freshly minted
business school graduates. They tend to be mom-and-pop operations
with little venture capital or corporate backing. And as private
businesses, they divulge almost nothing about how well they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences,'' said William P. Massey,
president of the National Charities Information Bureau, a watchdog
in New York that says shoppers can easily stumble unless they
understand how each site works.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from clear what rules, if any, apply. The Web sites,
technically affiliates of the retailers, which play no significant
role in their charitable activities, do not consider themselves
traditional fundraisers or solicitors, governed by state laws. Only
a few have registered with state regulators. And none appear to be
posting bonds or creating other backstops to insure that money
pledged doesn't get diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Two already appear to be having difficulty. One,
www.charitymall.com, has temporarily gone dark. Run by two brothers
from New York, both electricians, the site hopes to convert itself
to nonprofit status to make itself more attractive to sponsors.
This was the one site whose retailers had agreed to pay charities
directly, so the money raised so far isn't at risk, one brother
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another, www.socialgoods.com, created by two 1998 Harvard MBA's,
had considered closing down at the end of the month but has been
absorbed by www.4charity.com., a rival started by a 1998 Stanford
MBA. Socialgoods.com's founder, William Morrison, said causes will
get any money they were promised.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of such sites represents ``the beginning of the
problem,'' said Michael DeLucia, director of charitable trusts for
New Hampshire and president of the National Association of State
Charity Officials. ``It is a perfect opportunity for a classic
telemarketing charity scam.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are consumers to do? With hundreds of thousands of
charities _ many with similar-sounding names _ pleading for help
the old-fashioned way in mass mailings and cold calls, giving money
away is already tougher than it should be. Confusion over how
electronic transactions work, how much actually goes to charity,
and who, if anyone, might claim a tax deduction, is not helping.
Even the simplest question _ which site delivers the most to
charity _ is not obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Buying an item from most sites yields only half as much for a
worthy cause as purchasing the same item through 4Charity.com,
which funnels all money it receives from retailers to the
charities. 4Charity, which is seeking nonprofit status, can do this
because it relies heavily on volunteers and plans to pay its bills
by selling information about collective shopping habits to
companies, according to Scott Dunlap, its founder. But consumers
would be hard-pressed to figure this out without hours of research.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, sites like Shop2Give.com and MyCause.com, which
offer shoppers hundreds of thousands of charities to choose from,
raise some of the thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   Information may be dated or wrong, since the Web site can't
reach out to every charity. The sheer number of choices also makes
it harder for any one charity to meet a site's minimum threshold.
And consumers may have trouble picking and choosing, given what's
presented. Interested in finding a worthy cancer cause? IGive
provides 35 choices, ranging from three chapters of the American
Cancer Society in Texas, to Cancer Care of Ridgewood, N.J., to
Cancer Caring Center in Pittsburgh, to the Cancer Curing Society in
Bonita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thus some consumer advocates say Web sites with fewer choices
might have more appeal. 4charity.com goes to great lengths to
enlist the support of the 25 charities it highlights, while
Greatergood has signed contracts with all 14 of its charities. So
while consumers may not get as much latitude, there is some
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 4,000 causes to keep tabs on, Grosshandler of
IGive said he counts on shoppers to inspect his work. The site
provides each shopper with a detailed accounting of how much the
causes selected by that shopper have ``earned.'' The shopper is
then free to contact the charity to make sure a check was sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a million auditors,'' said Grosshandler. But
whether charities can or want to handle inquiries concerning
trivial sums is another matter. ``The site is abrogating its
responsibility,'' in expecting consumers to question the charities,
said Blaul of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites also leave the impression that the process is as
quick as a mouse click. Greatergood.com, for instance, asserts,
``At least 5 percent of whatever you spend will go to the
not-for-profit you choose, automatically. It's that easy!''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were. Most retailers make the sites generate a
certain amount in referral commissions. J. Crew, for example,
typically requires a site to earn $250 in commissions before it
writes a check. Thus, a site entitled to a 5 percent commission
would have to generate $5,000 in sales _ perhaps 150 polo shirts _
before it could expect payment.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Because the sites often set their own minimums,
starting at $10, any one charity has to inspire shoppers to buy the
equivalent of six or seven polo shirts _ or even a dozen _ before
it sees a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on San Francisco, for example, has been told it is
entitled to more than $100 through 4Charity but must be patient;
the site makes payments only four times a year. The group is also
waiting for a check from IGive, a delay chalked up to a clerical
error.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking individual donations is not always easy. During the
holidays, one retailer, Cyberian Outpost, had computer problems and
for several weeks lost information about which commissions were
owed. While the retailer said it paid the sites what it estimated
it owed them, sites like Shop2Give and 4Charity had no way of
knowing how much they owed various causes unless shoppers contacted
them to reconstruct their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites also require shoppers to take multiple steps to
ensure that their cause gets credit. IGive requires an electronic
proof of purchase via e-mail, but 10 percent of members never send
it. ``We consider that 10 percent a failure,'' said Grosshandler,
adding that the unaccounted funds still go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use our best efforts to make sure that your worthy
cause gets the appropriate credit,'' the site's fine print warns,
``but in some instances the information provided to us by the
merchant may make that impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites dance around facts consumers might want to know,
particularly those that might remind shoppers that the sites have
mercenary motives and might dip into any money they receive from
retailers to pay their own bills.
</P>
<P>
   MyCause.com leaves visitors with the impression that it is
``sustained by an additional commission paid by our affiliate
retailers,'' implying that its fees are not coming at the
charities' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Shop2Give, for its part, implied that retailers call all the
shots. The site allows the retailer ``to decide the amount to be
donated,'' it told shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some big merchants like J. Crew say they did weigh in, but in at
least one case involving a major retailer, Shop2Give had more
influence than that. ``We would have no voice in what an affiliate
partner does with the revenue stream,'' said Ben Boyd, a spokesman
for Barnesandnoble.com, one retailer on Shop2Give's site. The site
is ``mischaracterizing our commission as a pledged donation.''
</P>
<P>
   After being made aware of the conflicting accounts, Shop2Give
said it was changing its language. ``Shop2Give then determines how
much of this total commission will go to a nonprofit
organization,'' the site now tells shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also be forgiven for thinking they are eligible
for a tax deduction. They're not. Yet, only two sites, MyCause and
Shop2Give, make that clear. And Shop2Give even tells shoppers not
to lose hope _ it is ``actively working on finding a solution that
can accommodate tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see how. Whatever money goes to charity is the
result of the site diverting some, or all, of what it gets from the
retailer. Most telling: Even the Web sites typically consider the
money they remit to charity a marketing expense, not a charitable
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear of state regulators and charity watchdogs is
that many sites are accountable to no one. Only a few, Greatergood,
Shop2Give and 4Charity, say they have registered under state law to
do cause-related marketing. Other sites like IGive and MyCause say
they do not fall under existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   State laws also come into play when sites raise money without
the charities' cooperation. When the American Camping Association,
for example, found itself on MyCause.com, it requested information
about the site's activities, to no avail. Though the group has not
asked to have its name removed, ``we feel very removed from it,''
said Bob Shultz, the director of development.
</P>
<P>
   Another educational charity, which requested anonymity, has
sought to remove itself from IGive, only to be told it has no say
in the matter. IGive members decide which causes to include.
</P>
<P>
   Use of a charity's name without its approval may violate laws in
many states. In Pennsylvania, no one can solicit on behalf of a
charity without its consent, said Karl Emerson, director of the
Pennsylvania bureau of charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For every bona fide charity that ends up participating over its
objections, regulators also worry that imposters could seek out
listings and bombard shoppers with e-mail, imploring them to make
them the beneficiary. ``There is the distinct possibility that a
questionable charity will appear on one or more of these sites,''
said Massey of the National Charities Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   While Greatergood.com requires charities to be on the list the
Internal Revenue Service keeps of nonprofits that qualify for
tax-deductible gifts, it is one of the more stringent. Other sites
say they make case-by-case determinations, while IGive merely
requires causes to affirm they are nonprofits and engage in good
works, one reason it lists many lesser-known causes.
</P>
<P>
   Some like the Broken Nose Fund in Portland, Me., have neither
applied to the IRS for permission to accept tax-deductible
donations nor registered with charity regulators in their home
states. ``I am not registered because I am trying to make money for
myself, because I need surgery,'' said Ashley Lenartson, who is
looking to raise $15,000 to fix his own nose for the third time.
While he believes his is a legitimate cause, the only way consumers
could conceivably learn more about it would be to write to an
address he supplies IGive and wait.
</P>
<P>
   IGive's Grosshandler acknowledges that some groups on its site
are not bona fide charities and says the site's job is not to play
Big Brother. He suggested that it's possible that someone may have
registered a cause close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's their favorite worthy cause, it's great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the dilemma. If these Web sites survive, they will
come to resemble electronic shopping malls with as much to show for
themselves as the credit card companies that pioneered the
help-a-favorite-cause pitch. Nearly 6 percent of the $596 billion
in Visa and MasterCard volume last year went to cards that diverted
a fraction of purchases to worthy causes, according to the Nilson
Report, an industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But there are key differences. Credit card issuers are often
well-established companies that have earned consumers' trust. They
enter contracts with every charity they represent. And while
Internet companies often fall between regulatory cracks, banking
has always been well monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these shop-for-a-cause sites become a permanent part of
the scene depends a lot on what kind of results they deliver for
charities and consumers. What worries Dunlap, the founder of
4charity, is that some sites _ ones that mislead consumers or
alienate charities _ ``will ruin it for the rest of us.''

WHAT A TANGLED WIRE WEB WE WEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's a problem with our wired world: wires.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was pointed out to me the other day by my wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that pile of junk down there?'' she asked, as we slid
my computer table away from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, wires,'' I answered, wondering where the conversation was
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this mess,'' she continued. ``Haven't you ever
heard of wire management?''
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I, too, was a bit amazed at the tangle of
black, gray and white wires that sat, twisted and ugly like some
lazy python, against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   When I set up my computer, I distinctly remember carefully
running each of those wires between various pieces of equipment. I
avoided tangles, and made sure none of the wires wrapped around
anything, like a table leg. I even coiled and lightly bound wires
that were extra long.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, it looked as though a gremlin had done the
wiring job. I couldn't even tell where some wires connected. I'd
start at a plug and work backwards, only to get lost in a jumble of
plastic between the surge protector and my computer.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   That's what my wife wanted to know, as we set into position a
nice, new computer table, which, unfortunately, revealed more of
the wire nightmare than the old table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this connected to?'' Mary asked, gripping a slim black
wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speakers,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really need them?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ack! Of course!'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   And so my afternoon went.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a week later, I sit at my machine writing this column.
Everything appears to be working OK, which means we got all the
wires plugged back in properly. And, I must admit, ``wire
management'' and a few of those plastic wire ties really made
things look nice.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not nice. But better.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the organization last? I'm not sure, but I think I
already hear gremlins giggling . . . &QL; 
MP3 making lots of noise
</P>
<P>
   Since I last wrote about MP3, the file compression format used
to distribute music via the Internet has really taken off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible. It's astounding,'' said Michael Robertson,
chief executive officer of San Diego-based MP3.com, perhaps the
biggest player in the MP3 music business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know that Robertson is in business, and it's his job to
talk-up MP3. But he offered statistics and information to back up
his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   First off, MP3.com is signing 125 new bands each day, Robertson
said. The Web site (www.mp3.com) already offers downloadable music
from more than 10,000 bands from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com also is adding new functionality to its site. Last week,
for example, the site unveiled a new search function that allows
visitors to find the hottest bands from any given city. Previously,
searches could only be conducted by genre.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, MP3.com has become a record company _ of sorts.
Via its Digital Automatic Music system, artists can compile a list
of songs that MP3.com will put on CDs and sell. Artists have no
start-up costs, and they get half the CD-sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, MP3.com earned a major shot of respectability last
week, when Ted Waitt, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Gateway 2000
Inc., joined the MP3.com board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   What else is in store for the MP3 crowd? Robertson says
enthusiasts should expect ``MP3.com's Guide to MP3,'' a soft-bound
book, to become available next month. Expect sales via MP3.com and
Amazon.com. Retail sales are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Robertson predicted that this summer will see a
host of new MP3 hardware hit the market. He said different
companies are jumping into the business, and the goal is to get MP3
players out that can handle more than an hour's worth of music.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, MP3 lovers don't have much more than the Rio, a $200
Walkman-like portable player that has memory enough for about 60
minutes of music. They're on sale at various electronics stores,
including CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   All is not rosy for MP3, however. Despite legitimate
applications such as those employed by MP3.com, the MP3 technology
is considered by the established music industry to be little more
than organized piracy, because of the ease of which it allows
anyone using free software from the Internet to rip music off
traditional audio CDs, compress them into the MP3 format and
redistribute them via rogue Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by the Recording Industry Association of
America will likely fan the fires of anti-MP3 sentiment. The
survey, released last week, found that 15- to 24-year-olds are
buying less music, something the survey partly blamed on MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing drop-off in the proportion of purchases
accounted for by 15- to 24-year-olds (32.2 percent in 1996 vs. 28
percent in 1998), once the mainstay of the market, is puzzling,''
the report states. ``Potentially the rise of the Internet as a free
entertainment center, and the accompanying availability of free MP3
music files, could be contributing factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps spurred by such findings, the recording industry
intensified its attack on MP3. Last week, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry launched legal proceedings
against the Norwegian partner of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos (www.lycos.com) is a popular U.S.-based search engine
site. Over the past few months, it has launched FAST MP3 Search
(mp3.lycos.com), which can instantly link users with tens or
hundreds of Web sites offering MP3 files for download.
</P>
<P>
   It's my guess that if MP3 continues to grow in popularity and if
the format isn't replaced by something better, the recording
industry will take over and dominate the MP3 distribution business
within a year. It'll be the old ``if you can't beat 'em, join 'em''
thing. &QL;

AVOID COMPUTER-TRANSMITTED VIRUSES BY PRACTICING SAFE E-MAILING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The frenzied spread of the W97 Melissa virus that
began Friday and continued through Monday is the direct result of a
widely accepted _ yet very unsafe and very unwise _ business
computing habit: sending Microsoft Word documents as e-mail
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   It's a practice that has become more prevalent as Microsoft's
Office suite of productivity software becomes more ubiquitous.
Everyone has Word, right? So it must be okay to send information as
a Word document over the Internet, right?
</P>
<P>
   But computer users everywhere discovered, starting Friday
afternoon, that it's ITAL not END ITAL right. The fact that Word
documents can transmit computer viruses is just one reason why
those who use PCs should stop the practice immediately, and instead
send e-mail as text-only messages.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus _ which technically is a form of destructive
programming known as a worm _ takes the form of a macro built into
a Word 97 or Word 2000 document. A macro is a series of commands
that causes the popular word processing software to perform
specific actions.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Melissa macro commands activate the address
book in either Microsoft's Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail
programs. It grabs the first 50 names in the address book and mails
a copy of a list of pornographic Web sites to those people.
</P>
<P>
   Even those computer users who practice safe computing were
fooled on Friday when the virus first appeared. That's because
Melissa appears to come from someone known to the recipient. The
macro inserts the name of the sender _ the person whose address
book was invaded _ into the subject field as part of the subject
line that begins ``Important message from ... '' That makes the
recipient more apt to trust the document and open it in Word.
</P>
<P>
   Macro viruses have been around for several years, ever since a
computer science professor created a benign one to prove it could
be done, and serve as a warning to PC users.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, macro viruses are now the most prevalent form of virus
in the wild, according to Symantec, which makes the popular Norton
AntiVirus software. And that's largely because of the practice of
sending Word documents via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons not to send Word documents as
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   -- They can be quite large, particularly complex documents that
contain illustrations. For those who are receive e-mail via modem
connections, waiting for one of these to download can be
excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not everyone uses Word. Although Word has a grip on about 85
percent of the word-processing market, Corel's WordPerfect and
Lotus' WordPro also are popular. Those programs may not be able to
look at Word documents, depending on the version.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not everyone uses Microsoft Windows, the platform on which
Word 97 and Word 2000 run. At the Houston Chronicle, for example,
most of the editorial department runs on a Unix-based system.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are sending a document to someone with whom you are
collaborating, there are very few good reasons for sending a Word
document simply to deliver information.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may want to preserve the fancy formatting they've
put into a document, but unless it contains tables or
illustrations, visual tricks usually don't add much to the content,
which is what's really important.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist upon a glitzy look can always use HTML, or
HyperText Markup Language, which is the coding used to build Web
pages. Most modern e-mail programs can read HTML-based messages.
</P>
<P>
   But plain, simple text really is the best format for e-mail. It
doesn't take a long time to download, it can be read by all types
of computer users, and it can't hurt your computer upon being
opened.
</P>
<P>
   (Despite the chain-mail warnings that nearly every PC user has
gotten about not opening certain e-mails _ with subjects such as
``Good Times'' or ``Join the Crew!'' _ there is no way that a
text-only e-mail can harm your computer _ only those with attached
documents or programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people will send whole programs to each other _ executable
files that end in .exe. Such programs as Happy99, a virus that
changes crucial system files and then attaches a copy of itself to
every e-mail you send, would not be a problem if people did the
smart thing _ delete any executable file, unless you know who it's
from and were told it was coming in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive a Word document, politely ask the sender to
resubmit the message in text-only format, and point out that such
attachments can transmit computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a concerted effort to get computer users to stop
sending Word documents, but the Melissa virus should provide some
inspiration for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive a Word document you feel you must look at, try
using QuickView instead. This is a small program built into Windows
95 and 98 that lets you view many documents without using the
software that generated them.
</P>
<P>
   Right-click on the document, then choose QuickView. The top part
of the document may appear to be garbled in some cases; scroll down
to see the text.

MICROSOFT WILL REORGANIZE INTO 5 UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heralding an era he referred to as the ``vision version 2.0,''
the Microsoft Corp.'s president, Steven Ballmer, announced the
reorganization of the company Monday into five divisions that he
suggested would act with some independence.
</P>
<P>
   In a morning teleconference held with his friend, William H.
Gates, who co-founded the company, Ballmer, who became president of
Microsoft eight months ago, said that he was beginning to reinvent
the company, the world's largest independent software maker,
focusing it on initiatives that he said were largely ``customer
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who has a reputation as a hands-on manager who likes to
burrow deeply into the company's different businesses, said that
the reorganization had nothing to do with the bitter antitrust
lawsuit Microsoft is now fighting with the federal government and
19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Ballmer said in response to a question about
whether the software publisher was simply looking for a new
divisional structure that might facilitate a future breakup
instituted by the Justice Department. He added, ``There's certainly
no breakup of this company into smaller companies that I would find
acceptable, and we're certainly not in any way thinking of that as
a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that it was ``inappropriate'' to comment on
settlement talks with the Justice Department and state attorneys
general that were scheduled to begin Tuesday in Washington. He said
his two objectives going into the discussion were that the
company's Windows operating system retain its integrity and that
the company maintain its ability to add innovations to its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization announced Monday, Microsoft has been
divided into five separate divisions, and two veteran executives
have been named to head its troubled online operations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the five new groups within Microsoft under the
reorganization:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Business and Enterprise Division, which will focus on
software for information technology customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Consumer Windows Division, which will focus on developing
Windows for the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Business Productivity Group, which will focus on products
for so-called knowledge workers, which includes telecommuters and
home-office workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Developer Group, which will focus on software developers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Consumer and Commerce Group, which includes the Microsoft
Network, will focus on bringing consumers and businesses together
on line.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced an expanded 14-member executive
committee, which analysts said was intended to help decentralize
the management of the giant software company, based in Redmond,
Wash. The group, which will be headed by Gates, will meet monthly
to discuss the company's broad goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden between the lines is the reality that this can no
longer continue to be the Bill and Steve show,'' said an executive
who is close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally favored the reorganization, and the stock
market was positive as well, sending the shares up $3.25, to
$92.375, on the first day of trading after a 2-for-1 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense,'' said Arthur V. Russell, an analyst
with the brokerage firm of Edward Jones, adding that it would
``allow Microsoft to get closer to its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said neither investors nor consumers were likely to see
any immediate change from the reorganization. However, he said, if
the reorganization is successful, eventually customers will see
more reliable products and intensified marketing efforts, while
investors could see increased sales and higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization James Allchin, a technologist, will run
two groups: the Business and Enterprise Division and the Windows
division, aimed at developing the Windows operating system for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Microsoft veterans, Brad Chase and Jon DeVaan, will
run the Consumer and Commerce Group, and Paul Maritz will supervise
the software-developers group. Robert Muglia will oversee the
division aimed at knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the executives named except DeVaan have testified at the
antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not mentioned Monday, the company's Windows CE
consumer operating system for hand-held computers and set-top boxes
has been split between the Business Productivity Group and the
Consumer and Commerce Group.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from Monday's announcement were two Microsoft veterans
who have played significant roles in the past. Ballmer said that
Brad Silverberg, who had been a key executive both in the company's
Windows desktop business and its Internet effort, had recently
returned to work half-time after a leave of absence and had an
office several doors down from his own.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Silverberg would serve as an adviser to him and
that he was already being peppered with e-mail from him.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when he was asked why Nathan Myhrvold, who heads the
software publisher's basic research efforts, had not been named to
the company's expanded executive committee, Gates said that
Myhrvold's work had a research and not a business focus.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has until now been organized into three
technology-oriented groups: computer operating systems,
applications, and other activities similar to its online business.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews Monday and during the teleconference,
Ballmer stressed that he was attempting to streamline the company
to make it more responsive to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to talk about is the reinvention of Microsoft,''
he said, adding that the company would now shift its focus to a
changing model of computer technology, one not so radically focused
on the desktop personal computer as Microsoft has been.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has increasingly found itself under attack from
competitors that argue that the computer industry is entering a
post-PC phase and that new growth will largely come in areas in
which Microsoft is not dominant, such as hand-held devices and
wireless appliances.

 &HT;    Boiled custard recalls sweet memories
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Myra Hager of Lilburn (Ga.) is among readers who
remember, and sometimes make, boiled custard. She sent her
grandmother's recipe, which she said is at least 60 years old, in
response to a recent request from Nina Whitfield of Roswell (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Many in Hager's family say it wouldn't be Christmas without
boiled custard. Her grandmother used it as a base for lots of
desserts, including her father's favorite _ stirred into banana
pudding _ but always reserved a separate bowl full of plain custard
just for Myra. Our tester says it's great with fresh strawberries,
too.
</P>
<P>
   We hope it's the kind Whitfield wanted.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Boiled Custard

   In a heavy pan over medium heat, bring milk to warm temperature
without boiling. In a bowl, mix the sugar and cornstarch. Add eggs
to sugar mixture and beat well. Pour the hot milk over the sugar
mixture slowly and mix well. Return full mixture to heat and cook
on medium-low until it thickens, stirring constantly. Do not
overcook. Bring to 170 to 180 degrees or until mixture coats the
spoon you are stirring with.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat, stir in extract and strain through wire
strainer if desired. Pour into a pitcher or bowl to cool and cover

   Recipe requests
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Susan W. Vaughn of Conyers (Ga.) is looking for a recipe for
Hot Water Corn Bread. After reading about it in a cookbook that
extolled the bread's unique texture, caused by the hot water, she
was disappointed to find that the book didn't contain the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Linda Juckett (e-mail) is looking for a tossed salad recipe
that includes broken, uncooked ramen noodles.

 &HT;    No jest: Films offer cavalcade of fools for April 1
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's April Fools' Day. Feel like fooling around with some
jesters, clowns and just plain fools? Here are some prime examples
of film foolishness on video, though not necessarily ha-ha foolish.
And please note the absence of Jim Carrey, Jerry Lewis and Roberto
Benigni; we figured you already knew the usual fools.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Court Jester'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   Danny Kaye's genial spoof of the Robin Hood legend and Hollywood
swashbucklers was one of his biggest hits. The agile Kaye _ he
proved as good at sword fights as he was with tongue twisters _
plays a cowardly carnival entertainer who gets mixed up in royal
intrigue when he's forced to masquerade as a world-famous court
jester. The ace supporting cast includes Angela Lansbury and Basil
Rathbone. Remember: The chalice with the palace has the brew that
is true.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   It's a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb movie. And every bit as bloated as
its title (especially if you see the original 3 hour and 12 minute
version). But what it does offer is as fine a collection of
midcentury or so comics as you're ever likely to see gathered
together for one film.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Durante kicks the bucket (literally) in the opening scene,
but not before dropping a clue about some buried loot. So the hunt
is on, conducted with high spirits _ no matter how low the material
goes _ by the likes of Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters, Sid Caesar,
Edie Adams, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The icing on the madness? There are also cameos by every
still-ambulatory joker then in the biz _ Jack Benny, Don Knotts,
Buster Keaton, Jim Backus, the Three Stooges and at least a dozen
others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The April Fools'' (1969).
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Loy and Charles Boyer are free spirits with a long and
happy marriage. Their example inspires a mild-mannered stockbroker
(Jack Lemmon) and a married woman (Catherine Deneuve) to chuck
their mundane lives and, um, do their own thing (well, it was the
late '60s).
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve, in her first American role, is lovely to look at (also
scared to death, remembers Loy in her autobiography), and Lemmon
does his dithering Everyman bit both touchingly and well. The
picture as a whole may not gel as well as its individual parts
suggest, but there's a splendid bit with Harvey Korman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fools' Parade'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   This quirky, virtually unknown film offers Jimmy Stewart in his
last appearance as a bona-fide leading man. After this, it was TV
and Lassie movies.
</P>
<P>
   An adaptation of an idiosyncratic novel by Davis Grubb (``Night
of the Hunter''), the picture takes place in rural West Virginia in
1935. Stewart, Strother Martin and Kurt Russell are ex-cons who
plan to open a general store with the money Stewart has saved from
his prison pay. But a crooked warden (George Kennedy) has other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   If you were one of the 12 people who saw the movie, what you
probably remember most is Stewart's glass eye, which he uses to
bamboozle gullible thugs. The eye itself was something of a
problem. It was a prosthesis _ a kind of contact lens contraption _
that was extremely irritating to Stewart's own eye. He could only
wear it for 20 minutes at a time, which made for a stop-and-go
production schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ship of Fools'' (1965).
</P>
<P>
   Critics called it ``Grand Hotel'' at sea when it came out.
Today, it would probably be characterized as ``Titanic'' minus the
iceberg with a dash of ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Stanley Kramer, the movie takes place on an ocean
liner en route to Bremerhaven, Germany, from Vera Cruz, Mexico, in
1933. On board is a rich microcosm of humanity _ Vivien Leigh as a
fading divorcee; Lee Marvin as a boorish Texan; Oskar Werner as the
sensitive ship's doctor who's in love with Simone Signoret; Jose
Ferrer as a German businessman and enthusiastic Hitler supporter;
and Michael Dunn as the film's one-man Greek chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The off-screen dramas were as rich as the on-screen ones. Leigh
was dying; this would be her last film. Werner refused to be
photographed from the right. Meanwhile, Marvin was falling for a
bit player named Michelle Triola who, a few years later, would add
``palimony'' to our vocabulary.

   &QR;  ``Everest'' (unrated) _ What was breathtaking on the
five-story IMAX screen (and earned an ``A'' grade) is still
impressive. David Breashears' documentary was filmed at the same
time as the 1996 storm that killed eight mountain climbers,
memorialized by Jon Krakauer's best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''
But on the small screen, it bears the same relation to the IMAX
experience as a museum postcard does to the actual painting it
reproduces. Grade: B

wants to kiss her. A mix of Hollywood blandness and small-town
condescension, the movie can't decide if it's a romance or a farce.
But Catherine O'Hara chews the scenery _ in a good way _ as the
boys' vengeful mom. Grade: C

 &HT;    `Rugrats' comfortingly familiar familial territory

   ``The Rugrats Movie'' (G)
</P>
<P>
   The animated ``Rugrats'' hit the big screen with a big issue:
making way for a new baby. That's what Tommy Pickles has to do when
his folks come home from the hospital with Dylan ``Dil'' Pickles.
</P>
<P>
   On top of dealing with the constant crying, Tommy can't help
noticing all the attention his parents are giving to this needy
newcomer. His pals Phil and Lil and Chuckie aren't crazy about the
new kid, either. So when they all get lost in the woods, Tommy
fears that he has to choose between playing with his friends and
tending his nuisance baby bro.
</P>
<P>
   The movie version of the TV hit show is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds. Grade:
B-

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

CLINTON'S REIGN OF ERROR IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The last few days I've felt sick, angry and
powerless. And I don't mean about rising gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Our president ordered the bombing of a small country run by a
man with a record of genocide, and yet never expected that the
genocide would be escalated enormously.
</P>
<P>
   I predicted it. Anyone could have predicted it by flipping
through the news clips on Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia, Sarajevo and
Kosovo. President Clinton, one of the smartest politicians in the
world, failed to predict it.
</P>
<P>
   How do we explain this? Clinton even promised Milosevic that he
would not send in ground forces. He didn't even have troops and
tanks in reserve in case the air war didn't go as planned _ which
it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of talk about how Clinton doesn't have an
``exit strategy'' or an ``end game.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's something like ``closure,'' but long ago military
thinkers used the word ``victory.'' That word has fallen out of
use.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a chess analogy in this horror, it's that Milosevic
has been playing chess while Clinton has been playing his old game
of _ what? Strip poker? Or maybe Go Fish.
</P>
<P>
   End game? Clinton is fishing for a second move.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has Clinton boxed between two choices: the complete
``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo, or American casualties on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, taking casualties is politically unacceptable in
modern American war.
</P>
<P>
   We like our wars risk-free to Americans, easy and quick enough
to fit between stories like the rising price of gas and the Dow
hitting 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was starting to rant about those liberals (yes, mostly
liberals) who call for more bombing to stop the genocide, yet want
the war to be quick and free of American casualties, I got a call
from somebody who knows a thing or two about war and its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sullivan, a San Francisco native and former aide to Rep.
Tom Lantos, is the executive director of the National Gulf War
Resource Center in Washington, D.C. This veteran of the First
Armored Division in the Gulf War addressed the notions that the
Gulf War was a low-casualty, high-tech battle and that it was
quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say it was quick, because it's still going on,''
Sullivan said. ``You can't say it was so high-tech because the
Patriot missiles didn't work and the cruise missiles were as likely
to hit a civilian target as a military one. You can't say it was
low-casualty because thousands of Iraqis died, and still are dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mythology of the clean, simple war is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it lives on in such bloodless Pentagon language as the use
of the phrase ``degrading enemy forces'' when talking about trying
to find targets in the fog and blow them up.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and White House talk about ``punishing'' Milosevic,
while the air attacks make him a hero to his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I go past the Iwo Jima memorial,'' Sullivan said.
``You've got to go over and plant your flag in the other guy's back
yard to win a war. The U.S. had a comprehensive plan to defeat
Japan in World War II. There is no plan here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans think there's no war, either. It's just another
president dropping bombs on another strange little country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that gets me are the talking heads on TV talking
about the `fireworks,' and going `Ooh' and `Aah,''' Sullivan said.
``Every time those `fireworks' go off, people are being blown to
heaven. When are they going to get some real people on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the original questions. Why did Clinton think bombs and
missiles would cow Milosevic into accepting an unfavorable treaty
and being nice to ethnic Albanians?
</P>
<P>
   And why did Clinton give away any advantage by promising his
adversary he wouldn't use ground forces?
</P>
<P>
   The easy answer is that Clinton avoided military experience.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of generals and admirals have done dumb things, too.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the problem is that Clinton has been playing the game
he knows best, besides legal and sexual semantics. He's been
playing symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between symbols and substance, Clinton has always
chosen symbols, from his ``conversation on race'' to his
cruise-missile attacks on Sudanese penicillin plants.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton loves to send messages via laser-guided bomb and cruise
missile, a weapon that isn't very powerful, but looks good on TV
and doesn't result in lost pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Milosevic stepped up the action in his much more
deadly non-game of genocide, or ethnic cleansing if you prefer that
awful term.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is playing for keeps. Clinton apparently was playing
to the polls, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it doesn't matter if the genocide would have
taken place without the bombing. It has increased because of
Milosevic's deadly serious chess playing, and we have no effective
way to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone remember how long it took to load the tanks of Paul
Sullivan's First Armored Division on ships and get them to the
Gulf?
</P>
<P>
   It's too late to get them anywhere near Kosovo now, and we're
stuck with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's America going to do to take care of these refugees?''
Sullivan said. ``We're responsible for them now. That's a tough
burden.''

NOTARO: I'M READY TO GO FULL MONTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If you told me last week that I'd take my clothes off
for millions of people to see, and get paid for it, I'd have told
you, ``Get outta here! Quit your fooling around!''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, who knew? The last person I expected to hear on the other
end of the phone line was Kevin, the photo editor I had interviewed
while covering the auditions for the Playmate 2000 contest last
year. During our interview, against my better judgment, he talked
me into auditioning for the contest myself, and I did it, despite
the fact that the other girls in the room looked like they were all
hatched from one egg laid by Pamela Anderson. There was enough
silicone in that room to seal every bathtub drain in the
continental United States. And yeah, as I walked through the Valley
of the Shadow of Breasts wearing a white bathrobe with an
embroidered bunny on the lapel, my inner thighs rubbing together
and creating one really painful rash, I knew that for the rest of
my life, I could truthfully say that I had tried out to be a
``Playboy'' centerfold.
</P>
<P>
   I never expected them to call. During the audition, I never even
took my clothes off. When it was my turn and I disrobed, the
photographer saw me in my gray jumper and black tights and shot me
a puzzled look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting to . . . try out,'' I explained, laying
across the bed like a corpse. ``I'm not really . . . ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' the photographer coaxed. ``I've seen
everything!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' I said, shaking my head. ``No, you haven't. You see,
I haven't shaved . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen stubble,'' he interrupted, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . since the morning of my wedding in 1996,'' I finished.
``Naked, I'm a tourist attraction from Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, the fact that I remained clothed didn't
kill my chances; in fact, it increased them. Over the phone last
week, Kevin explained that my modesty was ``very alluring'' and
``intriguing,'' something the folks at ``Playboy'' don't see very
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see girls every day, giving looksies away for free,'' he
added. ``There's no challenge in that! But you, you're like a
private reserve. Carefully keeping nature's bounty a secret, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature has been very bountiful to me,'' I added, nodding my
head and feeling my second and third chins dance together. ``Will
you pay for liposuction?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' Kevin yelled into the receiver. ``We love
you just the way you are. You are EVERYWOMAN. We narrowed down our
search to you and Monica Lewinsky, but you are more `EVERY.' Do you
know how sick I am of Skinny Minnies? If I see another protruding
rib cage, I'm going to throw it on the grill and slap some KC
Masterpiece on it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I said, giggling. ``Because I was about to eat a
Twinkie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat the Twinkie!'' Kevin shouted joyfully. ``Eat a Ding Dong!
The tide is changing, girlfriend, and you are going to be the
poster girl for the Real Woman of the New Millennium!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a zit on my neck the size of a cat's-eye marble,'' I
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it has a shadow, we can airbrush,'' he replied. ``But we'd
rather keep our Nude Real Woman of the New Millennium as very real
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   I stopped. I had forgotten about the naked part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin,'' I mentioned carefully, ``do I have to be totally
naked? I mean, can I have some props, like a rug, or a big
poncho?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have that thing on your neck, but of course we can
work in other props,'' he said, much to my relief. ``How about a
book? Or a feather? And don't freak out, you won't be totally
naked. You'll be wearing pearls!''
</P>
<P>
   That was still pretty NAKED. Could I do NAKED? Even for money? I
really didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to all the letters I received a couple of weeks
ago, calling me ``sick,'' ``repressed,'' ``Victorian'' and a
``disgusting pig'' because I freaked out when I saw a naked lady in
the locker room. Maybe the angry naked people were right, I said to
myself suddenly. Maybe my body was God's art, maybe everything I
was taught about modesty, privacy and propriety was wrong. Maybe I
should start letting it all hang out, even the wrinkled parts.
Maybe I should show my respect for my body by being intimate with
strangers. Maybe pride really is taking off my clothes for people I
don't know and will never meet! In the name of God's beautiful
creation, I could make my privates into an open house! Especially
for the right dollar amount!
</P>
<P>
   So I went to work creating the all-important bio of myself that
would run with my pictorial, exposing more of my inner self to
``Playboy's'' readers than what would already be in the layout,
especially the one of me climbing rocks:
</P>
<P>
   Favorite color: Fudge.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby: Chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   Life goals: To outlaw any dress size under 12 and to get the
original cream filling back into Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Sno
Balls.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Climbing rocks with no panties on.
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Popping the zit on my neck on the first try.
</P>
<P>
   I also practiced cursive writing, dotting each ``i'' with a
smiley face and crossing each ``t'' with a full, pouty set of lips.
</P>
<P>
   After I finished my bio, I had to do the hardest thing of all,
and that was to tell my mom. I didn't want her hearing about my
layout at her bunco club after she had just eaten a forkful of
ambrosia salad. I had to call her myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, I'm going to be ``Playboy's'' Nude Real Woman of the New
Millennium!'' I tried to say as excitedly, quietly and quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too bad,'' she said rather calmly, ``because I don't
think the pictures will turn out too good because of the casts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The casts for what?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casts the doctor puts on both of your legs after I break
them like twigs!'' she yelled. ``How sexy is that, Miss Open to the
Public? Huh? I'm sending you back to that doctor for some more
counseling, because if you think you're going to ruin this family's
name, you're NUTS, you hear me? Your brain's the size of a damn
walnut if you think you're showing your patootie and lentils to
strange men! I didn't raise you to be a hoochie-coochie girl!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it easy. It's very tasteful, Mom. I'm wearing pearls!'' I
said adamantly. ``Besides, April is the cruelest month. Especially
the first day.'' &QL;

FREE ADVICE FOR PHILOSOPHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Everybody needs a philosophy of life. Here's
mine:
</P>
<P>
   Get over it. Stop whining. Tend to business. Just figure that if
you're getting a raw deal, it's probably won't be the last time.
Raw deals are part of the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's not complex thinking. It's not a reflective
representation of any particular school of philosophical thought.
It does have this virtue, however: You didn't have to pay me for
it.
</P>
<P>
   If Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr.'s bill goes through the New York
Legislature, though, the public will have to pay a philosopher to
give advice like that to somebody _ to anybody, actually _ who
qualifies for taxpayer-funded third-party payment. And then, of
course, the private health insurance companies would be pressured
to offer the same payment.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we now pay shrinks to help Medicaid recipients get their
heads on straight, so, too, would we pay philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, 25, is the youngest member of the Legislature. Twice now,
the Bronx assemblyman has introduced a bill to set up a state board
to license philosophical practitioners. It would set minimum
educational standards _ a doctorate in philosophy. It also would
regulate philosophical practitioners, or counselors, once they're
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   What's really important about this bill, though, is the
third-party payment angle. That means that taxpayers would pay
philosophers just as taxpayers now pay psychologists to offer
advice on how people might get their acts together.
</P>
<P>
   No other state offers public payment for people seeking advice
from philosophers. Diaz feels that New York should ``lead the
way.'' This bill was introduced by Diaz at the request of the
American Philosophical Practitioners Association. This is a group
of three dozen people with advanced degrees in philosophy, mostly
City University of New York professors, who figure that the advice
they give is worth at least as much as the advice handed out by
psychologists. Psychiatrists, they concede, are physicians, but
they mostly hand out drugs to people with emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Del Duca, Diaz's chief of staff, holds a degree in
philosophy. Instead of treating a client's unhappiness with drugs
or psychotherapy, he said, ``the philosophical therapist will ask,
`Well, what is happiness?''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marinoff, the executive director of the American
Philosophical Practitioners Association, put it this way: ``Most
people have problems at one time or another ... You might have a
problem in a relationship ... Your life might feel meaningless to
you ... These are not, in and of themselves, mental illnesses. So a
lot of people feel quite benefited by speaking to philosophers
about these subjects ... Call it therapy for the sane.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all fascinating, of course, but it raises an interesting
question: Should government limit third-party payment only to
medical care? Or are taxpayers prepared to foot the bill for a wide
variety of personal services that could help Medicaid recipients
live their lives more enjoyably? And, if so, where does it stop?
</P>
<P>
   If we clear the way for Medicaid payment to philosophers, for
example, can personal trainers be far behind? Will Medicaid pay for
gym memberships? How about art lessons, so depressed Medicaid
recipients can unleash their creative energies?
</P>
<P>
   How about fortune tellers? How about sex surrogates for the
romantically dysfunctional? And don't tell me they don't provide a
service that would be in heavy demand if taxpayers were footing the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   There's a word for a plan like this. That word is ``nonsense.''
There's also a reason it's being proposed. For a dozen years now,
American universities have overproduced graduates with doctorates
in the humanities. There are no full-time teaching jobs for most of
them _ especially for highly educated philosophers. The Diaz bill
would, in effect, create a taxpayer-funded market for therapy
services that the philosophers can't peddle successfully in the
free market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medi'' is in Medicaid for a reason. This bill will go nowhere.
That'll probably upset the philosophers. My advice: Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, no charge.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>

   Things were already not going so well for ``10 Things I Hate
About You'' when Joan Armatrading faded in on the film's
soundtrack. Her ``The Weakness in Me'' is the song that's supposed
to reveal just how much Patrick (Heath Ledger) is falling in love
with Kat (Julia Stiles), but it only reveals how hopelessly
off-base ``10 Things'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Armatrading? She writes ballads every mix-taper should be
proud to own, but the soundtrack to an upbeat teen movie? It's like
name-dropping to a bunch of people who wouldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this update of Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew''
is the type of movie that would just as soon have a middling rock
outfit like Letters to Cleo go amateur night all over the song
anyway _ so better to have the original.
</P>
<P>
   As handled by Gil Junger, the man responsible for the TV
syndication staples ``Golden Girls'' and ``It's a Living,'' ``10
Things'' is like something made by your incorrigible uncle, the one
who let you borrow his Malibu before you got your license, the one
who swore he'd keep your first sex and drug encounters ``our little
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The hep uncle with the girlfriends about your age who thinks
he's cooler than your parents because he can ask you ``what the
dilly yo?'' Ugh. It's dispiriting to see a gaggle of up-and-comers
held in movie detention by forces more avuncular than awesome. Oh
``10 Things,'' how I loathe thee, let me count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie repeatedly done in by its soundtrack. Just because
a film is based on a play from the 16th century doesn't mean the
music that drives it ought to come from that era too. What suburban
party goes through the trouble of bum-rushing some rich kid's
house, throwing up a couple turntables complete with DJ, then
spinning a creaky Thompson Twins number as if no one would notice?
</P>
<P>
   None of the characters notices much of anything going on beneath
the surface at Padua High. When Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)
decrees himself in love with the virginal Bianca (Larisa Oleynik),
he refuses to believe she's as shallow as she sounds. Never mind
that she's hashing over the difference between liking and loving
Skechers and Prada bags with her friend Chastity (Gabrielle Union)
as if memories of ``Clueless'' had all but dried up. Besides, names
do lie: Chastity is the biggest skeezer at Padua High.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca is smitten with the school hottie Joey (Andrew Keegan), a
socks and briefs model who appears to be wearing more make-up than
every girl running to the bathroom mirror for a touch-up between
classes. She'd like to go on a date with Joey, but her father
forbids it unless Kat, her hard-boiled, hot-blooded and willfully
manless older sister can scare up a beau. That sends Cameron and
Joey on individual scrambles to Patrick, Padua's resident bad boy,
to woo his even more callous half.
</P>
<P>
   This despair could all have been avoided if someone had the
basic social sagacity to realize a few things about the players in
this staged play. ``There's this boy ...'' Bianca tells her dad,
``who's a flaming imbecile,'' interrupts Kat.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's just flaming, but everyone's so focused on being
grateful that the Sylvia Plath-loving Kat owns a pair of black
undies and is ``not a kd lang fan'' that Joey's playing the
specious straight falls through the cracks of what could have been
a hilariously observant, modern movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things'' hides behind Shakespeare, kissing up to the Bard
when its makers and participants really owe their jobs and this
entire teen resurgence as we now know it to John Hughes. Updates
like this one and ``She's All That'' use literature to disqualify
the fact that they wish they had Hughes' breezy, infectious
neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things'' could have been wild, raucous fun, still quotable
in 10 years, but terms like ``up-chuck'' and ``panties in a twist''
are so 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles and Ledger are the big deals here. Together they seem to
be in another movie in which people don't suffer rubber emotions
but ones that stick. Stiles is especially captivating with her
husky voice and tomboy overtones. You're convinced she'll go to
Sarah Lawrence and have the lesbian tryst her friends and family
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's afraid of her, turning Kat into a Solid Gold dancer
in the time it takes to drop one Notorious B.I.G. song at that
house party _ which is why it's the Spam of processed teen movies.

BLUE JEAN FORTUNES; JUMPER FATES; MS. MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world fraught with uncertainty, a world in which stealth
bombers are shot down and the Good Samaritan's suicide line is
busy, there is a single unwavering constant. It is a comfortable
pair of blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   There are those among us, those of a certain, ah, disposition,
who know that the best pair of jeans are Levi's straight legs with
a button-down fly and the company's little leather square stitched
high on the butt. They do not need to be washed for months. They
are always there for you, molded to your body, even when your loved
ones are not.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that this reporter leapt to Nina Munk's cover
story in the April Fortune on ``How Levi's Trashed a Great American
Brand.'' I confess: I never read Fortune. I consider stories about
corporate America as kin to month-old pork chops discovered in the
back of the fridge. But I read every word of this story.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, of course, so much a story about jeans as it is about
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. CEO Robert Haas, one of those rare titans of
industry who actually care about people as much as profits. Levi's,
certainly, has suffered as the world has been flooded by ever new
brands of jeans _ its US market share of men 16 and older has been
halved in recent years. But the decline of this American classic is
also the result of Haas's utopian vision, according to Fortune, and
his determination to show that a company driven by social values
could do just as well as one driven by profits, and perhaps even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, who sprang from the Peace Corps and Harvard Business
School to become the fifth-generation family member to run the
company in 1984, believes in corporate responsibility. Really! He
pulled out of China to protest human rights abuses. He created task
forces to make the company more aspirational. He distributed AIDS
leaflets outside the company cafeteria. There were lots of meetings
about finding meaning in the workplace. But somehow, Haas forgot to
keep an eye on what folks were wearing out there. And when managers
became distracted with a retailer-friendly program in the mid
1990s, the blue jean king kind of imploded. Fortune estimates that
over the past three years, the company's market value has shrunk
from $14 billion to $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune takes a tsk-tsk attitude about all this, sniffing
unhappily that madman Haas is virtually unfettered at the wheel
until 2011. The story nods at corporate efforts to reclaim its lost
market share, only to draw up in horror at Haas's promise to reward
every Levi's employee in the world with a bonus worth a year's
salary if the cash flow rises to a certain level in the next two
years. What! What next?! Free jeans for the homeless? So if it is
hard for readers to solider into the business press, it is nice to
discover that someone, somewhere, is doing it differently.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   I remember the day Dano died. I did not know him, never even
heard of him in fact. But as I drove home from work one day last
November I listened enthralled to the radio account of how he had
plunged 1,100 feet into the dark of a Yosemite valley tethered to a
single rope. He was working on his sport.
</P>
<P>
   In the April issue of Outside magazine, Craig Vetter takes a
look at why, sort of. Dan Osman (his full name) was a rock rat, one
of those ropy-haired, iron-muscled men who spend their days
crawling up the craggy cliffs and sometimes jumping off them. Dano
was very good at it. In fact, he had created a whole system of
ropes and anchor lines that spread the weight of impact of his fall
and enabled him to jump from heights no one had ever tried before.
He called this new sport ``free-falling.'' And, lately, adventure
and sport companies had been shooting spots of the 35-year-old for
their ads.
</P>
<P>
   For Dano, not suprisingly, the ante got raised ever higher, as
did the height of the rocks he jumped off of. Although the story
promises in its headline to go deep, to look at whether his jumps
were ``as profound as he imagined, or just stunts taken to foolish
extremes,'' it largely does not. Mostly, it ogles the phenomenon
and a youngish man's tragic death. But it is a gripping story
nonetheless, a glimpse of wandering soul's brief collision with
identity. It is a story about doing it differently. It is a story
that Robert Haas might wish to read.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of things that are different, here's something that's
not. Ms. magazine is back on the stands after an absence of several
months while it was being sold to a group of women investors called
Liberty Media for Women. Although the bimonthly was supposed to
have been retooled to appeal to younger women, it looks less like a
new magazine and a lot like all the other women's magazines. That's
progress for you.
</P>
<P>
   The April/May issue includes a story on a woman's experience
with plastic surgery. (Mostly good.) One on adultry. (Mostly bad.)
A couple of pieces about a woman's run for the presidency. (Time
will tell.) And a host of updates on such boilerplate subjects as
abortion clinic violence, sexual harassment in public schools, and
the like. There are two stronger pieces, one on the political
implications of women becoming more religious, the other a woman's
memoir of her parents' divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In an introductory letter, founding editor of the original
magazine and current shareholder Gloria Steinem exults that Ms. is
at last women-owned and independent. ``I can't wait to see what
happens now,'' she concludes. Neither can we.

DRIVERS REAP BENEFITS AS INSURER TAKES A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, six years after the Berlin Wall fell, Commerce Group
Inc. introduced price competition to the Soviet-style auto
insurance market in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Things have never been the same since. The Webster-based insurer
initially offered discounts from the state-set rates to Commerce
subscribers who were also members of the American Automobile
Association. Rival insurers countered with discounts of their own,
including breaks for safe drivers. The state added to the mix by
cutting rates more than 20 percent over a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a golden age for Massachusetts drivers. The
same cannot be said for Commerce. True, the company is much bigger.
Its share of the Massachusetts auto market has climbed from 16
percent at the end of 1995 to 22 percent. But most other numbers
have been going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Profits, which peaked at $122 million in 1994, were just $96
million last year. The company's loss ratio _ the percentage of
each dollar of premiums that is paid out in claims _ has been
steadily rising. Investors have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, Commerce's stock price has
dropped from 35 to 25, a decline of 28 percent. Over the past three
years, the stock has climbed just 20 percent at a time when the
stock market in general has roughly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem? A big piece of it, ironically, is the price
competition Commerce brought to the market. Credit Suisse First
Boston just shaved its 1999 and 2000 earnings estimates for
Commerce, blaming ``increased competitive pressures in personal
auto insurance in Massachusetts.'' Credit Suisse expects earnings
to fall this year and recover somewhat next year. Dowling &AMP;
Partners, a Hartford research firm, projects declining earnings
both this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company will report earnings in several weeks,
Commerce executives declined to talk about earnings or the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street thought the price competition might ease up a bit
this year. So did Commerce. In January, the company said it would
offer drivers with safe records a 5 percent discount this year,
down from 15 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, however, Commerce reversed course and
said the safe-driver discounts would be 8 percent. Commerce acted
after other insurers, including Liberty Mutual, set their discounts
at 8 percent. ``It's competition and we want to make sure our rates
are adequate to protect our market share,'' said Commerce spokesman
Anthony J. Battista, explaining the company's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently once the genie of competition has been let loose,
it's tough to get it back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But competition is not Commerce's only problem. The company does
the vast majority of its business in Massachusetts. As Credit
Suisse put it, ``Massachusetts has historically been an extremely
difficult operating environment for many personal auto insurers.''
The state has lots of traffic, bad drivers, and high medical costs.
It is also the only state that still sets auto insurance rates, a
task the rest of the country leaves to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the industry asked for a 15.5 percent hike in rates.
Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt granted an increase of just
0.7 percent. Commerce called the rate hike inadequate. An executive
from another company, who spoke on the promise he would not be
identified, was less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was insane,'' said the executive. ``The insurance
market here is highly politicized.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has appealed the rate decision. The Supreme
Judicial Court is expected to hear the case this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce has been trying to solve its Massachusetts problem by
expanding its business in other states. Last year Commerce acquired
the Automobile Club Insurance Co., a firm that writes insurance
policies through AAA agents in 23 states. The deal increased
out-of-state business to 15 percent of the company's total.
Commerce's long-term goal is 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But life outside of Massachusetts is no picnic either.
``Nationally, competition is getting tougher,'' said Jeffrey
Thompson, an analyst with Advest in Hartford. ``Everyone is
fighting for market share.''
</P>
<P>
   With the growing popularity of insurance sales over the
Internet, the barriers to entry have practically disappeared, say
analysts. In such a world, where the product offered is essentially
a commodity, price wars could become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts still like Commerce's prospects. They say the
stock has been beaten up too much, that the company is well run,
and that the Automobile Club deal will help over time. They may be
right. In the meantime, however, life is better for those of us who
buy auto insurance than it is for those who sell it.

WE'VE HUFFED AND PUFFED _ WHAT DO WE DO NOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tomahawks are sizzling. The Stealths are bombing. Oh yes, we
lost one of our $45 million planes, but the American pilot ejected
safely. It was like a heroic movie: He was rescued just as a ring
of Yugoslavian soldiers was closing in on him.
</P>
<P>
   A telling cultural moment of how we view the NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia is on the front page of one of the nation's
leading newspapers. For ``an interactive look at Kosovo,''
including ``daily images of war,'' click on www.usatoday.com.
Somehow I just cannot picture such cavalier, capitalistic
computerspeak to plug photos of bleached bones at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surreal was Tuesday's front page of The Christian
Science Monitor. It featured a story on a bill in Arkansas to ban
minors from violent video games in public arcades. One teenager was
quoted as saying: ``I have friends who spend their allowance in the
machines until it is all gone. Most of my class likes the
blood-and-guts or combat types best.'' The bill's author,
Lieutenant Governor Win Rockefeller, said, ``Video games basically
numb our youth'' to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of our intellectual claims that real war is a
serious business, it has become Nintendo. As long as it appears
that we are not spilling blood or guts, $45 million planes are
disposable toys. On Friday, a prominent Wall Street investor, Thom
Brown, said it ``would be very negative for the market'' if NATO
sent in ground troops. No ground troops, no real war, no worry. How
else do you explain that despite the grave comparisons of Slobodan
Milosevic to Hitler and the Khmer Rouge, the Dow finished Monday
above 10,000 for the first time ever?
</P>
<P>
   To borrow from Neil Postman, we have amused ourselves to defeat.
Here we are flying B-2 Stealths all the way from Missouri for
outrageously inefficient bombing runs merely on the philosophy of
``use it or lose it.'' The United States has spent $50 billion to
build planes to evade radar, yet because of the mountains and
clouds in this part of Europe, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said on Monday, ``we obviously have concerns'' about the Stealth's
``vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they tell us they are bringing in yet more bombers, B-1Bs,
B-52s, Warthogs. We have huffed, puffed, and bombed Slobodan's
house down. We say we have crippled his ground radar. We say we are
decimating his tanks. Yet this is taking on all the appearances of
federal agents using battering ram tanks to demolish a ghetto
apartments only to find no drugs or dealers.
</P>
<P>
   For while we play with our toys, Milosevic is doing exactly what
he wants. Coveting Kosovo as sacred Serb grounds, he had already
driven out 500,000 of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians, who had
made up 90 percent of the province's population. During the NATO
bombing, the stream of Albanians out of Kosovo has grown to an
average of 20,000 a day. Observers said Kosovo could be truly
``ethnic cleansed'' in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had planned to supply 4,000 troops to a
28,000-soldier NAT0 peacekeeping force, assuming that Milosevic
would crumble under air power. But to defeat Milosevic's 40,000-man
army, an army that knows how to hole up in the mountains, military
experts say NATO would need between 100,000 and 200,000 ground
troops and at least six months to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kosovo has no ethnic Albanians left to defend, the bombs
no longer have a point. It took five months to amass the nearly
550,000 troops for the Gulf War. But even though we liberated
Kuwait and secured our oil supply until the next crisis, Saddam
Hussein still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said it would take about a month to amass enough ground
troops to seriously threaten Milosevic on the ground. It makes you
question what was the point of the bombing in the first place. On
Monday, in the face of the obvious, NATO's military commander,
General Wesley Clark, said, ``We never thought we could stop
this,'' referring to the ethnic cleansing. ``You can't conduct
police actions from the air in any country.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that up in those secretive war rooms, the brass knew
all along that air power alone would not deter Milosevic. But they
also knew, as Bacon said, ``there was no support within NATO for a
massive ground operation.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the world in a terrible quandary. We employed the
weapons of the Nintendo age to call a despot's bluff. We thought
nothing of it because the weapons are so distant from point of
launch to point of death. The ``images of war'' are so antiseptic
we are tempted to rule out other, less violent options. Or, in the
case of Kosovo, where genocide is quite real, we draw back from
using the only force that a despot will listen to _ the force to
destroy his army.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, there seems no real hope of stopping the exodus
unless the Russians, of all people, come to the rescue. Despite our
billions of dollars of air power, Milosevic is on his way to being
a fait accompli winner.
</P>
<P>
   He will be happy to allow a cease-fire with an ethnically
cleansed Kosovo. He will be happy to come to the bargaining table,
knowing that he forced the United States and NATO to be mere
bystanders to another trail of tears. But there will be relatively
few tears shed in the United States. The Dow went over 10,000
points.

VIEWERS FLOCKED TO WOMEN'S FINALS

   When Duke beat Tennessee in the East Regional, it sent a shock
wave felt by anyone even remotely involved in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Great, said some, it will be good to see new teams vying for the
national title. There will be more parity.
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, moaned others, who will pay any attention to women's
basketball now (without Tennessee)?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, many people paid attention. The championship
game between Purdue and Duke Sunday night produced a 4.3 rating for
ESPN, meaning it was seen in 3.2 million homes. It was the second
biggest audience for an ESPN college basketball game, men's or
women's. (The biggest was the Arkansas-Princeton men's game in
1990, seen by 3.4 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee looked like a lock to reach the final based on its
31-3 record and the fact it was the three-time defending champion.
The team seemed destined to live up to its national presence: A
book by coach Pat Summitt, a cover story on her in Sports
Illustrated, and the star appeal of senior forward Chamique
Holdsclaw, the three-time AP Player of the Year who as recently as
two weeks ago was on the cover of TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Even nonchalant fans marveled at Holdsclaw's heroics and quickly
learned to pronounce her first name: Cha-MEEK-kwa. She was an
All-America for each of her four years at Tennessee and last month
won an ESPY as Female Athlete of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 43,281 people who filled out tournament brackets on
espn.com, 25,806 predicted Tennessee would win the championship.
Purdue was picked by 6,932, and 292 predicted Duke.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that last week's Tennessee-Duke game earned a
2.1 rating, the highest on ESPN for any non-Final Four game.
</P>
<P>
   But when Duke advanced, ESPN knew it had to change gears. No
problem, said Len DeLuca, senior vice-president of programming
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed the double Duke story was one people would
adopt,'' he said, as the Blue Devils men's and women's basketball
teams advanced to their Final Fours. ``We go for good stories, and
here it was served up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The stellar rating of the championship game, he said, shows the
depth the sport has developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the growth of the Title IX generation,'' DeLuca
said. ``So the audience interest is no longer novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The other story lines ESPN had were that both Duke and Purdue
had defeated Tennessee, and that the teams shared players who had
played together at Purdue for a year. Nicole Erickson and Michele
VanGorp transferred to Duke from Purdue after their coach was
fired; Ukari Figgs and Stephanie White-McCarty stayed. Both pairs
of players also were roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a soap opera to me.'' said White-McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Meyers, ESPN analyst for women's basketball, admitted before
the Final Four that the network would have a challenge without Tenn

THE MAN BEHIND `THE SIMPSONS' LOOKS AHEAD WITH `FUTURAMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America loves sitcoms, from ``I Love Lucy'' to ``The Many Loves
of Dobie Gillis'' to ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' not to mention
``Joanie Loves Chachi.'' We've loved them for the way they edge our
lives into satire and farce and sheer harmlessness. We've loved
them enough to inspire a glut of some 45 half-hour comedies on TV
schedules every week, not including the episodes in endless
syndication. We've loved them enough to wear them out, and to leave
our TV landscape littered with deadwood like ``Veronica's Closet.''
And so now, 50 years after early sitcoms like ``The Goldbergs,''
it's not surprising to find TV script writers, and TV viewers,
reaching beyond conventional, live-action sitcoms into the creative
possibilities of adult animation. With a roster of prime-time
cartoons like ``King of the Hill,'' ``The PJs,'' ``Family Guy,''
``Dilbert,'' ``South Park,'' and no less than seven forthcoming
series (including an adaptation of Kevin Smith's movie ``Clerks''),
we are on the verge of a full-fledged nighttime toon boom.
</P>
<P>
   It was Matt Groening who made the animation alternative hot 10
years ago with ``The Simpsons,'' which takes the nuclear family and
the nuclear world to new levels of dark hysteria. Now Groening is
joining the wave that he started with another witty series called
``Futurama,'' which premiered Sunday night. It's not quite the
revelation that ``The Simpsons'' was, but ``Futurama'' contains
enough inventiveness and heart to make it a worthy follow-up. Like
``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama'' has a cast of unique characters who
are as lovable and fallible as they are pop-eyed and chinless. And
more than ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama'' goes places only animation
can go, with a colorful and comic vision of the year 3000 that
would tax even a Jim Cameron-size budget and a Fellini-size
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Futurama'' setup has a clueless pizza delivery boy named
Fry caught in a cryogenics chamber for a thousand years, and waking
to a new universe. It's the perfect territory for the cynical
Groening, and he overstuffs his futurescapes with pop allusions and
jokes that upend our own 1999 world. Some are quickie gags, like a
billboard for ``The Implant Hut,'' a J.F.K. Jr. Airport, and a line
adapted from the movie ``Pulp Fiction,'' with a cop saying, ``I'm
gonna get 24th century on his ass.'' And some are sharper-edged,
like the 25-cent ``Suicide Booth,'' Fate Assignment Officers who
insert permanent chips that determine people's careers, and the
ruins of New York City buried underneath a high-tech urban
construct.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere, Fry befriends a heavy-drinking,
robot-porn-loving robot named Bender and a tough, sensible one-eyed
alien named Leela. He also connects with his only living relative,
a great-great-great-etc. nephew named Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Future episodes will have the gang planet-hopping in service of the
professor's intergalactic delivery company. As you might expect
from the man behind ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama'' will also pick
up lots of unusual supporting characters as it develops, including
Dr. Zoidberg, a lobsterlike alien anatomy expert. We can also
expect to see a few familiar faces if the show returns to the head
museum introduced in the premiere. There, the classic heads of
celebrities like Leonard Nimoy, Dennis Rodman, Richard Nixon, and
Matt Groening himself live in jars of water, where they are fed
like fish. Now there's a scene you probably won't find on most
live-action sitcoms.

 NCAA VIEWERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MISSED
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Before we start dissin' CBS for broadcasting the lowest-rated
NCAA championship game in the last 21 years, consider the
following:
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces are dropping bombs in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestling owns Monday night cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Neilsen Media has an absurd way of measuring viewers of sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Quality has little to do with commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   None of these facts are particularly revelatory but help explain
why Monday night's game between Duke and the University of
Connecticut received a 17.2 rating and 27 share in the national
overnight measurement of the 44 largest media markets. Last year's
game between Kentucky and Utah was just three percent higher, but
neither game came close to the 24.1 rating earned by the 1979
Michigan State-Indiana State game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird and Magic was a powerful draw, but the Duke-UConn game was
much better, going down to the last few possessions. Not even Billy
Packer's constant carping on the players' fatigue could undermine
the sheer energy the teams generated in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The game was up and down the entire 40 minutes, and in Boston,
the last 15 minutes attracted an additional 66,000 viewers, the
highest rating period of the game. The overall number in Boston was
a 13.2 and 23 share, making Channel 4 the ratings winner over Peter
Jennings's ``The Century'' on Channel 5 (9.5 and 16 share) and a
Julia Roberts movie, ``Something to Talk About,'' on Channel 7 (7.6
and 12 share).
</P>
<P>
   But no one guaranteed a thrilling final, and oddsmakers had No.
1 Duke a 9-point favorite. So why were the numbers so low?
</P>
<P>
   Blame the supposed Duke juggernaut and the overall lackluster
tournament. Of the 63 games, only one went into overtime, only 14
were decided by 5 points or fewer, and 17 were blowouts of 20
points or more.
</P>
<P>
   We have come to expect buzzer-beaters in the NCAAs. Last year,
20 games were within a 5-point spread, five were settled in
overtime, and only 11 were decided by 20 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   The semifinals were another story. Saturday's doubleheader is
supposed to build interest among casual fans for Monday night's
championship game. It didn't this year, largely because of the
lunatic du jour, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Male viewers turned to cable news channels in record numbers to
watch the bombings. MSNBC, CNBC, Headline News, CNN, and Fox News
attracted record numbers, mostly men. Between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. on
Saturday, male viewers between the ages of 18-49 increased by a
total of 233 percent. The number for men between ages 25 to 54, the
most prized demographic for advertisers, skyrocketed by a
staggering 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the cable universe is smaller than networks, the impact on
the NCAA was noticeable. The Monday night championship game went up
against pro wrestling on USA and TNT. In case anyone is keeping
score, pro wrestling usually provides the top five weekly cable
programs, and eight of the top 12. Each program attracts about 4
million households, mostly young men.
</P>
<P>
   Cable or network, those numbers are significant, especially
considering the Neilsen methodology. Its fact gathering, for
example, doesn't include out-of-home viewers, which doesn't make an
ounce of sense, largely because people tend to watch big-time
sporting events in groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Neilsen had installed a meter in the mobbed gyms at Duke
and UConn _ which it didn't _ the total number would have been two
households. Never mind that at least 10,000 people jammed in to
watch their schools. Ask yourself the following questions: When was
the last time you watched a Super Bowl alone? When was the last
time you watched ``Baywatch'' with a group of friends?
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Jim Nantz said he was disappointed by the numbers, but
still considered it a classic game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so special,'' Nantz said. ``No one ran away with it.
You got the feeling all night that it would go down to the wire. I
wished more people could have seen it. It was something to behold.
It was surreal. There were kids crying for joy and sadness, kids
holding hands, praying. There were genuine feelings, raw emotions
that you just don't see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz is correct. With the exception of Hartford (49.7 rating
and 66 share) and Raleigh (36.2 rating and 49 share), a lot of
people just didn't see it.

MORE JOURNALISTS IN SURVEY AGREE WITH PRESS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JUKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have met the enemy and it is us.
</P>
<P>
   That's the crucial finding in a new survey of 552 journalists
and news executives conducted by The Pew Research Center For the
People &AMP; the Press. A decade ago, for example, only about one-third
of news media professionals cited a lack of credibility with the
public as a major cause of declining news audiences. In the Pew
study released Tuesday, that number rose significantly, to about 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big story is that journalists are beginning to
acknowledge the criticism of the press,'' said Pew Research Center
director Andrew Kohut, who finds ``the convergence of the public's
views of journalism and the journalists' views of journalism'' the
most striking aspect of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   This tough internal critique comes at a time of technological,
financial, and professional turmoil in the news industry. New
technologies _ such as the Internet and cable _ are ascendant,
while newspaper and network television news audiences steadily
erode. Sensational and salacious stories like the O. J. trial and
Lewinsky scandal seem to dominate the information landscape. And an
ever-louder drumbeat of professional media criticism and public
anger resonates in the ears of many journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists are a lot more self-critical of the profession
than they used to be. They are critical of themselves in the same
way the public is critical of them,'' added Tom Rosenstiel,
vice-chairman of the Committee of Concerned Journalists, which
helped fund the study and design the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 70 percent of the print, radio, TV, and Internet
journalists polled by Pew cite the blurring of lines between
reporting and commentary as a valid criticism of their business.
Nearly three-quarters of the newsroom staffers complain that news
outlets are too preoccupied with entertainment. (In that same vein,
solid majorities of those quizzed reject the notion that Geraldo
Rivera, Matt Drudge, and Larry King are fellow journalists.) And
nearly 60 percent of the respondents said national news
organizations gave too much play to the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large majority of news professionals sense a degradation of
the culture of news _ from one that was steeped in verification and
a steadfast respect for the facts toward one that favors argument,
opinion-mongering, haste, and infotainment,'' declared a Committee
of Concerned Journalists analysis of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone greeted the Pew findings as gospel. Chicago Tribune
editor Howard Tyner, admittedly ``not a big fan of Pew,''
acknowledged that ``crediblity is clearly an issue and the public's
perception of the media is colored, at least in part, by
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But he worries about the media's tendency toward
self-flagellation and cautioned that ``I don't think (public
criticism) is grounds for us to be beating our chests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be listening to the public,'' said USA Today
editor David Mazzarella, who nevertheless is more bullish on the
media's performance. ``As for my own personal assessment of the
press, I think it's quite credible,'' he added. ``It just seems
that there's been this crescendo over time, particularly in the
past year, of breastbeating on the part of the presss.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of journalists' discomfort illuminated in the Pew
study is the growing fear about the impact of the bottom line on
the quality of journalism. Roughly 40 percent of the sample views
business and financial pressure as the most important problem
facing the news industry. In the past four years, the percentage of
those who say bottom- line demands have harmed news coverage has
risen from 37 percent to 53 percent among national TV and radio
personnel and from 24 percent to 46 percent among local electronic
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a large majority of newsroom staffers think the
buyouts of news organizations by diversified corporations and the
purchase of local newspapers by large chains are bad for
journalism, a sentiment not as widely shared by their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey also points up some areas of substantial
disconnect between the media and the public. Nearly 90 percent of
the media professionals polled believe press criticism of political
leaders prevents the pols from stepping out of line. Less than 60
percent of the public agrees.
</P>
<P>
   People in the news business say the primary cause of shrinking
news audiences is Americans who are overloaded with information.
But only 28 percent of the public cites that issue as a factor in
how they consume news. At the same time, only about one-third of
those at the national news media and less than half those at local
news outlets believe they ought to pay a great deal of attention to
the public's interests when deciding what to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey does reveal a media culture that seems far
more inclined to acknowledge public attitudes and particularly,
criticism. The larger question, in many minds, is whether this
becomes a catalyst for serious reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than navel gazing,'' said Kohut. ``This is
coming after Lewinsky. I think the press is in a place where it
sees itself under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey means ``that journalists are going to be accepting of
change,'' added Rosenstiel. ``The question is which change are they
going to be accepting.''
</P>
<P>
   One interested observer is Jan Schaffer, executive director of
the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, which oversees a major media
reform movement. The journalists' self-criticism doesn't surprise
her, but ``to have it formally ratified in authoritative studies
adds more heft to the fire,'' she acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But Schaffer is less certain that this dissatisfaction will
translate into meaningful change. ``I still think there is a great
(tendency) in the profession to not do what we say,'' she noted.
``And I don't know why that is.''

A PORTRAIT OF EGYPT 
A Journey Through the World of Militant  Islam 
By Mary Anne Weaver

<P>
   Iran in the '70s was a nation populated by Muslims but led by a
secularist whose power derived, in part, from state repression and
US backing. When fundamentalists led by a charismatic cleric
overthrew the shah, the US government lost an important friend and
gained a committed enemy overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Author Mary Anne Weaver, who has covered the Islamic world for
two decades, says it is about to happen again, this time in Egypt _
recipient of the second-highest amount of US foreign aid and
cornerstone of Middle East stability. Not only is such a
development inevitable, she says, it could carry far greater
consequences because Egypt's Muslims are of the majority Sunni
faith, and the revolution could spread to other parts of the Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the latter contention is less persuasive than the
former, ``A Portrait of Egypt'' is a fascinating and thoughtful
work that will tell Americans, particularly, facts they didn't know
and clarify events they have heard about. The Egypt Weaver
describes suffers a vast divide between wealth and poverty, and has
great numbers of educated young men who can find neither work nor
reasonable expectation for improvement. She says its government has
come to excel at torture and coercion while failing to provide for
basic needs, and Islamic groups that are officially outlawed fill
the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in Weaver's reporting is Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, 61, the blind cleric who is spiritual leader of
Gama'a, the foremost underground group. Americans know him
primarily in connection with the World Trade Center bombing, but he
has breathed the cause since the 1967 war with Israel. Weaver
presents a human picture of this zealot, who was accused in 1981 _
and acquitted _ of instigating President Anwar Sadat's
assassination and played a key role in the holy war to wrest
control of Afghanistan from the Soviets. ``It was one of the best
jihads we've had,'' he's quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   During the Afghan years, the sheik and the CIA consorted in
pursuit of their common aim to defeat the Soviets, though
presently, of course, they are considerably less chummy: Sheik Omar
is serving life in a US prison for seditious conspiracy. But other
elements of the cadres trained _ and armed _ in Afghanistan
continue the fight, a fact most galling to Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver says Mubarak has always been a private man, far less
interested than Sadat in imperial trappings, but he has become as
ruthless in maintaining power. When he was elevated to the
presidency, he spoke of reform, but his critics say he is now
hopelessly isolated. His security forces, perhaps without Mubarak's
full knowledge, now engage in evil tactics against his people, such
as the torture of wives and families to force fugitive men to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense the campaign has succeeded; many of the original
leading militants are in prison or exile. But the brutality has
destroyed the middle ground of Egyptian life and is making Egyptian
youth ever more radical. The assailants in the November 1997
slaughter of 58 tourists in Luxor _ young men from fairly prominent
families who had escaped the worst of Egypt's poverty _ hadn't even
been on the government's radical radar screen. The attack has
greatly damaged the tourist trade, worsening Egypt's economic woes
and further undermining the government.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver writes with convincing clarity, albeit with an annoying
habit of trying way too hard in places: ``One afternoon driving
through the diplomatic enclave, I saw a small man with a large
white kaffiyeh swathing his head shutter the windows of the Saudi
embassy and padlock its doors.'' Which is to say, the embassy
closed. But as she might put it, these are mere irksome grains of
sand against the broad expanse of her reporting. If Egypt does
indeed go the way of Iran, we won't be able to say we weren't
warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cairo: The City Victorious'' is a quirky paean to one of the
world's great crossroads. Max Rodenbeck has excavated myriad
historical tidbits, such as the waqf, which exploited a loophole in
Islamic inheritance law. Individuals couldn't receive bequests, but
they could be hired to administer bequeathed endowments, thereby
allowing control of the assets handed down. The practice led to the
founding of several free hospitals in Cairo in the 13th century,
and a waqf of that period was still feeding stray cats 500 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Rodenbeck tells how Cairenes fleeced the Malian king Mansa Musa
of his gold in the 1320s, provides rich descriptions of the
fabulously lavish court of the sultan Barsbay in the 1420s, and
digs into the region's centuries-old preoccupation with death and
burial tombs. His book is a delightful way to visit the city _ and
these days, one of the safer ones.

THOMAS GEOGHEGAN: ON THE SIDE OF LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The hardest part of being Thomas Geoghegan
may be having to endure the things people say about you.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough being a labor lawyer in an era when management's
not only owner but king. It's that much worse having to squeeze
time from your practice to write two critically acclaimed works of
nonfiction, ``Which Side Are You On?'' (1991) and ``The Secret
Lives of Citizens,'' published last month. But what's hardest of
all _ or at least for someone as relentlessly modest as Geoghegan _
is all the praise you keep getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is in a special class,'' declares a fellow Chicagoan,
author Studs Terkel, who's a client of Geoghegan's firm. ``He's an
American that you dream Americans should be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my idea of a self-made man,'' adds Harvard political
scientist Samuel H. Beer, who taught Geoghegan as an undergraduate.
``More than any man I know, he's made himself who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, the editor of the on-line magazine Slate and a
friend of Geoghegan's since college, says, ``He's extremely nice,
extremely decent, extremely devoted to causes outside himself, and
extremely talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of how Pollyannaish his words sound, Kinsley hastens to
add a qualifier. ``I can say all the obvious things, and they're
all true, but what I'm not capturing is the weirdness of the
combination.'' ``Weirdness'' may be an understatement, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Law school attracts few people with so intensely literary a
sensibility. Kinsley likens Geoghegan (pronounced GAY-gun) to a
novelist, Beer calls him a poet, and next month his first play _ a
romantic comedy, no less, that one Geoghegan friend describes as
``When Harry Met Sally at the Union Hall'' _ opens in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Few Harvard Law School graduates have blue-collar clients. Few
people on the left are practicing Catholics, and even fewer
demonstrate such a penchant for irony.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ed Sadlowski, who has known Geoghegan since 1976, when
he worked in Sadlowski's campaign for the presidency of the United
Steelworkers, comes closest to suggesting how sweeping an arc his
friend traverses. ``He'll be reading Plato one night, then go to a
ballgame with me the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans do need to be philosophical (their team has gone even
longer without winning a World Series than the Red Sox have), but
Platonism is not part of the labor-lawyer stereotype: a beefy guy
with a big voice who chews on a stogie while being driven around in
velour-upholstered comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's true Geoghegan enjoys the occasional cigar, but any
resemblance ends there. He has a lanky runner's frame and a long,
bony face that manages somehow to look both youthful and old
(Geoghegan's 50, but when the light hits him right he could pass
for a Rogaine-ready 35). He doesn't have a lawyer's face _ it's too
open. Neither is it a scholar's face _ it's too sly. Call it a
monsignor's face, one that's equal parts experienced and innocent,
precise and dreamy, of this world and beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   It's an appropriate face, actually, for someone with so divided
a personality. The phrase ``Capra hero'' tends to crop up when
people talk about Geoghegan. And, yes, he's a clean-cut,
still-somewhat-boyish idealist fighting the good fight out in the
heartland. But rather than being the title character in ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Chicago,'' he might more accurately be said to star in
``It's a Wonderful Life (If You Call This Living).'' Geoghegan
isn't Jefferson Smith. He's George Bailey, a man trapped by his own
goodness _ and made immeasurably more interesting by the resultant
tension between his capacity for doing the right thing and his
not-inconsiderable urge to indulge himself just as much as the rest
of us do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This internal struggle helps drive ``Which Side Are You On?,''
which is fitting, insofar as that book is as much memoir as
polemic. The new book is far more polemic, or even meditation, than
memoir, so Geoghegan dwells far less on this in-house debate
between duty and indulgence. That doesn't mean it's gone away,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of being a lawyer,'' he says, but the emphasis
lies on ``idea.'' ``Part of me is tired of doing it. At the moment,
the practice is good. We've got some really interesting cases in
the office. But would I like to chuck it and go to Europe for a
year? Yeah. Does it seem pretty silly to me that I'm doing this
when I don't have a wife and kids and I don't have anybody to put
through college yet I'm still grinding it out? Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-doubt may have its drawbacks from the sufferer's point of
view, but there are few better antidotes to stridency or
self-righteousness. Certainly, Geoghegan exhibits neither failing.
Hard as he can be on Republicans and union busting and the
latter-day failings of US society generally, he is far harder _ not
to mention far funnier _ on himself.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls, for example, the time he was an intern at The New
Republic (this would have been shortly after the Watergate
break-in) and an editor suggested he might want to follow up on the
burglary, even at the expense of more policy-oriented topics.
Geoghegan describes his aghast response. ``You really . . . you
really think, this break-in . . . is more important than revenue
sharing?'' It takes a certain kind of individual, by no means
common, to have said such a thing in 1972. It takes an even rarer
one to tell the story on himself 27 years later.
</P>
<P>
   A constant awareness of the absurd carbonates Geoghegan's
writing. In the new book especially, he portrays political activism
as a kind of sweet, sad comedy, one that's no less serious an
enterprise for being faintly ridiculous. To be sure, the comedy is
often quite dark. ``The Secret Lives of Citizens'' is as explicitly
a lament as it is implicitly an exhortation. The book celebrates a
golden age that grows ever more distant (the New Deal). It mourns a
hero who died too young (Chicago's African-American mayor, Harold
Washington). It decries afflictions so manifold they run the gamut
from the US Senate to resident-only parking (as Geoghegan
demonstrates, each is inherently antidemocratic and inimical to the
civic ideal).

 &HT;    Spring into cleaning with kitchen touch-up
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, Martha Stewart can knock off that spring cleaning list in
no time flat. She has about 87,000 people at her beck and call and,
by golly, they darn well better do what she says.
</P>
<P>
   But for the average person, even with an extra hand or two
pitching in, all that rug beating and house hosing can be a bit
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to get the most out of a precious springtime energy
surge is to direct it at one project where it will do the most
good. But what to choose when so much around a winter-weary house
needs rejuvenation?
</P>
<P>
   Just take a good look under your kitchen sink and you will have
the answer. Alarmed? Don't be.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has dozens of professional kitchen organizers and
experts to take you step by painless step through a process that
will continue to reap benefits throughout the year and well into
the next. You may even enjoy yourself knowing you can do your
household no better favor than get that kitchen straightened out
and humming.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Cheever, a kitchen expert who is a consultant for the
National Kitchen and Bath Association, begins on
www.csz.com/hih/hrr/jul96/orgkitch.html by suggesting that Saturday
afternoon is usually the ideal time for undertaking kitchen
reorganization projects. Then she gets down to business by telling
you to remove everything from the kitchen cabinets and sort it into
three categories, according to where the items are used.
</P>
<P>
   She goes through each category and each item, and by the time
you are done you will probably know more about how your kitchen
works than you did before.
</P>
<P>
   But before you decide to go with that site, check out www
</P>
<P>
   .123sortit.com/RO/, which is called ``Sort It'' and click under
``kitchen.'' Here the experts take an even more supervisory,
step-by-step approach. Do this, do that, then do this. They even
schedule a couple of coffee breaks saying, ``See you in 10
minutes.'' When you finish a task, you get praise, virtual pats on
the back and, all in all, have a pretty good time.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites to help you get it done:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An excellent article on spring cleaning in general plus a good
list of spring cleaning chores is at pages.prodigy.com
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You may want to check out and bookmark ``Organized Home,'' a
monthly webzine at organizedhome.com/ that is chock-full of good
tips on home organizing in general. This month has a pretty good
spring cleaning list of things to do around the house.

<P>
   &QR;  ``The Grand Plan'' for cleaning your house is at
shell.surfsouth.com/(tilde)sdove/theplan.html.

<P>
   When you're done, a great way to celebrate the season and your
brand spanking clean and organized kitchen is to prepare a recipe
from www.macronews.com/siddish.html. The author of an essay urges
us to eat in harmony with the seasons.

EASTER LAMB MAKES A TASTY DAY-AFTER TOPPING FOR LINGUINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Spring is entwined with religious and cultural icons, all
symbols of new life. Eggs and tulips play a part in this rebirth,
and so does lamb.
</P>
<P>
   In Christian iconography, lamb had a religious significance on
the table, but the meat had a practical aspect as well. Newborn
lambs were available at the end of the long Lenten fast. That they
became the centerpiece of the Easter table was, if nothing else,
logical.
</P>
<P>
   Today, families aren't sustained by their own land, and spring
lambs are hardly available. Yet the tradition persists. We eat lamb
(and very good lamb at that) raised in Colorado and Texas. Though
it may be labeled ``spring,'' it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to hang the label on everything _ even if it's eight
months old,'' says John Dewar of John Dewar &AMP; Co., a wholesale and
retail butcher. Genuine spring lamb, he says, is a month or two
old, and the whole lamb can weigh less than 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   So the leg of lamb on the Easter table is probably not genuine
spring and certainly didn't graze outside your farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that today's legs of lamb are bigger than those of
genuine spring lambs (American lamb legs weigh from 7 to 10 pounds)
means leftover roast lamb. Cold lamb sandwiches with French
mustard, diced lamb under a bed of mashed potatoes in a mock
shepherd's pie, or lamb tossed with pasta. Paul Sussman, chef of
Daddy-O's restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., adds Swiss chard to the
linguine, along with lentils and the diced lamb. The idea came from
an old James Beard book in which Beard combined lentils in a soup
with Swiss chard and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow chard he gets now has stems that are yellow, orange,
and red, and unless they're quite tough, he chops them along with
the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman's roast lamb sits overnight in a Mediterranean marinade,
made from lemon juice, olive oil, white wine, garlic, and marjoram.
``The leg is pretty tender to begin with,'' he says. ``I have my
doubts whether marinating tenderizes the meat.''
</P>
<P>
   He does it for the flavor. ``The flavors penetrate. When it
roasts up, particularly with the olive oil in the marinade, you get
a crisper crust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman can't serve the leg whole in his restaurant, but he does
use the same marinade for pieces of lamb served shish kebab style.
</P>
<P>
   The leg isn't harmed by the second cooking, because he pulls it
from the oven when it's medium-rare. That way, he says, if the
potatoes and the rest of the dinner aren't quite ready, the lamb
can sit on the stove and wait for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long, though. Lenten rules might not be as strict as
they once were, so guests aren't as desperate for a succulent
roast. Still, the smell of the leg of lamb is incredibly inviting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL; 
PAUL SUSSMAN'S MARINATED ROAST LEG OF LAMB WITH NEW POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   For the lamb:
</P>
<P>
   1 7- to 10-pound leg of lamb
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 cloves garlic, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fresh marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the potatoes:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds new potatoes (about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Trim the lamb of excess fat. In a roasting pan that will hold
the lamb snugly, combine the oil, wine, lemon zest and juice,
onion, garlic, and marjoram. Add the lamb and turn it over in the
liquid to moisten the surface of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and
as long as overnight, turning the lamb several times.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 2 hours before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the lamb from the marinade, and sprinkle it with salt and
pepper. Set the lamb on a rack inside a roasting pan and transfer
it to the oven. Roast the lamb, basting it with the marinade, for 1
1/4 hours or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest
part of the lamb registers 135 degrees, for medium-rare lamb (let
the leg cook 10 minutes longer for pink meat).
</P>
<P>
   When the lamb has been cooking for 15 minutes, roast the
potatoes. Without peeling them, cut them into eighths. In a bowl,
toss them with oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them on a rimmed
baking sheet, skin side down. Roast them for 1 hour or until they
are crisp on the outside and tender inside.
</P>
<P>
   Carve the lamb into slices and arrange it on a platter with the
roasted potatoes. Serve at once with hearty greens tossed with
walnuts and black-currant vinaigrette (below). Serves 4.

TEEN `TAMING' OFFERS AT LEAST 10 THINGS TO LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU 
Directed by: Gil Junger 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' Shakespeare meets the
teensploitation movie. But hold the groans. This rejiggering of
``The Taming of the Shrew'' for the high school set is a bright,
charming, refreshing surprise. Smartly written, lofted into orbit
by a heads-up ensemble performance, it's bursting with new talent
on both sides of the camera. The memories of high school sexual and
other politics are recent enough to the scriptwriting team of Karen
McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith for the duo to have nailed them
perfectly, while infusing the situation with believable romance and
even the odd tidbit of Shakespeare. It's a great mix and will
surely make ``10 Things'' the Easter holiday date movie of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most remarkable of all is that they have found ways to
get around the fact that Petruchio's grinding down of the spirited
Kat, with all the weight of a patriarchal society behind him, is
such a minefield as to be virtually unplayable. Julia Stiles's Kat
is no shrew. Her declaration of independence is invigorating and
sounds more Shavian than Shakespearean. It's just that her
hard-line feminism makes her a little tough to take. The film's
Petruchio doesn't muscle her into submission, but wins her with
sensitivity and imaginative wooing. The script genuflects to
Shakespeare in its choice of the male lead's name, Patrick Verona.
And, perhaps, you won't be surprised to hear that the Seattle-area
high school they attend is called Padua.
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger's romantic lead is a guy who's a little older than
the other students, a little cooler, with a mysterious past and a
sullen outlaw appeal. The script wisely never has him attempt to
overpower Kat in any way. Ledger's Verona suggests Patrick Swayze
with an Aussie accent, although he rises to a Gene Kelly moment in
his most charming scene. He woos Kat in public by dancing up and
down the concrete risers in a football stadium, beaming smiles at
her while dodging security. Stiles's Kat, meanwhile, has the
wittiest lines in the witty script, leaving no doubt of her
rapierlike intelligence, nor of the fact that her ferocious
exterior is also a defense for a softer Kat beneath _ just as
Patrick's cool-guy moves mask his gentler side.
</P>
<P>
   The teen romance stuff doesn't go anywhere surprising; rather,
it's the fullness and deftness with which it travels that makes for
such a satisfying hour and a half. The characters are better drawn
than in most films, teen or so-called adult. Larisa Oleynik's
Bianca, forbidden to begin dating until Kat does, not only sets the
plot mechanics in motion, but emerges more appealingly than in most
conventional Shakespearean productions, which settle for painting
Bianca as a bit of a twit. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who suggests a
young Timothy Hutton, brings charm and savvy to the role of the guy
who falls for Bianca and pushes along the Let's-get-Kat-a-date
project. David Krumholtz, as his comic sidekick, is another big
plus, and so is Susan May Pratt, as the cute girl he has his eye on
and chases, with an assist by Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is advanced in that it refuses to make a fool or dummy
of the only parent in the film, Larry Miller's single father of Kat
and Bianca. He has his comic moments, but on the whole is drawn
with a tenderness and humanity that Shakespeare never gave his
equivalent in the play. What this film shares with Shakespeare is a
drive toward reconciliation; this is a film that likes its
characters. It's humane as well as clever. This is probably the
time to praise director Gil Junger, making his film debut after a
career in TV. When as many of the performances work as well as they
do here, he must have had something to do with it. ``10 Things I
Hate About You'' is a serendipitous convergence of romance and wit.
Even the high school, a huge red brick faux chateau high on a
hilltop overlooking Puget Sound, takes on a star aura. I loved ``10
Things I Hate About You.''

 &HT;    It's the American way: Our involvement in Kosovo has to do with
who we think we are
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The explanation for U.S. involvement in Kosovo _ and for its
apparent failure to date _ does not really lie in lofty talk of
strategy, diplomacy or geopolitics. It lies in the creation myths
that help bind a nation together.
</P>
<P>
   The American creation myth revolves around our war against King
George, around Valley Forge and the Declaration of Independence. It
is an inspirational tale of democracy in triumph over tyranny, of
the United States as an international beacon of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian creation myth is ancient by comparison, dating to
1389. That year, the Christian Serb army was routed at a place
called Kosovo by an Islamic army, and the loss condemned the Serbs
to centuries of humiliating foreign occupation. Through those dark
centuries, the Serbs celebrated their own stubbornness and capacity
for suffering by retelling the tale of Kosovo in song and poetry,
nurturing their sense of aggrieved nationhood through story.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, is the clash between those two national myths,
American and Serb, one optimistic and humane, the other dark and
defensive. And the medium that brought them into conflict has been
a storyteller of a different sort: television.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Serbs have used terror and brutality in a
campaign to wipe ethnic Albanians, most of them Muslim, from
Kosovo. Scenes of Serb atrocities, broadcast on American
television, have had a predictable effect on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans like to think of ourselves as a humane and giving
people, too decent to stand by and let a bully brutalize a
powerless victim. In addition, U.S. military technology deludes us
into thinking that the dirty work of war can be done from a
sanitary, impersonal distance, with cruise missiles fired from
hundreds of miles away and bombs dropped at night from invisible
planes thousands of feet high.
</P>
<P>
   That illusion creates a startling dichotomy. Last weekend, TV
news was dominated by reports that a single American plane had been
downed. Hundreds of personnel and billions of dollars' worth of
equipment were mobilized to rescue the pilot, and broadcasters
pondered what impact the event might have on U.S. policy,
particularly if the pilot had died or was captured.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Serbia was stark. Each night, Serb parents
huddle in bomb shelters wondering whether they and their children
would survive the night's bombing. And each morning, they emerge
more supportive of the war than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we may have air power, but the Serbs have
commitment. And commitment might well prove more powerful. In fact,
with thousands of Albanians fleeing Kosovo each hour, our tepid
attempt to validate our national myth may turn out to be a disaster
even for those in whose defense we have acted.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bad situation, and it has become all too familiar. We
are captives of a new dynamic: Our humanitarian instincts are
easily provoked by a worldwide communication system that operates
as both a nagging conscience and an international 911 line. And our
status as the world's only superpower makes it temptingly easy to
act, flying off like an international Superman to right injustice
and protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   That combination has driven us to action in Somalia, Haiti,
Bosnia and other hot spots. The only way to avoid future such
entanglements would be to ignore all pleas for U.S. intervention,
even in cases involving mass killings. But that option isn't open
to us, not if we're the nation we believe ourselves to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, critics of our policy toward Kosovo may be correct:
It may not work. It's a hard fact of life that sometimes you do the
right thing, and you fail anyway. If so _ if the Serbs choose to
absorb the NATO bombing as part of the price they have to pay for
taking Kosovo _ do we take the next step and commit ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   That decision will be debated in high-flown terms of strategy,
its impact on our relations with Russia, and other concerns. While
important, those issues will not decide the matter. Instead, the
decision will probably be driven by another central aspect of our
national character:
</P>
<P>
   We don't like to lose.

WOLF ON THE PROWL: J. GEILS BAND REUNITES FOR TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We want to create a celebration of what we accomplished. I
feel excited that we can go out and do it again,'' Peter Wolf said
Tuesday, discussing the J. Geils Band reunion tour that is finally
on after years of maybes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this progresses further than the tour, hopefully it can
lead to more great Geils music,'' said Wolf, referring to the
tour's confirmed kickoff at the Tweeter Center for the Performing
Arts June 23 and 24. (Tickets go on sale Saturday at noon through
Ticketmaster.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little surreal, but exciting. I'm as anxious as the
next person to see how it all pans out,'' said Geils keyboardist
Seth Justman, noting that it's been 16 years since the group last
performed. ``They said it couldn't be done,'' he said of the
reunion, which is being pulled together with help from John Baruck,
REO Speedwagon's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now? I'd answer it by saying why not now?'' Wolf said of
the reconnection with Justman, guitarist J. Geils, harpist Magic
Dick, and bassist Danny Klein. (Drummer Stephen Jo Bladd has
declined to tour.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been wanting this for a long time. I still get
e-mails about what the Geils band meant to people,'' said Wolf, who
said the group will dig out such radio classics as ``Freeze
Frame,'' ``Centerfold,'' ``Love Stinks,'' and ``Detroit
Breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to keep its top ticket price at $39.50, a
bargain for today's rock reunions. ``We tried hard to keep the
ticket prices down,'' said Wolf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, there is laughter in the book, and not a little of it,
for Geoghegan recognizes the silliness intrinsic to so much of what
citizenship entails (attend planning board meetings? gather
signatures? vote?). More important, he has written a book that,
superficial appearances to the contrary, is profoundly affirming _
an affirmation of the greatness of so much of this country's past
in this century, an affirmation of that past's relevance to its
possible greatness in the next _ and few mundane acts are as
inherently affirming as laughter. ``Pursuing the Promise of
American Life'' is the subtitle of ``The Secret Lives of
Citizens.'' Its author, a great admirer of the Czech novelist Milan
Kundera, could just as easily have paraphrased a Kundera title and
used ``The Book of Laughter and Remembering.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Geoghegan grew up in inauspicious surroundings for a celebrant
of the New Deal. Not only is Cincinnati the home of Robert Taft,
cosponsor of the labor movement's greatest bane, the Taft-Hartley
Act, it's the largest US city Franklin Roosevelt never carried.
``It was like being a French Huguenot to be a Democrat in
Cincinnati,'' Geoghegan says. ``It was a foretaste of the America
to come, and I didn't like it. So I went east.''
</P>
<P>
   He means Harvard, which he remembers as an immersion in
17th-century English history and literature (``I almost became a
Calvinist,'' he says, perhaps not altogether facetiously). What he
calls ``my claim to fame'' as an undergraduate was serving as
deputy to future New York Times op-ed columnist Frank Rich when
Rich ran The Harvard Crimson editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did one truly bad thing,'' Geoghegan confesses. ``One
week when I was in charge, an invitation came to a cocktail party
because they were going to shoot a movie called `Love Story' here
in Cambridge. I was thinking, `Oh, that's a good thing for Frank to
go to,' when a voice inside me said, `Don't put it in Frank's box.'
So I got drunk with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. It was a very
strange evening.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1971, Geoghagen had his New Republic stint.
Then came law school, with time aside for another tour at The New
Republic. He worked for the United Mine Workers in Washington,
D.C., and then the Sadlowski campaign in Chicago. He served in the
Department of Energy in the Carter administration. During those
days of malaise and moral equivalents of war, DOE was the grim
ground zero of Carterism (if such a thing there was), and after two
years of it Geoghegan was ready to get away as far and fast as he
could. New York? Boston? The West Coast? ``I thought, `If you're
going to be an American, you've got to do it all the way,' '' so he
returned to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He joined a law firm headed by Leon Despres, a reform alderman
and local legend who today, at 91, is, as Geoghegan happily
declares, ``not even semi-retired, thank God'' (``Secret Lives'' is
dedicated to Despres). There's one other lawyer besides the two of
them, and ``nobody screens the calls,'' Geoghegan sighs, ``because
that's part of the office's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simultaneously do this big-case stuff and also have this .
. . friends-and-neighbors sort of practice. You can do one or the
other, but trying to do both is maddening, and I have been trying
to do both over the years. So there's a lot of people who call up
for small legal problems. Then other people who are calling up,
`I'd like to bring a $25 million class action.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's one case Geoghegan pursued that people still talk about
_ with characteristic self-deprecation, he notes that it did put
the back of his head, if not his face, on Page 1 of the Chicago
Tribune _ an epic, seven-year battle to get 2,500 former
steelworkers the pension benefits they lost when International
Harvester pulled an extremely slick deal to divest itself of
Wisconsin Steel, where the men worked. In the end, Geoghegan got
his clients a $14.8 million settlement. He still regrets having
gotten them so little. Others marvel that he got them anything at
all. ``People wanted to abandon it,'' Sadlowski says, ``but Tom was
like a tenacious dog.''
</P>
<P>
   That tenacity points to what may be the weirdest element in the
Geoghegan combination: how such a true believer has never lost
himself in the abstractions of ideology, never given up his faith
in doing _ or at least trying. ``I'm emphatic about how important
it is to try,'' he says. ``That is the overwheming message of the
new book . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just enough to try in the romantic sense _ you know,
just noble tries. I'm half German, on my mother's side, and half
Irish, on my father's side. I think there is an element of the
German romantic that says how important it is to try, but there is
an element of the Irish politician that also says how important it
is to win. The noble gesture isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a case with a lawyer once. We were in it halfway
through, and he said to me, `You know, when we started this I
thought you had in mind just taking a principled stand on
something. But I'm beginning to realize, to my horror, you're
trying to win this!' It was the nicest thing anybody ever said to
me.''

WAR INTENSIFIES, BUT TARGETS ARE SMALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As tales of violence in Kosovo increase each day,
so, too, do promises by NATO officials to ``intensify military
efforts.'' But with few hard statistics or details of each day's
attacks, military analysts are left to wonder: Is NATO keeping its
word?
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence it is. In addition to some 400 NATO warplanes
positioned to attack Yugoslavia since last Wednesday, the United
States this week announced it was sending over a new batch of
fighters, including five Air Force B-1 bombers and five EA-6B Navy
aircraft, known as Prowlers, which are radar-jamming planes
designed to confuse enemy antiaircraft systems.
</P>
<P>
   Ten refueling tankers are also on their way, Pentagon officials
said. Airstrikes, which at first took place only during the night,
are now being delivered around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   And the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which left its
dock on the East Coast on Friday, is expected to arrive in the
Mediterranean Sea in a matter of days. Although the Roosevelt is
scheduled to continue on to the Persian Gulf for a six-month
rotation, several outside analysts and officials said the carrier,
equipped with some 75 warplanes, would probably make a stop in the
Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clear indications that things are being stepped
up,'' said retired Colonel Joseph J. Collins, a senior fellow in
political military studies at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. ``It's also clear, obviously,
that although we've done a lot,'' Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic ``has not yet reached his threshold. So stepping up our
activities clearly makes some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The most convincing evidence may be the NATO target maps
themselves, according to defense analyst John Pike of the
Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the airstrikes, the maps showed NATO
warplanes mostly hitting previously known targets: airfields,
production plants, and manufacturing centers. The maps also
indicated sites where ethnic cleansing was taking place, mostly in
southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, however, the previous ethnic-cleansing sites had
become NATO target sites _ a clear sign that allied forces were
zeroing on Serbian ground troops, Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are clearly intensifying their efforts in several
respects,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also suspicions that NATO's military actions might
not be escalating as quickly as its rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they believed the overriding fear of a US
pilot getting shot down is still driving the strategic planning,
citing as evidence the fact that the A-10 ground-attack planes have
not yet been used.
</P>
<P>
   The A-10, referred to as ``the Warthog'' and the ``flying
bathtub'' for its sturdiness and slow speed, has in recent days
been described as one of NATO's best assets in fighting small
groups of Serbian troops who are reportedly carrying out appalling
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Heavily armored, the A-10 is
equipped with both a low-altitude cannon and air-to-ground
missiles, and it flies low enough to target specific clusters of
troops.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also highly susceptible to being spotted by enemy
radar, analysts and officials said. And although Pentagon officials
have largely blamed the weather for not using the A-10, others
expressed concern that the pace is not picking up quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are intensifying, but not as quickly as I would
have advocated,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
``But they are faced with a significant problem. And that is, you
cannot risk the loss of one American pilot. They are faced with the
problem of making sure they don't lose pilots or aircraft, and at
the same time, making sure that they inflict the maximum damage.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, placed
some of the blame on NATO allies other than the United States,
saying he had been informed that US plans to attack a building that
housed the Yugoslav defense ministry had been vetoed by other NATO
nations.
</P>
<P>
   But another member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack
Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, was less critical of NATO for
executing what he called a ``very methodical plan,'' though he
acknowleged that it had only ``been disclosed in general terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that they want to be careful about this,'' said
Reed. ``They are very concerned about the safety of the pilots
flying these missions. They don't want to rush into it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven days into NATO's bombing campaign over
Yugoslavia, a question nearly as old as this century crops up once
again: Can you win a war, impose order, do much of anything, with
air power alone?
</P>
<P>
   If history provides clues, the answer seems to be: No, not
really _ unless you use atomic weapons (as at the end of World War
II) or unless the bombing is coordinated with soldiers fighting on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched its present campaign with the idea of forcing
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his aggression
against the Albanians in Kosovo, and shocking him back to the peace
table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Robert Pape, professor of national-security studies at
Dartmouth College and author of the book ``Bombing to Win: Air
Power and Coercion in War,'' said in a telephone interview Tuesday,
``Bombing has never won a war or changed a state's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape examined every air campaign in history _ from German
Zeppelin raids in 1914 to the US airstrikes over Iraq in 1991, with
World War II, Vietnam, and other conflicts in between _ and
concluded, ``Air power alone has never produced decisive effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Posen, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's security studies program, agreed: ``Officials use
bombing to try to affect the adversary's will or to punish him, but
most of these strategies don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most successful air campaign of recent times, the
1991 US air war against Iraq, had its limits. The setting was ideal
for bombing. The Iraqis had buried their tanks in shallow shelters
in the sand, turning their entire army into a fixed target. The
desert landscape was flat and defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after a month of fierce bombing, a vast army of ground
troops was needed to push Saddam Hussein's warriors out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The brief air campaign against Iraq last December, designed to
punish Saddam Hussein for keeping United Nations inspectors away
from suspected weapons sites, seems to have had little effect
beyond hardening his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is the classic case of an air war that officials thought
at first would be easy, but quickly turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy's chief military adviser, General
Maxwell Taylor, confidently wrote in a memo of November 1961,
``Nothing is more calculated to sober the enemy . . . than the
knowledge that the United States has prepared itself soundly to
deal with aggresssion in Southeast Asia at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bombing started in full force in 1964, President Lyndon
B. Johnson's national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, wrote in a
memo, ``The theory of this plan is that we should strike to hurt
but not to destroy, and strike for the purpose of changing the
North Vietnamese decision on intervention in the south,'' a theory
strikingly similar to President Clinton's current thinking behind
the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the CIA reported, ``If anything, the strikes to
date have hardened'' North Vietnam's attitude, but then urged, ``We
must hit them harder, more frequently, and inflict greater
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice was followed _ but, it seemed, 10 years and 59,000
American fatalities later, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, according to Pierre M. Sprey, a military
historian and former Pentagon official, ``Bombing has lengthened a
conflict. It causes the people being bombed to hate you _ a lot _
no matter what you claim your intentions are.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, during the ``pauses'' in the B-52 bombing campaigns,
the North Vietnamese had trouble getting people to repair roads and
bridges. However, once the bombing started again, volunteers
rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, during World War II, before the Germans bombed London
and Coventry, British officials were worried about production rates
in local factories. The bombing galvanized the population, boosted
morale, and production soared.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies after the war showed the same thing had happened
in Germany. The Allies' intense bombing of Berlin and other cities
strengthened civilian support and industrial production for the
Nazi war machine.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, too, General Curtis LeMay's fire-bombing raids, which
destroyed whole towns, did little to dampen loyalty to the emperor
or determination to fight on. It took two atomic bombs, with their
unimaginable power, to do that, and nobody is talking about using
nuclear weapons against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the longtime US envoy on Yugoslav crises, has
argued that the NATO airstrikes in September 1995 directly
compelled the Serbs to sign the Dayton Accord, which fostered peace
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pape said these airstrikes were preceded by a joint
Croatian and Muslim ground offensive that drove a half-million
Serbs out of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air power was just the icing on the cake,'' Pape said. The
strikes prevented the Serbs from providing reinforcements. As a
result, had the Muslim and Croat troops kept advancing, the
retreating Serbs could not have stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Pape argues that, in general, airstrikes have decisive effects
only when combined in this way with ground troops. ``Pressure from
ground forces acts like an anvil,'' Pape said, ``forcing the
opponents to concentrate. Once they're concentrated, they're easier
to find, and easier to kill in large numbers, from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In the struggle for Kosovo, NATO commanders have at their
disposal the A-10 attack plane, whose lethal 30-mm antiarmor
munitions destroyed more tanks than any other type of plane in the
1991 war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   However, as long as Milosevic's troops can remain dispersed or
hidden, each A-10 sortie, no matter how well-executed, will have
very limited effects.

THE SECOND COMING OF `STAR WARS'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed how the frenzy attending the release of the new
``Star Wars'' movie resembles Parousiamania? Yes, I thought you
had.
</P>
<P>
   Parousiamania, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is
the ``excitement or frenzy aroused by the thought of the Parousia''
_ a New Testament Greek word referring to the ``arrival,'' or
Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Believing Christians live in
anticipation of this moment, the time of the Last Judgment and the
establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible isn't clear on the timing of the Second Coming. As a
result, believers occasionally experience manic fits of
anticipation, especially in the months and years preceding a
millennium. How very odd that George Lucas has chosen the last
Easter Week of the millennium to dial up the promotional hype for
his new ``Star Wars'' episode, ``The Phantom Menace.'' Coincidence?
Or something more . . .
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, this analogy falls flat. Two thousand American
movie theaters have fixed the date for the arrival of ``The Phantom
Menace'' _ Wednesday, May 19. But in other ways, it holds up quite
well. Earlier this week, for instance, Lucas &AMP; Co. announced that
they wouldn't sell any advance tickets to avoid setting off a
bidding mania among crazed fans. So the loons who run the web site
http://starwars.
</P>
<P>
   countingdown.com started lining up Tuesday at Mann's Chinese in
Hollywood to buy ``Menace'' tickets!
</P>
<P>
   In addition, we have:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradual revelation: The unveiling of the two ``Star Wars''
trailers, one in November and one earlier this month, have
attracted more attention than most movies released during the same
period. The offical web site, http://starwars.com registered 3.5
million video downloads of the trailer during five days this month,
probably an Internet record.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved houses of worship: In a lengthy pronunciamento, 20th
Century Fox bossman Tom Sherak has declared that only certain,
specially qualified theaters will be allowed to show Lucas's
precious work: ``The film will play all digital formats, Dolby
Digital, DTS, and SDDS. If a theater is in a market that has
digital theaters but does not have digital sound, it will not play
in that theater.''
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking through the prophets: The New York Times dispatched
once-respected journalist Orville Schell to the Lucaslair, whence
he returned with the news that Lucas really, really loves his
children. In hot pursuit, CBS's Leslie Stahl gave Lucas 30 minutes
of prime airtime to reiterate his startling declaration of
unconditional love for his children.
</P>
<P>
   --Relics for sale: ``All four new `Star Wars' glass Christmas
ornaments are rendered with the old world craftmanship that has
made the Christopher Radko name world famous with collectors.
Crafted exactly as ornaments were a century ago, each unique piece
is individually mouth blown, silvered and hand painted, and
requires an entire week to create. Get ready to decorate your `Star
Wars' Christmas tree.'' Available for pre-order from the web site
at $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   --Canon Formation: Since 1994, Lucas's spokeswoman, Lynne Hale,
has been filming the making of ``The Phantom Menace.'' Working with
three recent graduates of Stanford University's film school, she
has shot more than 600 hours of must-see video, which can be
sampled at the web site.
</P>
<P>
   If you've read this far, you might find the ``Star Wars'' /
Parousia analogy stretched, or even offensive. Let me refer you to
the bible of ``Star Wars'' studies, Entertainment Weekly. EW
reports that in 1977, with the popularity of the ``Star Wars''
story rivaling that of you-know-who, director Francis Ford Coppola
``seriously proposed that Lucas start a religion, using the murkily
defined tenets of `the Force' as a central holy text.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Francis's thing,'' Lucas told EW. ``I remember him
saying, `You know, you've got a certain amount of power in
politics. But religion! With religion, you really have power.' I
told him, `Forget it. I don't have any interest in power.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Are you reading this in the morning? Only 48 days and about 3
hours until the first showing!

AUTHORITIES SOFTEN TONE IN CHILD INTERVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ A woman sits at a child-sized table in a
sparse room facing a young girl. They color, and talk casually
about dolls, starting kindergarten, and a favorite swing that goes
high enough to touch the trees.
</P>
<P>
   It could be preschool, except for what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know why you came to talk to me?'' asks Stephanie
Brant, looking down as they both color.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Daddy,'' the 5-year-old answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did something happen with Daddy?'' Brant asks evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Brant's voice is as gentle as a summer breeze. It betrays
nothing except, perhaps, mild curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Brant is a forensic child interviewer for the Middlesex District
Attorney's Child Unit, and she is engaging in one of the most
ethically _ and legally _ challenging conversations in modern life.
</P>
<P>
   She is talking to a little girl about her relationship with her
father, who is suspected of abusing her. She is trying to obtain an
accurate rendering of the facts, without coaching or encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering behind every word is the ghost of the Fells Acres case,
the child sex-abuse prosecution generated by this very DA's office,
which has spawned a decade of appeals and allegations that the
procedures used to interview the child witnesses were flawed, that
the interviewers planted false scenarios of abuse in the minds of
children.
</P>
<P>
   While defending the overall fairness of the Fells Acres case,
Middlesex prosecutors acknowledged last year, for the first time,
that the techniques used to interview children from the Malden day
care center run by the Amirault family were improperly suggestive.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new DA, Martha Coakley, who once headed the Child Unit,
is implementing procedures to correct any bias. Last week, she
invited observers, including Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, to see
a videotape of Brant using the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (unit) opened in July 1989 somewhat in response to Fells
Acres,'' Coakley said. ``There was a need to respond to concerns
about how we interviewed. Obviously, the interviewing was not
perfect and we have learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The new methods, developed by child abuse specialists and
prosecutors, eschew many of the tactics widely used in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say those older approaches, which sometimes leave the
children in tears, don't work. In one instance cited even by
prosecutors as overly manipulative, interviewers used peer pressure
to extract information: One child from Fells Acres was told by an
interviewer that her playmate had already said she had been
molested.
</P>
<P>
   Now, interviewers no longer ask ``why'' questions, or react to
anything the child says, or make the child feel he or she is in
trouble or not being helpful. They no longer ask leading questions.
</P>
<P>
   And except for clarifying the many terms children use to
describe their body parts, interviewers now rarely use anatomically
correct dolls. Recent research has found that the dolls can lead
children to act out encounters that might be misunderstood by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Brant is one of four full-time forensic child interviewers at
the Middlesex DA's Child Unit. They handle 800 cases a year, 200 of
which are prosecuted, a typical rate nationwide. Similar units work
with children at almost every district attorney's office in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Brant explains that she pays attention to every detail, no
matter how embarrassing or disturbing, and does not necessarily
assume a child is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, kids are upset and crying, but part of being
objective is maintaining a neutral stance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike in earlier cases, Brant's interviews are videotaped
through a one-way mirror, a move that allows defense lawyers and
others to scrutinize cases for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a record now of what you are doing. We don't just
rely now on handwritten notes that described an interview as
`friendly,' '' said Maggie Bruck, a psychology professor at Johns
Hopkins University, who was a defense witness at a recent Fells
Acres appeal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some defense lawyers remain skeptical that the revisions
have scrubbed all suggestiveness from the interviews. And they
object to the idea that interviewers such as Brant should be
full-time employees of the prosecution team, paid to help build
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying that everyone working with (district
attorneys) is trying to obscure the truth,'' said James Sultan, who
represents Cheryl Amirault Lefave, one of the three Fells Acres
defendants. ``But there is the tendency on the part of someone
working with the DA to have a pro-prosecution bias.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brant and other interviewers insist that they seek only the
truth, to be neutral, objective and unemotional as they elicit
facts from children whose trust and power have been stripped from
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual abuse is the most common crime against children, and the
toughest to uncover, they said. That 90 percent of accused sex
abusers are the child's father, stepfather, uncle, mother's
boyfriend, or other man close to the family makes the interviewer's
role even more pivotal: Interviewers must often dip and dive around
a confused child's efforts to protect someone he or she loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases where the perpetrator is a stranger, it is easier for
the child to talk about it _ there is no guilt of responsibility
associated with it,'' Brant said. ``When it is someone loved by the
child, trusted . . . you can see the child's need to protect a
parent or someone they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the lack of medical and other evidence in about 75
percent of the cases, say specialists, which gives them a
frustrating he-said-she-said quality that is often impossible to
prove either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much emphasis on the interview itself, and that
is in part because law enforcement does not do a good enough job of
gathering collateral evidence to support or refute a child's
allegations,'' said Brian Holmgren, senior attorney for the
National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers are left to sift through conversations, getting
children, some as young as 2, to reveal painful thoughts and
memories.
</P>
<P>
   When, during her videotaped interview, Brant asks the little
girl what happened with Daddy, the girl responds slowly, elliptical
at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. But I think I forget,'' the little girl says, still
looking down at her picture. ``I just have to think about it. Maybe
if I am drawing, I can talk to you about Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, what tumbles out with disconcerting calm over two meetings
with Brant is a tale of Daddy making the then-4- year-old perform
oral sex on him and threatening to kill Mommy if their secret ever
emerges. Now, she says, she has moved and can't see her Daddy
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier not to believe this is happening,'' said Brant,
who is expecting her first child next fall. ``This doesn't just
happen to other people's kids. It is prevalent.''

AT TEXAS SCHOOL, BORDER BARRIERS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Herman Aguirre's day begins badly whenever he
dresses like an American college student _ in jeans and backward
baseball cap, a day's growth of beard on his chiseled chin.
</P>
<P>
   As he crosses the toll bridge over the Rio Grande that links his
hometown of Juarez, Mexico, and his destination, El Paso, customs
officials pull him out of line, pepper him with questions, and look
through his backpack for contraband.
</P>
<P>
   They find only advanced computing textbooks, a snack, and other
telltale signs that Aguirre, the officials' prejudgment
notwithstanding, is just what he appears to be: an American college
student, even if not an American.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Aguirre is part of an unusual daily migration in
which several thousand Mexican citizens cross the border not for
low-paying jobs but to attend Texas public universities. Making it
even more unusual is the fact that Texas law allows all but the
richest among them to pay the same tuition as Texas residents _
more than $2,500 less per semester than nonresident rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less than one-third as much money as it would be if they
charged me like an out-of-state student. I could never afford
that,'' said Aguirre, a computer information systems major who
expects to graduate in May 2000 from the University of Texas at El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Several Texas universities participate, but nowhere is the
program more popular than at UTEP, mainly because the sister cities
of Juarez, with 1.3 million people, and El Paso, with 700,000,
constitute what may be the world's largest cross-border community.
</P>
<P>
   The program took effect in 1988, at a time of declining
enrollment. Since then, the number of Mexican students has climbed
steadily. Mexicans now make up nearly 10 percent of UTEP's 14,600
students, the largest concentration of Mexican students of any US
college, school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate beneficiaries are Mexican students such as
Aguirre and his girlfriend, Gabriela Carrera, a marketing
management major who joins him every morning on the 90-minute trek
from their homes to the school, which is close enough to the border
to be visible from the toll bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It is a journey of long walks, interrupted by several bus rides
and the unavoidable check of their student visas. Along the way on
the Juarez side, they pass graffiti-splashed buildings, old women
and young girls selling candy from makeshift stands, and a
seemingly endless stream of taverns. Once over the border in El
Paso, they move through well-swept streets and a well-tended
business district before reaching the UTEP campus.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond helping individual students, the program underscores the
growing interdependence not just of Juarez and El Paso, but of
communities all along the 2,100-mile dividing line between the
United States and its second-biggest trading partner. In the 5 1/2
years since passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
Juarez has boomed while El Paso, losing jobs to factories over the
border, has wilted.
</P>
<P>
   But both have learned how much they depend on each other, and
about the values that these neighbors share, despite divisions of
wealth and culture _ not to mention barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing NAFTA does is to emphasize the importance of
post-secondary education. It also emphasizes the importance of
bilingual communication skills. Those two factors make a university
education from the United States more attractive,'' said Tom
Fullerton, an assistant professor of economics at UTEP who has
studied the border economy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the program's success _ and its strong support from
Republican Governor George W. Bush and a sometimes xenophobic Texas
Legislature _ cuts dramatically against the common, and not
unfounded, image of the border as a zone of endless skirmishes
between agents and illegals. Further, it flies in the face of ugly
caricatures of undereducated Mexicans crossing the border in
pursuit of welfare benefits, drug deals, or other undesirable
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how the border can serve as a barrier to
communication,'' said UTEP president Diane Natalicio. ``Having
Mexican students on campus creates a little dissonance for people
at first. But then it helps lay a foundation for better
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre puts it more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Americans think we are lazy people, dirty people. They
should see what we do to go to school, how hard we work,'' he said.
His day begins before dawn and he doesn't return home until after
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment is open to Mexican students who are at least somewhat
proficient in English and who score at least 920 out of 1600 on the
SAT. To qualify for Texas resident tuition _ $1,057 per semester,
as opposed to $3,613 for out-of-state residents _ they must also
demonstrate financial need, which is not difficult for many Mexican
students.
</P>
<P>
   A semester at a university in Juarez can cost as little as $60,
students and UTEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The in-state tuition often poses a burden for Mexican students,
many of whom work on-campus jobs or clean homes in El Paso, earning
$5 or $6 an hour instead of the $3 a day in the factories and shops
just across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Once at UTEP, Mexican students are more likely to remain in
school than their US classmates. Retention rates for Mexican
students is 81 percent after freshman year, compared with nearly 65
percent for the student body as a whole. Since the program began,
roughly 1,000 Mexican students have graduated, more than 200 with
postgraduate degrees, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few if any public detractors of the program, despite
the fact that _ on paper at least _ UTEP forgoes about $3 million
per semester in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But any money lost is outweighed by the opportunity gained, said
Christina Bernal, a third-generation Mexican-American who oversees
the program, formally known as PASE. The name is both the Spanish
word for pass and an acronym for a Spanish phrase that translates
as Financial Assistance Program for Mexican Citizens. Most Mexican
students could never pay the higher tuition, she said, and would
not attend UTEP.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent is also muted by the fact that it is difficult to find
anyone at the school who pays the out-of-state rates. Only 1
percent of students do so. In addition to the 10 percent of
students who are Mexicans paying in-state tuition, 85 percent of
students are from the El Paso area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bernal said she occasionally hears grousing. ``There are
some racist people in this state, and they don't like to think they
are paying the way for Mexican students,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On campus, however, Mexican students say they experience no
discrimination. That is unsurprising considering that two-thirds of
the student body is of Hispanic descent. Last fall a Mexican
student, Aaron Acosta, was named homecoming king.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Mexican students, choosing majors that are
expected to lead to jobs, eschew liberal arts for programs in
computers, engineering, or business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the kids in my neighborhood, 80 to 90 percent, are
gang members,'' said Abdiel Quezada, 19, a computer science major
from Juarez. ``I hope to stay in the United States and get a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Most said they associate mainly with other Mexicans, but Lilian
Lopez, a math science major who has become a campus orientation
leader, has made friends from Michigan, Minnesota, and as far away
as Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to meet people,'' she said. ``They speak English, and I
want to learn better.''

STOP MILOSEVIC NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one man wanted this war. Slobodan, this one's for you.
</P>
<P>
   The barbaric Serb warlord is the Hitler of the late 20th
century, the wolf loosed on the lambs of the European landmass. The
slaughter of innocents will not stop till he is neutralized, caged,
or destroyed. That grisly end should be at the top of NATO's target
list.
</P>
<P>
   It was Milosevic who has done this before, going back a decade.
French President Jacques Chirac, in a dignified address to the
French people, said Milosevic has killed 200,000 people over the
past decade, casting him as a throwback to ``the Dark Ages.''
Playing on Serb paranoia, propagandizing the undeniable excesses of
his foes, Milosevic has carved his bloody swath through Slovenia,
Bosnia, Croatia, now Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He is a one-man crime wave masquerading as a nationalist hero.
His father shot himself, his mother hanged herself, his country is
killing itself. And NATO should elevate the Milosevic scalp to the
top of the bombers' hit list. His appetite is insatiable, his
methods criminal. ``A serial ethnic cleanser,'' in the deft phrase
of NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. He is flooding Albania, Montenegro,
and the rest of the Balkans with refugees in the tens of thousands.
He is crude and cruel, fond of deputizing gangster associates like
the infamous Arkan to terrorize the helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is audacious; despite NATO threats, he moved 45,000
men into Kosovo in advance of the deadline. He has undoubtedly
advanced his timetable for the genocide that was planned before the
first NATO bomb fell. As in Bosnia, his thugs were ordered to
murder opposition leaders and fighters, roust women and children,
torch houses, separate men from the rest, and march them off to
burial pits.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming NATO's bombing for the atrocities is like blaming the
fire department for the arsonist's handiwork. Milosevic survives by
recognizing the West's reluctance to bomb civilians or to commit
ground troops that would suffer losses and prove politically
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Europe swallowed the deconstruction of Bosnia for years before
gagging. All those ``never again'' vows from Holocaust memorial
services proved hollow when Milosevic's storm troopers went on the
rampage. This time, for geopolitical reasons that are still not
sufficient for a lot of America's people and politicians, the
West's response is more muscular, aggressive, and fateful.
</P>
<P>
   Should or could we have avoided the situation we are in?
Perhaps. But now we have to deal with the fact that we are in a
round-the-clock shooting war, with tens of thousands of refugees
fleeing daily. The Greeks and Italians are wavering, frightened by
the refugee tide. In a dozen European capitals, Serb immigrants and
sympathizers burn flags and denounce NATO and the United States.
What's the proper course now that we're in this fight?
</P>
<P>
   Finish him, if we can. Bomb harder, closer, tighter. If
Milosevic gets waxed, great. If we can bomb him to the bargaining
table, that's less great, but OK. At a minimum, we have to
``degrade,'' in that curious Pentagon lingo, his war machine. If we
lose our will in the West, if NATO is faced down, if mobs outside
embassies intimidate Europe's wobbly statesmen, then Milosevic and
all the other Milosevics of this world will be stronger, and the
civilized world weaker.
</P>
<P>
   The European leaders begged us to be NATO's big stick. But some
of them turn fainthearted when the bullets fly.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic politics, Congress is unhappy with the choices, and
the people are deeply divided. President Clinton shows more resolve
than most in Congress. One US plane goes down Saturday, and the
media go berserk. You can't run a war without taking some
casualties of your own. As soon as there's one Yank pilot dead, or
five, or 10, Clinton's domestic political support starts draining
away. There'll be the ``we told you so'' chorus from Congress, and
not just from grumpy Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to see US troops rolling into Kosovo for a pitched
battle with Serb units and the inevitable terror attacks from Serb
sappers. But what if we have a bunch of NATO soldiers taken
prisoner? How do we not go get our guys? It is the realization that
far worse might lie ahead that makes Clinton dig in. The president
who bugged out of Somalia after 18 Americans died in an ambush, who
wavered on Bosnia till all of Europe was shamed into asking for our
help, is the same president who bombed Iraq during impeachment and
who ramped up the bombing war on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believed Clinton was a draft-dodging wimp skirt-chaser
who was too chicken to inhale now comprehend a re-elected and
impeachment-proof commander in chief committed to stopping the
soccer-field massacres even at the price of US casualties.
</P>
<P>
   If you really believe in ``never again,'' you have to admit that
Kosovo qualifies as a late-20th-century mini-Holocaust. No, we
didn't intervene in Rwanda, or Burundi, or Eritrea; we don't go
where the Tamil Tigers or the Khmer Rouge operate. We cannot do
everything everywhere to stop slaughter. But Kosovo is on Europe's
doorstep; NATO had to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks say a fish rots from the head. In the recalibration
of NATO's bombing targets, the list should start with Milosevic.
The Mad Dog of Belgrade is a walking advertisement for war crimes.
We never could pot Saddam; more's the pity. That's no reason not to
have a go at Slobodan. He's earned his right to be killed. His name
should top the list.
</P>

UNEASE AMONG OLD PEACENIKS

<P>
   SACRAMENTO &UR;  &LR; _ A B-52 bomber sits on the living room floor, and
no one wants to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of Vietnam made a brief visit to the Democratic State
Convention in California, interrupting Tipper Gore, who substituted
for her husband. At first she uttered appropriate notes of
self-mockery. ``Speaking of the 2000 election, Al sends his
regards,'' she deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   When she became serious, so did the delegates. ``They are
standing for us,'' she said, praising the US forces involved in
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. ``It's never an easy decision to send
our troops into danger.'' A lonely voice shouted, ``Bring them
home!'' the only note of foreign policy dissent at the party
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, California activists defined themselves as antiwar
Democrats. They entered politics to follow Eugene McCarthy, Robert
Kennedy, and George McGovern _ all ``doves'' in the war in Vietnam,
the longest war in US history. In the 1960s, these delegates were
picketing party meetings, chanting ``Stop the Bombing! Stop the
War!'' Today they're on the inside, maybe feeling uncomfortable,
but not saying so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed I'd have to go back and vote on airstrikes,''
said Senator Barbara Boxer, celebrating with delegates her
successful reelection. ``But human rights belong to everyone in the
world,'' she added, and ought not to be denied ``because of
ethnicity, religion, or background.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates said they hadn't followed the war in Yugoslavia
but were willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a Democratic
president, Bill Clinton, a courtesy they did not extend to Lyndon
Johnson in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are always ready to duel about ideology, but at the
Sacramento Convention Center the guerrilla theater was tame and
theoretical. Delegates listened to Gray Davis, the first Democratic
governor in 16 years, who campaigned as a Vietnam veteran backing
``a strong national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a campaign theme, Davis said, ``I pledged that I would
govern not from the right or the left but from the center,''
pausing for applause. Five delegates applauded. The 2,695 others
reacted as though an honorary Oscar were being awarded to Elia
Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., substituting for
President Clinton as a luncheon speaker, addressed the delegates
and, through them, Davis, whom he had supported for governor early.
``You are running the risk of losing the enthusiasm of your base
and ultimately the loyalty of your base,'' Brown said. ``You must
do justice to your base.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalk outside, the scene was surreal. Some 200
protesters mingled uncomfortably. Most were pro-Serb rather than
antiwar, waving Yugoslavian flags adorned with imperial crests. A
handful of aging hippies from the 1960s joined them, looking like
extras in the ABC comedy ``Dharma and Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, not every old lefty repressed long-ago instincts. The
state Senate's president, John L. Burton, who protested the war in
Vietnam as a member of Congress, was the only party leader whose
letter of welcome injected ideology in the convention brochure with
ungrammatical fervor: ``We're on the road to 2000. And we're going
to make sure that road don't veer to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving a two-minute luncheon speech, Burton stared at the
demonstrators, saying, ``They don't look too dangerous.'' He mused
about conventions past ``in '64, '66, '68 and right on through, all
about Vietnam.'' Calling Clinton's policy ``a pretty slippery
slope,'' he wondered ``whether genocide in Africa is different
because it doesn't involve white people'' and added: ``It's very
tough to support dropping bombs on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton left the convention early to drive home to San Francisco
to catch a documentary movie on Lenny Bruce, the late comic who
would have had some choice, unsympathetic, comments about the
silent discomfort of Democrats today.

BOB DOLE'S SUPPORTING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Dole has a new campaign. He's running for First
Gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   The former Senate majority leader and 1996 Republican
presidential nominee still thirsts for the White House. This time
he'll settle for the East Wing _ and will be happy to choose the
menu for state dinners, attend charity benefits and steer clear of
the limelight and policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to put the First Gentleman in charge of
anything,'' he said in an interview. ``He didn't get elected. He's
not accountable to the people. He'd be interfering . . . though I
have to admit I'd feel a lot of temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   After one campaign for the vice presidency and three for the
presidency, the former Kansas senator is boosting his wife, former
Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, for the White House. But he
says he's also campaigning for something else. He's trying to win
support for the idea that men ought to support their wives' career
aspirations in the way that women have done for men for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a one-way street until now,'' said Dole, 75.
``Mostly the men get support from the women. But the men should
support the women.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole has boosted his wife's political chances for years. As long
ago as the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, he spoke
movingly about how the limelight would one day change its focus
from Bob Dole to Elizabeth Dole. He ran for president twice more
since then, of course, but now his greatest ambition is to support
his wife's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   If she wins the White House, he said, ``She'd make history _ and
I'd be history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Bob Dole trying to be president through the back
door of the White House after not being able to be president
through the front door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he seeks to be a role model for husbands, Dole
acknowledges there are no role models for a male presidential
spouse. ``There's never been anything like this before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Elizabeth Dole campaign _ she's formed
an exploratory committee but hasn't yet declared her candidacy _
Bob Dole has stayed in the background of the campaign. More
accurately, he has been off-stage _ and would plan on staying off
stage if his wife won the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a driver and a car, something to toodle around
town in,'' he said. ``But I also want a beeper in case I get left
behind after some state ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas was accompanied by his wife in
his only major appearance in presidential politics, the
announcement of the formation of his exploratory committee. Senator
Bob Smith of New Hampshire was accompanied by his wife when he
declared for president. But Elizabeth Dole appeared in Iowa and New
Hampshire without her husband. He also does not appear in her
promotional video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same obligation to be supportive as a woman might
have to be supportive of her husband,'' Dole said. ``I've tried to
stay out of the formative stages of the campaign _ I've not
interviewed anybody for a job _ because I have to be in the
background. This would not be Bob Dole's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Doles seldom campaigned together in 1996, and when they
did the differences in their styles were clear. The husband is
informal, the wife formal. The husband seems reserved, the wife
seems open. But in truth, the husband is spontaneous, the wife
scripted. On campaign planes, the husband took naps. The wife read.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to President Clinton, the retired senator joined
the powerhouse law firm of Verner, Liipfert. He has made several
advertisements, continued to raise money for charities, become an
outspoken voice on prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction, and
has been an envoy to the Balkans. When the NATO attack on
Yugoslavia began, Defense Secretary William Cohen called Dole to
brief him on the military objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He's now ready for yet another slight adjustment in his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this _ taking orders _ for 25 years,'' he
said. ``The only difference is that I'd be doing this in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole believes the time has come for a female president, in part
because the public has grown so impatient with male politicians.
``Remember,'' he said. ``Only 50 percent of the people voted in
1996, and they had to choose among three men.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that being First Gentleman would be an easy job. ``It would
be a lot of work _ dinners, lunches, meetings of the Cabinet
wives,'' he said. ``I'd have to take up knitting. And maybe I'll
run for Senate from Massachusetts.''

NEW YORK MOUNTS CENSUS EFFORT TO RETAIN HOUSE SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Faced with the prospect of losing one
congressional seat _ and quite possibly two _ because of a
declining population, New York officials launched a yearlong effort
to ensure a thorough count in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some people, the census is going to be considered another
piece of junk mail,'' Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue said Tuesday at the
organizing meeting of the Complete Count Committee, which includes
government and private sector representatives. ``It is perhaps one
of the most important documents that anyone will be asked to fill
out next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next March, federal authorities will mail census forms to every
household in the nation, but officials here and across the country
are concerned that indifference in certain areas _ like New York _
could result in a significant undercounting. After the last census
in 1990, New York lost three seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives, and has acknowledged the loss of at least one more
after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The state now has 31 representatives in the House, while
California has 52 and Texas 30.
</P>
<P>
   The census count is required once every decade under the U.S.
Constitution and is used to determine how many representatives a
state has in Congress and how much aid it receives from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do a good job in 2000, we are going to be stuck
with the numbers for another 10 years,'' said Tony Farthing,
director of the New York City Regional Census Center. ``We did not
get the message out clearly in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   The Complete Count Committee is eager to ensure that New York
doesn't lose any more clout than necessary. The key, officials
said, is spreading the word and getting people to fill out census
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur G. Dukakis, director of the Boston Regional Census
Center, which services all of upstate New York, said the U.S.
Census Bureau will for the first time mount an aggressive
television campaign (the theme is: ``This is your future. Don't
leave it blank'').
</P>
<P>
   After the census is completed, a task force appointed by the
leaders of the state Assembly and Senate will come up with a
proposal for redrawing political boundary lines, so that each
member of the House of Representatives, as well as each state
Assembly and Senate member, represents approximately the same
number of people. Eventually, both houses of the Legislature and
the governor must approve the plan.

INTERNET BECOMES THIS WAR'S JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Web page of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the latest report
is marked ``Urgent, urgent, urgent'' with a headline posted in bold
red letters: ``Terror and massacre ... the humanitarian catastrophe
has happened.'' The site, at http://www.kosavapress.com, goes on to
list the names of people killed by Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the official Web site of the Serbian government
(http://serbia-info.com) offers an entirely different version of
events: One story accuses the ``NATO machine'' of attacking
villagers in Kosovo ``under veil of dark.'' Other pro-government
sites urge people to wear bull's eye targets on their clothing as a
symbol of protest against ``NATO aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sites hosted by various human rights groups,
including New York-based Human Rights Watch and the London-based
Institute for War and Peace, are posting up-to-the-minute bulletins
on violence reported by affiliates in the field. And on bulletin
boards and in chat rooms, people are launching ``flame'' wars of
their own, vilifying President Clinton or Serb President Slobodan
Milosevic, depending on their political persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   In the first international conflict monitored and reported on
the Internet, there are as many versions of events as there are
people willing to post them. ``The role of information technology
in reporting military conflicts has long historic roots,'' said
John Pavlik, director of Columbia University's New Media Center.
``What's different today is that anybody can publish information _
governments, military authorities, journalists, or citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   World War II was reported over radio, while the Vietnam War was
beamed into American homes via television. Fax machines were the
primary source of communication used by students during the
uprising in Tiananmen Square. And now the Internet is the medium of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   But the new technology, however democratic, represents a
double-edged sword. ``There is a fantastic opportunity for folks to
distribute a picture of the world as they see it,'' said Andrew
Shapiro, director of the Aspen Institute's Internet Policy Project.
``But you don't have the truth filters that you have in traditional
media. You don't have editors and libel lawyers and layers and
layers and layers of intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet human rights workers report that the Internet has been an
invaluable tool throughout the conflict in the Balkans. The
Institute for War and Peace has been monitoring the conflict in
Serbia since 1991, and after Western media members were expelled
from the area last week, its network of local journalists filed
regularly on its Web site, http://www.iwpr.net.
</P>
<P>
   ``When their mobile phones or e-mails are working, they are
filing reports two or three times a day,'' said Tanya Hassan, the
London group's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated technology also enabled Radio B92, an independent
station in Belgrade, to broadcast via Internet after its air
transmitter was banned. Its site, at http://www.b92.net, also
features streaming video, including man-on-the-street interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists warn that the new media is limited. ``We
shouldn't fall into the mythic sense that the Internet is
inherently democratizing,'' Shapiro said. ``We shouldn't say, `They
have the Internet, so why can't they overthrow this guy?' It
doesn't have the tools to determine the outcome of a military
conflict. I fear that Internet boosters tend to place too much
stock in the ability of the Internet to be a liberating force.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the general public in Havana wasn't allowed
to attend the game March 28 between the Cuban national team and the
Baltimore Orioles. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only invited guests were allowed into the historic game at
Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano, and even they had to thread their
way through a heavy security cordon that included dozens of
plain-clothed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the media, the government decided to keep tight
control over who could attend, distributing tickets to Communist
Party faithful through schools, youth organizations and unions.
Some tickets were parceled out to workers and civil servants as
rewards for meeting production quotas and other state goals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fans who attended, electrician Leonardo Marquez, said
he was given his tickets as a reward for being productive. ``The
people here were all invited,'' Marquez told a New YorkTimes
reporter. ``It's for the protection of the foreigners here. We were
told to behave ourselves.'' Another fan, Roman Garcia, who didn't
get a ticket, denounced the government's decision, saying: ``I
always go to the stadium, even when there are only 50 to 100 people
in the stands. But I can't go because I don't have an invitation. I
feel tricked and disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question that will be of interest to a lot of young
people. Is the rock singer who goes by the name of Marilyn Manson
the same person who played Paul on ``The Wonder Years'' about a
decade ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: That rumor goes around from time to time, but shock-rocker
Manson (real name: Brian Warner) says it isn't true. He also denies
other frequently recurring rumors, including the one saying he was
a child actor on ``Mr. Belvedere,'' and another claiming that he
died of a drug overdose in Phoenix. The part of Paul Pfeiffer on
``Wonder'' was played by Josh Saviano, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Delta Air Lines changed its policies about boarding
priorities for passengers traveling with children? We used to be
able to board at the same time as first-class passengers, but on a
recent trip from Phoenix to Atlanta we were told that isn't the
policy now, and those of us with children were to board only when
our row was called. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the policy indeed has
changed. It's part of a procedure Delta has instituted to expedite
the boarding process ``in order to ensure on-time performance.''
All passengers _ and that includes children _ board from the rear
of the aircraft by row number when the gate agent makes the
announcement. The exception is people holding first-class tickets
and other priority passengers, who can board earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is fat-free cream cheese possible, when most if not all
of the fat in milk is in the cream?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the ingredients list on the packaging of these products
and you'll see words like nonfat milk, whey protein, cultured skim
milk solids, skim milk, xanthan gum, carrageenan (a gum) and so on,
said Judy A. Harrison of the department of foods and nutrition at
the University of Georgia. This is your clue as to how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfat milk is used instead of whole milk or cream in the
production process of such products as fat-free cream cheese and
fat-free half and half. Milk proteins and gums, many of which are
plant-derived, are added to the nonfat milk to give the resulting
product texture or body similar to the original food product,
Harrison added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can an Internet user get a list of e-mail addresses of
U.S. senators and U.S. representatives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the 540 members of the 106th Congress (including five
non-voting delegates), the latest information shows that 386 had
e-mail addresses and 488 could be contacted via WWW home pages.
There are a number of online sources of information for reaching
them, and some list more traditional ground mail contact
information, too. Among the sources:
</P>
<P>
   www.visi.com/juan/congress
</P>
<P>
   www.vote-smart.org/congresstrack/contact
</P>
<P>
   www.capweb.net
</P>
<P>
   www.congress.org/ Q: I was extremely moved and hurt by the
pictures on TV of people in Kosovo forced out of their homes and
into the mountains. The announcer said monetary contributions to
help them would be best, but he didn't say where they could be
sent. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several relief organizations are accepting donations. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   American Red Cross: If sending a check, make it out to American
Red Cross International Response Fund (and indicate on the check
``Yugoslavia, including Kosovo'') and mail to American Red Cross
International Response Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.
For credit-card donations, call 1-800-HELP-NOW (1-800-435-7669) and
again indicate ``Yugoslavia, including Kosovo.'' Internet users can
make online donations by visiting www.redcross.org and choosing
International Response Fund as the option for donating.
</P>
<P>
   CARE: Make your check payable to CARE, write ``Kosovo'' on it,
and mail to: CARE, Attn.: Donor Services, 151 Ellis St., Atlanta,
GA 30303. Online donations can be made at www.care.org and
credit-card contributions can be made by calling 1-800-521-CARE
(1-800-521-2273).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the diplomat who claimed immunity after
a traffic accident in Washington a year or two ago in which a young
woman died? He had been drinking and was speeding, as I recall.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Gueorgui Makharadze, second-ranking member
at the embassy of the Republic of Georgia in Washington. The
accident, which killed Joviane Waltrick, 16, and injured four other
people, occurred in January 1997 when Makharadze's leased 1997 Ford
Taurus slammed into a line of cars waiting at a traffic light in
northwest Washington. Authorities said Makharadze was speeding
after a dinner during which he drank too much wine.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary step, the Republic of Georgia waived
Makharadze's diplomatic immunity so he could face criminal charges.
He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated
assault and was sentenced in December 1997 to seven to 21 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrick's family agreed last October to settle a lawsuit
against the Republic of Georgia and other defendants for ``well in
excess'' of $250,000 (the exact amount was not disclosed).
Waltrick's mother, Viviane Wagner, said she planned to use the
money to start a nonprofit foundation to educate the public about
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was reached, Tedo Japaridze, Georgia's
ambassador to the United States, wrote to Wagner expressing sadness
for what happened, and adding that he realized ``no compensation is
possible'' for the loss of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My family will be going on a skiing vacation north of
Vancouver, B.C., in December, driving into Canada from Seatte.
What are the entry requirements for U.S. citizens?
</P>
<P>
   A: No visa is required by Americans to visit Canada. Proof of
identity and citizenship (such as birth certificate or passport or
naturalization papers) is required, however, and passports or birth
certificates are preferred. Those bringing children must provide
the children's identification (i.e. birth certificate) and a letter
of permission from a parent or guardian if the child is traveling
with someone who does not have legal custody. It is recommended
that anyone traveling to Canada check with the nearest embassy or
consulate for more details. For online information, check this
site: www.canadatourism.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about a flare-up in the former Soviet Union
mentioned two ethnic groups, the Ingush and the Ossetians. I'm not
faimilar with them. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ingushetia is a republic in southwestern Russia. The majority
of the population is Ingush, one of the many Muslim mountain
peoples in the Caucasus. Their history has long been related to the
Chechen mountain peoples, who also are Muslim and whose language is
closely related to Ingush. But after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet
Union, the Ingush and the Chechen dissolved the union that had been
imposed on them after the 1920s, and formed two separate republics,
Ingushetia and Chechnya. Encyclopedia Britannica describes the
Ingush society as one based on clan and tribal relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ossetians live in a region in Caucasia divided between the
North Ossetian Autonomous Republic of the Russian Federation and
the South Ossetian Autonomous Federation of the Georgian Republic.
Ethnically they're of mixed Iranian-Japhetic (Caucasian) origin,
Britannica reports. Their language belongs to the Iranian group of
the Indo-European family of languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that 30 companies are used to calculate the Dow
Jones industrial average, and they are changed from time to time.
What were the 30 companies making up the original Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there were only 12 companies when Charles Henry Dow
published his first industrial stock average on May 26, 1896. Those
1896 components: American Cotton Oil; American Sugar; American
Tobacco; Chicago Gas; Distilling &AMP; Cattle Feeding; General
Electric; Laclede Gas; National Lead; North American (utility);
Tennessee Coal &AMP; Iron; U.S. Leather, preferred; and U.S. Rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The number rose to 20 in 1916. The 30-stock average made its
debut in 1928 and the number has remained constant ever since, even
though the companies within the index occasionally have been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first average computed from the 1896 list, by the way, was
40.94.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that more than $4 million has been collected
in President Clinton's defense fund, and more is expected. Is he
required to pay taxes on this money?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one we could reach at IRS would comment on the record. All
we were told is that the subject of legal defense funds is not
addressed in the tax code, and ``it would be inappropriate to
discuss the tax situation of any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I cracked an egg for a recipe, it had two yolks. What
causes this, and is it rare? The recipe turned out fine, by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   A: A hen normally ovulates one yolk a day, but occasionally two
yolks may be released and, on very rare occasions, there may be
three, said Michael P. Lacy, poultry scientist at the University of
Georgia Extension Service. So a two-yolk egg can't be considered a
rare occurrence, even though it's not usual. Lacy explained that it
happens when two yolks are ovulated at the same time, or close to
the same time, and are picked up simultaneously by the hen's
oviduct. (Think human pregnancies that result in fraternal twins,
whose development process begins when the mother's ovaries release
two eggs at about the same time).
</P>
<P>
   Lacy said double-yolked eggs are more common in young hens
because their oviducts are highly active, and meat-type chickens
are more prone to laying them than egg-laying strains. Also, some
strains of chickens produce higher incidences of double-yolk eggs
than others, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the Dew Line and North Warning
System. Can you tell me anything about a warning system called Pave
Paws, built in the 1970s to detect ICBMs from the U.S.S.R.?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're happy to, but it appears not to involve detection of
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to the
Dictionary of the Modern United States Military. Pave Paws _ whose
formal name is the Precision Acquisition of Vehicle Entry,
Phased-Array Warning System _ is an early-warning radar system
designed to detect sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The
military dictionary says its radars have a range of 3,450 miles and
are capable of counting re-entry vehicles as well as predicting
where they would impact.

   Since it can take 10 minutes or less for a SLBM to hit the
United States, depending on the point of launch, Pave Paws radars
are tied in to NORAD (North American Air Defense Command), the U.S.
Strategic Command and the National Military Command Center to
enable a quick military response if needed. The dictionary lists
these locations for Pave Paws radars: Robins Air Force Base in
Georgia (since installation, it has been mothballed); Otis Air
National Guard Base in Massachusetts; Goodfellow Air Force Base in
Texas; and Beale Air Force Base in California.

<P>
   Q: Who was the lone member of Congress who did not vote to
support the U.S. effort in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the only dissenter on the
resolution to to express House support for U.S. troops engaged in
military operations against Yugoslavia. Her office explained that
the freshman congresswoman is ``deeply concerned about the safety
of our troops,'' but her vote was in objection to the language in
House Resolution 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its wording, today's resolution extended far beyond
expressing support for our troops,'' Lee said in her statement,
dated March 24. ``The first clause of today's resolution asks the
Congress to abdicate its responsibility for declarations of war
and, instead, embrace the notion that the president can authorize
the commitment of U.S. troops to war without congressional
approval. This is a notion which the Congress must reject for
constitutional reasons: It is completely impermissible for the
president to commit troops to war, a right given only to the
Congress by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action a day before the start of hostilities, 41
senators voted against a resolution supporting NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On current episodes of ``This Old House,'' Norm Abram is
walking around with his right arm in a sling. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: A publicist at WGBH-TV in Boston, the station that produces
the program, said Abram tore his rotator cuff in a water-skiing
accident. No further details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the 30 companies chosen that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dow Jones &AMP; Co. explains that the editors of The Wall Street
Journal select the components. They take a broad view of what
industrial means, too: In essence, it's almost any company that
isn't in the transportation business or isn't a utility, because
there also are Dow Jones averages for those kinds of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a new company for the DJIA, the editors are said to
look among substantial industrial companies with a history of
successful growth and wide interest among investors.
</P>
<P>
   The components aren't changed often. It isn't a ``hot stock''
index, after all, and the newspaper's editors believe that
stability of composition enhances the trust that many people have
in the averages. The most frequent reasons for changing a stock are
that something is happening to one of the components, such as being
acquired, or that another company may become more representative as
a market barometer, or that a different sector of the economy
should be represented. Whenever one stock is changed, the others
are reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Dow Jones industrial average stocks were
changed was in March 1997, when Woolworth, Westinghouse Electric,
Texaco and Bethlehem Steel were deleted, and Hewlett-Packard,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Traveler's Group and Wal-Mart were added. The
last changes before that came in 1991.

<P>
   Q: A short item in the newspaper reported that Cesar Chavez was
inducted into the U.S. Labor Department's Hall of Fame as its 22nd
member. Who are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the Labor Hall of Fame honorees, in addition to
Chavez: Mary Anderson, Cyrus S. Ching, John R. Commons, Eugene
Debs, David Dubinsky, Arthur Goldberg, Samuel Gompers, William
Green, Sidney Hillman, Mother Jones, Henry J. Kaiser, John L.
Lewis, George Meany, James P. Mitchell, David A. Morse, Philip
Murray, Frances Perkins, A. Philip Randolph, Walter Reuther, George
W. Taylor and Robert F. Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame posthumously recognizes Americans deemed to
have improved quality of life for U.S. workers by pushing for wage
increases, safer working conditions and more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Q&AMP;A has printed this information in the past, and I
saved it, but now I can't find it. How do I get a presidential
greeeting sent to my grandmother, who will be 80 soon? She's a big
fan of President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't printed it lately, so we're glad to oblige for you
and many other readers who have asked us to repeat it. In addition
to birthday greetings for Americans 80 or older, anniversary
greetings are sent to couples celebrating 50 or more years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Requests must be put in writing and sent by mail to White House,
Attn: Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or faxed to
202-395-1232.
</P>
<P>
   You should request a card at least six weeks prior to the
occasion. For recorded information, call 202-456-2724.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact the national headquarters of the Republican
Party in Washington? I want to express my support of the party's
new stance on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Republican National Committee, 310 First St. S.E.,
Washington, DC 20003. Or send an e-mail communication to the RNC at
this address: info(at)rnc.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you discuss the meaning and origin of the business terms
bull market, bear market and blue chip? I hear them often, but
without any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Bull market'' refers to a prolonged rise in the prices of
stocks, bonds or commodities. Bull markets usually last a few
months and are characterized by high trading volume. Various
theories are advanced about how the expression started, but the
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the most likely
one is that ``bull'' refers to a bull's habit of tossing its head
upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear market'' is a prolonged period of falling prices. A bear
market in stocks usually is brought on by the anticipation of
declining economic activity, and a bear market in bonds is caused
by rising interest rates. The most plausible origin, according to
the Morris Dictionary, is that ``bear'' comes from the old axiom
about ``selling the skin before you've caught the bear.'' A trader
who operates in this fashion once was known in England as a
``bearskin jobber.'' An alternate explanation involves an attacking
bear's habit of thrusting its paws upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue chip'' refers to the common stock of a nationally known
company that has a long record of profit growth and dividend
payment and a reputation for quality management, products and
services. Think IBM, GE and Du Pont, for example. Blue chip stocks
typically are relatively high priced and low yielding. The
expression was borrowed from gambling: The most valuable counters
in poker are the blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle something about my favorite country singer,
Clint Black? A co-worker said he's from New Jersey, but I could
swear he's a native Texan, like I am. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brace yourself. Black was born Feb. 4, 1962, in Long Branch,
N.J., according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.
But he grew up in Houston, the youngest of four brothers. And it
was in Houston where he started playing the harmonica at 13, and
shortly thereafter used songbooks to teach himself to play the
guitar. You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, there was a move to convert the United States
to the metric system. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It went into hibernation _ encouraged, but not put on the
front burner, and never officially canceled, either. The federal
Metric Conversion Act of the mid-1970s was supposed to make metric
the accepted system in the United States. Even well before that _
the Metric Act of 1866 _ the metric system was given the official
OK by the federal government. But it has never caught on, even
though Americans deal with 2-liter Coca-Cola bottles and liter wine
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conversion to metric in this country was never
mandated, and no deadline was set for voluntary compliance, most
people have stuck with the tried-and-true. It's confusing, that's
for sure. Consider a breakfast oatmeal container with this on its
label: ``42 oz.; 2 lbs. 10 oz.; 1.19 kg.'' The cereal's nutritional
values are calculated in grams, but cooking instructions use
standard American-style measure. Go figure.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the general public in Havana wasn't allowed
to attend the game March 28 between the Cuban national team and the
Baltimore Orioles. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only invited guests were allowed into the historic game at
Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano, and even they had to thread their
way through a heavy security cordon that included dozens of
plain-clothed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the media, the government decided to keep tight
control over who could attend, distributing tickets to Communist
Party faithful through schools, youth organizations and unions.
Some tickets were parceled out to workers and civil servants as
rewards for meeting production quotas and other state goals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fans who attended, electrician Leonardo Marquez, said
he was given his tickets as a reward for being productive. ``The
people here were all invited,'' Marquez told a New YorkTimes
reporter. ``It's for the protection of the foreigners here. We were
told to behave ourselves.'' Another fan, Roman Garcia, who didn't
get a ticket, denounced the government's decision, saying: ``I
always go to the stadium, even when there are only 50 to 100 people
in the stands. But I can't go because I don't have an invitation. I
feel tricked and disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question that will be of interest to a lot of young
people. Is the rock singer who goes by the name of Marilyn Manson
the same person who played Paul on ``The Wonder Years'' about a
decade ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: That rumor goes around from time to time, but shock-rocker
Manson (real name: Brian Warner) says it isn't true. He also denies
other frequently recurring rumors, including the one saying he was
a child actor on ``Mr. Belvedere,'' and another claiming that he
died of a drug overdose in Phoenix. The part of Paul Pfeiffer on
``Wonder'' was played by Josh Saviano, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Delta Air Lines changed its policies about boarding
priorities for passengers traveling with children? We used to be
able to board at the same time as first-class passengers, but on a
recent trip from Phoenix to Atlanta we were told that isn't the
policy now, and those of us with children were to board only when
our row was called. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the policy indeed has
changed. It's part of a procedure Delta has instituted to expedite
the boarding process ``in order to ensure on-time performance.''
All passengers _ and that includes children _ board from the rear
of the aircraft by row number when the gate agent makes the
announcement. The exception is people holding first-class tickets
and other priority passengers, who can board earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is fat-free cream cheese possible, when most if not all
of the fat in milk is in the cream?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the ingredients list on the packaging of these products
and you'll see words like nonfat milk, whey protein, cultured skim
milk solids, skim milk, xanthan gum, carrageenan (a gum) and so on,
said Judy A. Harrison of the department of foods and nutrition at
the University of Georgia. This is your clue as to how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfat milk is used instead of whole milk or cream in the
production process of such products as fat-free cream cheese and
fat-free half and half. Milk proteins and gums, many of which are
plant-derived, are added to the nonfat milk to give the resulting
product texture or body similar to the original food product,
Harrison added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can an Internet user get a list of e-mail addresses of
U.S. senators and U.S. representatives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the 540 members of the 106th Congress (including five
non-voting delegates), the latest information shows that 386 had
e-mail addresses and 488 could be contacted via WWW home pages.
There are a number of online sources of information for reaching
them, and some list more traditional ground mail contact
information, too. Among the sources:
</P>
<P>
   www.visi.com/juan/congress
</P>
<P>
   www.vote-smart.org/congresstrack/contact
</P>
<P>
   www.capweb.net
</P>
<P>
   www.congress.org/ Q: I was extremely moved and hurt by the
pictures on TV of people in Kosovo forced out of their homes and
into the mountains. The announcer said monetary contributions to
help them would be best, but he didn't say where they could be
sent. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several relief organizations are accepting donations. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   American Red Cross: If sending a check, make it out to American
Red Cross International Response Fund (and indicate on the check
``Yugoslavia, including Kosovo'') and mail to American Red Cross
International Response Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.
For credit-card donations, call 1-800-HELP-NOW (1-800-435-7669) and
again indicate ``Yugoslavia, including Kosovo.'' Internet users can
make online donations by visiting www.redcross.org and choosing
International Response Fund as the option for donating.
</P>
<P>
   CARE: Make your check payable to CARE, write ``Kosovo'' on it,
and mail to: CARE, Attn.: Donor Services, 151 Ellis St., Atlanta,
GA 30303. Online donations can be made at www.care.org and
credit-card contributions can be made by calling 1-800-521-CARE
(1-800-521-2273).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the diplomat who claimed immunity after
a traffic accident in Washington a year or two ago in which a young
woman died? He had been drinking and was speeding, as I recall.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Gueorgui Makharadze, second-ranking member
at the embassy of the Republic of Georgia in Washington. The
accident, which killed Joviane Waltrick, 16, and injured four other
people, occurred in January 1997 when Makharadze's leased 1997 Ford
Taurus slammed into a line of cars waiting at a traffic light in
northwest Washington. Authorities said Makharadze was speeding
after a dinner during which he drank too much wine.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary step, the Republic of Georgia waived
Makharadze's diplomatic immunity so he could face criminal charges.
He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated
assault and was sentenced in December 1997 to seven to 21 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrick's family agreed last October to settle a lawsuit
against the Republic of Georgia and other defendants for ``well in
excess'' of $250,000 (the exact amount was not disclosed).
Waltrick's mother, Viviane Wagner, said she planned to use the
money to start a nonprofit foundation to educate the public about
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was reached, Tedo Japaridze, Georgia's
ambassador to the United States, wrote to Wagner expressing sadness
for what happened, and adding that he realized ``no compensation is
possible'' for the loss of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My family will be going on a skiing vacation north of
Vancouver, B.C., in December, driving into Canada from Seattle.
What are the entry requirements for U.S. citizens?
</P>
<P>
   A: No visa is required by Americans to visit Canada. Proof of
identity and citizenship (such as birth certificate or passport or
naturalization papers) is required, however, and passports or birth
certificates are preferred. Those bringing children must provide
the children's identification (i.e. birth certificate) and a letter
of permission from a parent or guardian if the child is traveling
with someone who does not have legal custody. It is recommended
that anyone traveling to Canada check with the nearest embassy or
consulate for more details. For online information, check this
site: www.canadatourism.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about a flare-up in the former Soviet Union
mentioned two ethnic groups, the Ingush and the Ossetians. I'm not
faimilar with them. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ingushetia is a republic in southwestern Russia. The majority
of the population is Ingush, one of the many Muslim mountain
peoples in the Caucasus. Their history has long been related to the
Chechen mountain peoples, who also are Muslim and whose language is
closely related to Ingush. But after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet
Union, the Ingush and the Chechen dissolved the union that had been
imposed on them after the 1920s, and formed two separate republics,
Ingushetia and Chechnya. Encyclopedia Britannica describes the
Ingush society as one based on clan and tribal relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ossetians live in a region in Caucasia divided between the
North Ossetian Autonomous Republic of the Russian Federation and
the South Ossetian Autonomous Federation of the Georgian Republic.
Ethnically they're of mixed Iranian-Japhetic (Caucasian) origin,
Britannica reports. Their language belongs to the Iranian group of
the Indo-European family of languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that 30 companies are used to calculate the Dow
Jones industrial average, and they are changed from time to time.
What were the 30 companies making up the original Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there were only 12 companies when Charles Henry Dow
published his first industrial stock average on May 26, 1896. Those
1896 components: American Cotton Oil; American Sugar; American
Tobacco; Chicago Gas; Distilling &AMP; Cattle Feeding; General
Electric; Laclede Gas; National Lead; North American (utility);
Tennessee Coal &AMP; Iron; U.S. Leather, preferred; and U.S. Rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The number rose to 20 in 1916. The 30-stock average made its
debut in 1928 and the number has remained constant ever since, even
though the companies within the index occasionally have been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first average computed from the 1896 list, by the way, was
40.94.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that more than $4 million has been collected
in President Clinton's defense fund, and more is expected. Is he
required to pay taxes on this money?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one we could reach at IRS would comment on the record. All
we were told is that the subject of legal defense funds is not
addressed in the tax code, and ``it would be inappropriate to
discuss the tax situation of any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I cracked an egg for a recipe, it had two yolks. What
causes this, and is it rare? The recipe turned out fine, by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   A: A hen normally ovulates one yolk a day, but occasionally two
yolks may be released and, on very rare occasions, there may be
three, said Michael P. Lacy, poultry scientist at the University of
Georgia Extension Service. So a two-yolk egg can't be considered a
rare occurrence, even though it's not usual. Lacy explained that it
happens when two yolks are ovulated at the same time, or close to
the same time, and are picked up simultaneously by the hen's
oviduct. (Think human pregnancies that result in fraternal twins,
whose development process begins when the mother's ovaries release
two eggs at about the same time).
</P>
<P>
   Lacy said double-yolked eggs are more common in young hens
because their oviducts are highly active, and meat-type chickens
are more prone to laying them than egg-laying strains. Also, some
strains of chickens produce higher incidences of double-yolk eggs
than others, he added.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the Dew Line and North Warning
System. Can you tell me anything about a warning system called Pave
Paws, built in the 1970s to detect ICBMs from the U.S.S.R.?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're happy to, but it appears not to involve detection of
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to the
Dictionary of the Modern United States Military. Pave Paws _ whose
formal name is the Precision Acquisition of Vehicle Entry,
Phased-Array Warning System _ is an early-warning radar system
designed to detect sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The
military dictionary says its radars have a range of 3,450 miles and
are capable of counting re-entry vehicles as well as predicting
where they would impact.
</P>
<P>
   Since it can take 10 minutes or less for a SLBM to hit the
United States, depending on the point of launch, Pave Paws radars
are tied in to NORAD (North American Air Defense Command), the U.S.
Strategic Command and the National Military Command Center to
enable a quick military response if needed. The dictionary lists
these locations for Pave Paws radars: Robins Air Force Base in
Georgia (since installation, it has been mothballed); Otis Air
National Guard Base in Massachusetts; Goodfellow Air Force Base in
Texas; and Beale Air Force Base in California.

<P>
   Q: Who was the lone member of Congress who did not vote to
support the U.S. effort in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the only dissenter on the
resolution to to express House support for U.S. troops engaged in
military operations against Yugoslavia. Her office explained that
the freshman congresswoman is ``deeply concerned about the safety
of our troops,'' but her vote was in objection to the language in
House Resolution 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its wording, today's resolution extended far beyond
expressing support for our troops,'' Lee said in her statement,
dated March 24. ``The first clause of today's resolution asks the
Congress to abdicate its responsibility for declarations of war
and, instead, embrace the notion that the president can authorize
the commitment of U.S. troops to war without congressional
approval. This is a notion which the Congress must reject for
constitutional reasons: It is completely impermissible for the
president to commit troops to war, a right given only to the
Congress by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action a day before the start of hostilities, 41
senators voted against a resolution supporting NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On current episodes of ``This Old House,'' Norm Abram is
walking around with his right arm in a sling. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: A publicist at WGBH-TV in Boston, the station that produces
the program, said Abram tore his rotator cuff in a water-skiing
accident. No further details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the 30 companies chosen that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dow Jones &AMP; Co. explains that the editors of The Wall Street
Journal select the components. They take a broad view of what
industrial means, too: In essence, it's almost any company that
isn't in the transportation business or isn't a utility, because
there also are Dow Jones averages for those kinds of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a new company for the DJIA, the editors are said to
look among substantial industrial companies with a history of
successful growth and wide interest among investors.
</P>
<P>
   The components aren't changed often. It isn't a ``hot stock''
index, after all, and the newspaper's editors believe that
stability of composition enhances the trust that many people have
in the averages. The most frequent reasons for changing a stock are
that something is happening to one of the components, such as being
acquired, or that another company may become more representative as
a market barometer, or that a different sector of the economy
should be represented. Whenever one stock is changed, the others
are reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Dow Jones industrial average stocks were
changed was in March 1997, when Woolworth, Westinghouse Electric,
Texaco and Bethlehem Steel were deleted, and Hewlett-Packard,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Traveler's Group and Wal-Mart were added. The
last changes before that came in 1991.

<P>
   Q: A short item in the newspaper reported that Cesar Chavez was
inducted into the U.S. Labor Department's Hall of Fame as its 22nd
member. Who are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the Labor Hall of Fame honorees, in addition to
Chavez: Mary Anderson, Cyrus S. Ching, John R. Commons, Eugene
Debs, David Dubinsky, Arthur Goldberg, Samuel Gompers, William
Green, Sidney Hillman, Mother Jones, Henry J. Kaiser, John L.
Lewis, George Meany, James P. Mitchell, David A. Morse, Philip
Murray, Frances Perkins, A. Philip Randolph, Walter Reuther, George
W. Taylor and Robert F. Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame posthumously recognizes Americans deemed to
have improved quality of life for U.S. workers by pushing for wage
increases, safer working conditions and more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Q&AMP;A has printed this information in the past, and I
saved it, but now I can't find it. How do I get a presidential
greeeting sent to my grandmother, who will be 80 soon? She's a big
fan of President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't printed it lately, so we're glad to oblige for you
and many other readers who have asked us to repeat it. In addition
to birthday greetings for Americans 80 or older, anniversary
greetings are sent to couples celebrating 50 or more years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Requests must be put in writing and sent by mail to White House,
Attn: Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or faxed to
202-395-1232.
</P>
<P>
   You should request a card at least six weeks prior to the
occasion. For recorded information, call 202-456-2724.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact the national headquarters of the Republican
Party in Washington? I want to express my support of the party's
new stance on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Republican National Committee, 310 First St. S.E.,
Washington, DC 20003. Or send an e-mail communication to the RNC at
this address: info(at)rnc.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you discuss the meaning and origin of the business terms
bull market, bear market and blue chip? I hear them often, but
without any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Bull market'' refers to a prolonged rise in the prices of
stocks, bonds or commodities. Bull markets usually last a few
months and are characterized by high trading volume. Various
theories are advanced about how the expression started, but the
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the most likely
one is that ``bull'' refers to a bull's habit of tossing its head
upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear market'' is a prolonged period of falling prices. A bear
market in stocks usually is brought on by the anticipation of
declining economic activity, and a bear market in bonds is caused
by rising interest rates. The most plausible origin, according to
the Morris Dictionary, is that ``bear'' comes from the old axiom
about ``selling the skin before you've caught the bear.'' A trader
who operates in this fashion once was known in England as a
``bearskin jobber.'' An alternate explanation involves an attacking
bear's habit of thrusting its paws upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue chip'' refers to the common stock of a nationally known
company that has a long record of profit growth and dividend
payment and a reputation for quality management, products and
services. Think IBM, GE and Du Pont, for example. Blue chip stocks
typically are relatively high priced and low yielding. The
expression was borrowed from gambling: The most valuable counters
in poker are the blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle something about my favorite country singer,
Clint Black? A co-worker said he's from New Jersey, but I could
swear he's a native Texan, like I am. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brace yourself. Black was born Feb. 4, 1962, in Long Branch,
N.J., according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.
But he grew up in Houston, the youngest of four brothers. And it
was in Houston where he started playing the harmonica at 13, and
shortly thereafter used songbooks to teach himself to play the
guitar. You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, there was a move to convert the United States
to the metric system. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It went into hibernation _ encouraged, but not put on the
front burner, and never officially canceled, either. The federal
Metric Conversion Act of the mid-1970s was supposed to make metric
the accepted system in the United States. Even well before that _
the Metric Act of 1866 _ the metric system was given the official
OK by the federal government. But it has never caught on, even
though Americans deal with 2-liter Coca-Cola bottles and liter wine
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conversion to metric in this country was never
mandated, and no deadline was set for voluntary compliance, most
people have stuck with the tried-and-true. It's confusing, that's
for sure. Consider a breakfast oatmeal container with this on its
label: ``42 oz.; 2 lbs. 10 oz.; 1.19 kg.'' The cereal's nutritional
values are calculated in grams, but cooking instructions use
standard American-style measure. Go figure.

UCONN FINALLY GETS SOME RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Clearly, there are some sad, misguided
souls out there who stupifyingly underestimated the University of
Connecticut Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Cancel the coronation of the Duke Blue Devils as a team for the
ages. Monday night at Tropicana Field, the Huskies gave the
bluebloods of college basketball a serious case of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had too much bite, too much bark, too much game for
the top-ranked Blue Devils in the championship game of the NCAA
Tournament. A 77-74 victory over a team that came in with a 32-game
winning streak can't help but qualify as an upset, but there was
nothing flukish or freakish about the way the Huskies won their
first national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Even those in the crowd of 41,340 who had nosebleed seats could
see that the Huskies and Blue Devils collaborated on a championship
game worth seeing again and again. There were 14 ties and eight
lead changes before Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin shot UConn
into the lead for good. The Blue Devils had two chances in the
final 15 seconds to save the game and a season of mythic
proportions, and they got the ball in the right hands.
</P>
<P>
   Duke senior guard Trajan Langdon is as pure of shooter as there
is in the country. He scored 25 points his final college game,
hitting the target on 5-of-10 of the 3-bombs he dropped on the
Huskies. Guard Ricky Moore is as tenacious a defender as UConn
coach Jim Calhoun has ever had on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Moore refused to let Langdon get even a glimpse at the basket
either time, triggering a raucous UConn celebration punctuated by a
moment of comic relief. One security guard mistook El-Amin as a
regular civilian and tried to escort the pleasingly plump point
guard off the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke section may have been stunned to silence, but not the
Huskies. Duke may have had the 37-1 record and the pedigree, but
neither Calhoun nor his players were taking bows for pulling off an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shocked,'' Calhoun said. ``We truly believed we
could beat them. As of this moment, we're the best team in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has been a head coach for 27 seasons. On his 13th trip
to the NCAAs, he removed himself from the running in the Best Coach
Never To Make the Final Four competition. The Blue Devils had
dashed his dreams of getting to the Final Four in 1990 on a
buzzer-beater by Christian Laettner. Consider the Blue Devils
repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no better coach than I was three weeks ago, and I'm no
worse a coach than I was three weeks ago,'' Calhoun said. ``All I
can do is be true to my kids and do the best I can. If you hear a
loud yell tonight, it will be me.''
</P>
<P>
   All weekend, Calhoun went out of his way to give the Devils
their due. He took special care the day before the game to deliver
an ode to Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the coach for our generation,'' Calhoun said.
``He has identified such things as what a program is _ class,
competitiveness, preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some coach certainly had the Huskies prepared for
everything Krzyzewski tried. The Huskies slowed down the Duke
offense by putting pressure on point guard William Avery, forcing
Langdon to bring up the ball. UConn defenders smartly double-teamed
Duke All-America center Elton Brand (15 points, 13 rebounds) into
confusion. On offense, the Huskies took advantage of their
quickness by spreading the floor and setting up pick-and-roll
opportunities. When the Duke big men slid over to help, Hamilton,
Moore and El-Amin diced and sliced the Duke defense.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure, Krzyzewski conceded afterward, eventually did in
Duke. Not the pressure of being a favorite, or having a chance to
secure a niche as a team for the ages. The pressure of trying to
stay with the Huskies every step for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept constant game pressure on us,'' Krzyzewski said.
``It's a different form of pressure. We'd get it down to one point
or tied, and they'd make a big play. You have to give them credit
for making big plays in the second half. Because we made big plays.
It was a possession-for-possession game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies played like a team that was possessed. It was as if
they were carrying the banner for the likes of Tate George, Donyell
Marshall, Ray Allen _ the players who put UConn on the college
basketball map. When Calhoun took over the UConn program in 1986,
the talk around the state wasn't about reaching the Final Four. It
was about whether or not the Huskies belonged in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the Big East first and UConn second when I came,''
Calhoun said. ``What we tried to tell kids is, `Would you like to
play against Reggie Williams, Alonzo Mourning? Would you like to
play in the Carrier Dome _ not in Syracuse, but would you like to
play in the Big East?'''
</P>
<P>
   Those days, Calhoun and his staff would call a player and ask
what leagues they liked best. Player after player would talk about
the Big East. Player after player would express admiration for
Georgetown coach John Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you talked to John Thompson?'' the UConn coaches would
ask. ``No? Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Expectations soar. A Duke or a UCLA would trip up
the Huskies short of the Final Four. Calhoun began to chafe at
being criticized for, as he put it, ``mere excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA Tournament is a cruel, cruel thing,'' Calhoun said.
``It's a wonderful thing. I've watched it through the eyes of kids.
The elation is absolutely incredible. I've watched through the
eyes, without knowing it, of Gonzaga, Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in turn, when it ends, it doesn't just slowly end. The
curtain gets drawn down, and the band marches on and you look up
and it's like a parade that has just passed through and you're kind
of left to clean up. Emotionally, that's how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's how the losing teams feel. The Huskies finally won the
last one, the big one. They were resilient, getting 13 first-half
points from Moore, who came in averaging 6.6 per game. They were
resourceful, getting by on a night when El-Amin committed six
turnovers and played only 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Moore kept the Huskies afloat early. Hamilton (27 points, seven
rebounds) steadied the ship during the middle and end. His
3-pointer down the stretch gave the Huskies a 73-68 cushion. Still,
the Blue Devils weren't ready to go away. El-Amin, who had hit a
floater over Shane Battier and Elton Brand with barely a minute
remaining, missed a jumper with the score 75-74 lead. The Blue
Devils retrieved the rebound and took a last gasp at the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 seconds remaining. The ball was in the hands of
Langdon. No way was Krzyzewski going to call a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Coach K telling Trajan to get the ball,'' Moore said.
``I felt like if he got it, he wasn't going to do anything with it.
It was crunch time. It was him against me.''
</P>
<P>
   From the left wing, Langdon tried to shake Moore with a spin
move to the middle. No way. Langdon wound up stumbling and
traveling. After two insurance free throws by El-Amin with barely
five ticks left on the clock, Langdon got one last chance. Just
past midcourt, he tripped. He fell. The mighty Blue Devils had
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't describe it,'' Hamilton said. ``I still don't
understand the things that we did and accomplished. Maybe it will
sink in a week or two from now. We were just happy to put a smile
on Coach's face.''

NEW MAP PINPOINTS TEXAS COASTAL BIRDING TRAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CINDY HORSWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A colony of 500 white pelicans forms a
flotilla, bobbing gently on the waves that lap the shore of the
Bolivar mud flats, a thin strip of land on Texas' Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   When hungry, some move into a line and herd their prey by
beating the water with their 8-foot wings. The birds then use their
pouches, which can hold up to 12 quarts of water, to scoop up the
corralled fish.
</P>
<P>
   Great blue herons stand motionless nearby on tall, stiltlike
legs, watching. Timid spoonbills with their rosy-pink plumage wade
into the salty water away from the crowd. Piping plovers _ small,
brownish birds listed as a threatened species _ skitter across the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 10,000 birds, representing 50 species, congregate on this
tranquil 500-acre Galveston Bay marsh. It's the Houston Audubon
Society's Shorebird Sanctuary, annually attracting visitors from 17
countries and every state.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the 125 sites listed on a new map showing
where to ``bird watch'' in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   The map, which covers the upper coast from Texas Point National
Wildlife Refuge near Beaumont, to the San Bernard National Wildlife
Refuge near Brazoria, is part of the Great Texas Birding Trail
being developed along the state's 500-mile coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Though some might think nature would be lost amid Houston's
petrochemical complexes and smoke stacks, the opposite is true,
said David Dauphin of Baytown, president of the Texas
Ornithological Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 450 different bird species have been found on the
upper coast. Only two of the 50 states can claim that statewide.
One is Texas, which has recorded the most of any state, or 600
species, and the other is California,'' said Dauphin, co-host of an
educational TV series, ``On the Birding Trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a birding trail was conceived in 1995 when the U.S.
Department of Transportation gave Texas a $2.5 million grant to
develop its natural resources, said Madge Lindsay with Texas Parks
&AMP; Wildlife Department. The first of three maps for the trail, which
will run the length of the Texas coast, was released in 1997 and
covered only the state's central section.
</P>
<P>
   The second map _ for the upper coast _ should be available from
Houston-area chambers of commerce, tourist bureaus and the Texas
Department of Transportation in April, Lindsay said. The third map,
covering the lower coast, is expected to be finished by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   While the Houston-area birding trail snakes along the coast, it
also includes 15 loops that meander deeper into the countryside to
spotlight unique scenery or special hideaways, said consultant Ted
Eubanks of Austin, who has visited each site and helped design the
map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have arranged the sites so that there's never more than an
hour's drive between each one. That should make it easy for
travelers to see quite a few sites in one day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-and-white signs that picture a tern winging past the sun
are posted at each location on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites aren't only designed for the avid birders, but for
anybody who enjoys the outdoors and wants an excuse to enjoy
wildlife. There are 70 million people like that,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages those following the trail to contact area chambers
of commerce to learn of historical sites or other points of
interest to visit while following the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks particularly enjoyed visiting the 19 sites on the ``Big
Thicket Loop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about seeing the Big Thicket, but not many people
know how to do it. It's more extensive than the natural preserve,''
he said. ``This loop goes from the Louisiana border, north along
the Sabine River to Toledo Bend and then wanders through the piney
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the birds, Eubanks also was impressed by wild
azalea thickets, long-leaf pines, cypress swamps and private
hideaways not usually seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the really remarkable sites in Newton County is owned
by a large timber company who maintains it as a wilderness park.
It's a canyon with rocky cliffs filled with wild azaleas. It's
other-worldly,'' he said. ``Another place is Boykin Springs north
of Jasper. It's a natural spring that creeps from a swampy lake.
It's part of a national forest that has sphagnum moss and
carnivorous pitcher plants that eat insects.''
</P>
<P>
   The map gives directions to the 125 sites, notes the best
seasons for viewing and lists special birds that might be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the birding destinations, one that might be the most
surprising is the loop centered on downtown Houston, Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that John Audubon, the naturalist famed for painting
North American birds, made a trip to Houston soon after the city
was founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Audubon wasn't that impressed with the `mud hole,' he
reported seeing more ivory-billed woodpeckers here than he ever did
the rest of his life. He also wrote in his diary about the wonders
of wildlife along Buffalo Bayou,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Birding is still possible in Houston's urban setting, Eubanks
insists.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, birds can become so disoriented amid the
skyscrapers during spring migrations that they cluster in pocket
parks around the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Buffalo Bayou Loop'' is designed for visitors who want to
stay within walking distance or a short drive of downtown Houston
and the Texas Medical Center, about five miles from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks and other experts agree that the single most spectacular
birding destinations on the upper coast are the High Island
sanctuaries on the ``Bolivar Loop'' during spring migration.
Beginning in mid-March, thousands of rainbow-colored songbirds
vacate their winter homes in Mexico and Central and South America
to travel to their summer homes in the northern U.S. states and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``These birds must have traveled 850 miles across the Gulf of
Mexico. Then they start looking for a resting place. They end up
funneling through High Island because it sits atop a salt dome, a
tiny pimple of ground with a forest of live oak trees. That's
because 40 miles in either direction is nothing but a flat,
treeless marsh,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these birds have flown through storms and stiff winds
and are so exhausted when they arrive that they may literally fall
out of the sky and land wherever they can.
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands of tourists who descend on High Island during
migration, bleachers have been installed at the end of boardwalks
for observing the birds, especially during the peak of the season,
April 19-23, Dauphin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to start birding is a field guide for bird
identification and some binoculars. It's easy and can be done in
conjunction with other outdoor activities,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Burkett, the Houston Audubon Society's sanctuary manager,
said the birding trail also should lead to an appreciation for the
area's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing habitat all the time with the destruction of the
rain forests in the tropics. We've seen some bird populations drop
by 50 percent in the last 20 years,'' Burkett said. ``That's why
it's so important to protect what we've got and acquire more
strategic sanctuaries, like the mud flats at Port Bolivar.''

   PERSONAL-SERVICE (Undated) _ From the specialists who locate
objects of sentimental value to the ones who locate other
specialists, there are now alluring experts for every household
quest. With men and women spending more hours at work than they did
a decade ago, the do-it-yourself movement, both as an approach to
home decoration and as an outlook on life, has gone into decline,
giving way to the wide-ranging ``hire-it-out'' trend. Its credo is
simple: to save time, just delegate others to pick up the dry
cleaning, pamper the pets, coddle the offspring. By Jenny Lynn
Bader.

dogs before they could become a figure of fun in beer ads. By Phil

conscious decision to avoid being typecast ``as a person whose work
concerns death and destruction.'' But proving that her

TEXAS PANEL DISALLOWS `PHEN' PART OF FEN-PHEN AS EVIDENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A three-judge panel in Harris County, Texas, became
the first court in the nation to disallow evidence that the
``phen'' part of the ``fen-phen'' diet drug combination has helped
cause heart defects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision was heralded Tuesday by manufacturers of
the ``phen'' drug as precedent-setting, plaintiffs lawyers said
they did not oppose the motion to disallow the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pirtle of the Houston law firm O'Quinn and Laminack said the
ruling Monday was actually a victory for fen-phen plaintiffs
because it has always been clear that the ``fen'' part of the
combination caused the alleged health problems. The ruling by the
judges means that the manufacturers of fenfluramine, Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of Philadelphia, a division of American Home Products,
will not be able to claim that the health problems were caused by
phen.
</P>
<P>
   The panel consists of state District Judges Harvey Brown, Tad
Halbach and Katie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Pirtle said plaintiffs' lawyers in fen-phen cases throughout the
country have been routinely dismissing the manufacturers of phen
from their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the Food and Drug Administration withdrew
from the market fenfluramine, sold as Pondimin, and a purer version
of the compound, known as dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of
the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, but
primarily by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass. No
studies linked this drug with the heart valve disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pirtle said phentermine manufacturers were also
initially sued in Harris County because they marketed phentermine
to prolong the usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual
period of 12 weeks to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Esnouf, spokesman for Fisons Corporation in Collegeville,
Pa., which had bought a manufacturer of phentermine in 1995, denied
phen manufacturers promoted the use of their drug with fen. He said
phentermine is a weight-reduction drug that should be taken on its
own.

   SLOBODAN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ To some of the people who came in
contact with him in 1995, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
deserved some credit for coming to Dayton and negotiating the
Dayton Peace Accord that ended the war in Bosnia. But the Serb
attack on the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo has caused
opinions about Milosevic to undergo an abrupt change. ``I sure have
changed my mind,'' said Dieter Krug, who hosted Milosevic and the
rest of the negotiators at a dinner in 1995 at his restaurant,
l'Auberge, in Kettering. ``His actions speak for themselves,'' said
Krug. ``This shooting and killing of innocent women and children is
very bad.'' (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News). 15.

   EVERGLADES-REPORT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Three months before
federal engineers ask Congress to approve a $7.8 billion Everglades
restoration plan, Congress' investigating arm has prepared a draft
report castigating existing Everglades efforts as confused and
disorganized _ and maybe worse. From what we've been able to glean,
the General Accounting Office slams the National Park Service, the
Army Corps and other agencies for being unable to resolve
longstanding disputes that have idled expensive new pumps and
allowed the Cape Sable sparrow crisis to drag on. The GAO also
examined the $200 million that the corps and Interior Department
have spent since 1996 buying Talisman and other buffer sites in
Palm Beach County's sugar region and the east edge of the
Everglades. The agency began its study last fall at the command of
U.S. House appropriations leaders who were irked by the Florida
legislature's proposal to make the corps give more money to owners
of condemned land; Lawton Chiles vetoed the proposal last year, but
now Gov. Jeb Bush and his new water managers support it. Sen. Bob
Graham has warned that the GAO study will be scathing, and that it
could be a sign of further souring in the federal-state Everglades
``marriage.'' (King, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

FRESH SIGNS OF SPRING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See SPRING-RECIPES) 
(Eds.: Dilip Naik is cq) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Create a spring bouquet of fresh vegetables for your
Easter centerpiece. Anchor the veggies in florist clay in a
container, or make a bridesmaid-style bouquet of baby artichokes,
asparagus, yellow wax beans, radishes, sprouts, parsley and
anything else that strikes your fancy from the produce counters.
Fill in with Queen Anne's Lace. For backing, use a frill of lace or
a doily.
</P>
<P>
   Think about vegetables for cooking, too. The favorite hallmarks
of spring _ artichokes and asparagus _ are joined this year by
several new arrivals, including broccolini, broccoli sprouts and
green gourmet garlic. These new vegetables will inspire culinary
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newcomers have a high nutrition profile and make it
easy to get the five servings a day that nutrition experts would
have us eat to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease and
promote optimum health.
</P>
<P>
   Broccolini
</P>
<P>
   Broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale. Despite
its Italian-sounding name, it was developed in Japan. It is green
with long, slender stalks like kale; the small head of buds at the
top is smaller than broccoli. It was created by Sakata Seed Co. in
Yokohama, Japan, which christened it Asparation for its
asparagus-like stalks.
</P>
<P>
   Sakata was trying to expand its market for broccoli seed because
broccoli requires a cool growing atmosphere. That limits it to
certain times of year and certain locations. It took seven years to
develop the hybrid, which is smaller and more tender than broccoli,
especially the stalk. Tasters found broccolini more elegant than
broccoli. They liked its size and appearance and the fact that the
whole plant is edible.
</P>
<P>
   A California company, Sanbon, also calls broccolini Asparation.
It is much more expensive than broccoli. It is sold at Kroger
Signature stores for $1.69 a bunch (about 8 ounces).
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli sprouts
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli sprouts have 30 to 50 times the concentration of
protective chemicals compared to mature broccoli. A diet rich in
broccoli (and other cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and
cauliflower) is associated with a lower risk of cancer. To halve
the odds of colon cancer, you would have to eat about 2 pounds of
cooked broccoli a week. With broccoli sprouts, 1 ounce a week
provides the same protection as 1 1/4 pounds of broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   This may be good news to those who don't like broccoli, because
the sprouts, which are tender shoots about 2 inches tall, don't
taste like the stronger-flavored mature vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   They also contain phytochemicals, a new buzz word in nutrition
circles. Scientists believe that phytochemicals may be one reason a
diet rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli sprouts are grown from special seeds, adding only water
and light. They contain antioxidants, which help destroy harmful
free radicals in the body. The sprouts were developed by scientists
at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and are marketed as
Fresh Alternatives BroccoSprouts. They were introduced at Kroger
Signature stores in February.
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli sprouts can be used like other sprouts in salads, on
sandwiches or as garnishes.
</P>
<P>
   Green gourmet garlic
</P>
<P>
   A stalk of green gourmet garlic looks like a smaller version of
a green onion with a garlic bulb on the end instead of an onion.
</P>
<P>
   Dilip Naik of Sugar Land, Texas, grew up in Surat in the state
of Gujarat on the west coast of India, where green gourmet garlic
is a staple in the cuisine. Naik missed it when he moved to Houston
to work as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   He realized the climate here is similar to Surat's and began to
grow some of the baby garlic plants for his own use. Recently he
acquired a partner, Jim Butaud of Kirbyville, who is helping expand
the business into a commercial venture. They have set up
greenhouses north of Beaumont, Texas. Naik's Gourmet Country Farm
is in Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   Green gourmet garlic never touches dirt; it is grown in water in
environmentally controlled greenhouses. Although it is grown from
regular garlic cloves, it has a more delicate flavor. It is grown
for the green tops, but the bulbs can be used just as any garlic
bulbs. It's delicious when pureed in a dip. The chopped green tops
can be used as garnish, added to salads, stir-fries or any dish in
which green onions might be used. If the green tops droop, put the
plant in a glass of water and they will revive.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in moist paper towel and stored in a perforated plastic
bag in the vegetable crisper, the green garlic should keep at least
a week, Naik said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston restaurants such as Aldo's, River Oaks Grill and Mark's
are using the green garlic. At Mark's, the whole plant is sometimes
roasted and used as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes
</P>
<P>
   California is the source for almost all the artichokes grown in
the United Sates. The spiky vegetables are hand-harvested. Because
the artichokes on each plant mature at different rates, the fields
are harvested weekly. Artichokes on each plant vary in size from
small to large.
</P>
<P>
   Choose artichokes that are heavy for their size. To prepare,
slice 1/2 inch off the top, and trim the outer, tough leaves. Cut
the stem off flush with the bottom. Rub the cut places with lemon
to prevent discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   To boil, place artichokes snugly in a nonreactive pan (such as
ceramic or stainless steel _ not aluminum or cast-iron) with water
to cover. Also add a squeeze of lemon juice, salt and a teaspoon of
oil. Cover and boil 40 to 50 minutes or until tender. Remove from
pan, and turn upside down to drain.
</P>
<P>
   To steam artichokes, place them upside down in a steamer with
water. Steam 30 to 40 minutes or until tender. The microwave is a
prime appliance for cooking artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare a cooked artichoke for stuffing, pull out the inside
leaves to make a 1 1/2-inch cavity. Scrape out the choke (a
grapefruit knife is handy), but do not pierce the heart.
</P>
<P>
   To eat an artichoke, pull off the outer leaves, one at a time,
and dip in sauce or melted butter. Draw the end of the leaf through
your front teeth, scraping off the edible portion at the base of
each leaf. Discard the leaf.
</P>
<P>
   When you reach a purple- or pink-tipped cone of light-colored
leaves, lift it off and eat the bottom portion. Cut out the
thistlelike choke in the center; discard. Cut the heart into
bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Baby artichokes do not have a thistle, and usually the whole
artichoke can be eaten after any tough outer leaves are discarded.
</P>
<P>
   April is Artichoke Month, and a toll-free artichoke help line
will be set up beginning April 1 by Ocean Mist Farms of
Castroville, Calif., the artichoke capital of the United States.
Dial 877-WE-R-CHOK (937-2465). Artichoke experts will be on duty 9
a.m.-8 p.m. Or access the Internet site (www.oceanmist.com), with
recipes and color photos.
</P>
<P>
   Asparagus
</P>
<P>
   Asparagus is delicious hot or cold, steamed, roasted, grilled or
stir-fried. Some people prefer the pencil-thin spears; others, the
fat jumbo stalks. Marinated and chilled, asparagus makes a
delicious salad. Jumbo spears with lemon butter or Hollandaise make
an elegant first course.
</P>
<P>
   Before cooking, wash asparagus in cold water, and break off
stems as far down as they snap easily. If fibrous or hard, pare
with a vegetable peeler. Leave whole, cut or slice diagonally.
Store covered in refrigerator in plastic bag until used. Do not
wash before storing.
</P>
<P>
   The Food editor prefers microwaving asparagus: Place in glass
loaf pan with tips to the center and stems to outer edges. Cover
dish with lid or plastic wrap. Microwave on high power 6 to 7
minutes per pound. Rotate dish midway through cooking if your
microwave doesn't have a turntable. Let stand 3 minutes. Remove
plastic wrap carefully to prevent steam burns.
</P>
<P>
   To steam: Place asparagus in a skillet or upright in double
boiler. Add boiling water to cover bottom of stalks, cover pan and
cook about 10 to 15 minutes, until just tender. Remove and drain.

   ROASTED ASPARAGUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From ``Vegetables'' by James Peterson (William Morrow, $35).
Peterson writes that roasting is a great technique for cooking
asparagus, especially if it is watery or bland. It does cause some
loss of color, however.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds medium asparagus
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Trim and peel asparagus, toss it in
olive oil and arrange in a baking dish just large enough to hold it
in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast 15 minutes.
Gently toss or push asparagus around with a spoon every 5 minutes
to help it cook evenly. Serve immediately or when cool. Makes 4
first-course or side-dish servings.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled Asparagus
</P>
<P>
   From ``Vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to boil or steam asparagus before grilling. If stalks
are thicker than a pencil, peel them. Toss asparagus with a little
extra-virgin olive oil and fresh chopped herbs such as thyme or
marjoram. Grill only long enough to heat through and brown
slightly, 7 to 12 minutes. Two pounds asparagus will provide 4
generous side-dish servings.

   ASPARAGUS QUICHE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Great for a spring lunch or Easter brunch. From ``Good
Housekeeping Best Recipes 1999'' (William Morrow, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons solid all-vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons plus 4 cups cold water, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Gruyere or Swiss cheese, coarsely shredded (1 cup)
</P>
<P>
   Stir flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt with a fork in a medium bowl.
With pastry blender or 2 knives used scissor-fashion, cut in
margarine with shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle 4 tablespoons water over flour mixture, 1 tablespoon at a
time, mixing lightly with fork after each addition, until dough is
just moist enough to hold together. Shape dough into a disc; wrap
with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes or until firm enough
to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in 2-quart saucepan, heat remaining 4 cups water to
boiling over high heat. Add asparagus and cook 6 to 8 minutes until
tender (or cook in microwave). Drain and rinse with cold running
water. Drain and set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On lightly floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll dough
into a round 11/2 inches larger than diameter than inverted 9-inch
pie plate. Gently ease dough into pie plate; trim edge, leaving a
1-inch overhang. Fold overhang under; bring up over pie plate rim.
Pinch dough to form decorative edge. With fork, prick dough at
1-inch intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Line pie crust with foil; fill with pie weights or dried beans.
Bake pie crust 15 minutes; remove foil with weights. Bake crust 10
minutes longer, or until crust is golden. (If crust puffs up during
baking, gently press it to pie plate with back of spoon.) Reduce
heat to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in medium bowl, with wire whisk or fork, mix eggs,
half-and-half, pepper, nutmeg and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt until
well-blended. Sprinkle asparagus and cheese into crust. Pour
half-and-half mixture over asparagus and cheese. Place sheet of
foil underneath pie plate; crimp foil edges to form a rim to catch
any drips during baking. Bake quiche 40 to 45 minutes, until knife
inserted in center comes out clean. Place on wire rack to cool;
serve at room temperature.

   POTTER-BESTSELLER (Undated) _ For a junior wizard, 11-year-old
Harry Potter has stirred up a steaming cauldron of Hogwart magic.
It has brought him fame, glory and an international copyright tiff.
The fictional Potter has soared into the popular imagination like a
loopy ride on his Nimbus 2000 broom. Last week, the first volume of
his adventures, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' outsold
more sober adult titles by the likes of Tom Wolfe, propelling this
British book to a pinnacle of best-sellerdom in the United States
never before achieved by a children's novel. By Doreen Carvajal.

GALLOS BUILD ON FAMILY LEGACY: A PERFECT WINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first thing you notice about Gina Gallo and her
brother Matt is that these are nice folks.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics would point out that as grandchildren of the late Julio
Gallo, they can afford to be. It was Julio Gallo who, along with
his brother Ernest, built the world's largest winery operation.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who's been interviewing winemakers for nigh on 20
years, I think I can spot a phony, and frankly my (long) list would
have some well-known names on it. But not these Gallo names.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, as the younger generation, they're in the forefront of
transforming Gallo from a jug-wine-only operation _ a wine
refinery, if you will _ into producers of very fine (some even
world-class) wines. Which is taking time (they're young),
dedication (it's obvious) and money (don't even ask).
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive. Gallo has successfully
launched such premium brands as Rancho Zabaco, Indigo Hills and
Anapamu, as well as the Gallo Sonoma single-vineyard wines that
stand up to California's finest. In the process, ``We retooled from
a bulk-wine facility to a fine-wine facility,'' Matt Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Gallo siblings were in Houston recently on a tour
celebrating Gallo's having been named Winery of the Year by Bon
Appetit magazine. The focus of this visit was on a line of wines
called Gallo of Sonoma, a set of several varietals that are
line-priced at $10 retail.
</P>
<P>
   Gina and Matt Gallo stressed that these wines are premium grapes
from top-notch growing areas and vineyards, made in the same way as
their more expensive wine: fermented in French oak barrels, for
example. But they want to keep the prices affordable. ``We want to
bring wine back to the lifestyle, make it just part of the grocery
bill,'' Gina Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we tasted from Gallo of Sonoma:
</P>
<P>
   1997 Gallo of Sonoma Chardonnay _ (4 stars) _ fairly soft, but
with a little zing that comes from Russian River Valley grapes, a
primo spot in Sonoma for chardonnay (and pinot noir).
</P>
<P>
   1997 Zinfandel _ (3-1/2 stars) _ pretty good fruit from Dry
Creek Valley (the mother lode area for zin) and smooth; could use a
little more intensity, though.
</P>
<P>
   1995 Cabernet Sauvignon _ (4 stars) _ nice wine, with good fruit
and no harsh aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Merlot _ (3-1/2 stars) _ good flavor and structure, but,
like the zin, it needs a little more bounce to the ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The merlot and zinfandel are reasonably priced for
what's in the bottle, while the cabernet and chardonnay rate as
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of younger generations, that's who's in charge of a
Sonoma County winery called Seghesio.
</P>
<P>
   Nice folks, nice wines. You may have read about them in this
space before.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cathy Seghesio was in town last week, and we tasted her
family's wines. One of them blew me away. She simply smiled and
said, ``I thought you'd like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a red wine made from the barbera grape. Barbera is an
Italian varietal that for decades was a workhouse blending grape in
California. Some wineries, though, used to make stellar wines from
it. Anybody remember the 1968 Louis Martini Special Selection
Barbera?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Seghesio is an old Sonoma County winery, dating to the
turn of the century. But the label on this new barbera indicated
the grapes came from Mendocino County to the north. Mendocino is
not exactly a hotbed of barbera. What gives, I asked Seghesio, who
does national marketing for the winery?
</P>
<P>
   It seems her husband, Pete Seghesio Jr., the winery's general
manager, wanted to buy some barbera. Problem was, he couldn't
locate any of sufficient quality.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Seghesio continued the story. ``So Pete took out an ad in
the Santa Rosa Press Democrat (the local Sonoma County newspaper)
that said, `Looking for barbera.' Everybody laughed at him, but he
thought he'd give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one day, this man up in Mendocino called and said he'd
been selling his barbera to (a very large winery) that was using
the grapes to blend into their red table wines. He thought his
grapes were better than that, and would Pete like to buy them?
</P>
<P>
   ``So Pete went up, brought back a barrel of barbera. Except that
the man had only put in half a barrel of juice and filled the rest
of the barrel with oak chips. Even so, we could see just how good
those grapes were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we buy all his barbera.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a great story, I said. How much barbera can you make?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 300-400 cases,'' she said. ``We sell most of it in
California. The rest goes to our best markets, which of course
includes Texas. You'll get'' _ she paused and lowered her eyes _
``14 cases.''
</P>
<P>
   That drop in the bucket for a state the size of Texas? I took
one more sip, and Kyle Britt of Prestige Wine Cellars here, who
distributes Seghesio, said, ``Well, there goes the allocation for
your ZIP code ...''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the 1997 Seghesio Barbera _ (5 stars) _ is
loaded to the gunwales with blackberry and blueberry fruit, with a
hint of raspberry. The vanilla from the oak barrels is in four-part
harmony, noticeable but not intrusive. The wine has good structure
but is not harshly tannic. And it has better balance than the
Flying Wallendas. In short, perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, of course, is that (a) it won't be on shelves here
for another couple of weeks, (b) there won't be enough to fill an
eyedropper, and (c) it's pricey at $24.
</P>
<P>
   And worth every cent.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, we also tasted a few other Seghesio wines,
including:
</P>
<P>
   1998 Pinot Grigio _ (4 stars) _ a very nice rendition of a
crisp, flavorful, Italian-varietal white wine. About $14.
</P>
<P>
   1997 Zinfandel (Sonoma County) _ (4-1/2 to 5 stars) _ a rich but
well-balanced, slightly peppery version of California's ``native''
grape. For $10-$11, you won't find a zin to beat this one.
</P>
<P>
   1997 ``Home Ranch'' Zinfandel _ (4-1/2 stars) _ is the best
version of this wine I've had, with gutsy fruit and some sharp
angles, but all in all, a right tasty bottle of zin. ``Bigger''
than the Sonoma County Zin, and a little rougher, but would go
better with grilled meats, for example. About $29.
</P>
<P>
   1997 Keyhole Ranch Pinot Noir _ (3-1/2 stars) _ a pretty big
version of what's usually a delicate grape, this wine was a bit
standoffish to me. The aromatics, so important in pinot noir, were
muted, and the flavor a bit shy, too. Maybe it needs more bottle
age. About $19.
</P>
<P>
   1997 Sangiovese _ (3-1/2 to 4 stars) _ had that nice dusty,
dried-rose-petal nuance, although the fruit could've been a tad
brighter. This is one of the more authentically Italian-tasting
sangioveses from California. About $19.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving Collina's on Richmond, I noticed there was
one more sip left of the barbera, and not wanting it to go to
waste, I helped myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops, there's goes another ZIP code's allocation,'' Britt
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WINE RATING: 5 stars, outstanding; 4 stars, fine; 3 stars, good; 2
stars, fair; 1 star, poor.

 &HT;    The season for giving
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spring may signal the end of cold weather, but it
certainly doesn't mean the end of showers. Between weddings,
graduations, anniversaries and the occasional birth, it's not
unusual to receive a flood of invitations and announcements this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: Each time you open one of those thick, elegant
envelopes, it means you'll probably be buying a gift. And spending
half a day meandering through malls, seeking out that special gift
is a luxury few can afford. But, gift giving needn't be the
time-consuming chore it once was. Thanks to some sophisticated,
computerized gift registries, purchasing the perfect present now
can take less time than deciding which video you're going to watch
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Federated Alliance, the corporation that owns several
department store chains nationwide, including Macy's and Rich's. It
boasts 250 stores, and all are connected to the Federated Gift
Alliance. Through this system, you can actually do your shopping
while stuck in the morning commute, if you have access to a cell
phone and a credit card. For instance, if your cousin is getting
married in California and is registered at Macy's, you can dial up
the nearest store, check out what's on your cousin's list, select
an item and request that it be wrapped and shipped _ all without
having to make the trek to the mall, much less break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, brides continue to top the list of those
signing up for registries.
</P>
<P>
   And, what's on their wish lists?
</P>
<P>
   Traditional household items are still popular, but with a more
casual twist, said Peggy Kocher, Rich's corporate gift registry
manager. ``We now see brides mixing and matching patterns in china
and silverware as well as textiles. Also, some of the makers of
silverware are giving their traditional patterns a new look by
using a matte finish, and that's very popular right now with
brides,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, brides can have their mothers' patterns that have
been tailored to a more contemporary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   At Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond, brides and grooms can register for items
to fill every nook and cranny of their home. The gamut runs from
bedding to cookware and even rose-tinted light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not everyone's in the market for china or crystal these
days,'' says Phyllis Lovelace, Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden Center
manager. She recently implemented a gift registry at the
110-year-old business on Peachtree Road.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for older couples or those in a second
marriage, who might already have the basics. Couples moving into a
new home, in fact, might prefer gifts such as garden tools, bedding
plants, gardening books, trees _ even sod.
</P>
<P>
   At Home Depot, registrants can choose from a vast array of
possibilities, from patio furniture and home-decorating accessories
to faucets and, yes, even the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   Something for everyone
</P>
<P>
   While brides make up the bulk of their registry business,
according to several retailers, expectant parents are increasingly
using this service. So it makes sense that baby gift registries are
becoming easier to find.
</P>
<P>
   Linking their gift registries with all store locations, chains
like Babies ``R'' Us, Toys ``R'' Us and Burlington's Baby Depot
offer convenience for shoppers who live out of the recipient's
area, as well as to mothers-to-be who can list preferences from
cribs to strollers and bottles to booties.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates, too, have climbed onto the registry bandwagon as have
those celebrating anniversaries and birthdays. There's even a trend
toward singles signing up for a year-round registry as a means of
collecting items they want on different gift-giving occasions.
</P>
<P>
   To fill that niche, Borders Books &AMP; Music on Peachtree Road
began a gift registry about a year ago. Here, grads who are media
buffs can sign up to receive their favorite tunes, films or books,
while some couples might prefer to compile a library or finish that
jazz CD collection.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ron Hancock, corporate services representative, the
store is testing this service before offering it at other Borders
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Have scanner, will shop
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't surprise anyone that registering for gifts is
pretty high-tech these days, especially at the large nationwide
chains.
</P>
<P>
   Target stores are hugely popular for their bridal and baby
shower registries and it's commonplace to see a bride or
mother-to-be armed with a hand-held scanner zipping through the
aisles, zapping everything from saucepans and crib sheets to tents
and everyday china.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevin Schmitt, manager of the Target store at North
Point in Alpharetta (GA.), most people take about 30 to 40 minutes
to scan the items they want, then the information gets placed in a
computer linked to all Targets. Those shopping for gifts can go to
a free-standing kiosk at any Target location and get a printout of
the list.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us also uses the scanning system. You might think
that an overzealous youngster would use that scanner like a machine
gun, blasting everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so,'' says Cathy Holden, department head for the juvenile
products and gift registry at the North Point store. ``From my own
experience, I would say that there are occasions where kids get
excited, but the parents are there to control them. Also kids are
pretty specific about what they want,'' she said.

 &HT;    Golf mecca has cultural, artistic assets, too
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Augusta than golf.
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of people will flock to the east Georgia city
from Monday through April 11 for the Masters Tournament, other
attractions await those who are in between rounds or who just don't
want to watch a dimpled little white ball fly through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most interesting _ blending history, culture and
shopping _ are historic Riverwalk, on the banks of the Savannah
River, and Artists' Row on Broad Street. Here you can buy
everything from a blue willow porcelain teapot ($20) at the
Augusta-Richmond County Museum to a bag of Grits Pie Mix ($7) at
Spiffy Miffy's on Broad Street. Both areas are part of the effort
to revitalize the riverfront and downtown with shops, eateries and
galleries that attract visitors and locals alike.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta has long been associated with water. In 1736, Gen. James
Oglethorpe founded the city as a Colonial trading post along the
banks of the Savannah River. The river became the city's commercial
lifeline, carrying cotton, tobacco and other agricultural products
to the seaport of Savannah. However, the river that built Augusta
almost destroyed it. Periodic floods ravaged the city until the
city fathers built dams to regulate the river's flow. In 1913, the
city constructed a 56-foot levee to alleviate flooding in the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Augusta's waterfront had became a blighted
area. During the mid-'80s, community leaders recognized its
potential as a tourist center and began breaking ground for the
development called Riverwalk. By the late '80s, the Shoppes of Port
Royal was opened. The riverfront mall included such upscale stores
as Colette's and Gucci. According to Jeannie Buttrum of the Georgia
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, ``the shopping area was
ahead of its time and proved to be commercially unsuccessful.'' It
closed in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But Riverwalk thrived as a cultural corridor. Today, after an
investment of $16 million, landscaped brick paths, seasonal flowers
and historical markers make it a place to enjoy concerts and
festivals or simply watch the water flow by.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The river) is calm, tranquil and has become a centerpiece of
the community,'' said Rebecca B. Rogers, director of communications
with the Augusta Metropolitan Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes referred to as Augusta's front porch, Riverwalk runs
from Fifth to 10th streets. Although a few souvenir shops dot the
area _ the Dock, Magnolia's on the River _ the riverfront is
essentially home to several museums with interesting gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   Begin your shopping foray at the Historic Cotton Exchange
Welcome Center &AMP; Museum (32 Eighth St.). In 1886, members of the
Augusta Cotton Exchange built this red brick structure that was
used by brokers until 1964. Tour the museum, pick up information
about activities in town and take home a souvenir of a miniature
bale of cotton ($2) or a burlap bag filled with cotton seeds ($4).
Also at the Welcome Center, you can order shirts and sweaters, caps
and visors from the Augusta National Golf Club. Pick up the
merchandise at the club gate or have it mailed to you.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite with kids of all ages is Fort Discovery/The National
Science Center (1 Seventh St.), which offers more than 250
interactive exhibits. Here you can walk on the moon, get videotaped
being chased by a dinosaur or fly a simulated jet. On a more
down-to-earth note, Jonathan Brandt, 8, from Columbia, S.C., was
exploring the science gift store on a recent Saturday morning. He
loved the policeman-shaped puppets ($18.95) and pronounced the
glow-in-the-dark yo-yo ($3.50) ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   For a different type of experience, visit the Morris Museum of
Art (1 10th St.). Housed in the Riverfront Center, it contains a
permanent collection that surveys 200 years of painting in the
South. In its gift shop, visitors will find a treasure-trove of
goodies designed or made by Southern artists, such as a salt-glazed
pottery vase ($75) designed by Ben Owen III of Seagrove, N.C., or a
hand-blown glass ornament ($14.95) by Loretta Eby of Watkinsville.
</P>
<P>
   After doing Riverwalk, stroll two blocks south to Broad Street,
the main business street of Augusta. Its sunken, median parking was
designed by noted architect I.M. Pei in 1975 as part of a
redevelopment program.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Broad Street's current renovation project is
Artists' Row, located in the 1000 block. Here, 14 visual artists
have revitalized the street by working and living in their studios,
many of which are warehouses more than 100 years old. A wide
variety of mediums is represented: paintings in watercolor, acrylic
and oil; porcelain painting; basket-making and pottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just celebrated our fifth anniversary,'' said artist
Will Fahnoe. ``Artists' Row was started by the city as a way to
recoup business for downtown. In the late '70s and '80s, businesses
fled to the malls. Many of these buildings were left empty.
Ceilings collapsed. We had to rewire. It was awful. I spent three
months just doing demolition. But the city has been wonderful,
paying rents in the first year. And exteriors have been renovated
as part of the Facade Grant Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy a building today,'' he said. ``The artists have
turned the street into gold.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the original artists, photographer Tom Barrett, remembers
that five years ago he had 35 black-and-white pictures in his
gallery Studio Fotografica. Today, he represents four photographers
and has more than 170 photographs. ``We have a way to go,'' says
Barrett. ``But restaurants are coming in and studios are offering
classes. Broad is bringing locals and tourists downtown again.''
</P>
<P>
   What's really attracting attention is First Friday. From 5-9
p.m. on the first Friday of each month, galleries and studios open
their doors and provide food and music. Each month, 800 to 1,000
locals and tourists take advantage of this laid-back way to view
new exhibitions and buy art.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing through the galleries, Gina and Mohammed Omari of
Augusta summed up what they liked best. ``Everything is so
diverse,'' she said, ``and all the art is done by local artisans.
That's what makes Artists' Row so special.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take 1-20 east to Riverwatch Parkway (Exit 66).
At the stoplight, turn left onto Riverwatch Parkway and proceed
downtown. Turn left on 10th Street, then right on Reynolds Street
to the Historic Cotton Exchange Welcome Center at 32 Eighth St.
Riverwalk is right here, and Broad Street is one street south.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ last week, in fact _ we went to war to save
the Kosovo Albanians. After months of negotiating and a thousand
broken promises, NATO's patience was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to teach the Serbs a lesson and _ dare we suggest it
_ revenge ourselves on Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic, not
just for Kosovo, but for the years of Western humiliation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was for the Kosovars, the 90-percent Muslim population of
Serbia's Kosovo province, that we would draw the sword.
</P>
<P>
   And our war is turning into disaster. The moment NATO's bombs
and missiles began to fall, the Serbs struck ruthlessly against the
Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being helped by NATO and NATO is our enemy and now
the Albanians are calling up NATO's air strikes,'' a young Serb
official snapped angrily at me on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovars _ from being merely recalcitrant or, at
worst, ``terrorists'' _ have now become fifth columnists. And fifth
columns are always destroyed by occupying armies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has come about what NATO now admits to be the greatest
humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. And already we are
being deceitful to both the victims and the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of the first air strikes _ when it became clear
that the Serbs were ``cleansing'' their way through Kosovo; when
the first 20,000 refugees washed up on the frontiers of Macedonia
and Albania _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, the architect (along
with Richard Holbrooke) of this particular adventure, made an
astonishing statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bloodshed would have been ``even worse'' if
NATO had not intervened. And he assured the American people that
U.S. troops would only be sent into Kosovo in a peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   How happy President Milosovic must have been to hear that.
Already, Clinton was making excuses for NATO's air raids _ and then
promising that ground troops would never be sent to fight Serbian
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's army pressed on eagerly. And when the next flood
of Kosovars staggered into Macedonia with their stories of summary
executions and house-burning, we were told yet again that things
would have been worse without the air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO admitted that 500,000 Kosovars had been displaced,
this lie was mercifully forgotten. Instead, the air raids would be
increased, the rules of engagement broadened, in order to end
Serbia's ``scorching'' of Kosovo's earth. The fruits of war had now
become the reason for its enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible formula has now emerged, one that the Kosovo Albanian
leadership is only beginning to understand. We in the West cared so
much for their people's suffering that we went to war to end their
grief and bring them peace. But we would not risk the life of a
single soldier to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Wilhelm's policy _ that the Balkans were not worth the
life of a single Prussian grenadier _ has been adopted to the
letter by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even as distraught women were entering Skopje with tales of the
execution of intellectuals in Pristina, a British officer
vouchsafed the opinion in Macedonia that ``we are here simply to
implement a peace agreement and that's what we will do, if (sic)
and when we get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So, more comfort for President Milosevic. However reasonable
this sounds in Washington and London, the message for the Serbs is
clear. NATO _ supposedly the iron shield of Western democracy in
the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe _ cannot even
defeat Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The men who were trained to defend the Fulder Gap against
Moscow's legions are going to sit it out in the hills of Macedonia
_ to act as peacekeepers ``when they get the chance.''

<P>
   Instead, we seek more monsters to justify our continued war.
George Robertson, Britain's beloved defense secretary, has
reintroduced the world to the arch-villain Arkan, ``ethnic
cleanser'' par excellence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arkan is an indicted war criminal. Robertson spent some
time dwelling upon the deeds of this ``outrageous thug.'' But the
fact is that Arkan's cruelty was made manifest in Bosnia, not in
Kosovo. There is no evidence _ so far _ that his ``Tigers'' are
murdering Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NATO itself cannot be humiliated on the eve of its
50th birthday. This was one of the raisons d'etre of this war over
the weekend. Presumably, we would have been less keen to bomb
Serbia if it were the 49th birthday or the 51st birthday...
</P>
<P>
   There is, needless to say, one very clear way that NATO could
show its teeth _ by arresting two Serb warlords even more infamous
than Arkan: General Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadjic.
</P>
<P>
   How strange that Robertson didn't mention those two indicted war
criminals last week. Why didn't he? Because he forgot? Or because
Mladic and Karadjic happen to reside in Bosnia, in a district
controlled by the very NATO troops whose reputation must be
defended by going to war with Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Robertson order their immediate arrest? Is it
because such arrests might be resisted, and NATO lives lost? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; COPY RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told us, too, that if we didn't continue the
war against Serbia, then we would see repeated ``what happened in
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   The West has every reason to feel humiliated by its performance
in the face of evil in Bosnia. And to blame Milosevic as one of
those who shamed us _ and let's not muddy the waters by remembering
the ruthless Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's ``cleansing'' of
170,000 Serbs from Krajina _ is fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   But to go to war to avenge ourselves for the Bosnian war was
folly. And it is becoming ever more clear that this is partly what
NATO's first-ever conflict is about. It is about getting our own
back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we are enduring the usual half-truths. Before America
bombed Libya in 1986 and Iraq in 1991, Washington insisted that it
had no argument with the ``Libyan/Iraqi people.'' President Clinton
said the same after he bombed Afghanistan and Sudan last year.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, just days ago, the Americans _ joined this time
by the British _ repeated the same old lament. We had nothing
against the Serbian people. It was just ``Milosevic's murder
machine'' that we hated. But, again, our hatred was not enough to
die for. &QL;

   In the next few days, two possible scenarios are likely to
present themselves to President Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   One will be to grit their teeth and go for the kind of haven
created for the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1991. The other is to pay
a humble visit to the Secretary General of that poor old donkey,
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be costly _ Serbia has promised to fight an
invader, not slink away as Iraq did after the Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO troops were to get involved in a firefight in Kosovo, it
would betray every promise that Clinton made to the Americans.
Bodies would probably come home in coffins. But the promise to the
Kosovo Albanians would have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be an experience deeply humbling to all the
armchair warriors who have been preaching the morality of war to us
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course, President Milosevic may capitulate. Or he may be
overthrown. But if he does not give up, NATO commanders may have to
decide whether to put their soldiers' lives on the line for the
policies of their governments, or hand the cause of peace in Europe
to the U.N.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ last week, in fact _ we went to war to save
the Kosovo Albanians. After months of negotiating and a thousand
broken promises, NATO's patience was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to teach the Serbs a lesson and _ dare we suggest it
_ revenge ourselves on Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic, not
just for Kosovo, but for the years of Western humiliation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was for the Kosovars, the 90-percent Muslim population of
Serbia's Kosovo province, that we would draw the sword.
</P>
<P>
   And our war is turning into disaster. The moment NATO's bombs
and missiles began to fall, the Serbs struck ruthlessly against the
Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being helped by NATO and NATO is our enemy and now
the Albanians are calling up NATO's air strikes,'' a young Serb
official snapped angrily at me on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovars _ from being merely recalcitrant or, at
worst, ``terrorists'' _ have now become fifth columnists. And fifth
columns are always destroyed by occupying armies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has come about what NATO now admits to be the greatest
humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. And already we are
being deceitful to both the victims and the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of the first air strikes _ when it became clear
that the Serbs were ``cleansing'' their way through Kosovo; when
the first 20,000 refugees washed up on the frontiers of Macedonia
and Albania _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, the architect (along
with Richard Holbrooke) of this particular adventure, made an
astonishing statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bloodshed would have been ``even worse'' if
NATO had not intervened. And he assured the American people that
U.S. troops would only be sent into Kosovo in a peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   How happy President Milosovic must have been to hear that.
Already, Clinton was making excuses for NATO's air raids _ and then
promising that ground troops would never be sent to fight Serbian
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's army pressed on eagerly. And when the next flood
of Kosovars staggered into Macedonia with their stories of summary
executions and house-burning, we were told yet again that things
would have been worse without the air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO admitted that 500,000 Kosovars had been displaced,
this lie was mercifully forgotten. Instead, the air raids would be
increased, the rules of engagement broadened, in order to end
Serbia's ``scorching'' of Kosovo's earth. The fruits of war had now
become the reason for its enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible formula has now emerged, one that the Kosovo Albanian
leadership is only beginning to understand. We in the West cared so
much for their people's suffering that we went to war to end their
grief and bring them peace. But we would not risk the life of a
single soldier to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Wilhelm's policy _ that the Balkans were not worth the
life of a single Prussian grenadier _ has been adopted to the
letter by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even as distraught women were entering Skopje with tales of the
execution of intellectuals in Pristina, a British officer
vouchsafed the opinion in Macedonia that ``we are here simply to
implement a peace agreement and that's what we will do, if (sic)
and when we get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So, more comfort for President Milosevic. However reasonable
this sounds in Washington and London, the message for the Serbs is
clear. NATO _ supposedly the iron shield of Western democracy in
the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe _ cannot even
defeat Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The men who were trained to defend the Fulder Gap against
Moscow's legions are going to sit it out in the hills of Macedonia
_ to act as peacekeepers ``when they get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   We cry for the Kosovo Albanians. Perhaps we even love them. But
we will not die for them. &QL;

   If NATO troops were to get involved in a firefight in Kosovo, it
would betray every promise that Clinton made to the Americans.

   Yes, of course, President Milosevic may capitulate. Or he may be
overthrown. But if he does not give up, NATO commanders may have to
decide whether to put their soldiers' lives on the line for the
policies of their governments, or hand the cause of peace in Europe
to the U.N.

COULD AMERICA FIGHT A WAR? CONGRESS, PENTAGON QUESTION MILITARY'S
DEPTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's military readiness has sharply eroded and
its armed forces are spread dangerously thin because of such
international operations as NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
many lawmakers and Pentagon planners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What valuable dollars will be taken away from military
readiness accounts to pay for this?'' asked Sen. Jim Bunning of
Kentucky, one of several Republican senators who have complained
about the latest military operation in the troubled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, added, ``Just where is the
money going to come from? Is it going to come from other defense
accounts, so other places in the world where we have troops are put
at risk?''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Clinton administration has spent
adequately to maintain the Pentagon's war-fighting capability as
the U.S. military is used increasingly as a world police force.
Since President Clinton took office Jan. 20, 1993, the U.S.
military has been pressed into action about 60 times in such places
as Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The constant wear and tear on weapons, the expenditure of
ammunition and ordnance and the human stress resulting from long
separations of soldiers from their families is all part of the
equation. Weapons have to be maintained and replaced, bullets and
bombs have to be replenished, and military personnel must have
enough down time to keep the armed forces at peak efficiency,
lawmakers and top officers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now that we are in the same situation we
were in the late 1970s with the hollow force,'' said Sen. James
Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee
on readiness. ``We can't afford to dilute our military strength any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. Richard Hawley, who directs the Air Combat
Command, said, ``Funding has simply not kept pace with the demands
on our force. Mission capable rates have slowly declined since
1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, defense spending has declined
dramatically, dropping from $358 billion in 1990 to a projected
$267 billion in fiscal 2000. During the Cold War, spending on the
Pentagon averaged about $320 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that funding issues should not keep the United States
from carrying out its international obligations as the world's sole
surviving superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that we are a European power,'' said Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del. ``For 54 years, we have kept as many as
365,000 troops in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some staunch supporters of President Clinton caution
that America's military might needs some shoring up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stability of the entire planet depends on the readiness
and availability of the U.S. armed forces,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb. ``We should not fritter them away in peacekeeping missions
in countries which do not rise to the level of vital American
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad are things at the Pentagon?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Air Force says that, as of Feb. 1, it had a shortage of
855 pilots, and that number is expected to grow to nearly 2,000 by
Jan. 1. Pilots cite frequent operations as a top reason for
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 25 percent of the Air Force's F-15 fighter planes need
repair at any given time and only 54 percent of its B-1B bomber
fleet is usable, prompting both planes to be called ``hangar
queens.'' ``We have one-third of our aircraft broken at all
times,'' said Maj. Monty Diehl, a maintenance officer at Langley
Air Force Base, Va.
</P>
<P>
   _ The grounding of Air Force planes because of a shortage of
parts has jumped more than 50 percent since 1990, and stripping
planes for parts, called ``cannibalization,'' has jumped 78 percent
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Navy's Atlantic Fleet says it is short 7,600 sailors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Marines' amphibious assault vehicles are, on average, 28
years old. Marine trucks and artillery vehicles are 17 years old,
on average. The CH-46, the Marine helicopter to be replaced by Bell
Helicopter's V-22 Osprey, is, on average, 31 years old. ``Some of
our airframes are older than their pilots,'' said Lt. Gen. Peter
Pace, commander of the Marine's Atlantic forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, since Operation Desert Storm, has cut eight divisions
and 630,000 troops. But it is facing deployments, Army officials
say, at rates that are four times what they were during the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment and retention has become such a troubling issue for
the Pentagon that some lawmakers have begun talking about
reinstating the draft. Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., told a House
panel last year that too many people are escaping their civic duty.
``There are benefits to a draft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days before the airstrikes in Yugoslavia began,
Pentagon chiefs were telling a House Armed Services subcommittee
that America's war machine is showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Clinton's plans to boost Pentagon spending by $112
billion over the next five years, Hawley of the Air Force and other
top commanders say the figure is $50 billion too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixing readiness is not unlike trying to turn the Titanic _ it
takes a long time for even large rudder inputs to have a noticeable
effect,'' Hawley said. ``The funding increases are not sufficient
to fix all our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr. said the drop in troop numbers,
coupled with the increase in operations, is spreading America's
forces too thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have downsized our military forces while using them
more frequently, maintaining our readiness is more difficult than
during the Cold War,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The readiness debate needs to go on until we find a way to
appropriately fund the right mix of operations and training,
modernization and quality of life, spare parts and engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace, the Marine commander, said the corps has jumped through
hoops to maintain its status as the nation's ``911 force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified and exploited all available efficiencies,''
he said. ``We implemented improved business practices by reducing
inventories, saved on spares and parts by buying used items and
even manufacturing our own.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in Washington say they believe that the Pentagon must
share in the blame for its problems and that it has done little to
cut costs on big-dollar procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, for example, has been a regular
critic of Pentagon procurement programs, accusing several,
including Lockheed Martin's F-22 program and Boeing's FA-18E/F, of
being over budget and off schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, recently noted that
the Army bought thousands of trucks that were delivered behind
schedule and $100 million over budget. Moreover, the trucks' cabs
began rusting before the vehicles left the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO criticized the Army for selecting Stewart &AMP; Stevenson
Services Inc., a Houston-based company, for the work in 1991. It
noted that the company had no experience in building trucks or
combat vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Liesl Heeter, a defense budget analyst with the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington, said Pentagon
readiness, by many measures, has declined. But she added that the
Defense Department ``has pretty high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. always has a very big advantage,'' she said.

SUPPLY PROBLEMS PUMP UP GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 and KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gasoline prices in California rose sharply in
March to per-gallon averages of $1.31 in Los Angeles and $1.61 in
San Francisco, increases that were spurred by two recent refinery
fires and rising worldwide oil costs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, gas prices have jumped 31 cents per gallon since March
11 in Northern California, and 14 cents per gallon in Southern
California, according to the California State Automobile
Association, an affiliate of the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices at the pump remain remarkably low in much of the
country, a plan by the world's leading oil producing nations to
tighten supplies is expected to drive up the price of fuel even
before the peak summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average price for regular self-serve unleaded
gasoline is $1.08 per gallon, an AAA spokesman said Wednesday. The
cost in Hawaii is $1.54 and in California as a whole, $1.48.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki said he would ask the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate gas pricing, adding that
the San Francisco Bay area had always been the ``cash cow'' for oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to take any of their explanations anymore,'' Yaki
said. ``What's pretty clear is that any excuse will do to afford
the oil companies an excuse to gouge the people of the Bay area.
We've had refinery fires and explosions in the past and oil tankers
running aground and we've never had a price spike like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The price spike in Northern California is attributed in part to
two recent refinery fires _ one at a Tosco Refining Co. plant, the
other at a Chevron refinery. Problems at the plants in Northern
California mean companies must to turn to out-of-state suppliers
for gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shipments are only scheduled to come through by
mid-April,'' said Susanne Garfield, a spokeswoman for the
California Energy Commission. ``That's good news. Having more of
the product on the market will ease fear and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that supply arrives, the laws of supply and demand will
drive up the cost around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors also are contributing to the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil jumped almost $3 a barrel when members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last month to
cut production and reduce the world's oil glut.
</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists said gas prices are generally higher in
Northern California because there are fewer gas stations due in
part to high land costs.
</P>
<P>
   And gasoline prices are typically higher in California because
of strict federal pollution regulations that require use of
cleaner-burning fuels.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Mike Ross eased his Mitsubishi Galant into a
Texaco gas station Tuesday, took a look at the prices _ $1.67 to
$1.87 a gallon, depending on the grade _ and whipped out his cell
phone to complain about the prices to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reluctantly pumped a few dollars of gas. ``Let me put it
this way _ this is all I've got,'' he said, holding a crumpled $5
bill and a couple of dollar bills. ``And I'm not going to buy any
more than I have to at $1.67 a gallon.''

JUST TRY TO GUESS WHAT ROCK &AMP; RYE IS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When my sister and I were growing up in Detroit, we always
ordered Faygo Rock &AMP; Rye. Is that soft drink still available?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.W., Redwood City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rock &AMP; Rye and other Faygo flavors can be ordered by calling
the Faygo Pop Shop at (248) 865-4767 or by visiting the World Wide
Web site www.faygo.com. Eight 2-liter bottles sell for $10.99, and
24 12-ounce cans for $8.99.
</P>
<P>
   Faygo was started in 1907 as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works.
Founders Ben and Perry Feigenson used icing and baking recipes to
create the first three flavors: fruit punch, strawberry and grape.
They added Rock &AMP; Rye in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s the company adopted the Faygo name and moved to
Detroit, where it still operates. Redpop is Faygo's No. 1 flavor,
and Rock &AMP; Rye is still in the top five, according to a company
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the last time the Sacramento Kings finished a season
with a winning record?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.S., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The last winning record was a 45-37 finish in the 1982-83
season, when the franchise was the Kansas City Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Drew and Eddie Johnson were the star players on the team,
which did not make the playoffs. Teams with losing records reached
the first round of the National Basketball Association postseason
in 1985-86 and 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the last winning season, the Kings were sold for
$10.5 million to a Sacramento group. After suffering several years
of declining attendance in Kansas City, the franchise moved to
California in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who set an NBA record with their 15th consecutive
losing season last year, sold out every game in Sacramento from
1985 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have Blythe Danner and her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow ever
worked together on a film?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.D., Whitehall, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Internet Movie Database turns up one project: the 1992 TV
miniseries ``Cruel Doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner and Paltrow portray mother and daughter in the two-part
movie, which was Paltrow's third film appearance.
</P>
<P>
   They also provided voices for the 1997 Ken Burns documentary
``Thomas Jefferson'' and starred together in several plays at the
Williamstown Theatre.

THE `ICEMAN' OF KEVIN SPACEY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Spacey, resplendent in black, from T-shirt to
running shoes, is sitting amid the empty seats of the Brooks
Atkinson Theater, watching the international scrum of lugs, louts
and losers who frequent Harry Hope's bar in ``The Iceman Cometh''
by Eugene O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   He snorts in amusement, as if startled by a line he has never
heard. He throws his head back and cackles. He leans toward the
actors rehearsing onstage as if eavesdropping on a particularly
juicy bit of conversation, jabs his right fist up and down in the
cadence of the lines being spoken, huddles with the director,
Howard Davies, and then bounds toward the rear of the theater,
springing off the balls of his feet like a sprinter ready for a
race.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey spent much of the last year in London playing Hickey in
the critically acclaimed Almeida Theater production of ``The Iceman
Cometh'' on which the current American revival _ opening on
Thursday on Broadway _ is based. As the salesman turned would-be
savior around whom the work revolves, he must have seen, heard and
mouthed every line of O'Neill's epic bull moose of a play so often
that it is difficult to imagine what he could find new and
startling in a routine rehearsal. Yet the fact that he still
responds intensely to lines he has lived with so long may be as
revealing as Spacey gets.
</P>
<P>
   A respected and prize-winning stage actor, he is probably best
known for, and at times hard to differentiate from, the dark,
somewhat mysterious characters _ all chilly control and sheen on
the surface, all menace and surprise underneath _ that he has
played in films. These include ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Swimming
With Sharks,'' ``L.A. Confidential,'' ``Hurlyburly,'' and ``The
Usual Suspects,'' which won him an Oscar for best supporting actor
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one place where his agenda seems transparent, it
is on the level of pure craft and the laserlike focus he has on
acting, the theater and O'Neill's seldom-staged epic, which has
arrived amid expectations so high that they may make even him a bit
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a thousand little reasons why this matters so
much,'' he said one recent Sunday morning, picking at his French
toast in a hotel restaurant in the theater district. ``But
basically, to be part of a production where this play gets heard
and people respond to it is something maybe you do once in a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's crazy. The play has everything going against
it. It's too long, it's clunky, it's got all its difficulties. But
one reason I've fallen in love with it is because O'Neill not only
knew these people, he loved them, and he wrote about them with
clarity and with an outrageous sense of humor that allows them to
rib each other and be in on their own joke. You don't get many
chances to expose people to a play like this. It's a gift and a
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's blowsy barroom meditation on hope, dreams and
illusions is indeed a rare beast, a drama running more than four
hours with a cast of 19 actors on one set (designed on Broadway, as
in London, by Bob Crowley). The length and cost of staging it are
so off-putting that its one classic rendition remains the famous
Circle in the Square revival of 1956. Directed by Jose Quintero and
starring Jason Robards as Theodore (Hickey) Hickman, it brought
O'Neill's work back to life and inspired the Off Broadway movement.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent versions have included Hickeys as diverse as James
Earl Jones and Brian Dennehy, but few have attracted the attention
of the recent production in England. The play began at the
experimental Almeida in North London and earned both Spacey and
Davies Olivier the Evening Standard and London Critics' Circle
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh,'' written in 1939 and first staged on
Broadway in 1946, recreates the world of Jimmy the Priest's bar on
Fulton Street, where O'Neill hung out, drank and attempted suicide
in 1912, when he was 24. The play begins by introducing its
sprawling cast of oddly likable down-and-out boozehounds who
stumble onstage one by one and, for the most part, immediately pass
out, while the audience filters into the Brooks Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   The characters will spin their pipe dreams in this prefiguring
of both ``Waiting for Godot'' and ``Death of a Salesman,'' as they
await the arrival of Hickey, a salesman coming in for his annual
binge.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives promising salvation through the shock therapy of
truth, only to find that his own life and the experience of the
barroom fraternity seem to indicate that life without illusions can
turn out to be no life at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh'' is famously rigorous: hopeless without
both a bravura Hickey and an ensemble with the seamless chemistry
of a bunch of barroom drunks.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, with thinning black hair, an oval face and his air of
being at once imperturbable and opaque, Spacey seems an ideal
Hickey, all coiled energy and high-speed verbal pyrotechnics, able
to do U-turns in the middle of a sentence and switch moods without
missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his boyhood in New Jersey and California. His father
was a writer of technical manuals, his mother a secretary; Spacey
was enough of a smoking pistol to be shipped off to military
school, from where he was soon expelled. In high school in
California, he found himself drawn to acting and has since
channeled most of his rogue energies in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as a stand-up comic, he turned to acting on the
stage, where by now he has a long history that includes the role of
the older son, Jamie Tyrone, in Jonathan Miller's Broadway and
London production of O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night''
with Jack Lemmon in 1986. (Robards played Jamie in the Broadway
premiere in 1956.) Spacey won a Tony Award in 1991 for his
portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's ``Lost in Yonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to split his energies between theater and film, but
even so an excursion into ``The Iceman Cometh'' struck him as
wildly improbable at first. When Jonathan Kent, the co-artistic
director of the Almeida, called him about doing the play, ``My
reaction was: `What? You want me to do what?,''' the actor said,
spitting out the word as if he had been asked to do Hamlet in
Russian. ``It seemed, you know, a little heady.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spacey had always wanted to work with Davies, who had tried
to hire him when Alan Rickman was leaving the Broadway production
of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' in 1987. So before Spacey knew it,
he was on his way to London, carrying a paperback copy of
``Iceman'' that is now as battered and dog-eared as an old family
Bible, and that seems to have become a permanent appendage of his
person.

<P>
   Since the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the Qumran area of
Israel, the question of who wrote these biblical and secular texts
has puzzled scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as the archeological find of the century, the scrolls
supposedly are the oldest copies of most of the Old Testament and
sectarian writings. Scholars have theorized that they were written
by the ``Essenes,'' an ascetic brotherhood of bishops and laymen
with strict rules of behavior that existed long before the birth of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence that the Essene sect was not established
until after the time of Christ. If the Dead Sea Scrolls are indeed
pre-Christian documents, the Essenes could not have written them.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, scholars who
questioned the truth of the Bible developed the Essene theory to
account for the origins of Christianity. They speculated that it
sprang from a sect of pre-Christian Jews. These scholars also
suggested that John the Baptist and Jesus himself were Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere in the New Testament are the Essenes mentioned,
though other sects are, including the Zealots, Herodians, Sadducees
and Pharisees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the writers of the Scrolls never called themselves
``Essenes,'' but referred to themselves as ``the poor'' or ``poor
in spirit,'' which also happen to be terms applied to the early
followers of Jesus. Even Lawrence Schiffman, a noted Dead Sea
Scroll scholar, has gone so far as to say that the writers of the
scrolls should not be referred to as ``Essenes'' but as the
``Qumran sect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, scholars who believe in the antiquity of the
Scrolls claim they were written by the Essenes in a writing house
-- a scriptorium -- in Qumran near the caves where the first
scrolls were found. World renowned Hebrew paleographer M. Bezalel
Narkis, however, notes in La Paleographie Hebraique Medievale that,
``One should take into consideration the fact that Jews never had
monastic scriptoria ... . Only since the 13th century is there some
evidence of larger workshops headed by scribes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The records of historians Pliny and Philo, who were writing in
the decades after Jesus' death, include sketchy details about
sects.
</P>
<P>
   Dead Sea Scroll scholars combined several sects into one that
they inferred to be the Essenes in order to account for the
authorship of the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the same period, also
wrote about such a sect, calling its members city dwellers who
lived in ``every town in Israel.'' They didn't live in the desert
or wilderness, like the Dead Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, respected Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld
created a stir by asserting that Essenes lived not at Qumran, but
at Ein Gedi, a Dead Sea community 20 miles south of Qumran. But
Hirschfeld said he found a striking similarity between that
community and the monasteries built centuries later by Byzantine
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Pick, also an archaeologist and the dean of arts and
sciences at Columbia Pacific University in California, added a nail
to the coffin of the Essene theory when he told Newsday in 1997,
``The most telling thing was there was no synagogue at the Qumran
site.''
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jews, he said, built synagogues at sites where
they lived for only a few years, such as the fortress at Masada.
Why, Pick asks, wouldn't the Essenes have built a synagogue at
Qumran where they supposedly lived for more than 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   OSSAEANS, NOT ESSENES
</P>
<P>
   But people called ``Ossaeans'' did live along the northern
shores of the Dead Sea after AD 68. Some scrolls scholars believe
they were the Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius, a church father of the third and fourth centuries
AD, wrote that the ``so-called heresy of the Ossaeans ...
originated from the regions of Nabataea and Ituraea, Moabitis and
Arielitis, from the regions that are situated at the other side of
the lake that in the Holy Scripture is called Dead Sea.'' The fact
that Epiphanius calls them a ``heresy'' suggests that they had a
Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups lived not far away in the Golan Heights region.
Claudine Dauphin, a French archeologist, found that Judeo-Christian
sects emerged after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 and continued
into the medieval period.
</P>
<P>
   ``At two of the sites,'' she wrote, ``we started finding bizarre
stuff -- Christian symbols intertwined with Jewish symbols ... like
a menorah covered by a ship, representing the church, whose mast
was a cross, or a lulav (palm branch) whose top branches formed a
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why I found lameds (the Hebrew ``L'') with the
top part turned into a cross in the Copper Scroll (one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls). Or why there are X's in the margins of messianic
passages that speak of the Messiah on the Isaiah Scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Another important clue in the search for the Essenes is offered
by Athanase Negoitsa in Revue de Qumran. He writes of a document by
Nilus the Ascetic of the fourth century AD that indicates the
Essenes lived then. Nilus praises their ``meditative and lofty
moral life.'' But he regrets that the Essenes do not follow in the
true philosophy of the gospel of Christ, implying that they were a
heretical Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a source that clearly states the Essenes originated in
the Christian period and not before?
</P>
<P>
   CALLED ``NAZARENES''
</P>
<P>
   We know from the writings of the Church Fathers that the Jews
who believed in Jesus were called ``Nazarenes'' and that they kept
the laws of Moses and the customs of the Jewish people. That
dispels the gentile myth that the Jewish people rejected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Honorius Augustodunensis stated, ``The Nazoraeans
are so called after the village Nazareth. These confess that Christ
is the Son of God but they observe everything in the old Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the New Testament book of Acts clearly
brings out that not only did large numbers of Pharisees, but also
``a great company of priests [Sadducees] had turned to the Lord.''
We also find in the book of Acts that entire Jewish cities, such as
Lydda and Sharon, accepted Jesus the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the Church Fathers that even in the later
centuries -- like the fourth and fifth centuries AD -- Jewish
followers of Messiah still existed and did not deny their heritage.
If the name for Jewish believers was ``Nazarenes,'' what then were
the gentiles called who received Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We read in Acts of the Apostles (11:26) that the gentiles who
believed in Jesus were called ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the time of the first gentile believer (Cornelius)
and the time that large numbers of gentiles in Antioch were
converted, what name differentiated gentiles?
</P>
<P>
   I found the following statement in Epiphanius: ``All Christians
were called Nazoraeans [Nazarenes] once. For a short time they were
given also the name Iessaeans, before the disciples in Antioch
began to be called Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius thus contradicts the theory that the Essenes were a
pre-Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But is he a reliable source? If he is, why have his words on the
subject been ignored? Why, as Negoitsa brings out, do ``...many
Qumranologists (Dead Sea Scroll scholars) take no account of
Epiphanius...?''
</P>
<P>
   They surely must have found, as I did, the references in
Epiphanius that show the Essene sect did not come into existence
until after the death of Jesus. A noted Qumranologist has revealed
that ``older scholars will prefer to ignore the new materials: the
ferment they produce is too strong for their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just ``new material'' but anything that goes against
the ``accepted theory.'' Four decades ago, Jewish writer and
scholar Solomon Zeitlin said anyone who challenged accepted Dead
Sea Scroll theories was regarded as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars regard Epiphanius as an extremely important
source. In ``Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' German scholar
Rainer Riesner states, ``According to reliable tradition in
Epiphanius, the Jewish Christian community left the Holy City at
the outbreak of the Jewish War (AD 66-70) to settle at Pella in the
Decapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Negoitsa writes: ``Epiphanius was born in Palestine ... spoke
five languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Coptic, and Aramaic. Thus he
was able to read all the documents and writings ... (had) precise
information regarding the sects of Palestine and especially those
in the region harboring the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Negoitsa doesn't mention Epiphanius' statements about
``Iessaeans.'' What is the derivation of this Greek word, and does
this have any bearing on Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Comfort, professor of Greek and New Testament at Wheaton
College and Senior Bible editor at Tyndale Publishing House, states
that the word ``Iessaeans'' or ``Essenes'' comes from the Greek
word ``Iessaios,'' which means Jesse, the father of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians may have called themselves this because
the Messiah was called the Son of Jesse (Isaiah 11:10, Romans
15:12),'' wrote Comfort, whose analysis offers further insight into
Epiphanius' statements that the Essenes were a Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   How then could the Essenes be the writers of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which supposedly date as far back as 300 BC?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the scrolls ``merely revived [this] old, long
discarded theory,'' claims Millar Burrows in More Light on the Dead
Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ON JESUS
</P>
<P>
   Scroll scholar A. Dupont-Sommer explains that the Essene theory
was a product of 18th-century biblical criticism. It speculated
that Jesus ``was imbued with Essene ethics, which in their turn,
owe much to Zeno,'' a Greek philosopher of the fifth century BC.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Essene Writings from Qumran,'' Dupont-Sommer says the
Christian apologists saw this philosophy as ``a weapon, a devilish
theory designed to sap the originality and transcendence of
Christian revelation. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand
the very lively opposition of a number of Christian historians,
Catholic and Protestant alike, in the 19th century and during the
first half of the 20th.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Essene theory had become a scholarly attack upon
Jesus -- the uniqueness of his teaching, his Jewishness, his early
years and his divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Though soundly refuted in the last century, the Essene theory
began gaining acceptance again in the 1950s. Jewish scholars, such
as Zeitlin and P. R. Weiss, were among a growing number who
challenged the early dating of the scrolls as well as the theory
that the Essenes wrote them. They believed the scrolls dated from
the medieval period, rather than 300 BC to AD 50.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitlin wrote that ``ascribing ... the scrolls to the
pre-Christian period (was) theologically motivated.'' The scrolls
were being used as propaganda against Christianity, he said, by
back-dating them to the pre-Christian era. Many scholars who no
longer held to historic Christian doctrinal beliefs revived the
Essene theory to attack the Judeo-Christian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Jewish scholars who defended
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity about the Dead Sea Scrolls continues as new pieces to
the puzzle of their origin are put into place and access to the
Dead Sea Scrolls becomes less restricted. We now know who the
Essenes were and that they couldn't have written the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now must search for the historicity and identity of
those who did and who carefully stored them in the caves at Qumran.

 NEW YORK: his person.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The original plan was for an eight-week run at the Almeida, but
the production proved so popular that it transferred to the Old
Vic, with Spacey by then one of the producers. From that point, a
move to New York seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the 1956 ``Iceman'' will always be remembered for
Robards's Hickey, this one, too, is dominated by Spacey's part
salesman, part evangelist, part con man who ultimately delivers a
nearly half-hour monologue in the last act.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Danza, who plays the bartender, Rocky, said a measure of
Spacey's mastery of the scene is how fast it seems to play out:
``At the end, Kevin does his 25-minute speech, where my job is to
hit my spot at the bar, where I land and listen. The thought hit my
mind the other day, when the speech started, that maybe I needed to
find a more comfortable position, because 25 minutes is a long
time. And the next thing I knew it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sean Leonard, the stage and film actor who plays the
young Don Parritt, said: ``I don't think you have to be intelligent
to be good in a film. It helps, but it's not essential. But I don't
care what anyone says, you can't be good onstage, not in this play
anyway, unless you've worked it through in your head, and Kevin has
done it so well that there's a reason for everything he does. He's
thought it out, right down to the eye contact for each speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as the character of Hickey dominates the stage,
the production hinges on two assumptions. The first, by Davies, the
director, was that the only good ``Iceman'' is a funny ``Iceman.''
Rather than an austere classic, Davies said, he began with the idea
that the humanity of the play and the appeal of the characters flow
from a rich vein of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this play once before with a remarkable cast in a big
theater, and looking back on it, it had a slightly reverential
quality,'' Davies said. This time, he continued, ``I knew from the
start that what I wanted was a bunch of happy bums. I've always
felt the play is very funny, and I cast it looking for actors with
real comedic skills. I don't think an actor is any good unless he's
got that anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The second assumption, largely on the part of Spacey, was that
the play should be done on as egalitarian a basis as possible, just
as at the Almeida, where all the actors shared a common dressing
room and worked for the same fee. He has insisted that the dressing
room walls at the Brooks Atkinson be knocked down, so that the cast
can dress together. He also insisted that his name not be placed on
the marquee or at the top of ads.
</P>
<P>
   And as one of the co-producers of the New York production with
the Broadway veteran Emanuel Azenberg and others, Spacey has agreed
to a pay scale where everyone, including he himself and Danza,
popularly known for his television series roles, work for the
Broadway minimum of $1,135 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The production, whose 91 performances are 90 percent sold out,
extends that sensibility to the seats, with what Spacey calls
``Robin Hood'' orchestra prices of $100, $75 and $50 helping to
subsidize a substantial number of $20 student seats for each show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to preach to the converted,'' he said. ``I
wanted to hit an audience that might not otherwise come.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey said the collegial ethic is a reflection less of what a
swell guy he is than of what it takes for both the cast and the
audience to make the play work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really difficult to ask an audience to listen as
carefully as they have to at the beginning of Act I if they've been
sold on the idea that they're going to spend an evening with a
single actor, and they're waiting for him to show up,'' he said.
``This play is written as an ensemble; the fact that we're all in a
big romper room dressing room helps add to the camaraderie onstage.
That's how it began at the Almeida, and there's no reason to change
it now. I love being a member of this company, so we have to make
some degree of effort to make sure it works that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies has put together a cast that includes veterans of the
London production and Americans. Holdovers are Tim Pigott-Smith,
who plays the dispirited, failed anarchist, Larry Slade; James
Hazeldine, as the cranky bar owner, Harry Hope; Patrick Godfrey, as
an aging former British officer; and Clarke Peters as Joe Mott, the
black gambler.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, an American who lives and works in London, needed no
dispensation to appear, but Spacey made a special plea to Actors
Equity for his British colleagues to repeat their roles on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Danza, who starred briefly last year in the Roundabout
Theater Company revival of ``A View From the Bridge,'' the other
new Americans include Leonard, the first person Spacey recruited
for the production; Michael Emerson, who portrayed Oscar Wilde in
the recent highly praised ``Gross Indecency'' Off Broadway; the
veteran Broadway actor Ed Dixon; Paul Giamatti, a young stage and
film actor and the son of the late baseball commissioner Bart
Giamatti; Katie Finneran, who was seen most recently on Broadway in
Simon's ``Proposals''; and the well-known downtown performer Jeff
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Spacey has lived with ``Iceman'' for the last year,
there could be more life still. He has bought the rights to the
play and is contemplating another look at it, perhaps in film or on
television.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like an awful lot of Hickey and the lost boys and
a prolonged detour from the main Hollywood highway. But Spacey, who
lives in downtown Manhattan, not Los Angeles, clearly feeds off the
energy of the stage and, film roles notwithstanding, he has never
been one of the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, the kind of actor who leaves the theater each
afternoon after rehearsals wearing sunglasses and a knit cap,
venturing into traffic on a yellow electric Zappy, sort of a
motorized skateboard with handlebars. So his personal and
theatrical instincts make this extended excursion perfectly
logical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this great character, you have O'Neill's language,
which comes flying out of one's mouth, and you have characters with
dignity, humor and wit,'' he said. ``This play is just one of the
mountains you keep wanting to climb. There are so many more reasons
to do it again than not to do it.''

   In fact, the writers of the Scrolls never called themselves
``Essenes,'' but referred to themselves as ``the poor'' or ``poor
in spirit,'' which also happen to be terms applied to the early
followers of Jesus. Even Lawrence Schiffman, a noted Dead Sea
Scroll scholar, has gone so far as to say that the writers of the
scrolls should not be referred to as ``Essenes'' but as the
``Qumran sect.''

   Furthermore, scholars who believe in the antiquity of the
Scrolls claim they were written by the Essenes in a writing house
-- a scriptorium -- in Qumran near the caves where the first
scrolls were found. World renowned Hebrew paleographer M. Bezalel
Narkis, however, notes in La Paleographie Hebraique Medievale that,
``One should take into consideration the fact that Jews never had
monastic scriptoria ... . Only since the 13th century is there some
evidence of larger workshops headed by scribes.''

</P>
<P>
   The records of historians Pliny and Philo, who were writing in
the decades after Jesus' death, include sketchy details about
sects.
</P>
<P>
   Dead Sea Scroll scholars combined several sects into one that
they inferred to be the Essenes in order to account for the
authorship of the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the same period, also
wrote about such a sect, calling its members city dwellers who
lived in ``every town in Israel.'' They didn't live in the desert
or wilderness, like the Dead Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, respected Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld
created a stir by asserting that Essenes lived not at Qumran, but
at Ein Gedi, a Dead Sea community 20 miles south of Qumran. But
Hirschfeld said he found a striking similarity between that
community and the monasteries built centuries later by Byzantine
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Pick, also an archaeologist and the dean of arts and
sciences at Columbia Pacific University in California, added a nail
to the coffin of the Essene theory when he told Newsday in 1997,
``The most telling thing was there was no synagogue at the Qumran
site.''
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jews, he said, built synagogues at sites where
they lived for only a few years, such as the fortress at Masada.
Why, Pick asks, wouldn't the Essenes have built a synagogue at
Qumran where they supposedly lived for more than 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   OSSAEANS, NOT ESSENES
</P>
<P>
   But people called ``Ossaeans'' did live along the northern
shores of the Dead Sea after AD 68. Some scrolls scholars believe
they were the Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius, a church father of the third and fourth centuries
AD, wrote that the ``so-called heresy of the Ossaeans ...
originated from the regions of Nabataea and Ituraea, Moabitis and
Arielitis, from the regions that are situated at the other side of
the lake that in the Holy Scripture is called Dead Sea.'' The fact
that Epiphanius calls them a ``heresy'' suggests that they had a
Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups lived not far away in the Golan Heights region.
Claudine Dauphin, a French archeologist, found that Judeo-Christian
sects emerged after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 and continued
into the medieval period.
</P>
<P>
   ``At two of the sites,'' she wrote, ``we started finding bizarre
stuff -- Christian symbols intertwined with Jewish symbols ... like
a menorah covered by a ship, representing the church, whose mast
was a cross, or a lulav (palm branch) whose top branches formed a
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why I found lameds (the Hebrew ``L'') with the
top part turned into a cross in the Copper Scroll (one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls). Or why there are X's in the margins of messianic
passages that speak of the Messiah on the Isaiah Scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Another important clue in the search for the Essenes is offered
by Athanase Negoitsa in Revue de Qumran. He writes of a document by
Nilus the Ascetic of the fourth century AD that indicates the
Essenes lived then. Nilus praises their ``meditative and lofty
moral life.'' But he regrets that the Essenes do not follow in the
true philosophy of the gospel of Christ, implying that they were a
heretical Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a source that clearly states the Essenes originated in
the Christian period and not before?
</P>
<P>
   CALLED ``NAZARENES''
</P>
<P>
   We know from the writings of the Church Fathers that the Jews
who believed in Jesus were called ``Nazarenes'' and that they kept
the laws of Moses and the customs of the Jewish people. That
dispels the gentile myth that the Jewish people rejected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Honorius Augustodunensis stated, ``The Nazoraeans
are so called after the village Nazareth. These confess that Christ
is the Son of God but they observe everything in the old Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the New Testament book of Acts clearly
brings out that not only did large numbers of Pharisees, but also
``a great company of priests [Sadducees] had turned to the Lord.''
We also find in the book of Acts that entire Jewish cities, such as
Lydda and Sharon, accepted Jesus the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the Church Fathers that even in the later
centuries -- like the fourth and fifth centuries AD -- Jewish
followers of Messiah still existed and did not deny their heritage.
If the name for Jewish believers was ``Nazarenes,'' what then were
the gentiles called who received Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We read in Acts of the Apostles (11:26) that the gentiles who
believed in Jesus were called ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the time of the first gentile believer (Cornelius)
and the time that large numbers of gentiles in Antioch were
converted, what name differentiated gentiles?
</P>
<P>
   I found the following statement in Epiphanius: ``All Christians
were called Nazoraeans [Nazarenes] once. For a short time they were
given also the name Iessaeans, before the disciples in Antioch
began to be called Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius thus contradicts the theory that the Essenes were a
pre-Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But is he a reliable source? If he is, why have his words on the
subject been ignored? Why, as Negoitsa brings out, do ``...many
Qumranologists (Dead Sea Scroll scholars) take no account of
Epiphanius...?''
</P>
<P>
   They surely must have found, as I did, the references in
Epiphanius that show the Essene sect did not come into existence
until after the death of Jesus. A noted Qumranologist has revealed
that ``older scholars will prefer to ignore the new materials: the
ferment they produce is too strong for their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just ``new material'' but anything that goes against
the ``accepted theory.'' Four decades ago, Jewish writer and
scholar Solomon Zeitlin said anyone who challenged accepted Dead
Sea Scroll theories was regarded as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars regard Epiphanius as an extremely important
source. In ``Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' German scholar
Rainer Riesner states, ``According to reliable tradition in
Epiphanius, the Jewish Christian community left the Holy City at
the outbreak of the Jewish War (AD 66-70) to settle at Pella in the
Decapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Negoitsa writes: ``Epiphanius was born in Palestine ... spoke
five languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Coptic, and Aramaic. Thus he
was able to read all the documents and writings ... (had) precise
information regarding the sects of Palestine and especially those
in the region harboring the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Negoitsa doesn't mention Epiphanius' statements about
``Iessaeans.'' What is the derivation of this Greek word, and does
this have any bearing on Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Comfort, professor of Greek and New Testament at Wheaton
College and Senior Bible editor at Tyndale Publishing House, states
that the word ``Iessaeans'' or ``Essenes'' comes from the Greek
word ``Iessaios,'' which means Jesse, the father of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians may have called themselves this because
the Messiah was called the Son of Jesse (Isaiah 11:10, Romans
15:12),'' wrote Comfort, whose analysis offers further insight into
Epiphanius' statements that the Essenes were a Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   How then could the Essenes be the writers of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which supposedly date as far back as 300 BC?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the scrolls ``merely revived [this] old, long
discarded theory,'' claims Millar Burrows in More Light on the Dead
Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ON JESUS
</P>
<P>
   Scroll scholar A. Dupont-Sommer explains that the Essene theory
was a product of 18th-century biblical criticism. It speculated
that Jesus ``was imbued with Essene ethics, which in their turn,
owe much to Zeno,'' a Greek philosopher of the fifth century BC.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Essene Writings from Qumran,'' Dupont-Sommer says the
Christian apologists saw this philosophy as ``a weapon, a devilish
theory designed to sap the originality and transcendence of
Christian revelation. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand
the very lively opposition of a number of Christian historians,
Catholic and Protestant alike, in the 19th century and during the
first half of the 20th.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Essene theory had become a scholarly attack upon
Jesus -- the uniqueness of his teaching, his Jewishness, his early
years and his divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Though soundly refuted in the last century, the Essene theory
began gaining acceptance again in the 1950s. Jewish scholars, such
as Zeitlin and P. R. Weiss, were among a growing number who
challenged the early dating of the scrolls as well as the theory
that the Essenes wrote them. They believed the scrolls dated from
the medieval period, rather than 300 BC to AD 50.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitlin wrote that ``ascribing ... the scrolls to the
pre-Christian period (was) theologically motivated.'' The scrolls
were being used as propaganda against Christianity, he said, by
back-dating them to the pre-Christian era. Many scholars who no
longer held to historic Christian doctrinal beliefs revived the
Essene theory to attack the Judeo-Christian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Jewish scholars who defended
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity about the Dead Sea Scrolls continues as new pieces to
the puzzle of their origin are put into place and access to the
Dead Sea Scrolls becomes less restricted. We now know who the
Essenes were and that they couldn't have written the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now must search for the historicity and identity of
those who did and who carefully stored them in the caves at Qumran.

FUN FOR PRANKSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By SREENATH SREENIVASAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think pranksters would be at their wits' end. Real-life
headlines _ President's DNA tested in sex scandal, Baltimore
Orioles play baseball in Cuba _ seem stranger than fiction, defying
anyone to come up with an eye-catching practical joke on April
Fool's Day.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong. Thanks to various software and Web sites, it is
easier than ever to fool and be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a 120-year
tradition of students' playing benign engineering pranks. A year
ago today, students hacked the front page of the MIT home page and
replaced it with one that announced ``Disney to Acquire M.I.T. for
$6.9 Billion.''
</P>
<P>
   So proud are students of their handiwork, that they have
archived examples of their famous online and off-line pranks,
including the Disney one, at the MIT Hack Gallery
(hacks.mit.edu/Hacks).
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schiller, MIT's computer network manager, said his team
was ready to defend itself against any similar efforts this year.
``We are always vigilant,'' he said, ``so my bigger concern is, how
funny will it be?'' Schiller said that he discovered last year's
Disney hack within three minutes, but left it up for the day
because ``it was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point for exploring Internet-based pranks is
April Fools on the Net (www.2meta.com/april-fools), run by David
Barberi of 2meta Consulting, in West Chester, Pa. It serves as an
archive of various fake e-mail messages and other pranks. Among the
classics in the ``Top 20 Fools'' section: the ``Internet Cleaning''
hoax of 1997, which warned that the entire Internet needed to be
shut down on April 1 that year.
</P>
<P>
   That one encouraged people to turn off their computers and
servers and disconnect their Internet connections so that
``Internet-crawling robots'' could remove ``electronic flotsam and
jetsam'' to create a ``better-working and faster'' Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoid wearing nylon (or other dielectric fiber) undergarments
because of the possibility of electrical discharge,'' the message
warned helpfully. And of course it urged Internet users to post the
message prominently and to pass it to others.
</P>
<P>
   These hoaxes ``thrive on the newbies,'' said Rob Rosenberger, a
security expert who documents hoaxes and debunks phony virus
warnings on his site (kumite.com/myths). ``One of the first things
any new user invariably gets is a hoax of some kind that he or she
then forwards to everyone they know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent, educated users who throw away chain letters
received via the Postal Service seem keen on forwarding the most
outrageous fake e-mail about Internet ``tolls,'' ``Walt Disney
Jr.'' giving free Disney World passes to a lucky few thousand
people who add their names to an e-mail list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology makes it so much easier to send messages that
no one thinks before hitting the send button,'' Rosenberger said.
``They think they can change the world with a few clicks of the
mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong distinction, of course, between the April
Fool's tradition of jokestering on the Web and the malicious hoaxes
meant to inflict harm on individual or networked computers.
</P>
<P>
   For those wanting to go beyond jokes and fashion a more
sophisticated and personal spoof, there is AprilFools.com, which
promises, ``We don't want to fool you. We want to help you fool
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pranks can be played free.
</P>
<P>
   Another repository of April Fool's shenanigans is The Free Site
(www.thefreesite.com/aprilfools.htm). Some of the tricks there,
such as programs that simulate an accidental erasure of every file
on a hard drive, complete with realistic messages and sound
effects, are on the cruel side.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for something tamer can try the April Fool's
electronic greetings at the Hallmark Cards site
(www.hallmarkconnections.com/SID(EQ)ff13164a_3/cardshtml/).
</P>
<P>
   If you do get an e-mail today that seems too good, too bad, or
too amazing to be true, it probably is. If you harbor suspicions,
visit Hoax Kill (www.hoaxkill.com), which tracks urban legends,
bogus virus warnings and other pranks and offers help users ``to
actively combat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful out there today. You've been warned.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a girl, Christmas far eclipsed Easter as my favorite
holiday.
 &HT;    Anticipation gripped me for weeks as I awaited Santa's visit and
all those presents.
 &HT;    Easter paled by comparison. Although my parents bought me a new
dress and spring coat, the Easter Bunny and his basket of candy
appeared Scrooge-like compared to Santa.
 &HT;    Then there was church. At Christmas, the baby Jesus, his
beautiful mother, the angels, shepherds and wise men entranced me.
Christmas' simplicity spoke to my childhood world.
 &HT;    But Easter? It made no sense. Although the baby grew up and
helped some people, others got so angry with him that they killed
him. God didn't like this, so he raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    Apparently, Easter doesn't make sense to many Americans.
Although 66 percent of us attend church on Easter Sunday, fully 20
percent admit to not understanding Easter's message.
 &HT;    The holiest day for Christians, Easter is about grown-up faith.
Jesus Christ, loving and sinless, suffers and dies at the hands of
fearful people. To prove the power of love, God raises Jesus from
the grave.
 &HT;    Easter's message startles: Christ has died. Christ has risen.
Death and resurrection.
 &HT;    Grown-up faith? Yes. Believing in a virgin birth, a cute baby,
and angelic hosts is easy stuff in comparison. But new life out of
death?
 &HT;    Mature faith gazes into the mystery of suffering and
resurrection. Only from life's unwanted pain and darkness can new
insight, wisdom and unconditional love arise.
 &HT;    Fifteen years ago, a friend suffered a terrible car accident.
Wrapped around a tree, his Volkswagen encased his twisted form
until paramedics cut him loose and rushed him to the hospital.
 &HT;    Amazed that he lived, the doctors said he would never regain
consciousness. Poised between life and death, he slept in a coma.
We anointed him with oil and prayed.
 &HT;    Unbelievably, he recovered _ even to the point of graduating
from college. As a result of his experience, he became a nurse who
treated those dying from AIDS.
 &HT;    For him, suffering brought forth compassion and service.
 &HT;    A few years ago, he died of AIDS. In the midst of his own pain,
he worked to heal others. No miraculous recovery this time. He
suffered only to suffer again.
 &HT;    Trying to come to terms with his death, I realized existence
moves from one death to another. Without the hope of new life, the
human story is little more than senseless tragedy.
 &HT;    But Easter insists upon _ indeed, Easter shouts _ triumph over
an endless cycle of suffering.
 &HT;    Hanging on the cross, Jesus suffered. In his pain, he cried out,
``Father, forgive them. They know not what they do.''
 &HT;    Breathing his last, he sighed, ``It is finished.'' Then he died.
 &HT;    Finished. Death is the ultimate end. As I grew up and began to
understand death, I reeled under its terror. Eternal nothingness.
It is finished.
 &HT;    The heart of the Easter story lies in Jesus' suffering. Good
Friday and Easter Sunday embrace in joyful triumph as the cross
leads to the empty tomb. Resurrection overcomes death.
 &HT;    Little children, charming in their Easter finery, chase each
other around the churchyard and hunt for colored eggs. They enjoy
Easter, but they don't grasp its power because, for the most part,
they haven't suffered.
 &HT;    Adults often do everything possible to escape pain and
suffering. But not until we grow up and face ``it is finished,''
can Easter have any meaning.
 &HT;    For Jesus it wasn't finished. After three days, God overcame the
horrifying injustice of the cross and raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    This fundamental theological insight _ that suffering brings
forth new life _ is adult faith. Although hard to believe, once it
is embraced, we find true freedom.
 &HT;    As the old hymn reminds us, ``He is risen! Death is conquered,
we are free!''

THE MALE ALTO TENOR FIELD IS GETTING CROWDED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time, there was a countertenor who had
his niche to himself. ``The most remarkable countertenor of the
20th century,'' Sir Michael Tippett called Alfred Deller. The quote
blazes off the recent reissue of the Deller Consort's John Dowland
anthology ``Awake Sweet Love,'' on Vanguard, which dates back to
1966.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. The morning mail brings an advance copy of ``Heroes,''
Andreas Scholl's new London CD, in stores next month, accompanied
by a fancy brochure citing Opera magazine to the effect that Scholl
is ``undoubtedly the best-equipped countertenor of the day, perhaps
any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyrichord quotes Fanfare magazine to tout Russell Oberlin, whose
anthologies of medieval music, taped in the late 1950s, are
enjoying an enduring CD renaissance: ``He was the century's finest
countertenor. ... We have no countertenors who sing like this
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is getting crowded. Time to strike the male alto from
the rare-species list.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate how well established this once marginal vocal
category has become, consider the case of David Daniels, who makes
his Metropolitan Opera debut on Saturday evening in a revival of
Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' with an encore scheduled for April 27
in the form of a recital at Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It was with the premiere of this Met production in 1988 that
Jeffrey Gall and Daniel Dash struck for their brothers the blow
that in 1955 Marian Anderson struck for blacks, opening the doors
of the nation's premiere opera house to a class of artists formerly
excluded. As in the case of Anderson, who was invited too late to
be heard in her glory, there was something disappointing and token
about the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   In the groundbreaking Peter Sellars production of the opera,
Gall had already played the title role as the Nixonesque kingpin of
the free world, a performance that brought him international
acclaim. At the Met, his role was that of Cleopatra's brother
Tolomeo, her effete rival for the Egyptian throne. He looked like a
minor satrap from ``Star Wars Meets Cleopatra'' and had little to
sing. As Nireno, the royal siblings' double-dealing confidant, Dash
had even less.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels has the title role on his agenda for next winter at the
Florida Grand Opera, but his Met role is that of Sesto, who stalks
through the opera seeking revenge for his father, the murdered
Pompey. No, it is not Caesar, but a role with which, in the Sellars
production, Lorraine Hunt scored a triumph. The Met's previous
Sesto was Hilda Harris, another mezzo-soprano. The current Tolomeo
is the well-established Brian Asawa, in 1991 the first countertenor
to win the Metropolitan Opera Auditions; the fast-rising Daniel
Taylor plays Nireno.
</P>
<P>
   On his debut CD, a Handel disk for Virgin, Daniels sings
Caesar's smoothly menacing duet with horn, ``Va tacito,'' and
Sesto's ``L'angue offeso,'' heaving with shame and
self-recrimination. The recent Handel revival has taught us how
wide an emotional spectrum Handel's characters encompass.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels rejoices in the possibilities, from the quivering,
outraged coloratura of Tamerlano's ``A dispetto'' (a souvenir of
his thrilling portrayal at Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y.)
to the heartbroken, introspective legato of Ariodante's ``Scherza
infida.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opera house, Daniels sticks to the repertory in which
countertenors are no longer a novelty: notably, Baroque roles
originally sung as trouser parts or by castratos. This spring, in
Rome, he takes on Oberon, in Britten's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,''
the first great role for a modern countertenor (written for
Deller).
</P>
<P>
   As a recitalist, however, he pushes the envelope into
``standard'' repertory, written when the countertenor as a species
did not exist. Some are startled to hear him perform the Brahms
Songs With Viola (Op. 91), one of which is sung in the person of
the Virgin Mary. That Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert and other
composers whose music Daniels likes probably never heard grown men
singing in the range of a mezzo-soprano does not frighten him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can bring as much variety of color and drama to the
recital repertoire as to opera,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Bejun Mehta is another countertenor whose career is growing
fast. The story has made the rounds how it was a profile of Daniels
in The New Yorker that opened Mehta's eyes to his calling. Like
Daniels, he was a former boy soprano; indeed, one of renown, with a
Delos CD to his credit that made a fan of Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Like Daniels, he never set out to be a countertenor. But their
attempts to remake themselves in conventional categories (tenor for
Daniels, baritone for Mehta) only made them miserable. One day
Daniels shyly confided in his teacher that he had ``another
voice,'' and suddenly he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   As Mehta, 30, tells it, he read this, put down the magazine,
stood up from his chair and started making sound. The downtown
debut that ensued almost immediately in Handel's ``Esther'' with
Millennial Arts Productions was as stunning for its fluency,
articulation and power as for its emotional abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Handel's ``Partenope'' at the New York City Opera last
fall, several concerts here and abroad in which Mehta spelled an
indisposed Daniels, and a recital for Marilyn Horne's ``On Wings of
Song'' series at the Kosciuszko Foundation. Like Daniels, Mehta was
not shy about venturing into the standard repertory, from Brahms to
Barber and Britten. His performances justified every choice.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the recital, Mehta remarked that until recently,
he had never liked countertenors very much: ``Something about the
singing struck you as artificial: strained, not otherworldly. We're
on an arc of legitimization. When countertenors first came along,
they got jobs if they had the notes, and the notes didn't even have
to be pretty. Then people started demanding style, range, dynamic
control, emotional depth: all the things they demanded of `normal'
singers for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already know what the next phase will be. Young kids are
coming to me, asking me to teach them, kids who never thought about
being anything else. A lot that informs my singing comes from my
experience as a baritone. For the next generation, being a
countertenor is not this exotic thing. One of my great goals is to
cement the countertenor as just a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who is all of 33, marvels that music schools have
countertenors now: ``That was unheard of when I was a student.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite vanishing from sight for about two centuries, the
countertenor has a history stretching back at least to the Middle
Ages. Henry Purcell, the pre-eminent composer of 17th-century
Britain, wrote for countertenors and was a countertenor himself.
But the beast we know on the brink of the millennium, like the
early-music movement, is a creation of this century.
</P>
<P>
   An unsystematic survey of the recorded history from Deller
forward tends to confirm Mehta's analysis. Deller himself was an
artist of taste and expressivity, though perhaps too smitten with
melancholy. Long lines flow like dark ribbons of honey, though the
ends often fray like thread.
</P>
<P>
   He is at his most captivating in Britten's own recording of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' on the London label, entering the action
shrill with monarchic fury at Elizabeth Harwood's equally unbridled
Tytania. But against the rainbow display of emotion Asawa puts on
in Sir Colin Davis's recording of the opera for Philips, Deller's
reserve in subsequent scenes comes off bloodless indeed.
</P>
<P>
   For some listeners, Oberlin remains the touchstone, but from a
newcomer's vantage point, his art seems a hard taste to acquire. In
Bernstein's weird ``Messiah,'' cut and pasted into a pattern
nothing like Handel's own, Oberlin may be the weirdest feature,
mouthing his music phoneme by fastidious phoneme on an equally
fastidious and immaculate stream of pear-shaped tone.
</P>
<P>
   Breakthroughs of the countertenor have been occurring with some
regularity. A Purcell recital by Andrew Dalton released on Etcetera
in 1984 stands out in memory for its intimacy and unaffected
dignity. Aficionados will know the names of James Bowman, Michael
Chance, Jochen Kowalski, Derek Lee Ragin and many more, past and
present.
</P>
<P>
   To a greater or lesser extent, they are cult figures all; of
each it has been said at one time or another that in him the ideal
of the castrato _ range, flexibility and brilliance of the female,
muscularity of the male _ has at last been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Pure speculation, of course. Meanwhile, plenty of mezzo-sopranos
are outgunning, on sheer decibels, any countertenor who has yet
appeared, which may be why a big house like the Met still thinks it
best to cast a Jennifer Larmore as Handel's Julius Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at about the same time as Gall, Drew Minter struck one
critic as the Tebaldi to his colleague's Callas. As an illustration
of what Daniels calls Minter's ``style and class and artistry,''
his vivid Handel CD ``Arias for Senesino,'' recorded on Harmonia
Mundi France in 1986, serves perfectly. ``Love Letters From
Italy,'' a Lyrichord release from 1996, catches Minter as the
collaborator of the early-music group Artek in sophisticated yet
thrillingly immediate accounts of works by Monteverdi, Gagliano and
Sigismondo d'India.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond reclaiming the music of the castratos for male singers,
some countertenors are casting an eye on roles originally conceived
for women. Still, the most famous cluster of trouser roles _
adolescents like Mozart's Cherubino, in ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' and
Richard Strauss's Octavian, in ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' as well as
his Composer, in ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' _ may remain the province of
mezzo-sopranos, at least for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, at any rate, has no designs on them. ``Octavian is too
high, and the orchestration is too big,'' he says. ``And the role
just doesn't interest me. If other countertenors want to sing it
and they can do it, more power to them. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   One good reason, at least as far as Cherubino and Octavian are
concerned, is that an androgynous note is integral to the perfume
of these parts. Baba the Turk, in Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress,''
subsumes a likely homosexual subtext intended by the librettists
W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman into the image of a bearded female,
a part Asawa has played with gusto and satin vocalism on film under
the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
</P>
<P>
   If the countertenor is not yet ``just a voice,'' we have reached
the point where any given countertenor pretty much has the freedom
to be as great, as vain, as inventive or as bizarre an artist as
anyone else. Jeffrey Dooley and a Baroque ensemble have recorded a
Stephen Foster CD, ``Dear Friends and Gentle Hearts,'' due for
release on Lyrichord.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tour de force,'' says a label executive, but you must have
had to be there. A novelty I look forward to is ``Epitaph,'' on
Opus 111, featuring Sverrir Godjonsson in a womb-to-tomb cycle of
Icelandic folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Dark is My Delight,'' a decorous debut album of
16th-century lute songs for RCA, Asawa has returned on the same
label with ``Vocalise,'' swamping his svelte sound in rich, gooey
arrangements of Rachmaninoff, Faure, Medtner and Villa-Lobos.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding Scholl's forthcoming ``Heroes'' may not do
him much of a favor. For one thing, the album competes with his own
Handel CD ``Ombra Mai Fu,'' out this month on Harmonia Mundi
France, the specialized label from which the London star machine
recruited him to an exclusive contract.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Scholl's notion of the heroic has room for long
spells of self-doubt, which in his case translates to a penchant
for scooped, limp phrasing. Scrupulous musicianship and cultivated
sound notwithstanding, the program is more dutiful than exciting.
</P>
<P>
   A livelier side of his personality came through in a Harmonia
Mundi album with Pascal Bertin and Dominique Visse. Scholl crooned
Carmen's Habanera, Bertin had at ``My Way,'' and Visse hiccuped
through Offenbach's drunk act for ``La Perichole.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Three Countertenors warbled ``O Sole Mio,''
``Maria'' and ``Una furtiva lagrima.'' The CD was recently
withdrawn in deference to legal eagles asserting the franchise of
The Three Tenors. If countertenors in any numbers now pose a threat
to the troika of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti, they have come
farther than anyone can have imagined.

IMPROVED WAYS TO TRACK EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine never again finding out after an airline journey with
several ups and downs that your luggage turned left when you turned
right. That would be possible, of course, if the tag slapped on
your bag at check-in was smart enough to follow you through your
plane changes.
</P>
<P>
   With a new ``smart label'' developed by Motorola, those little
paper tags stuck on your suitcase _ and a lot of other labels, as
well _ may become a lot more useful.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's Worldwide Smartcard Solutions division recently
announced its new Bistatix technology, which uses special antennas
printed on paper in an identification system based on radio
frequencies to track everything from packages to people. Bistatix
is still being tested; the first products are expected next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Similar radio-frequency technology using conventional antennas
is already used for such things as electronic time cards and
security passes for employees and for inventory control in
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Radio-frequency-identification technology may sound a little
scary, but it just means that the label can emit radio waves that
contain identifying information and can also receive radio waves
that change the information carried by the label. The label itself
includes an integrated circuit that works with a special antenna;
signals can be sent and received when someone approaches with a
radio-frequency scanning device.
</P>
<P>
   There are already many types of digital scanning devices, like
Metrocards, which have a magnetic stripe that, when passed through
a scanner, admit the holder through a subway turnstile. But the
magnetic stripe, as any New York subway rider can tell you, has to
be swiped just so to work.
</P>
<P>
   A radio-frequency reader needs to be only close to the tag _
inches or feet away _ to recognize it, and the signal can be read
through dirt, wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a traditional antenna made from a metal wire coil and a
capacitor, the Bistatix antenna is printed on paper in an
inexpensive process that uses regular carbon-based ink. There are
no rigid metal parts. Since the Bistatix label has both the antenna
and the circuit, it can both send signals to a reader device and
receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tag is scanned, yielding information, Bistatix might
sound like some sort of fancy new bar code process, but the two
technologies are different, said Rich Krueger, director of
radio-frequency-identification business development at Motorola.
``In bar code, first of all, it's a read-only technology,'' he
explained. ``You can't change the information on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he pointed out, a bar code can easily be counterfeited on a
photocopier. Instead of a bar code, which can only send information
back to a computer when it is scanned, a Bistatix label can
actually receive information, which changes the data encoded into
it and can then be used to track an object.
</P>
<P>
   To scan a bar code, Krueger said, ``you need what's called a
good optical angle.'' Think of all those times you've stood in line
at the local grocery while the cashier tries to scan through a can
of soda at the wrong angle, and you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've got an extremely expensive and complex bar code
scanner,'' Krueger said, ``you have to get alignment to it in order
to read it.'' The new Motorola tags, however, can be scanned
without any clear line of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Bistatix tags can carry more information than the average bar
code label. ``That silicon can hold about 900 user bits of
information, which translates into roughly 112 characters of
information,'' he said. Bistatix technology can also be used with
bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger said he expected the security industry to be one of the
first business sectors to adopt Bistatix products. He said he
expected them to be used for security cards controlling access to
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   They are also expected to be useful for tracking packages. The
United States Postal Service began testing the Bistatix technology
this month. ``For those kind of applications where you have
hundreds of thousands of parcels moving on conveyors, we see the
Bistatix technology as offering hands-free automatic identification
of those parcels,'' Krueger said. ``That's an application that's
really aimed at improving business efficiency.'' Other possible
uses for Bistatix include tags for theme-park passes, which could
be programmed to let the holders enter on certain days, and tickets
for sports or theater events, which could be encoded to give
discounts to season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other aspect that's unique about Bistatix,'' Krueger said,
``is that _as opposed to those rigid antennas _ it's printed on
paper, so you can wrap it around objects like bottles and parcels
and still access it.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry is another big potential customer. Three
million pieces of luggage are handled each year by airline
personnel. The bar code labels used by many carriers can become
scratched, torn and otherwise rendered unreadable in transit,
forcing people to route more than 40 percent of the baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Lost or delayed luggage costs money, up to $10 billion per year
worldwide over all, according to industry estimates. But bag tags
and boarding passes made with Bistatix technology can still be read
even if they are folded, scuffed or ripped.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger explained how bag tags printed at luggage check-in
counters would work: ``As the bag tag goes through the printing
mechanism to print the bar code and other information like `Chicago
to San Francisco,' it would be encoding the information into the
silicon at the same time. And out the other end would come an
electronic label, all in one basic operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since new information can be encoded into fields on the tags,
Bistatix boarding passes could track people just as easily as their
bags. ``One could reserve selected fields for the original flight
information, the intervening airlines that one might transfer to in
the course of that trip and then the final destination _ all tied
into system locator information,'' Krueger said. ``You could update
that as you go from point A to B to C. That same information can
then be linked to similar fields that you could put on a bag tag.
That process allows you to modify the contents of the tag as you
move throughout the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result could be fewer lost suitcases. But don't look for
progress any time soon in those in-flight snacks.

MAXIM VENGEROV, A GIFTED RUSSIAN VIOLINIST, RISE CONTINUES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Lawrence B. Johnson is the music critic of The Detroit News.  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young Siberian Maxim Vengerov continues to stake out his
ground among the most gifted and engaging violinists of, let's say,
the last 25 years. Let's say that, because ``half-century'' or,
indeed, ``modern times'' has an inescapable ring of hyperbole. Yet
Vengerov's magnificent new recording of Brahms's Violin Concerto,
with Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony (Teldec
0630-17144-2; CD), immediately brings to mind classic performances
available on compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   Vengerov, now 24, offers uncommonly personal Brahms, and it
resonates with that rare blend of intellectual depth, technical
finesse and lyric beauty that one associates with Jascha Heifetz's
patrician recording with Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony,
from 1957 (on RCA), or Isaac Stern's stormy reading with Eugene
Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, from 1959 (on Sony).
</P>
<P>
   Lesser strengths would scarcely support the leisurely tempos
that invest Vengerov's performance with its transcendent
spirituality. Moreover, from the first measures of the broadly
paced opening movement, the easy rapport between violinist and
conductor is manifest and unflagging. Barenboim accomplishes the
critical double task of limning the concerto's symphonic structure
yet setting off the violin to optimum advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Vengerov conspicuously command the spotlight. The
single feature of this enterprise that most belies his years is his
essentially undemonstrative musical bearing. He can muster power
aplently, but the real magnetism lies in his restraint and his
subtle inflection, and in the profundity of ideas thus illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   Vengerov provides his own cadenza in the opening movement. Ever
since Brahms's day, most violinists have played the cadenza written
by Joseph Joachim, the most celebrated virtuoso of the time and the
composer's friend and technical consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Heifetz, a notable exception, substituted his own concise,
brilliant cadenza. By comparison, Vengerov's is a veritable
rhapsody, a lengthy ``improvisation'' rich with adroit spins on
Brahms's thematic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The songful Andante, always arresting in competent hands, here
becomes a reflection of unexpected intimacy. In a way I've never
quite experienced before, Vengerov connects this movement with its
famously prayerful counterpart in the First Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the finale, with all its propulsive energy, Vengerov
remains the elegant craftsman. Here he hews closer to the cool
precision of Heifetz than to the withering intensity of Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Vengerov veritably revels in the Chicago Symphony's luxurious
virtuosity and enjoys an equally felicitious partnership with
Barenboim as the pianist in Brahms's D minor Violin Sonata, which
fills out the disk.

   EILAT, Israel _ The Red Sea Star Restaurant began with an
underwater vision and ended up a vision underwater: a whimsical
restaurant deep in the Gulf of Eilat, where diners devour fish
platters under the scrutiny of fish peering in at them through
portholes.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala Serfaty, the restaurant's designer, was four months
pregnant and snorkeling in the Red Sea off Egypt when the concept
came to her. If the reef were soft, she thought, and you could
float weightlessly inside it, it would be just like a womb. Humans
would love it, she said to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it sounds totally weird now, but I knew then that I
wanted to create an underwater environment,'' Ms. Serfaty, who
works in Tel Aviv, said recently. ``I wanted to create an interior
space that would merge with the sea, where the light and color and
language of shapes would play together in a kind of Ping-Pong.''
</P>
<P>
   From this lofty vision came the down-to-earth, or rather,
submerged, reality: a new tourist attraction in Eilat, a
southeastern city that, esthetically, is a sort of Israeli Las
Vegas _ without the gambling. The restaurant is still working out
the kinks peculiar to an underwater dining establishment, such as
how to keep food hot as it travels into the sea from a rooftop
kitchen. But the offshore decor is already attracting attention
from design aficionados in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a winged creature, the canopied entrance to the
restaurant sits at the end of a long pier jutting into the Gulf of
Eilat. Diners descend in an elevator to a depth of 20 feet beneath
the sea. The elevator doors open into a kind of reverse aquarium.
Outside the 62 portholes, school after school of exotic fish glide
by, dipping in and out of the coral gardens that wrap around the
restaurant. Overhead, the sea washes over the skylights, making it
abundantly _ and dizzyingly _ clear that one is submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serfaty said she sought to insure a feeling of equilibrium
underwater by designing wavy window frames and tables that reflect
the rippling water outside. Still, some visitors complain at first
of seasickness and need a period of acclimatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just hold off on the food for a bit, if you don't mind
terribly,'' a German visitor, Uwe Stein, told the waitress as she
handed him a menu.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the furniture and lighting, inspired by sea creatures,
play off the surroundings. The amoeba-shaped tables are
coral-colored; their smooth, reddish surface is fashioned from
sand, painted with dye and coated with epoxy glue. In the bar, the
stools look like velvet sea urchins (the spineless variety) atop
seaweed legs of painted metal. Hanging from the ceiling are
crinkled silk starfish and pleated silk sea anemones that serve as
lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a lot about interior decoration,'' said Rafael
Alterac, a retiree wearing a Greek fisherman's cap, who had parked
his boat at a nearby marina. ``But I like the beautiful feeling it
creates. It's like scuba diving without getting wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serfaty perched atop a velvet stool, cooing at the fish.
``Shalom, shalom, sweetie,'' she said. It was just before lunch,
and the man she called the ``gardener'' was prettying up the
``grounds.'' He was, disconcertingly, floating outside the window,
wearing a mask and snorkel and brushing sediment from the corals
with gloved hands.
</P>
<P>
   The project began, fittingly, with another diver's dream. Ami
Ben Zvi, who owns a diving school in Eilat, collaborated with an
architect, Sefi Kiryati, and a marine engineer, Moshe Drimmer, to
form the structure. Made of metal, it was filled with water and
sunk on a concrete base into the sea floor. It went down in three
pieces, which were welded underwater and secured by spikes.
</P>
<P>
   The sea life there had died long before, killed by sewage and
overdevelopment. Doron Kairi, a marine-life expert, was hired to
reconstruct a reef under the supervision of the Israeli Nature
Reserve. Four years ago, he began transplanting fragments of living
coral from dying beds in the bay. Soon he was tending a coral
nursery, and bit by bit, he began landscaping with sponges, sea
stars and sea cucumbers. Once the habitat was recreated, the fish
followed _ butterfly fish, triggerfish, parrotfish, bluefish and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old guys come here and see that the fish have returned, and
they feel like they're going back in time,'' said Roni Leni, the
project manager.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years after her snorkeling epiphany, Ms. Serfaty
heard about the sinking of the structure on the radio. A painter
and sculptor by training, she was already designing and
manufacturing aquatically inspired furniture and lighting at her
Tel Aviv workshop, home to Aqua Creations, the company she runs
with her husband, Albi. Ms. Serfaty put her fantasies on paper, bid
on the project and won the contract.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the structure, it was forbidding: a cold, metallic
shell that she eventually covered with plaster and paint. To create
the warm space she had in her head, she knew she had to compensate
for the blue light pouring through the windows. She did so by
suffusing the room with yellows and reds. She used lighting and the
reflective surfaces of her shiny tables and mirrored floor, on
which a layer of transparent epoxy over sand makes a stylized
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is campy but soothing. As Ms. Serfaty had hoped, the
internal and external environments do play off each other. The fish
are reflected in the table surfaces, and images of the fake sea
creatures inside bounce on the reefs outside.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's menu offers a mixed fare, but Ms. Serfaty was
disappointed that fish were on the menu at all. The chef, Oskar
Linden, said people were always asking him how he felt about
cooking creatures from the deep in such an environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fry the fish, I try not to look in his eyes,'' he said,
a porpoise earring dangling from his ear lobe.
</P>
<P>
   When a whole grilled fish, head still attached, was set before
one diner, Noa Berger, an entire school of angelfish seemed to be
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't feel quite right,'' Mrs. Berger said, taking a
timid bite and glancing up anxiously at her audience, who _ perhaps
she imagined it _ were clucking with their gills in judgment.

THE SONG BOOK'S FUTURE: STARING AT BLANK PAGES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the composer Vernon Duke.  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The noble parade of dead songwriters in Lincoln
Center's American Songbook series has begun, starting with Harold
Arlen in February and Richard Rodgers in March and continuing in
the fall with Jimmy Van Heusen and Jerome Kern. The mission is
nothing less than the preservation of our popular song heritage.
But is preservation enough?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the music of that melodious roster of songwriting
legends from the 1920s to the 1950s, like Cole Porter, George
Gershwin, Irving Berlin and their peers, will remain with us for
the foreseeable future. Long-term, though, their songs, written for
a mass market that no longer exists, employing standards of craft
and sophistication that no longer apply, seem destined for
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   And yet one cannot but hope. The establishment of the American
Songbook series at Lincoln Center is undeniably a hopeful
development: a sanctuary where the converted can gather regularly
and be preached to. Yet this is an audience nearly as old as the
songs it venerates.
</P>
<P>
   For the American popular song to be truly reborn, as opposed to
merely being endlessly resurrected, new composers must be found who
can reimagine and expand the cannon for younger listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Musical theater has in the last few years produced a handful
(all of them, sadly, neglected by Broadway): Michael John LaChiusa,
Ricky Ian Gordon, Jeanine Tesori and Adam Guettel (a grandson of
Richard Rodgers, who actually sang his grandfather's and Lorentz
Hart's song ``Glad to be Unhappy'' at Lincoln Center in March).
</P>
<P>
   All four possess the requisite talent and, more important, have
served the apprenticeship necessary to absorb the subtleties of
craft that songwriting of this caliber demands. Each has
reconfigured the American popular song form in distinctive and
highly original ways. The question remains, though, whether their
often rarefied concoctions will ever gain wide commercial
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A more unexpected cause for optimism is a crop of young pop and
rock singer-songwriters that includes Rufus Wainwright, Elliott
Smith, Beth Orton and Duncan Sheik. In their work as songwriters
(their voices as singers aside), one discovers memorable snatches
of melody, lyric dexterity and even occasional wit, elements that
form the bedrock of the American popular standard.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of them now appears to give the American popular
song tradition more than a passing thought, maybe they should be
encouraged to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright, 25, offers the most promise. His recent debut album
is an often irresistible jumble of eclectic, psychedelic carnival
music, songs that are melodically seductive and occasionally even
constructed with sophistication. His lyrics, moreover, are shot
through with clever conceits that he nimbly runs with, in the
tradition of _ dare one even suggest it _ Porter and Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 29, is a knottier, more problematic composer but one who,
in an odd way, evinces even greater potential. Strip the Beatles
harmonies from his infectious pop tunes and ``Rubber Soul''
leftovers may be all that remain. Yet, Smith's adroit musical
craftsmanship and intuitive harmonic flair suggest that there might
actually be a classic traditional songwriter in the making here,
one with an original voice that combines romantic harmonies with
wrenching dissonance in an engaging way.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Wainwright, like the more conventionally folkish
Sheik and the more raucously subversive Ms. Orton, are descendants
of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Lennon and McCartney rather than
Gershwin or Berlin. But what if these newcomers were invited inside
a towering yet increasingly distant tradition? What if they, and
we, were permitted to hear their songs reinterpreted by masters of
the American popular song?
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center's American Songbook series would seem best suited
for this mentoring role precisely because it is still inventing
itself and therefore unconstrained by longstanding programming
prejudices. In contrast, the 92d Street Y's invaluable ``Lyrics and
Lyricists'' series, which started out celebrating only living
lyricists, appears too engrossed in the history of this music to
even bother looking toward its future (though the series's new
director, Barry Levitt, has suggested this posture may change).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Symphony Space, for the last decade, has presented wonderful
daylong retrospectives devoted to single songwriters _ most
recently Frank Loesser. But there is also little room here for any
forward thinking amid the boundless traditionalism.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Center, however, the potential is intriguing,
assuming, of course, that those in charge can be persuaded to
hazard something new. Why not put living and dead songwriters
together on the same program? Randy Newman, say, might be invited
to perform both his own music and that of Kurt Weil _ two
generations of astringent musical wits intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Paul Simon performing his songs along with those of
Johnny Mercer _ an exploration of two All-American hit makers and
their extravagant depths.
</P>
<P>
   Among rock-and-roll's elders, Tom Waits and Lou Reed merit
consideration. Their music is directly descended from American
popular standards, reveling in the darkness that underlies the
sunny assumptions of much of that music. Joni Mitchell's seemingly
sweeter musical universe is no less obliquely linked to this
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The songs of all three bring to mind the sardonic brilliance of
that rough-hewn sophisticate Hoagy Carmichael. Any matchup
involving the four of them would certainly offer some fascinating
juxtapositions.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't it be lovely to hear Burt Bacharach's blend of Tin
Pan Alley standards, Brill Building pop and vintage
rhythm-and-blues sung by the majestic jazz singer Carol Sloane or
even the classic pop song diva Barbara Cook? Songs from that nifty
batch recently written and recorded by Bacharach with Elvis
Costello would be worth exploring. It would also be illuminating to
hear Costello's own, supremely literate, surprisingly melodic songs
sung by real singers.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to reinvigorate the American popular song must also
address the performance conventions of the music. Debonair
posturing has lead to a decidedly nostalgic lifelessness. The point
about Fred Astaire was not that he sang as perfectly as he danced;
he was, in fact, no great singer at all, formally. What made him
the favorite of Gershwin, Porter and Berlin was that he sang just
as effortlessly as he danced, imputing a thrilling illusion of
spontaneity to their music, as if he were making it up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Lincoln Center's Arlen and Rogers evenings were a
fascinating contrast in spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately separated the two was polish, or rather the
unexpected value that an absence of polish added to the Arlen
event.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a matter of intent. The 25-piece American Songbook
orchestra clearly lacked cohesive musical direction during its
Arlen outing (a raggedness largely tidied up by the time the
Rodgers concert was presented a month later). The Arlen bill even
endured a late scratch due to illness: the marvelously refined
Maureen McGovern was replaced at the last minute by the marvelously
unrefined Debbie Gravitte.
</P>
<P>
   The rawness that engulfed the Arlen proceedings proved anything
but a liability, however. No one would suggest that the American
Songbook series aspire to imperfection. But in the case of the
Arlen program, imperfection produced some terrifically raucous
music.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the evening was embodied when the usually
circumspect Audra McDonald, who is black, growled, ``Damn, I'm the
whitest woman out here tonight.'' The audience roared, as it never
quite did at the meticulously performed Rodgers program a few weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   Living composers, fully alive performances by singers unafraid
to inhabit these songs without holding back _ that is what the
American popular song cries out for, not merely to survive but to
flourish. And if a more expansive definition of the popular
standard emerges as a result, well, that would be all right too.

EVOLUTION, WITH A BEAT YOU CAN DANCE TO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As William Gibson, the seminal cyberpunk novelist, observed,
``The street finds its own uses for things.'' Billboards and
back-alley nightclubs routinely grab bits and pieces of high
technology or high culture and bend them into strange, vibrant new
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest candidate for metamorphosis is Richard Dawkins, an
Oxford professor whose books about evolutionary theory (``The Blind
Watchmaker'' and ``The Selfish Gene'') have been fueling ivory
tower research and highbrow cocktail party conversation for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The street has found its own uses for these ideas. To wit:
Dancer DNA, a CD-ROM that harnesses the mathematics of evolution to
produce new species of rave graphics. In this instance, the conduit
from Oxford laboratories to London clubs is a small British
software company, Notting Hill Publishing, which teamed up with
Dawkins to produce a CD-ROM about the evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that CD-ROM was a small program that allowed
three-dimensional shapes to breed and mutate on a computer screen.
``The aim was to show how fast evolution could work,'' said Notting
Hill's creative director, Ben Whittam Smith. ``Because one of the
points was that evolution doesn't need tens of thousands of years.
It can happen just like that, right in front of your eyes, and with
software we could show that, using a genetic description language
that makes it very obvious what genes are and how they change as
you evolve these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we put it up on our Web site because it was quite a small
application _ we couldn't put the rest of the disk up, so we put
that up. And it had a massive number of downloads, comments,
e-mails and so on. So we realized we had something quite powerful.
But it didn't do anything, apart from being didactic. So we
realized we had to do something with it, and the idea almost came
out of nowhere: using music to control the evolution of these
shapes. And we realized we had Dancer DNA 1.0 in our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, after much tweaking and tuning, is a program that
allows you to generate exotic digital images, select the most
fantastically beautiful ones, then mutate and breed them into an
array of spiny, globular, metallic creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Line the images up, and the program creates an animated
sequence, with each creature morphing into the next, all set to
music. (Slip an audio CD into the CD-ROM drive but be advised: the
creatures seem to prefer drum and bass.)
</P>
<P>
   Dancer DNA creates a gene space _ the universe of all possible
creatures that could evolve from the specimens you've selected _
and music guides the video sequence through that range of options.
Differences in rhythm and volume produce different frames of
animation. Music is the environment in which these creatures live.
It influences the way their genes are expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Spawned by the Dawkins project, Dancer DNA quickly established
an online foothold of its own. On Notting Hill's Web site, the
overwhelming consensus was that this software belonged in a
nightclub. So the programming squad took it to a rave, and people
in baggy pants loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the software was far too slow,'' Whittam Smith said. ``If
you're dancing, your perception of time becomes strangely accurate,
and if the software's out of sync, you notice it. So we completely
reworked the product to make it much, much faster so that we could
license the software to veejays' for live events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, all the video work is done by people who just
love graphics, get paid a pittance by clubs to turn up with a van,
do an eight-hour show, then go home with a pat on the back and not
even a free beer. They get paid so poorly that we cannot generate
any sort of meaningful revenue from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the people with money are the brands. And we
realized the software could be used to advertise things. So we
completely rewrote the genetics language again so that it took a
slightly less organic view of how shapes are created and more of a
formal mathematical view, so it was easy to generate things that
humans make, perhaps with sharp edges _ like bottles. So it became
an advertising medium _ we are effectively paid by the brands to do
the shows, not by the clubs. At the moment we're doing a nine-month
tour with Bourjois Cosmetics, which is a part of Chanel. We've
worked with Sony Playstation, Holsten beer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if the evolutionary principles driving the
graphics were driving the product itself. Every time the program
hit some kind of economic roadblock, Notting Hill's programmers
rewrote its code. Via mutation and selection, the program evolved
its way into a youth culture fueled by advertising _ a fertile
niche where the software could proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Dawkins, a programmer is just computer code's way
of making more computer code. Hats off. &QL;

A COUNTRY OF LESSER GIANTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch's most recent articles on theater have appeared
in The Atlantic Monthly and The Wall Street Journal.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture a Mount Rushmore in honor of the monumental characters
of American drama. What faces do you see there, carved in stone?
Willy Loman, Blanche DuBois, Theodore (Hickey) Hickman and Mary
Cavan Tyrone. But has our country yet produced drama worthy to set
beside the Greek tragedians, Shakespeare, Calderon, Schiller,
Ibsen, Chekhov? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Willy, the washed-up salesman. Blanche, the desperate mantrap.
Hickey, the ``iceman,'' whose wife's perpetual forgiveness is his
ball and chain. Convent-bred Mary Tyrone in her morphine fog,
mourning her shattered faith and a buried child through her long
day's journey.
</P>
<P>
   Losers, every one.
</P>
<P>
   Losers, what's more, far past the point of no return when the
curtain rises. We never bear witness to the stages by which they
make their fate their own. Their stories unfold backward, through
endless hearsay. Whatever is wrong, don't blame them! It's not
their fault. From curtain up to curtain down, they point the
finger, make excuses, bellyache and lie.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is how long they can keep running on empty.
Long before victimhood became the glamorous political stance here
in the home of the brave, it was the ambitious playwright's idee
fixe.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, our Virgil in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' calls the inferno of
Harry Hope's saloon and rooming house the No Chance Saloon, the
Bedrock Bar, the End of the Line Cafe. Blanche takes a streetcar
named Desire, transfers to one called Cemeteries and gets off at
Elysian Fields _ a destination one actress articulated, with
purposeful ambiguity, as ``Illusion Fields.'' Next stop: the mental
ward.
</P>
<P>
   Our masterpieces of serious drama are dramas of failure.
</P>
<P>
   American plays that seek to analyze and reflect on what we might
grandly call the Human Condition or the Way We Live Now (or the Way
We Live Here) are a curiously recent phenomenon, more recent, in
fact, than similarly minded movies. D.W. Griffith made ``Birth of a
Nation'' in 1915, ``Intolerance'' in 1916. Not until after World
War I did American plays of comparable stature appear. The first
were the young Eugene O'Neill's ``Beyond the Horizon'' and ``The
Emperor Jones,'' mounted by the Provincetown Players in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, countless seriously intended plays have come and
gone. Sophie Treadwell and Maxwell Anderson, Clifford Odets and
William Inge stepped up to the plate. Pending unforeseen and
unlikely developments, their memory lives more in history books
than in drama courses, let alone on the living stage, where their
rare revivals give off a whiff of mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   History's judgment on American dramatists who are active and
esteemed today _among them Edward Albee, Margaret Edson, Horton
Foote, John Guare, Tony Kushner, David Mamet, Terrence McNally, Sam
Shepard, Nicky Silver, August Wilson _ may be kinder; it is too
soon to say.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Shepard's ``Buried Child'' will endure. With a
gun at my head, I would also place bets on Albee's ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?,'' Ms. Edson's ``Wit,'' Guare's ``Six Degrees of
Separation,'' Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' Wilson's ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom'' and McNally's ``Master Class,'' which in
international productions has seemed a much richer, more enigmatic
script than most New York critics have supposed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a canon of older plays has formed. ``Death of a
Salesman'' qualifies as a classic, though the claim of Arthur
Miller's other scripts is shaky. The legacy of Tennessee Williams
includes several items that refuse to die (``The Glass Menagerie,''
``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''), several
that refuse to live (``Summer and Smoke,'' ``Sweet Bird of
Youth''), and several that are available to the enterprising
resurrectionist (``Orpheus Descending,'' ``The Night of the
Iguana,'' ``Not About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that there is something tremendous about O'Neill,
even if it is measured by the clock (only three hours and change
for ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' four plus for ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' five for ``Strange Interlude,'' six for ``Mourning
Becomes Electra'').
</P>
<P>
   Thornton Wilder presents a special case. Our life resembles
``Our Town'' less and less, but his generous vision is still
appealing, as anachronistically American as apple pie. ``The Skin
of Our Teeth,'' Wilder's Joycean projection of human history onto
the paradigm of a ``typical'' mid-century American family, has its
champions, too. Come to think of it, George Antrobus, the play's
Father Knows Best, might merit a place on Mount Rushmore also,
except that he would seem so out of place. (He's not a loser.)
</P>
<P>
   Partly, no doubt, for chauvinistic reasons, we pretend that our
greatest plays measure up to the world's greatest. Directors,
critics and the public from London to Tokyo, from Paris to Sydney,
indulge us in this fantasy, treating our classics in a respectful,
often worshipful spirit of continuing exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The key word here is ``continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   However we choose to define a classic, a sine qua non is that
the material lend itself to reinterpretation in the light of
changing circumstances. On this test, our canonical masterpieces
fail. Unlike Oedipus, Hamlet or Hedda Gabler, the towering roles in
American drama belong to characters about whom it is impossible to
develop a genuinely fresh point of view. The deficiency extends,
unsurprisingly enough, to the plays in which they appear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Our great American masters wrote plays the way a Stendhal or a
George Eliot wrote prose fiction. They spelled out a character's
appearance, age, physical tics, personal aura and psychology, not
to mention the setting, in overwhelming and often unrealizable
detail, down to the length of their noses and the titles of the
books on their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The insights squirreled away in stage directions can be
remarkable. Meet Happy, Willy's younger son: ``Sexuality is like a
visible color on him, or a scent that many women have discovered.
He, like his brother, is lost, but in a different way, for he has
never allowed himself to turn his face toward defeat and is thus
more confused and hard-skinned, although seemingly more content.''
</P>
<P>
   Observations of such specificity _ also abundant in O'Neill and
Williams _ make absorbing reading, but what business does a
playwright have making such a show of omniscience? A novelist, by
convention, can do so, being free to speak to the audience
directly.
</P>
<P>
   A playwright, however, is at the mercy of intermediaries.
Clytemnestra or Uncle Vanya not only allow the actor to exercise
independent creativity, they also demand it. Whereas Willy,
Blanche, Hickey and Mary Tyrone take their marching orders and
execute a maneuver. Everything is diagrammed right there on the
page.
</P>
<P>
   As, for instance, in the final sequence of ``Long Day's Journey
Into Night,'' stage-managed with all the know-how of the mad scene
of ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood is set by the sound of rheumatic fingers playing a
Chopin prelude on an offstage piano. The music breaks off and in
comes Mary, trailing her wedding dress, the talisman of a life
sacrificed to romantic illusion. ``I knew she heard my prayer and
would always love me and see no harm ever came to me so long as I
never lost my faith in her,'' Mary says, as her reminiscences draw
to a close, recalling her girlish devotion to ``the Blessed
Virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in the winter of senior year,'' she says, as her
reminisces draw to a close. ``Then in the spring something happened
to me. Yes, I remember. I fell in love with James Tyrone and was so
happy for a time.'' These words are music on which Donizetti
himself could not improve. Delivered with minimal competence, they
cannot fail of their effect, but the effect is identical every
time.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of ``Death of a Salesman'' is similarly invariant.
Brian Dennehy transferred to Broadway this season from the Goodman
Theater, Chicago, accompanied by the sort of hoopla that greeted
the Electra of Zoe Wanamaker or the Hamlet, several seasons ago, of
Ralph Fiennes, performances that redefined the roles and thus the
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway's last Willy Loman was Dustin Hoffman, a bantam.
Dennehy is a bruiser. The different body image strikes a different
note of pathos, but it has no bearing on who Willy is. His meaning
is contained in the name Loman, his fate summed up in the immortal
line about riding on a smile and a shoeshine. The character knocks
at the gate of metaphor, but the gate stays shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody dast blame this man,'' says a cranky neighbor at
Willy's graveside, and who dast disagree? He has his failings, to
be sure: a little adultery, a little vanity, a lot of denial. He
puts up a brave front. He regrets his lost chances. Mostly, though,
he functions as Exhibit A in the playwright's harangue against
capitalist exploitation of the workingman. Instead of moral
inquiry, there is moralizing: ``Attention must be paid!'' When
characters in Ibsen moralize, as the awakened Nora does in the last
act of ``A Doll's House,'' they are not broadcasting the Author's
Message but voicing hard-won convictions of their own. From the
clash of opposing convictions, the drama takes fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey's Hickey in ``The Iceman Cometh'' is generating, if
anything, an even louder buzz of anticipation than Dennehy's Willy
Loman did, and no wonder. The production, opening on Thursday at
the Brooks Atkinson Theater on Broadway, is based on the Almeida
Theater version mounted in London, where it won Olivier, Evening
Standard and London Critics' Circle awards for Spacey and for
Howard Davies, the director.

   Hickey (another salesman) is the party animal who all of a
sudden starts calling all his cronies on their ``pipe dreams,''
those not-so-little, not-so-white lies by means of which they hold
up their heads. (Samples: I'm not a whore, I'm just a tart. I wish
I were dead. I'll get my job back. White people treat me as a white
man. I love the proletariat. I loved my wife. I love my mother.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at Harry Hope's has a button, everyone else knows what
it is, and nobody ever pushes one, for fear of reprisals. In walks
Hickey, full of his new gospel, hawking truth serum, and all hell
breaks loose. ``I wrote the book,'' he keeps saying, setting people
straight much against their wills. Surprise! The truth sets no one
free. Hickey's pipe dream is the most lethal of all. (Hickey _ what
a name. Love bites.)
</P>
<P>
   Few actors at large have more aces up their sleeves than Spacey,
a master at keeping the spectator off balance. Who can doubt that
he will rivet the attention? But if he torpedoes my theory (and I
hope he does), he will be the first to achieve a significant
re-evaluation of one of American drama's iconic characters, defined
once and for all time, even for those too young to have seen him,
by Jason Robards in Jose Quintero's Circle in the Square revival of
1956.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The hope of anyone performing that service for Blanche DuBois
grows increasingly remote. For audiences under 65, who missed
Jessica Tandy, the role's reputedly incandescent originator, the
point of reference is the movie with Vivien Leigh. Is there
anything in the role she failed to show?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of recent seasons _ separate Broadway revivals
mounted around Blythe (``Illusion Fields'') Danner and Jessica
Lange; Andre Previn and Philip Littell's new operatic
``Streetcar,'' starring the lustrous soprano Renee Fleming; Michael
Wilson's perceptive revival this season at Hartford Stage with
Annalee Jefferies _ says no. (The Hartford production returns in
July.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lincoln Center Theater's recent revival of Lillian
Hellman's subclassic ``Little Foxes'' revealed in Regina Giddens
facets that few can have suspected were there. On film, Bette Davis
gave what looked like the definitive account of an iron-willed
gorgon, icily calling every shot in her nefarious property-grabbing
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   On the stage of the Vivian Beaumont, Stockard Channing portrayed
a desperate woman bluffing her way to Pyrrhic victory with a very
weak hand, transforming a star vehicle into something much more
fascinating: a play.
</P>
<P>
   As for Blanche, you can play much of her part for laughs
nowadays. (As history teaches, tragedy repeats itself as farce.)
What you cannot do is conceive of the part in any but the precise
masochistic terms Williams prescribes, as a vulnerable, poetic soul
shipwrecked on the cruelty of an uncomprehending world.
</P>
<P>
   Her name, like Willy Loman's, is emblematic. Blanche the
lily-white, Blanche the blameless, Blanche the more sinned against
than sinning. Never mind that she drove her husband to suicide,
never mind her questionable morals; Blanche is the victim here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What poetry!,'' Stanley sneers, after one of her lesser
tirades, representing all the brutes who ever failed to appreciate
her. ``We've had this date with each other from the beginning!,''
he announces later, on the brink of rape. To put it gently, the act
seems wildly out of character. Stanley needs sex the way a baby
needs the breast. A husband more attached to his wife's apron
strings you will not find. A rapist? In Blanche's dreams, but
Williams needed (italics)someone(end italics) to smash her.
</P>
<P>
   Previn reports that every soprano he meets these days wants to
sing Blanche in his new opera. ``It's an irresistibly
(italics)big(end italics) part,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Here may be the key to the lasting appeal of our American
classics. Focus on failure, reduce action to recrimination as they
may, they offer juicy opportunities for acting _ acting in the
sense of vicarious living under the gaze of those wonderful people
out there in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Actors' egos must be served, of course. No narcissism, no
performance. But on the ladder of dramatic greatness, the
satisfaction of such needs is only the first step.

EXAMINING HITCHCOCK AT 100: AN INTERACTIVE MUSEUM EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The scene on the screen is intimately familiar: a blond woman
smokes a cigarette, oblivious to the ravens gathering on a set of
monkey bars in the schoolyard behind her. By the time she finally
notices a bird landing next to dozens of others, the suspense is
almost too much to bear. So you click on the Pause icon and go back
in five-second intervals, trying to figure out how the scene was
made.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be impossible to interrupt a film in a theater
and clumsy to skip from shot to shot using a VCR, manipulating film
clips is central to Multimedia Hitchcock, a new computer program
that will be part of the Museum of Modern Art's centennial
exhibition on the filmmaker starting on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to use a computer kiosk to learn about all
of Alfred Hitchcock's 53 films through a wealth of video, text,
audio and still images.
</P>
<P>
   In a section called Classic Sequences, for example, users can
watch a scene from one of 11 films, manipulate it frame by frame
and hear Hitchcock's own comments (or read an interview
transcript).
</P>
<P>
   When you click on the audio button during the playground
sequence from ``The Birds,'' you hear Hitchcock say he thinks that
the traditional technique of building suspense through
cross-cutting is ``worn out.'' He goes on to explain, ``That's why
when the girl was waiting outside, smoking, I stayed with her for
50 feet of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia Hitchcock has a biography of the director; reviews
and commentary by critics; video clips representing 27 films;
descriptions and credits for each film; the cameos Hitchcock made
in most of his movies; biographies of collaborators like David O.
Selznick, Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck and James Stewart; clips
from the television series ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' and a
section examining his influence on directors from Truffaut to
Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia Hitchcock was developed by Robert E. Kapsis, a
professor of sociology and film studies at Queens College of the
City University of New York, as a tool for film students. He grew
up seeing the director's films. ``The thing about Hitchcock was his
psychological mastery of the audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapsis said his original aim had been to build a scholarly
database of primary source material. For film students, Multimedia
Hitchcock offers a way to study the director by seeing and reading
original material. For the public, it offers a new look at
Hitchcock films through his writings and words.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia Hitchcock will be on display at the Museum of Modern
Art through 1999. Unfortunately for fans, there are no plans to
produce the program commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Veneziale, Sarah Kozinn and Lauren Popkin spent 30
minutes examining Multimedia Hitchcock when it was on display
recently at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. ``It
was neat to hear Hitchcock's voice,'' said Veneziale, a big fan.
``It was like having a conversation with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kozinn enjoyed exploring the ``Psycho'' shower scene shot by
shot and the flexibility of the program's user interface.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are in control of everything,'' she said. ``It's like
creating your own documentary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kozinn, who was born three years after Hitchcock made his
last film, ``Family Plot,'' in 1976, and has seen only three of the
director's works, is on her way to becoming a serious fan. ``I'd
never associate Hitchcock with today's horror films,'' she said.
``He's sort of his own genre.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4)  
 (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gloomy winter and the bright spring have provided
the proof. The glorious fullness of light that the architects John
M. Carrere and Thomas Hastings envisioned 90 years ago for the New
York Public Library's main reading room has returned the Beaux Arts
space to its former splendor.
</P>
<P>
   The room _ the length of a football field, the height of a
cathedral nave _ was darkened during the blackout days of World War
II when the arched tops of its 15 soaring windows were painted
over. It grew dimmer over the decades as the paint-scarred windows
were further blighted by grime that eventually obliterated the view
of the sun and sky from inside the room.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, entire tiers of bulbs in the chandeliers
short-circuited and lighting fixtures on the book stands and
reference shelves burned out, never to be repaired or replaced.
Later, as the number of microfilm machines and garish yellow chairs
multiplied, the room became dowdy.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue was realized under Paul LeClerc, the president of the
library, through the largesse of Sandra Priest Rose, a library
trustee, and her husband, Frederick Phineas Rose, a real estate
developer, who gave $15 million to restore the space.
</P>
<P>
   The room, newly named after their four children, is now called
the Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest and Adam Raphael Rose
Main Reading Room.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even on the darkest days, the room is filled with light.
The windows gleam with exquisite clarity, each pane replaced with
energy-efficient glass that prevents ultra-violet damage to the
books and the painted or stained-wood surfaces throughout the room.
</P>
<P>
   Refurbished or new lighting fixtures have made the titles on the
spines of books easy to read again. Fixtures have been installed
inconspicuously on tops of the bookcases on the room's perimeter to
illuminate the murals of sunny skies on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture is all about light,'' said the architect Lewis
Davis, who masterminded the restoration, paraphrasing his mentor,
Louis Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Light even influenced the choice of new finishes on the American
white oak furniture throughout the room. The sun had bleached some
surfaces in the north and south sections, so they were refinished
in a far paler tone than their original nut brown. The
Renaissance-style tables, too, are this light color. They had been
darker, but restaining would have marred their ebony inlay.
</P>
<P>
   Once the microfilm machines and the yellow chairs were removed,
the tables were returned to the room, updated with wiring for
computers. Back, too, came the saddle-seat chairs along with the
baluster-shaped lamps with bronze bases and brass shades.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs, too, were refinished and appear more graceful in
their lighter incarnation. From the tops of their rounded backs to
the tips of their cabriole legs, the chairs borrow the best from
the imperial past with their scrolled Grecian arms and vase-shaped
Chinese back splat, a must for Ming emperors.
</P>
<P>
   These and other distinctive elements were brought together in
the 1840s in a hybrid chair form that Carrere &AMP; Hastings adapted
for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the more than 600 chairs in the restored room are
reproductions, which were made by the Sam Moore Company of Bedford,
Va. After decades of requests from visitors, the library will sell
such reproductions in its shop at $799 each.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, 60 reproductions of the lamps were made to go along
with the 100 originals that survived. The new lamps were produced
by the Excalibur Bronze Sculpture Foundry of Brooklyn. The foundry
also rewired, cleaned and restored the original lamps, stripping
off the greenish white paint finish on the shades from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize the amount of light given off by the lamps _ old and
new _ Excalibur painted the insides of the brass shades white.
Masters at decorative metalwork, the foundry restored damaged parts
or recreated missing ones, like rosettes, on the 18 chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   The reproductions cost more than $1,000 each, a price that
seemed too high for them to be sold in the library shop. A version,
produced in China for Visual Comfort of Houston, sells in the shop
for $268. It is more than three inches taller than the original,
with a narrower, taller shade, two bulbs instead of three and pull
chains to turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   Excalibur also made the lion-shaped bronze fixtures for the
entryway to the main reading room, as well as the cone-shaped
white-glass hanging lamps in the book delivery and retrieval area.
These hanging lights replaced those with green-glass shades,
artifacts sorely missed by many people who studied in this room
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry W. Henderson, who fields questions at the information
desks in the room and has worked at the library for 39 years, said
visitors still asked, ``What ever happened to those emerald green
lamps?'' He said he didn't miss them one bit: ``They were part of
the darkness that's gone now.''

ONLINE GROCERY COUPONS FOR CONSUMERS

<P>
   The shoppers weren't the problem. Three years ago, the marketing
company Supermarkets Online decided to test the idea of offering
grocery coupons over the Internet. The company created a Web site
offering coupons that consumers could print out and redeem at their
favorite supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers liked it immediately,'' said David Rochon, president
and chief executive of Supermarkets Online, ``even though they had
to print out the coupons, even though they had to cut them out
afterward so they looked like normal coupons, even though we only
had a half-dozen or so offers a week on the service. They let us
know right away that they wanted even more coupons.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was with the manufacturers. ``Our version was not
acceptable to the manufacturers who offer coupons, because of all
the potential of fraud, the worry that nothing would prevent people
from counterfeiting unlimited amounts of coupons,'' Rochon
remembered. ``We realized then that if manufacturers weren't
willing, there wouldn't be an online service.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the first of the many hurdles purveyors of online
coupons have faced. Clearly, there was a market. American shoppers
are predisposed to using coupons to save money _ four out of five
shoppers used coupons in 1997, redeeming more than $3 billion worth
of the offers, according to industry studies.
</P>
<P>
   To compete with traditional coupons, E-coupon companies have
struggled to come up with a secure, well-targeted way to turn those
coupon consumers from clippers to clickers.
</P>
<P>
   For its coupons, Supermarkets Online created a new system that
calls for consumers to print out a shopping list of discounted
products. Emblazoned with a special bar code, the shopping list can
be scanned at checkout at 9,300 participating stores nationwide to
total a shopper's savings and then issue a credit, in the form of
``Web bucks,'' that can be redeemed to pay for subsequent
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we officially launched the site in January 1998,
we had the solution in place, and that was the breakthrough,''
Rochon said. Since then, the number of offers on the site
(www.valupage.com) has increased to about 50 a week; the number of
coupon shoppers visiting the site has also gone up significantly,
from 20,000 a month in January of 1998 to more than three million
last month.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers, online coupons offer a major advantage:
customization. Instead of picking through a random selection of
coupons that arrives in the mail or tucked into the daily
newspaper, shoppers can fill out online questionnaires specifying
their interests, zip codes and shopping habits and then receive
e-mail with relevant offers on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics differ slightly from site to site. For instance,
at some sites, consumers can print out paper coupons, redeemable at
brick-and-mortar stores. In other cases, the coupons can be
redeemed electronically at online stores. And, as is the case with
Valupage.com, a shopper who redeems the site's offers earns ``Web
bucks'' that can be used like cash.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the variety of online coupons _ offering
discounts that range from 50 cents off a package of Huggies diaper
wipes to $500 off a General Motors vehicle _ has proliferated with
the introduction of numerous online sites. Rather than relying on
determined shoppers to hunt down their coupon Web sites, many
companies have struck deals that will distribute their coupons on
popular portal sites and online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first step in the evolution of online
coupons, because there's an enormous opportunity here,'' said James
McQuivey, a senior analyst in online retail strategies at Forrester
Research. ``In the next two to three years, companies will figure
out how to get coupons more and more easily to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month, for example, America Online's customers
will find Supermarkets Online's grocery offers distributed on an
AOL food channel. The online offers from Emaginet.com, which
specializes in so-called E-centives that can be redeemed on line,
appear on the online site of the newspaper USA Today, in the
Marketplace section.
</P>
<P>
   Val-Pak Coupons Online, which specializes in offering shoppers
coupons for such local products and services as pizza and dry
cleaning, struck a deal last month to team up with Yahoo to
distribute its coupons to the 50 million users on the popular
portal site. Val-Pak will eventually be able to send customized
coupons to Yahoo's registered users to offer them products
available in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good fit, because the portal sites know exactly where
their users are registered,'' said Todd Leiser, vice president of
Internet technology at Cox Target Media, which owns Val-Pak.
</P>
<P>
   Another online coupon company, Coolsavings.com, last month
announced a daal with General Growth Properties, the nation's
second-largest regional mall company, to offer online coupons that
can be redeemed at local malls around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, online coupon companies envision a time in the
not-too-distant future where they will be able to deliver a
customized package of offers and information based on a shopper's
past habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't even need to know your name, just where you live
geographically and what you like to buy,'' Rochon said. ``It will
go beyond mere coupons. If you buy a lot of Oreos, maybe you'll get
a coupon for a new kind of cookie that tastes similar. If you buy a
lot of Miracle Whip, maybe you'll get a recipe, through e-mail,
that tells you how to use Miracle Whip as an ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could expand far beyond grocery savings. Maybe you'll get a
package of coupons in your e-mail for savings at your favorite
hardware store, gas station, even the shoe repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that day, however, finding online coupons remains a
hit-and-miss proposition. Surfing the Web looking for the perfect
coupon is enormously time-consuming. A more useful approach for the
shopper: limit the hunt to a trusted site or two, then get a
regular update on that week's offers in just a few minutes' time.
Better yet, find a site that sends e-mail updates directly to you.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is a relatively new industry, it pays to call ahead
to the retailer to confirm that the coupons will be honored. And as
with all coupons, check the expiration date before you print them
out: many online coupons are good only for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early in the life cycle of online coupons,'' said Ken
Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``Going to the next
level, where they are really convenient and easy to use, might be a
bit of a stretch. But it's going to happen.''

GIVING A GUERRILLA JOURNALIST THE FREEDOM OF CABLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Warren Berger is the founding editor of One, a magazine about
advertising.  
 By WARREN BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the debut episode of ``The Awful Truth,'' the new series
created by the guerrilla-style documentary filmmaker Michael Moore,
viewers meet Christopher Donahue, a Florida man with a
life-threatening pancreatic illness. Donahue desperately needs a
transplant, but his health care provider, Humana, refuses to pay
for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   On a conventional newsmagazine program, Donahue's plight might
have inspired grave tones and earnest pleas from a well-coiffed
correspondent. For Moore, it is not just a call to action but an
opportunity to create mischief. With cameras rolling, he
accompanies the ailing Donahue on a stroll through the corporate
offices of Humana, where Moore asks a sweating, stonewalling public
relations official to help him choose in advance a nice coffin for
Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Moore stages a mock funeral for Donahue on the
lawn of Humana's headquarters in Louisville, Ky. Moore himself
delivers a eulogy for the man standing beside him: ``I remember
Chris always used to say,'' Moore begins, then leans toward Donahue
and asks, ``What did you always say?'' Donahue replies, ``I just
want a pancreas.'' Before long, Moore has so thoroughly embarrassed
Humana that the company responds by reconsidering in Donahue's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Moore's work, particularly his breakthrough
documentary film in 1989, ``Roger and Me,'' and his Emmy-winning
series ```TV Nation,'' will recognize that the basic ingredients
remain the same in ```The Awful Truth,'' which has its premiere
next Sunday at 9 p.m. on Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, Moore can be counted on to defend downtrodden
``ordinary people'' like Donahue while taking aim at rigid (and
some might say easy) targets like bureaucratic corporations and
double-talking politicians. As ever, his chief weapons are his
unblinking movie camera and his wicked, offbeat sense of humor,
which usually manages to keep him from seeming sanctimonious as he
plays a kind of shlumpy Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's arrival on Bravo could be viewed as a step down for
someone who once occupied a prime-time slot on NBC, then one on
Fox, with ``TV Nation,'' which ran sporadically during the 1994 and
1995 television seasons. But Moore insists that he is pleased to be
returning to television on cable, where, he said, he is granted
more freedom to take on subjects that might be taboo on broadcast
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is going to be everything `TV Nation' would have
been if we didn't have the heavy hand of network standards and
practices on us,'' Moore declared on a recent evening at a
Manhattan editing suite, where he was putting the finishing touches
on a scene from ``The Awful Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment shows Moore bringing a group of Christmas carolers
to the headquarters of a tobacco company, where he leads them in
song in the lobby. The catch: The carolers, all lung cancer
victims, sing with croaky artificial voice boxes, as mortified
tobacco executives stand by helplessly and watch. ``That's
something you've never seen on TV before,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not on Bravo, whose viewers are accustomed to the more
mellifluous singing of, say, Luciano Pavarotti. Some viewers of the
arts network are likely to be surprised by ``The Awful Truth,''
whose rambunctious segments include one in which Moore travels with
a group of homosexual men in a recreational vehicle he calls ``the
sodomobile'' into states where sodomy is outlawed and interviews
shocked local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the show creates a little controversy, we're comfortable
with that,'' said Ed Carroll, the general manager at Bravo, which
is producing the series with the British network Channel 4. Carroll
said he believed ``The Awful Truth'' might help Bravo connect with
``viewers who haven't sampled the network before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``TV Nation'' was never highly rated ( Moore blamed
poor time slots for the ratings and the show's ultimate demise), it
did attract a following of younger viewers, who responded to
Moore's outrageous pranks and his willingness to challenge
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Awful Truth,'' Moore's fans are with him not only in
spirit but in person. Moore closes and opens the show and
introduces each segment standing before and interacting with a live
studio audience, filled with mostly young devotees.
</P>
<P>
   During the taped segments, the crowd can be heard tittering and
cheering whenever Moore, camera in tow, begins to advance on the
bastions where he is most unwelcome (corporate America, Capitol
Hill, the Deep South).
</P>
<P>
   But Moore is not just a prankster playing to the youth audience,
a la Tom Green of MTV, whose idea of humor is to cover himself with
food. Most of Moore's segments touch on serious issues like race,
class, free trade, environmentalism or health care.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll of Bravo believes that the channel's sophisticated
viewers will respond to that aspect of the show as well as to
Moore's arch humor and cinema verite style. Meanwhile, as he is
wont to do, Moore sees his presence on Bravo in terms of class
struggle: an arts channel ``should not be the purview of only
people from the upper class,'' he said. He promises to bring not
just college students but also working-class viewers into the Bravo
fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're part of my core audience, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who invariably wears jeans and a baseball cap, and whose
slumped posture and bowed knees make it seem as if he is supporting
the weight of the world, remains proud of his modest background,
often bringing it up with no prompting. ``I didn't go to film
school, and I didn't start out at Sundance,'' he said during a
break in his editing session.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting like a child _ slumped, sideways, with one leg draped
over the arm of a plush chair _ Moore veered between animated
political discourse (true, the murder rate in New York is down, he
acknowledged, but only because ``they don't count people killed by
the police'') and personal data.
</P>
<P>
   When he began filming ``Roger and Me,'' Moore recalled, he was
collecting unemployment in Flint, Mich., where he ``shopped at K
Mart and lived in a $27,000 house.'' He made the film _ in which he
doggedly pursues Roger Smith, the chairman of General Motors, to
confront him about the closing of GM plants in Flint _ ``because I
was angry at what General Motors had done to my town, and I was
going to do something about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger and Me,'' one of the most successful documentaries ever
made, turned Moore into an unlikely celebrity. But he resisted
changing his regular-guy image or his guerrilla-film ways. On ``TV
Nation,'' he continued to stage pranks and conduct ambush
interviews, often intended to make a political or social point and
to make his targets look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   He often succeeded, with help from willing victims. (On one ``TV
Nation'' segment, Moore showed that with a bit of lobbying, he
could coax Congressmen to propose legislation designating a
national holiday in honor of his series.)
</P>
<P>
   Moore has drawn criticism for his ambush tactics. The television
critic Tom Shales once derided him for ``dragging people in front
of a camera lens and humiliating them.'' However, Moore contends
that he doesn't trick his subjects and always allows them to speak
freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to present myself in as nonthreatening a way as
possible,'' he said. ``Some people end up saying things they
shouldn't say because they look at me and think, `Well, this isn't
going to end up anywhere; look at him, he hasn't even shaved in a
week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moore doesn't hide his political agenda, which leans heavily
toward labor and usually favors liberal positions over conservative
ones (though he considers himself politically independent). In the
opening episode, he ridicules Kenneth Starr by staging his own more
cost-effective Capitol Hill witch hunt, complete with overwrought,
finger-pointing actors in Puritan garb.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore makes no apologies for presenting a politically biased
show. Citing Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,'' which he considers
derivative of ``TV Nation'' but ``without the politics,'' Moore
said that because that show lacked an underlying serious message or
point of view ``it ends up just making fun of stupid people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after ``Roger and Me,'' the real issue for Moore may
not be one of politics or occasional harsh treatment of subjects
but of staying power. Though he has added a few new wrinkles, he
remains the same basic character who burst on the scene in his
debut film: the labor-loving Everyman, shambling into corporate
lobbies and asking rude questions. His schtick, if it's fair to
call it that, given his obvious passion, does not seem to have
evolved much.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is aware of this and understands the need to reinvent
oneself in the fickle media landscape. He insisted that he planned
to limit the number of ``scenes of Mike going into the lobby and
jousting with public relations people,'' and that he would try some
new creative approaches on his show.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should expect a kinder, gentler or apolitical Moore
anytime soon. And industry moguls who see someone with a baseball
cap and a movie camera coming through the revolving doors would be
well advised to hide.

<P>
   Q. How can I get a program to start automatically when I turn on
my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is something rather satisfying about booting up your
computer, going to make some coffee and returning to your desk to
find your word-processing and e-mail programs open and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a programs to do that is fairly easy, whether you're
using Windows 95 or 98 or Macintosh. You simply need to put a
shortcut or alias file of the program into the start-up folder.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a PC with Windows 95 or 98, use Windows Explorer to
find on your hard drive the folder for the program you want to open
when you boot. Open the folder, and then find and right-click on
the program's executable file (the one that ends in .exe) to create
a shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   Then type Control X to cut, go to the Start button, right-click
on that to get the pop-up menu and pick Open. Double-click on the
Programs folder inside the window to open it, then find the
Start-up folder in there and open it. Type Control V to paste the
shortcut into the Start-up folder.
</P>
<P>
   On a Mac, find the program file you want to use. Click on it
once and type Command M to make an alias file. Drag the alias file
to your desktop. Open the System folder on your hard drive and find
the folder called Startup Items. Drag the program's alias from the
desktop and into the Startup Items folder.

REASSEMBLING ART SHATTERED IN EARTHQUAKE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ken Shulman's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on an
exhibition of Caravaggio's ``Taking of Christ'' in Boston.  
 By KEN SHULMAN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ From afar, it looks like an Italian neo-realist
director's vision of Camelot: the 13th-century Basilica of St.
Francis (San Francesco), its sides ribbed with scaffolding, the
base of its bell tower warmed by a blanket of winter mist.
</P>
<P>
   As a visitor draws closer, the cathedral's solemn mass comes
into view, looming unshakable and solid. Two tonsured Franciscan
friars huddle under an umbrella beneath the archway at the lower
basilica. Only on entering the upper basilica is one reminded of
the recent tragedy, and then only vaguely.
</P>
<P>
   Here 28 miles of gold-hued aluminum scaffolding transform the
narrow nave into a sort of solemn dirigible. The ceiling vaults
above the entryway and the altar _ vaults that collapsed 18 months
ago during an earthquake, shattering ceiling paintings attributed
to Cimabue and Giotto and killing four people _ have been entirely
rebuilt and reinforced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``From a structural point of view, I can say that we are well on
our way,'' says Raoul Paggetta, a director of the architectural
restoration at the basilica. ``For us, the worst is definitely
over.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 26, 1997, at 11:26 in the morning, a violent tremor
shook the earth of the central Italian region of Umbria. In Assisi,
the tremor caused the basilica's vaulted ceiling to contract and
then expand, catapulting into the air more than 1,000 tons of
debris that had been left on top of the vaults from centuries of
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The mass of leftover stones, bricks and mortar crashed into the
vault over the main altar, blasting away two of its leaves and
sending Cimabue's ``St. Matthew'' and a section of his assistants'
starry sky plummeting almost 60 feet to the stone floor below. At
the entryway, a support arch collapsed, hurling eight painted
saints by Giotto to the ground and burying two Franciscan friars
and two fine-arts inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A vault leaf decorated with Giotto's ``St. Jerome'' also gave
way. When the tremor finally stopped, more than 1,900 square feet
of ceiling _ about 10 percent of the area _ had collapsed. The
remaining 21,000 square feet were badly scarred. Tons of rubble lay
at the entrance and at the base of the altar. Four people were
dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though often criticized for its lack of efficiency, the Italian
state responded swiftly and effectively to the Assisi crisis. An
emergency committee was established two days after the disaster
under Mario Serio, the director general of the Fine Arts
Administration of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During the first critical weeks, Giuseppe Basile, an inspector
at the state Central Restoration Institute in Rome and director of
pictorial restoration at the basilica, orchestrated a force of 300
restorers and volunteers, who sifted through the rubble to recover
and catalog the pieces of the crumbled paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, Paggetta and his crew of nearly 100
workers rebuilt the missing sections of the ceiling and the
supporting arch above the entrance. As insurance against future
quakes _ the region of Umbria is historically unstable;
seismologists have charted more than 50 tremors since September
1997 _ the entire ceiling was reinforced with strips of Kevlar, the
bulletproof material used in police vests, and strapped across the
back of each vault leaf like giant Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   Circular steel braces now anchor the bases of the crumbled
15th-century arches. A calibrated network of sensors monitors the
ceiling, plotting expansions, contractions and, above all, the
shifts caused by earth tremors. The entire operation, expected to
cost $28 million by completion, has been financed by the Italian
government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To draw attention to the disaster, the Vatican and several
Italian cultural agencies have organized ``The Treasury of St.
Francis of Assisi,'' an exhibition of 100 objects that is on view
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York through June 27. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as absolute security,'' says Paggetta,
his voice bobbing over a chorus of hammers and electric drills and
chatter from the scores of unseen workers on the scaffolding above
him. ``If a cataclysm occurs, there's nothing we can do. But we can
and have done much to insure that the basilica will suffer little
or no damage if struck by a quake like the one that caused this
damage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far beneath the basilica, in the 16th-century stables known as
``Il Stallone,'' the mood is less ebullient. There, in a hastily
constructed but fully modern restoration laboratory, a half-dozen
white-coated restorers struggle with what is probably the most
difficult pictorial conservation effort in Italian history.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Giotto's ``St. Jerome'' lies in a series of milk crates and
plastic trays, shattered into 30,000 pieces. The remnants of
Cimabue's ``St. Matthew,'' another 30,000 pieces _ some of them as
small as one square millimeter _ lie in another series of
containers. The scene is as dramatic, and pathetic, as a Mannerist
deposition.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shards of Giotto's eight saints lie on nine-foot aluminum
tables, spread on top of life-size color reproductions that serve
as visual guides for the restorers. Following experience, and
sometimes only instinct, the restorers try to match pieces by
shape, color and subject. For them, it's almost like working on a
series of giant jigsaw puzzles, except that many of the most
important pieces are either damaged or missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some saints, like St. Ruffino, whose face and body are now
composed into a segmented but wholly legible mosaic, are well on
their way to reconstruction. Others lag behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a job that has to take a long time,'' says Paola
Passalacqua, chief restorer of the Assisi team. ``The pieces don't
come together automatically. Some days you can be lucky and place
20 of them. Some days you feel lucky if you place just one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Passalacqua hopes that the eight saints can be reassembled,
mounted onto specially constructed curved supports and reinstalled
along the rebuilt arch in the upper basilica by Christmas when Pope
John Paul II is scheduled to say Mass in Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   For the other damaged paintings, she and her colleagues are far
less sanguine. Cimabue's ``St. Matthew,'' which was executed in
tempera and whose fragments are dangerously fragile, is
particularly problematic. In private, several members of the Assisi
team admit that the question for Cimabue is not ``when'' but
``if.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Basile, who directs Ms. Passalacqua and her restorers,
Cimabue's best chance for survival lies in a novel _ some might say
quixotic _ computer program. ``We are taking photographs of each of
the Cimabue fragments,'' he explains, ``labeling them and creating
a virtual archive of the fragments. We will then turn the project
over to our computer experts, who are working on an algorhythm that
will eventually tell restorers where each of the thousands of
pieces belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   If the still-unwritten computer program works, Basile says, both
the Giotto and Cimabue paintings could be ready within two years.
If not, he says, the completion date will be significantly
extended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basile has already drafted several contingency plans for the
space on the ceiling vault should the ``St. Matthew'' prove to be
unsalvageable. One of these involves projecting a photographic
image of the Cimabue painting onto the bare plaster of the vault
over the altar. Another calls for commissioning a contemporary
artist to paint a new mural where ``St. Matthew'' once stood.
Still, he stresses, these are plans of last resort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to hope that we can recover the majority
of what we had before the earthquake,'' he repeats, in a voice
neither full nor void of conviction. ``We should know whether the
computer program is viable within six months. And if it isn't,
we'll just move on and start trying to put the paintings together
by hand.''

HOME CLINIC: THE PREPARATION AND INSTALLATION OF ATTIC VENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Howto drawing is being sent to both photo and graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week this column discussed the need for proper attic
ventilation with vents. Vents rely on natural temperature
differences within the attic to move the air. They use no
electricity, so they are economical. In most cases, a few
well-positioned vents may be all you need to keep the air recycling
in your attic.
</P>
<P>
   Soffit vents fit in the panels on the underside of the eaves.
There are three types: circular plug vents, rectangular panel vents
and strip vents. Plug and rectangular vents are the easiest to
install. You only have to cut a hole through the soffit boards and
position the vent, but making these cuts may be a little difficult
because the panels are in an awkward location. You will have to
bend over backward to operate the saw.
</P>
<P>
   Strip vents are harder to install because you have to cut
notches in the soffit supports to accept the strip. This may entail
dismantling the soffit to make the cuts, then reassembling it.
Whichever soffit vent you choose, you must make sure that the attic
insulation does not cover the vent opening. So after the vents are
in place, check that the floor insulation does not extend to the
eaves. If it does, trim it back to gain the necessary clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Gable or louvered vents are mounted in the gable walls of the
attic. Ideally, the vent should be centered under the roof peak.
First measure the length and width of the vent housing (not the
surface flanges), then transfer these dimensions to the outside
wall. With a circular saw, cut an opening through the siding and
sheathing.
</P>
<P>
   Next measure the width and length of the surface flanges (these
dimensions will be larger than the housing dimensions) and transfer
them around the newly cut opening. In effect, the lines will look
like a frame around the opening. Set the saw blade to cut through
the siding, not through the sheathing, and cut this part away.
</P>
<P>
   Working from inside the attic, cut away any studs that obstruct
the opening. Frame the opening by nailing two 2 by 4's above and
below the opening between the nearest studs. Next nail two vertical
2 by 4's to these horizontal pieces on either side of the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the outside, push the vent into the opening until
the flanges seat snugly against the sheathing. Nail it in place.
Cover the flanges with trim, and caulk between the trim and siding.
</P>
<P>
   Roof vents are installed through the roof. Naturally you must
cut a hole first. Start from inside the attic. The vent hole should
be centered between two rafters. Select a location, then drive a
nail through the roof to mark the center of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Now move to the roof. A word of caution: working on any roof can
be dangerous, especially if it has a steep pitch. Never work on a
roof on a windy day or if the roof is wet or even damp. Wear shoes
with nonskid soles and be sure to secure yourself and tools and
materials as you work. If you are uneasy when working from heights,
it may be better to leave this job to a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Find the nail in the roof. Cut away the shingles, then cut a
hole in the sheathing to match the shape of the vent. Return to the
attic and nail support boards, 2 by 4's, between the rafters at the
top and bottom edges of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof, pry up the shingles (be careful: cold shingles can
break when you attempt to bend them) around the hole. Coat the
underside of the vent flanges with roofing cement and slip the vent
beneath the shingles. Secure it with gasketed roofing nails.
</P>
<P>
   The ridge vent is positioned over a gap (this must be cut) in
the roof peak. It runs along the entire length of the roof. Ridge
vents are difficult to install because you must work on the highest
part of the roof while maneuvering the long, unwieldy vent into
place.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by removing the cap shingles. This will expose the black
building felt beneath. Measure one inch down from the roof peak. Do
this on both sides of the roof, front and rear. Snap chalk lines to
connect the marks on one side, then the other. This will give you
two long lines on either side of the peak. Use a circular saw to
cut on the line just through the sheathing. Be careful not to cut
into the rafters beneath _ this could compromise the structural
strength of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the cuts, pry away the sheathing, then apply a
generous bead of caulking on either side of the gap. Position the
vent on the peak then fasten it down by driving gasketed roofing
nails through the mounting flanges.

MAYA LIN'S LATEST: MIXING DAVEY CROCKETT AND ARMANI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, Tenn. _ For 18 years Maya Lin's reputation has been
etched in stone. ``Every time there was a bombing or a plane crash,
I would get a fax,'' the designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
said. Eventually, Ms. Lin made a conscious decision to avoid being
typecast ``as a person whose work concerns death and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But proving that her architectural reach extends beyond black
granite monuments has taken time. ``I need a body of work to come
out for people to realize how serious I am about this discipline,''
Ms. Lin, 39, said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on a farm owned by the Children's Defense Fund outside
Knoxville, Tenn., she is showing off her newest creation, a library
hidden in an old barn that once belonged to Alex Haley. She had the
existing building taken apart, then reinstalled, its rugged skin
wrapping around the new construction. Where the barn's wizened
timbers meet Ms. Lin's translucent blue-green glass, there's a
tantalizing glimpse of history, and of this oft-overlooked region,
striding confidently into the future. Think of it as architecture's
Appalachian spring.
</P>
<P>
   The building's dedication in mid-March, orchestrated by Marian
Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund, was a
daylong photo opportunity: first a ribbon-cutting with Hillary
Rodham Clinton, then presentations by Toni Morrison and Dorothy
Allison, Donna Shalala and Joyce Carol Oates, Maya Angelou and
Martha Stewart. All day, the famous visitors posed in small groups,
as if trying out configurations for a women's Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin, six months pregnant with her second child, flew down
from New York with her husband, Daniel Wolf, the photography
dealer. Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble, who
financed the library with his wife, Louise, gave them rides on his
corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ms. Lin, one of the most-recognized designers in the world,
doesn't like crowds. (Watching the first lady meet and greet, she
said, ``That's so not me.'') Indeed, it was hard not to think she
was talking about herself when she said of the library: ``There's a
complete schism between inside and outside. That's a conscious
decision that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   The library is the latest addition to the farm, which the
Children's Defense Fund, bought from the Haley estate to use as a
retreat and conference center. At its center is the barn, a
30-by-60-foot rectangle of rough-hewn lumber. The century-old
building was raised high on a pair of cribs _ the cantilever style
favored by farmers to keep hay dry during floods. ``I thought of it
as a kind of living room for the farm,'' Ms. Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   She turned one crib into a gift shop, the other into an entry
(including stairway and elevator). Once the new rooms were
completed, she had the old lumber put back roughly where it had
been. The juxtaposition of hand-split logs and bluish-frosted glass
creates the building's most striking effect: from the outside, the
glass is partly visible between the logs, while from the inside,
the wood's irregular shadows mottle the translucent panes. Either
way, the contrast of homespun and minimalist is mesmerizing _
picture Davey Crockett wearing Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs is a single room of about 1,200 square feet. (It
contains the Langston Hughes Library, contributed by Len and Louise
Riggio, and encompasses the John Hope Franklin and Maya Angelou
Reading Room and a bench called the Mrs. Rosa Parks Sitting Area.
Luckily, the Vietnam memorial taught Ms. Lin how to squeeze in lots
of names.)
</P>
<P>
   The room's surfaces are pale maple, beige industrial carpet and
brownish particleboard. It is a slick, pleasant interior, but it
bears no relationship to the barn vernacular or to any of the
region's other styles. If it wasn't for a large, square window
overlooking a man-made pond, this room could be the attic above Ms.
Lin's studio in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, she says, is to create a complete separation, so you
experience entering the building as a peeling away of a rough outer
skin. ``It's like a diamond in the rough,'' she said. ``When you
cut into it, it reveals a more-polished inner self.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin, in a black pantsuit and a single string of pearls,
pointed to the asymmetrically placed window. ``I never do
symmetry,'' she explained, ``because it's more fun to have to work
everything out for yourself, like a tangram,'' the ancient Chinese
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   She describes the interior as both Shaker and Zen. (Not a
licensed architect, Ms. Lin collaborated with a Tennessee firm, and
her assistant, Stas Zakrzewski, served as go-between. ``I can't
stamp the plans,'' she says, ``but I see them all.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin said she wanted the architecture to be anonymous, ``a
clean, well-lighted place to read a book.'' And yet outside,
between the cribs, there's a cube of black marble, with water
bubbling out of its top. Ms. Lin didn't just agree to incorporate
the familiar stone into the library's entrance court, she insisted
on it. ``I knew without it there would be no proper point of
arrival,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't the stone reminiscent of the monuments she says she wants
to put behind her? ``This is a totally different granite,'' Ms. Lin
answers, unconvincingly. ``It has a splash of white running through
it.'' Later, she warms to the idea that this is her signature.
``The stone,'' Ms. Lin says, ``is a reminder I was here.''

   Potted Azaleas
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was given a large potted azalea at Christmastime. It
bloomed heavily through January. Can I plant it outdoors in the
spring? Would it be better to put it out in the summer and then
take it indoors?
</P>
<P>
   A. The azaleas sold for winter bloom indoors are usually from a
group called India hybrids, large-flowered plants that flourish in
the Deep South but are not hardy in the North. Dr. Robert Hobbs,
editor of The Azalean, the quarterly journal of the Azalea Society
of America, says: ``My idea would be to put it outside for the
summer in a lightly shaded spot. The plant should stay in its pot
but be buried in soil up to the rim. It has to stay moist but not
wet, so if it's in plastic, repot it in terra cotta.'' (Unlike
plastic, terra cotta is porous. Soil in terra cotta pots dries out
faster when the pots are exposed, but stays moist longer when they
are buried.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it out for a month to six weeks after the first frost,
'' he said. ``In order to bloom, the plant needs a chilling period
at near-freezing temperatures. Thirty-two to 40 degrees would be
ideal, but be sure not to let it get colder than 20. Bring it
inside, put it in a sunny spot, give it a little bone meal or other
bloom-enhancing fertilizer and water it well. It should bloom
around Christmastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hobbs didn't mention aphids, whiteflies and red spider
mites, all indoor pests that are likely to find your azalea
attractive, but he did point out that this branch of the
rhododendron family was huge. There are hundreds of other azaleas,
including scores of beauties far hardier than your houseplant.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more, consider joining Dr. Hobbs and his
fellow aficionados, both amateur and professional, in the Azalea
Society of America (P.O. Box 34536, West Bethesda, Md. 20827, 301
855-5269). Membership costs $25 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Elusive Piquillo
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read an article in The New York Times on Jan. 6 about
piquillo peppers from Spain. They sound interesting, but I have
been unable to find a source for seeds. Do you know of one?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have not been able to find a United States source for
plants or seeds of any pepper called piquillo, as described in ``A
Hot Sweet Taste of the Spanish North'' (Dining In/Dining Out),
which reports that chefs are turning to these horn-shaped sweet,
hot peppers from Navarre, though they are available only in jars
and cans.
</P>
<P>
   Piquillos are probably an old-fashioned seed-saver's variety,
not a modern hybrid. Dr. Paul Bosland, a hot pepper expert, who is
a professor in the horticulture department at New Mexico State
University in Las Cruces, said that in this country ``Hungarian
paprika would be about as close as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   They're thick walled and sweet,'' he continued, ``but the
hotness does vary. Be sure you get one of the mild kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood roast one of those, and you'll get something resembling the
peppers that sound so appetizing in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Resemblance is as far as you'd be likely to get even if you did
find piquillo seeds, because growing produce is like selling real
estate: location is everything. (Think about the way wine people
are always going on about where the stuff is from.) The flavors of
vegetables and fruits are genetically determined, but how those
flavors are expressed depends a lot on climate and soil. Yours may
be excellent for pepper growing, but they won't be the same as
those in Lodosa, Spain, the piquillos' home ground.
</P>
<P>
   To get as close as possible, try growing peppers that are
described as thick fleshed, sweet and mildly piquant _ bull nose
would be another good choice. Roast and peel samples of everything,
then have a taste test, using canned piquillos as your standard.
It's likely that you'll do well with at least one of your
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   For the widest range of possible peppers, consult The Garden
Seed Inventory, available from Seed Savers Exchange, 3076 North
Winn Road, Decorah, Iowa 52101, (319) 382-5990; $26 for softcover.
The catalog comes close to listing all the nonhybrid vegetable
seeds available commercially in the United States, along with
sources where they can be obtained. Paprika and bull nose are
available from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, P.O. Box 170,
Earlysville, Va. 22936, (804) 973-4703 (catalog, $2).
</P>
<P>
   Skunks in the Suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in a lovely suburb 15 minutes outside Boston, and we
have a large skunk community. How can I keep them out of my yard?
Is there some kind of plant or shrub or other organic matter they
will avoid? It wouldn't be a problem except that my dog cannot stay
away from them. Is there a way to get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Getting rid of them is not to be. Skunks have adapted very
well to the suburbs, where there are lots of good things to eat _
lawn grubs, earthworms, mice and rats _ and plenty of sheltered
places to build dens. When you remove a skunk from such habitat,
all you do is open territory for the next boarder.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep them out of your yard is with a low, tight
wire mesh fence. Skunks don't do much climbing, so two feet tall
should be adequate. They do dig, though, which means you'll want to
bury the fencing six to eight inches deep. Nothing repels them, but
they are easily attracted, especially by grub-infested lawns and
anything fishy, meaty or sweet. (They love moldy cake and stale
cookies almost as much as raccoons do.) Some authorities suggest
drenching the lawn with pesticides to get rid of the grubs, but
even doing that is unlikely to solve the skunk problem completely.
It's important to keep the garbage covered, and to be aware that
such organic fertilizers as blood meal and bone meal are powerful
lures. Keep unused supplies in tightly lidded containers, and be
sure to work the fertilizers well into the soil as soon as you use
them.
</P>
<P>
   As you note, however, the problem is not so much with the skunks
as with your dog, and the easiest solution is probably to control
the pooch rather than the polecats.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the forces that permeate daily life, perhaps nothing
merits the close scrutiny of scholars more than technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people who are critical of technology. They
range from extremists like Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber, to
popular authors with a less fanatical approach, like the astronomer
Clifford Stoll (``Silicon Snake Oil'') or the unyielding naysayer
Kirkpatrick Sale (``Rebels Against the Future'').
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few scholars _ a few dozen philosophers,
historians and computer scientists _ concentrate on technology the
way medical and environmental ethicists concentrate on the fate of
the planet or issues related to the human body.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of skeptical view of the human use of natural resources
that characterizes a field like deep ecology is harder to find
among the people who study technology, said Andrew Light, an
assistant professor of philosophy and environmental studies at the
State University of New York at Binghamton who splits his time
between environmental ethics and the philosophy of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Light said, it can sometimes get a little lonely for
those in the business of suggesting that the profound technical
revolution computers have brought about is as much of a problem as
it is a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Three philosophers who take a skeptical approach are Hubert L.
Dreyfus of the University of California at Berkeley; Joseph
Weizenbaum, who retired from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Albert Borgmann at the University of Montana. They
all continue to pursue lines of thought about technology that they
first articulated 25 or 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some newcomers trying to move theoretical work in
more practical directions, like Richard E. Sclove, founder of the
Loka Institute in Amherst, Mass. Sclove is actively engaged in
community organizing and public policy issues related to
technology, as is Gary Chapman, director of the 21st Century
Project at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread in all their thoughts is that not enough
attention is being paid to the limitations of computers and the
moral and political consequences of putting computers where people
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   These philosophers are not Luddites. On the contrary, they not
only use computers and other electronic products, but they also
admire and depend on them. ``I have a recordable Walkman that just
blows my mind, it's so beautiful,'' said Dreyfus, 69, a philosophy
professor at Berkeley. ``And I love my laptop.'' Drefyus said he
was also impressed by new software for continuous speech
recognition that allows you to dictate to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus first drew attention for his views in 1972 with the
publication of a defiant book titled ``What Computers Can't Do''
(Harper &AMP; Row). It challenged the assumptions of the nascent field
of artificial intelligence, saying it was theoretically impossible
to build truly intelligent computers. Dreyfus holds firm to his
view. ``Computers have been getting faster and faster at an amazing
rate,'' he said, ``but as I predicted, they are not getting more
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Dreyfus has criticized Cog, a humanoid robot
built by artificial intelligence researchers at MIT. ``All I can
say for now is that I am ready to go out on a limb and predict Cog
won't learn a thing,'' Dreyfus said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not deny that computing technology is good for many
tasks. ``My interest is in people who claim more promise for
computers than can be done because they don't understand how
different humans are from computers when it comes to performing in
a human world,'' Dreyfus said.
</P>
<P>
   He is joined in his skepticism of artificial intelligence by
Weizenbaum, an MIT computer scientist who is known for having
written a program more than 30 years ago called Eliza, which
imitated a Rogerian psychologist. His intention in writing Eliza,
he wrote later, was not to prove that a computer could understand
natural language but to demonstrate that language is understood
only in contextual frameworks.
</P>
<P>
   Weizenbaum wrote that he had been alarmed to see people become
captivated with the program and engage in long, typed conversations
with it. ``What I had not realized is that extremely short
exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce
powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Now retired and living in Berlin, Weizenbaum, 76, continues to
lecture and write on the topic of misguided faith in computers and,
now, the Internet. ``The Internet is like one of those garbage
dumps outside of Bombay,'' he said in an interview. ``There are
people, most unfortunately, crawling all over it, and maybe they
find a bit of aluminum, or perhaps something they can sell. But
mainly it's garbage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Dreyfus and Weizenbaum have concentrated on what computers
cannot do, Langdon Winner, who is a political scientist at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and is trained as a
social and political theorist, comes to the topic from a more
political viewpoint, focusing more on what computers
(italics)should(end italics) not do.
</P>
<P>
   Winner is known for his view that technological advances have
political implications. A prominent example that Winner cited in
his 1986 book, ``The Whale and the Reactor: A Search for Limits in
an Age of High Technology,'' was the system of overpasses in and
around New York City that were designed by Robert Moses.
</P>
<P>
   The overpasses on the parkway to Jones Beach, for example, were
built low and prevented access by public buses. One consequence,
Winner pointed out, was to exclude low-income people, including
many members of racial minorities, who depended on public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked at all kinds of technological systems, it seemed
to me that the stuff of politics is almost always built into
them,'' Winner said. ``A lot of the issues that have concerned
people from Plato to Hannah Arendt are questions located in the
kinds of things we call technology: our experience of being free or
unfree, the social arrangements that either foster equality or
inequality, the kinds of institutions that hold and use power and
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Winner, who is 54, said he had been inspired as a graduate
student to continue a course of study in technology and politics
after auditing one of the first classes Dreyfus taught on computers
and intelligence at Berkeley in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Winner has examined how the introduction of computers and the
Internet could drive out other styles of living and what he calls
``crucial forms of locally based commerce.'' He refuses to purchase
a book, for instance, from Amazon.com because he worries about the
effect that online bookstores are having on, say, his own local
bookstore in Chatham, N.Y., whose owner is Muriel Faxon. ``I say:
`Think global. Shop Muriel,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a skeptic about the tendency to move agreeable kinds of
human interaction, particularly those that bring us into contact
with strangers, into a digital world. We want to have places that
feel comfortable, secure and friendly. I can't figure out why we're
so busily eliminating those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dreyfus and Winner, as well as Weizenbaum, are highly
suspicious of computers in education and especially suspicious of
so-called distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some nontraditional students who, for one reason or
another, would find it excessively difficult to actually drive to a
university campus several times a week,'' Winner said, ``and I
don't have any problem with that. But there are some very important
parts of education that have to be done in the physical presence of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Luddite label is affixed to Winner and his colleagues,
they bristle. But in these times, their message is easily
misunderstood. ``They reach a public and a media and an industry
that has no room except for friends and enemies,'' said Sherry
Turkle, a professor of the sociology of science at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Like Winner, Borgmann has written extensively on the high social
cost of high tech. And like his fellow skeptics, Borgmann starts
many conversations by pointing out that he is not against computers
per se. ``The question is,'' he said, ``how the computer will
insinuate itself into culture at large, and into leisure, how it
will further isolate people from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   As the veteran skeptics enter their 60s and 70s, it is logical
to assume that a younger generation of scholars will pick up where
they leave off. Indeed, a number of departments devoted to science
and technology studies have sprouted in the past two decades at
places like MIT, Cornell University and the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with fields like environmental ethics, in which
virtually every major academic press is publishing books, young
philosophers of technology remain relatively scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your average graduate student in philosophy is very unlikely
to get any exposure at all to the philosophy of technology,'' said
Light, who is 32. As a graduate student, he said, he was fortunate
to meet Andrew Feenberg, a philosopher at San Diego State
University who encouraged him to pursue the study of technology.
Light hopes not only to bring more philosophers to the study of
technology, but also to make them a more visible part of public
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work on issues like the effects of technology on
society, we're remiss if we don't talk about our work in a public
context,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weizenbaum is not heartened by the level of public discourse
about technology. ``Speaking globally,'' he said, ``society is
suffering from a gigantic failure of critical thinking. In a
certain sense people are getting dumber. People seem to have lost
the capacity for skepticism and what I call critical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borgmann is relatively optimistic. He said he believed that
the public was more likely now to turn its attention to technology
and its effect on the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to a point,'' he said, ``where a lot of people are
going from a station wagon to an SUV, or from old-style TV to
high-definition TV, or a machine that runs at 266 megahertz to one
that runs at 500, and they'll ask, `Is that all?'''

THE BOYS OF SUMMER WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring is officially here. The grass is ripening like a sweet
green apple. Flowers are blooming like colorful microwave popcorn.
And I'm very, very worried.
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried because spring is summer's maid of honor, and summer
is coming down that flower-strewn aisle at a rapid pace.
Unfortunately, I am not ready for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that I was ready. I maintained my weight over the
winter. You know, nothing ventured, nothing gained. But I think
that my muscles must have melted a little bit under all those
layers of corduroy and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was trying on my swimming suit recently in preparation
for a family vacation in Florida. My husband wandered into the
bedroom and caught me hiding in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' he exclaimed, his eyes nearly popping out of the
sockets. ``You bought a thong swimming suit! I can't believe it! I
thought you hated those. I've been trying to get you to buy one for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new,'' I mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what are you saving it for? Why haven't you worn it
before now? I certainly don't want you to wear it at the YMCA pool,
but you could wear it around the house with those nice, red pumps
that I like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pumps hurt my feet. The heels are so high that I fell
and sprained my wrist the last time that I wore them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, forget the pumps. Just wear the new swimsuit with some
houseshoes when the kids spend the night with your folks this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that it's not new, OK! This is the suit that I bought
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year? No way, that thing was huge. It looked like a
shorts set. It was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's still ugly, and this is it. I think the chlorine
made it shrink or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The merriment danced in his eyes until it came parading out of
his mouth as outright laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, I was in front of the TV working out to an
aerobics video. I did great for the first 10 minutes; then my body
turned on the sweat hydrant. I almost drowned during the next 10
minutes. I was gasping for breath when the video instructor said,
``All right, we're all warmed up now. Let's do some real
exercise!''
</P>
<P>
   I crumpled to the floor, crawled to the VCR and pushed the eject
button. By then, I couldn't have found my thong without exploratory
surgery. My husband finally cut one end with some scissors and the
thing snapped like a broken fan belt. I almost lost an eye when it
whipped by my face.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've since started a low-fat diet; I gained 2 pounds the
first week.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, I wrote Congress and asked them to extend spring
by one month this year. I haven't gotten a reply, but I'm hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a word of caution from someone who knows: Never, ever
do tae-bo in a thong bikini. I can't explain the details. Just take
my word for it.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL SUSPENDED AS TALKS CONTINUE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) finance and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks underway, the presiding
judge in the Microsoft antitrust case Wednesday put the trial on
hold until at least May 10, giving the government and the software
giant nearly six weeks to strike a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief status hearing, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson did not allude to the top-level talks, which began
Tuesday at the Justice Department. When he recessed the high-stakes
trial on Feb. 26 for what appeared then to be a six-week hiatus,
Jackson had pointedly called the warring parties into his chambers
to urge them to use the time wisely.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a joint vow of silence on the courthouse plaza
Wednesday, lawyers for the government and the company signaled that
they were serious in their resolve to settle the case. Microsoft,
the world's largest software firm, has denied the government's
contention that the company illegally expanded its dominance over
operating systems for personal computers into such other realms as
Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But when Microsoft made the first move last week to reach an
accord, several state attorneys general, who are also parties to
the case, were quick to assert that the company's proposed remedies
fell far short of an acceptable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If there is continuing skepticism on the government's part over
Microsoft's commitment to a settlement, it remained hidden amid an
effort to present a common front on the one area over which there
is seeming complete agreement -- the need to impose secrecy over
the coming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are going to be productive settlement discussions,
those discussions can't take place publicly,'' said David Boies,
the government's lead attorney. ``Consequently, none of us will
have any comment whatsoever about settlement discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's veteran general counsel, standing
beside Boies, nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Their unprecedented joint statement followed 62 days of
testimony by 24 witnesses, much of it under cross-examination, when
the mood in the small courtroom was often tense and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   But after the hearing, Boies and Neukom emerged from the judge's
chambers to quickly brief their own teams and -- with the courtroom
locked and cleared of spectators -- together draft what would be
said to the press a few minutes later on the courthouse plaza.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, Boies, had flanked Joel Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief when the talks opened in Klein's
guarded third-floor conference room. Also present were Iowa
Attorney General Tom Miller and Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Neukom, Microsoft is being represented at the talks by
Richard Urowsky, a silent but potent legal presence at the defense
table who had brokered a 1995 consent decree for his Microsoft
clients, and by Charles Rule, who had held Klein's current
antitrust post during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   In further suspending the trial -- it was originally set to
resume April 12 -- Jackson has made a virtue of necessity: he is
currently presiding over a murder case that, he noted, could well
run beyond the May 10 date that he has set as the earliest one on
which the Microsoft trial could resume.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the settlement talks fail to produce results, Jackson
will hear from six rebuttal witnesses -- three from each side. The
list of those witnesses is due April 23.
</P>
<P>
   After the rebuttal witnesses, Jackson will give the parties 30
days to submit written proposed ``findings of fact,'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then will issue his own ``findings of fact,'' which in
turn will trigger oral closing arguments. Each side will have more
time to frame their own proposed ruling -- known as ``conclusions
of law'' -- before Jackson will issue the only ruling that counts.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft should lose, Jackson will probably convene the
remedy phase of the trial. No matter which side wins, the other
side is virtually certain to appeal.

 HIS NEW DOORS DON'T CLOSE PROPERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeaating for Indianapolis and all needing; moved Thursday, March (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In my new house, there are two interior doors that hit the
top jamb on the latch side of the door when I try to close them.
How can I fix that?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN TOSCANO, Onset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it is truly a new house, the contractors should fix those
doors, which may be hung slightly askew. Or, possibly, some
settlement knocked them out of plumb.
</P>
<P>
   Short of all that folderol, this is what you can do. Check the
hinges to make sure they are tightly screwed on. Sometimes just
tightening them will bring the door back into position. If they are
tight, shim out the top hinge; unscrew one leaf of that hinge (the
one on the jamb) and insert a piece of cardboard the shape of the
leaf into the mortise, where the hinge normally goes. Reattach the
leaf and see what happens. This shimming will drop the door's latch
side by a bit, clearing the jamb opening. If the door has three
hinges, you may have to shim the middle one, too. And be careful
that you don't drop the latch side so much that that side binds in
the jamb.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these tricks works, you may have to cut or plane down
the top edge to make it clear.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another idea in the continuing battle against pigeons on
the roof. M.T. of Danvers, Mass. called to say she tried
everything: a fishing line laced zigzag fashion on small stakes, a
fake owl, needle boards, and Tanglefoot (a sticky substance), all
without success. In desperation, she cut two pieces of garden hose
3 feet long and placed them on the roof, looking squiggly like a
moving snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had no pigeons for 15 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, that is a long time to fool pigeons, but they must have
gotten the message. It may not work for everyone, but you have to
believe it worked for M.T.
</P>
<P>
   I believe any color hose could be used, but I think green or
black would be most appropriate, or effective.
</P>
<P>
   Another caller gave this tip: Water the pigeons down with a hose
as often as possible. Eventually they will get the point.
</P>
<P>
   That latter idea is best for one-story houses. Once again, the
handyman expresses his thanks, and is happy to pass on the tips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.The mortar between the bricks in my fireplace's firebox are
crumbling. The house is nine years old, and the gaps are 3/8-inch
wide. What's wrong, and how can I fill those gaps and keep the
mortar from falling out again?
</P>
<P>
   TONY TONELLI, Winchendon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ordinary mortar in a firebox will burn out fairly quickly; a
firebox like that should be made of fire brick (hard-baked clay,
yellow in color) with fire clay (a special type of mortar) between
them.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have such fire brick, you can repoint: Chip and dig
out all loose mortar to a depth of at least 3/4 inch and as wide as
the joint. Dry-brush any mortar residue, dampen the joints, and
insert fresh mortar. You can buy a high-quality mortar at hardware
and building stores; it is called mortar mix, made by Sacrete. Add
water to make a crumbly, not soupy mix, and insert this in the
joints, using a pointing tool, an inexpensive tool sold in hardware
stores that allows you to push the mortar in compactly. You must
compact that mortar; otherwise it will fail. Another reason why the
original mortar failed is uncompacted mortar. The reason you wet
down the joint is to prevent the dry brick from pulling moisture
out of the mortar excessively and prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am renovating my house, but the floors are a little slanty,
which I do not plan to level. But they slope enough to make double
doors scrape the floor when they are opened. What can I do to
prevent that scraping?
</P>
<P>
   BILL MURKO, Ipswich, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If they are interior doors, you could trim the bottoms of
them. Or, reset the framing so the doors are a little higher. That
latter chore sounds like a lot of work; it is. It even sounds a
little barmy, but the Handyman has done it. One often has to do
some weird things in an old house.
</P>
<P>
   But here is an easy way out: Install rising butt hinges on the
door; these hinges are set on a cam that raises the door when it is
open. They are made by Constantine; telephone 800-223-8087.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The glass stopper is stuck in my antique glass decanter. I
heated the glass, and used some penetrating oil. Neither worked. In
fact, I think someone superglued the two together. What can I do
next?
</P>
<P>
   BOB WARSHAW, Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You did the two classical remedies, but you might not have
worked the heat properly. To do so, soak the decanter in warm
water, and let it heat up. Then pour cool water on the stopper.
Since the decanter is antique, I would be very careful using hot
and cold water on old glass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of WD40 or penetrating oil, try glycerin, which may
penetrate better than other oils. If this fails, call Trefler &AMP;
Sons in Needham at 781-444-2685. They specialize in restoring and
repairing china, ceramic, porcelain, and other materials.

AUTHOR LETS A CAT DO THE TALKING IN HER SEVENTH MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 26 years since her lesbian pride novel ``Rubyfruit
Jungle'' established her as an instant and lonely voice for the
literary gay community, Rita Mae Brown has made all sorts of
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's personal life, especially a relationship with tennis
star Martina Navratilova, fueled gossip columns and tabloids. Her
poetry and ``serious fiction'' _ mostly novels combining wicked
humor and social sensibility _ have captivated critics. Brown's
screenplays have emphasized history and human rights, particularly
HBO's ``The Nat Turner Story.'' She founded FREE, the Feminist
Repertory and Experiment Ensemble, to give female writers and
performers a stage for less-than-mainstream stage productions.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a serious woman interested in making a serious
impression. And yet, the 54-year-old Virginia native is currently
touring the country on behalf of ``Cat on the Scent,'' the seventh
in a series of mystery novels whose hero-sleuth is a feline named
Sneaky Pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't think writing the occasional Sneaky Pie book is a
contradiction to my other interests,'' Brown says. ``The cat
consciousness is fun. You've got the human master, and this little
cat is always sort of pushing her to be smarter. See, I live out in
the country, I grew up in the country, and I was always in contact
with animals who were a lot more intelligent and aware than humans.
Did you know a horse can gather seven times more information than
we can because of the way its eyes are spaced?''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Brown become minilectures. She knows a great
deal about many subjects, and she isn't shy about demonstrating it.
But her smile is so genuine, and her enthusiasm for topics ranging
from fox hunting to weight lifting is so great, that the effect is
friendly rather than intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to write any book; technically, it's very
difficult,'' Brown says. ``Sneaky Pie books aren't easy, though in
a sense they are relaxation from my real, or serious, work. The
problem often is, though, that when you tackle serious causes like
feminism, when you try and stand up for what you believe in, people
lose their sense of fun. And there's nothing wrong with having fun.
We're not on Earth to be sad or serious all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1973, ``Rubyfruit Jungle'' gave readers and the public a
certain impression of Brown that she hasn't been able to escape.
She accepts her reputation without entirely agreeing with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people just think I'm sort of a gay Girl Scout, hopefully
a good one,'' she says. ``I'll carry that reputation with me until
I die. But I have to say that the early '70s were fearful days,
when nobody in my (gay) situation felt safe admitting what they
were. So in terms of me, well, I said it loud, and all these years
later it feels pretty good, at least to me, that I did it. I was
raised to stand up and fight. I still do. If I see someone kicking
a dog, I'm going to go over and kick the one who's doing the
kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her primary motivation remains just putting words on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live to write,'' she says. ``The English language is just a
cathedral of sounds. It's a privilege to be a writer in this
cathedral. I never want to leave it. I want to be around to write a
really good novel when I'm 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown segues to what aspiring writers ought to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where our language is concerned, if you want to write, then
you must read the great writers and learn from them,'' she insists.
``Homer, of course; Euripides because he invented the tragic comedy
and perfected it; Shakespeare; Virginia Woolf, who can be so
difficult and infuriating; Gertrude Stein, who will also be
infuriating, but still can teach young writers everything they need
to learn about using the present participle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning young writers reminds Brown of Monica Lewinsky, whose
``Monica's Story'' (written by Andrew Morton) briefly topped the
bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at that girl and I think, `This poor soul,' '' Brown
says. ``It's all too human and too understandable what she did,
what happened to her, but how is she going to feel about it when
she's 50? Right now she gives the impression she's not entirely
sorry; that, in some ways, she's actually proud of what happened
with her and the president. When she gets older, she's going to
realize what a mess she made.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledges that she's made her share of messes; breakups
with some lovers have been anything but discreet. But she's not
wasting time on regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried, above all, to be honest,'' Brown says. ``I'm at a
point now where I can write my books, do a Sneaky Pie title now and
then, have some fun and indulge my interests. I still have a lot of
things I want to do, like visit the great opera house in Vienna and
fox hunt in Ireland. After a certain age, maybe 40, you always have
to ask yourself, `Do I want more in life or less?' And I always
want more.''

`MATRIX' KICKS THRILLER GENRE UP A NOTCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost worth seeing the sci-fi action thriller ``The
Matrix'' just to catch Keanu Reeves mouth the word he was born to
utter _ ``Whooaaa'' _ in that stoner's deadpan of his. ``The
Matrix'' is another wily genre bend from the Wachowski brothers,
Andy and Larry, the talented pair behind 1997's no-budget pretzel
twist of a noir, ``Bound.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, they've taken on science fiction, and more important,
the Joseph Campbell mythological bent the genre has acquired since
``Star Wars.'' (Not to mention the
``snatch-the-pebble-from-my-hand'' fakey Eastern philosophy from
``Kung Fu''; I always wondered why George Lucas never gave David
Carradine any props.)
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is computer programmer Thomas Anderson, the Luke
Skywalker-ish figure who has to be convinced that he has, if not
the Force, then an incredible simulation. (He's portentously
referred to as The One.) And who could be better at playing
slightly out-of-it incredulity than Reeves? With his coma-dark
eyes, long neck and quizzical expression, he's like a real-life
relative of Olive Oyl from the old Popeye cartoons, and his dazed,
deliberate ``Wha ...?'' makes him look as if his thought processes
operate on a five-second delay.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's dreams of pursuit and arrest, which keep him sweaty
and shocked, have begun to intrude on his thoughts. But he soon
learns that he's not just paranoid. He's told that the world we all
think we exist in is basically a dream state, created by a computer
network to keep everyone blissed out on mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Morpheus (a sonorous-voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi figure played by
Laurence Fishburne) is the man to emerge from the underground and
inform Anderson _ renamed Neo _ that he is The One. Meaning, Neo
has the gift to defeat the monstrous machine that keeps the world
subjugated. And also to do away with the automatons in
charcoal-gray suits and dark glasses _ human-appearing
manifestations of the computers _ who are out to crush Morpheus'
band. These creatures are led by Bob Smith (Australian actor Hugo
Weaving, from ``Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Matrix'' bolts from the block with a rush of adrenaline,
running to keep a few steps ahead of the mold that could be growing
on the cliches. Of course, Morpheus trains Neo to disbelieve what
he sees. And, for some reason, to practice kung fu and other
Oriental fighting techniques. This seems odd, because the
automatons can't be defeated in this way; they're even faster than
Morpheus' artificially enhanced freedom fighters. But the fights
look great.
</P>
<P>
   The Wachowskis use this opportunity to pack in the garish
fluidity of Hong Kong action movies, with the opponents pitted
against one another like video-game warriors. The hand-to-hand
fight sequences are filmed with stop-action cameras that could
probably track a raindrop to the ground frame by frame. The
slender, fit cast looks great whipping into the air, a martial-arts
version of The Gap's ``Swing'' commercial, although most of the men
look as if they've had their heads shaved with a belt sander.
</P>
<P>
   The whole rickety mess is built atop a dystopic cyberpunk vista
influenced by William Gibson. (It's almost as if Reeves chose to
star in this movie to make up for his role in the Gibson-inspired
``Johnny Mnemonic,'' a barking trout of a film.) It's rare, and
kind of touching, really, to see a lushly financed studio
spectacular work so hard to keep everyone's attention. And with
enough symbolism _ Reeves' name, Neo, means ``new'' and is an
anagram for ``one'' _ to keep online chat rooms busier than the day
``Babylon 5'' was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Matrix'' steals a piece of almost every sci-fi
movie of the past 20 years, from ``Aliens'' to ``Dark City.'' Its
majestic silliness gives the directors a chance to use their
prowling camera around the vast spaces of Sydney, Australia, where
it was filmed. They also came up with a florid visualization of
their allegory: The real world gives everyone a faded, bluish tinge
as if it were lighted with industrial-strength fluorescent bulbs,
but inside the Matrix the colors are Kodak-ad vivid.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, although overlong, is an exhilarating mixture of
pulp-grandiosity and the kind of big-budget thrill-seeking that TV
has been unable to supplant. (Take some earplugs, because this film
is also brain-shaking loud.) And luckily, ``The Matrix'' is smart
enough to have a sense of humor. A knowing smirk dances around its
lips, especially since Morpheus is constantly saying, ``You cannot
know what the Matrix is'' and then taking the better part of the
picture trying to explain it. Based on the kind of box-office smash
it's bound to be, Jason Patric better start working out, in case
Reeves turns down the sequel.

IT'S MY BOYCOTT, BUT i'LL WATCH IF I WANT TO 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard-core baseball boycotters say I'm a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Nonboycotters say I'm ambivalent, indecisive, confused.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't care about baseball one way or the other say
it's fine by them if I boycott _ or if I don't. They just want me
to shut up about it.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could. But I can't. I've been boycotting, or
semiboycotting, baseball for so long that I just can't stop _ and I
can't stop talking about it, either.
</P>
<P>
   If I gave up my boycott, I'd be in the same situation that the
Clinton-haters will be in once America's bad-boy president leaves
the White House: What in the world will they complain about?
</P>
<P>
   My love-hate relationship with baseball, especially major-league
baseball, is too embedded in heart and mind to be altered. I have
loved baseball since thrilling to the exploits of all-time greats
such as Stan Musial, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays way back in the
1950s. I have hated it since the early '90s, when overpaid players
and greedy team owners started bickering about their millions and
billions.
</P>
<P>
   I launched my first boycott after a ``labor dispute'' between
players and owners that disrupted spring training in 1990. The
details of the dispute were irrelevant; I was outraged that
big-league ballplayers had the audacity to mention the word
``labor'' in the same sentence with ``baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott has been an on-again/off-again operation since then,
peaking in intensity after baseball's most loathsome affront to its
fans: the 1994 strike that wiped out part of the season, all of the
playoffs and _ horror of horrors _ the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury in recent years were the antics of
arrogant, ungrateful creeps such as Albert Belle, whose
considerable accomplishments on the ballfield have been tarnished
by his chronic and apparently compulsive abuse of fans, media and
fellow players. Belle is hardly the only jerk to play baseball _
remember Vince Coleman, who threw an explosive device at a group of
fans? _ but he's as representative a symbol of the game's
degradation as you could name.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately _ or fortunately, depending on your point of view
_ my anger at the participants has not diminished my affection for
the sport that once reigned as America's national pastime. Is it
possible to love the game even while despising the corruption?
</P>
<P>
   Sure it is. Which is why I seem ambivalent and indecisive about
the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to turn your back on baseball if you really don't care
about it. There is no shortage of other amusements in this day and
age. But if you grew up a baseball fan at a time when baseball was
still a glorious pursuit peopled by true heroes, giving up the game
is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   So last season, after several years of refusing even to read
game stories or box scores in the newspaper, I modified my boycott
to allow myself the luxury of watching games on television and
reading baseball news in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This decision earned me the instant disdain of committed
boycotters, who accused me bailing out, copping out and selling
out.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow boycotters jumped on me with both feet. Either you're
boycotting or you're not, they said. You can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I say I can have it both ways. It's my boycott, after all;
why shouldn't I make up the rules _ and change them if want to?
</P>
<P>
   My main concern these days is making sure that I don't
contribute in any way to the obscene accumulation of wealth by the
perpetrators of the business we call baseball. That means no
in-person attendance at ball games and no buying licensed
merchandise such as caps, T-shirts, coffee mugs, etc.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem like much of a boycott, but believe me when I
say that my resolve was sternly tested last September when I
visited the St. Louis area at the height of the frenzy over Mark
McGwire's home-run championship. McGwire memorabilia was
everywhere; someone even offered me a ticket to a game that had
been sold out for weeks. I had to leave town to keep from caving
in.
</P>
<P>
   So with the 1999 season only a week away, the boycott continues.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a wimpy boycott, but it's a boycott.
</P>

STORING E-MAIL: ON DISK OR PAPER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On many levels of government the debate continues about which is
preferable: archiving printouts of e-mail messages, or keeping them
in their electronic form. In the latter case, the mail is more
easily searched, and important header and address information is
more likely to be retained.
</P>
<P>
   But as technology changes, there is no assurance that electronic
records will be accessible down the road. ``Five years from now,
people may not be able to read those records,'' said Harry A.
Hammitt, editor and publisher of The Access Reports on information
policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Retrieving e-mail can be tricky even with newer computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Murphy, staff director of the Boston City Council, said
some council members had agreed to a newspaper reporter's request
to see their e-mail, but complying might be hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their e-mails actually were trashed, so to speak, as soon as
they read them,'' he said, ``so someone would have to go to our MIS
department and try to retrieve them. There are some issues there
because the council doesn't consider themselves a department and
doesn't want other city departments rifling through their computer
records either.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, e-mail was officially labeled a public record that is
subject to the federal Freedom of Information Act. (To include
e-mail in a Freedom of Information Act request, the person making
the request should add a phrase like ``including any e-mail
correspondence that relates to this issue'' in a written request to
the agency.)
</P>
<P>
   So federal officials' e-mail cannot be scrapped
indiscriminately, just as paper documents must be preserved. As
Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, put it: ``The medium is not the message. The
message is the message.''

KITSCH ASCENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ill.)  (js) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kitsch has history, too, and bad taste, just like good, has its
fashions. Inspiration struck someone the day velvet car dice were
born, just as surely as it did Duchamp or Daumier. An artist had
first to imagine and paint those card-playing dogs before they
could become a figure of fun in beer ads.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsch's history is illuminated by a strange show and a strange
new book. The book is ``The Artificial Kingdom: A Treasury of the
Kitsch Experience'' by Celeste Olalquiaga (Pantheon, $30). Ms.
Olalquiaga invokes the philosopher Walter Benjamin to argue for
kitsch as a key to reverie and a gateway to the unconscious. She
waxes lyrical about one of her favorite pieces of kitsch _ a hermit
crab under glass from a seaside resort. The hermit crab is also an
apt metaphor for the way kitsch inhabits the shells of old art
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, kitsch for commerce often grows out of kitschy art. I
thought of Ms. Olalquiaga's hermit crab the other day when I saw a
CNN segment about a lobster car. A seafood restaurant in Orlando,
Fla., had wrapped a little red New Beetle in a big red lobster,
swiping an idea from Dali's famous 1936 lobster telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Fine or semifine art's degeneration into commercial kitsch is
also the subject of the show at the Huntington Beach Art Center in
California through Sunday. ``Rascal in Paradise'' is devoted to the
work of Edgar Leeteg, the originator of a kitsch classic: paintings
on velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Escalante, the curator, explained that painting on velvet
goes back to medieval monks. It was a fad in Victorian England,
where proper young ladies in finishing schools turned out prim
little pictures of fruit and flowers on velvet. Leeteg, who was
born in East St. Louis, Ill., apparently came across some of these
in heartland museums and never forgot them. When he shipped out to
the South Seas in 1933, inspired by Gauguin, he turned to painting
to pay his bar bills, rendering on velvet grizzled island warriors,
happy diving boys and barely clad island women. In a few years, he
invented modern velvet painting, with its portraits of Elvis
Presley and John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Leeteg was also living a life as brightly tawdry as his
paintings. ``The American Gauguin,'' he called himself. A former
sailor pal who ran a tourist gallery in Honolulu made him a star.
Aloha Barney Smith compared the play of light against dark in the
paintings to the technique of the Dutch masters, a school of
painting he could be sure patrons would know from the cigar box.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the paintings were selling for $5,000 to $10,000
each, and Leeteg had established himself in a gaudy estate he named
Villa Velour. He died in a motorcycle accident in 1953. The demand
he created was fulfilled by mass production in the sweatshops of
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   South Seas and shell souvenirs: kitsch is often associated with
vacation locales. Constantin Boym, a Russian-born designer who
always brings a fresh take to American pop, has produced
limited-edition ``souvenirs for the millennium'' based on items
like spoons from Graceland or bronze Empire State Buildings. When
people travel, he argues, they like to buy objects they would never
consider at home. It might be called ``taste takes a holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Jeff Koons have shown interest in kitsch for years.
Now, Boym believes, kitsch is influencing designers and the mass
media. Ever since the modernist critic Clement Greenberg first took
on the subject in a famous essay in 1939, kitsch has figured as a
kind of evil twin to modern. But Greenberg's description of kitsch
as ``vicarious experience and faked sensations'' would be easy to
apply to all sorts of products in the postmodern world. And putting
kitsch in an artwork or in an art museum, shop or book changes it,
perhaps redeems it.
</P>
<P>
   A store in Los Angeles called You've Got Bad Taste and dedicated
to selling objects like ``Dukes of Hazzard'' watches has closed its
doors because of declining business. But perhaps only the name was
at fault. Much of the kitsch of the past flourishes today as camp,
produced to be purchased ironically, to show good taste by
disdaining bad. It has become fodder for what Peter Ward, author of
``Kitsch in Sync: A Consumer's Guide to Bad Taste'' (Plexus, 1994),
calls ``a gloriously inverted form of snobbery.''

DISTRAUGHT TEXAS A&AMP;M STUDENT LEAPS TO HIS DEATH 

</HEADLINE>

By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Texas A&AMP;M University freshman, apparently despondent over
failing grades, jumped to his death from the sixth level of a
campus parking garage as police tried to dissuade him from taking
his life.
</P>
<P>
   William Berry Jr., a 19-year-old agricultural engineering
student from the Waco-area town of Hewitt, died Tuesday afternoon.
Campus police director Bob Wiatt said officers talked to Berry for
20 minutes in an effort to get him to abandon his perch on the
garage ledge.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's death occurred just one day after a 25-year-old graduate
student, whose name was not released, threatened to jump from the
same garage in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Wiatt said, officers were successful in saving the
man. The student has been admitted to Scott and White Hospital in
Temple for psychiatric treatment, Wiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Berry had just been informed that he would be
dropped from the university because of failing grades. Suicide
messages were found in his truck, which was parked near the scene
of the jump, and in his dormitory room at Crocker Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One of Berry's friends, Cole Sauter of Corpus Christi, described
the student as ``just a good old Ag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kind of kept up the grades,'' Sauter tearfully
recalled Wednesday. ``That's what finally pushed him over the edge
_ that and a lot of other college problems ... He felt he let his
parents down. That he let everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sauter said Berry struck his friends as lighthearted. ``The
strangest part,'' he said, ``is that he was really a positive
person. He preferred to help others with their problems. He prided
himself in helping whoever he could whenever he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauter said Berry left him a suicide message attached to his
dorm door.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Birch Wade, a licensed psychologist who heads the university's
student counseling services, said that on average, one to two A&AMP;M
University students commit suicide each year. Most of those deaths
occur off campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really low for an institution this size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While no suicides were reported among the university's 43,400
students last year, 18 unsuccessful attempts were recorded. The
last suicide on campus, authorities said, was in 1983 when a young
man hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wade, whose office offers around-the-clock crisis intervention,
said the suicide rate for college students is 50 percent higher
than for their non-college peers.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest risk occurs among graduate students and
upperclassmen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not achieving well in school can be a factor in suicides,''
Wade said, ``but I wouldn't underline it as a factor. I wouldn't
say it's the most prominent. Students actually bring many family
problems to campus, where they get exacerbated. They have problems
relating to other students; can't conduct intimate relationships
very successfully ....
</P>
<P>
   ``All suicide attempts have different scenarios, histories. What
underlies them is a common sense of futility, a sense of
hopelessness and alienation. Some type of guilt, lack of support,
depression, low self-esteem ... Those are the more common themes.
No matter what the specific story, you usually find one or more of
those elements.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police director Wiatt said Berry's presence on the garage roof
was first detected by a security camera. A passerby also noticed
the student perched on the ledge and notified officers.
</P>
<P>
   The first campus officer, trained in crisis intervention
responded to the call in about two minutes, Wiatt said. Trained
psychologists also were summoned, but did not arrive in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking, but not very much,'' Wiatt said. ``He
responded to questions _ gave his name and where he was from.
Indicated it was his grades. Said he didn't want a counselor or
psychologist ... Then the young man looked at the officer and said,
`I'm sorry I have to do this. You're a good guy,' and then slipped
over the edge. &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt said Berry fell at least 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He was declared dead shortly after arrival at St. Joseph Medical
Center in Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care to say if you print this,'' added his friend
Sauter, ``is that William was a super guy.''

   LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. _ Jaylen Carr drooled, wailed and burped in

<P>
   So when the nurse entered the room, she carried a handheld
scanner to make sure that Jaylen had not been accidentally switched
with another child in the maternity ward. She scanned a data chip
on one of Jaylen's hospital identity bracelets, then did the same
to his mother, Jacquelyn Carr, who was in bed looking happy but
tired.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the device played the lullaby ``Hush Little Baby''
to indicate that Jaylen was in fact Jaylen. If the scanner had
found a mix-up, it would have sounded an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes you feel a little more at ease about letting your
baby go out of your room,'' Ms. Carr said. ``You feel a little more
secure that when he comes back, he is really yours. You want to be
able to say that you would recognize your child by sight, but you
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep infants from going home with the wrong parents, an
increasing number of hospitals are using technology that is more
commonly associated with department stores. Like a pair of jeans,
babies are scanned when their parents check out, and they are
protected from abduction by sensors they wear that can set off
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   But these electronic security devices, which have been on the
market for nearly five years, have drawbacks, including prices that
put them beyond some hospitals' reach. And the technology sometimes
fails or gives off false alarms that make nurses run from their
stations for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, located in this middle-class
Los Angeles suburb, has used scanners known as touch probes, from
Talon Medical, based in San Antonio, for nearly three years. There
have been no infant mix-ups in that time, said Jill Kennedy, the
hospital's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers, fathers and infants are fitted with scannable bracelets
just after the baby is wiped clean in the delivery room. They wear
the bands until they are discharged from the hospital; each band
contains a data chip that looks like a metal button and is
programmed with an identity number.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses scan these chips each time they move an infant to or from
its mother's room. The music that plays when the parent and child
are properly matched is intended to make the experience a little
more fun than notification by, say, a flashing green light.
</P>
<P>
   To operate the scanner, nurses touch it to the data chip on the
baby's bracelet, then to the parent's. The device determines if the
numbers embedded in the chips correspond. A similar system has just
been put on the market using bar codes. Nurses can scan the bar
codes, using a laser reader like those used at groceries.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, hospitals have visually checked the numbers on
hospital identification bracelets to keep the identities of
newborns and parents straight. But there have been several
well-publicized mix-ups using this system, including some that were
not discovered for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no way to document the number of babies
accidentally switched at the nation's hospitals because there is no
one agency that keeps those figures, and some switches may go
undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   In February at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, Calif., 15 miles
north of here, parents were sent home with the wrong baby. A nurse
discovered the error 90 minutes later. Two nurses were dismissed
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Such mistakes are worrisome but also potentially dangerous
because of the possibility that diseases like HIV and hepatitis
could be transferred to babies in breast milk. Mistakes also, not
surprisingly, damage a hospital's reputation and put it in jeopardy
of losing accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Ramsey, an obstetrician at Saddleback, said mismatches
occurred for several reasons. Among the most common, he said, is
that nurses misread or forget to check the identity bracelets worn
by a mother and child.
</P>
<P>
   The probe virtually eliminates the chance of garbling numbers,
Ramsey said. Forgetting to use it is still possible, but that is
less likely, he said, because the instrument records when it is
used.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors can download the information into a computer to
determine whether nurses are following the correct procedures. A
note about each time a child is scanned is included in each baby's
medical report.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said the likelihood of switching infants was higher in
hospitals that have nurseries where more than a dozen babies may be
kept together and moved several times a day for feeding. At
Saddleback, however, babies are generally kept in their mothers'
rooms, partly to minimize the risk of a mix-up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a nurse with three babies in a cart to hand out to
mothers and only five minutes until break,'' Ramsey said. ``The
nurse might not be too careful in a situation like that. You can
easily see how switches might happen, though that doesn't excuse
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals must also guard infants against people with malicious
intentions. Every year, a handful of newborns are abducted from
maternity wards. To prevent that, many hospitals have installed the
same kinds of security devices used to stop shoplifters. Babies are
fitted with sensors that set off an alarm if a child is brought
near electronic detectors installed by the door.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Webb, vice president of Talon Medical, was reluctant to
disclose much about the alarm system that his company installed at
Saddleback. He said he was concerned that such information might
help potential abductors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Webb would disclose that each baby was fitted with a sensor
contained in a sticker. The sticker is placed somewhere on the
infant, he said, although he would not say where (other than to say
that it was not attached to the identity bracelet) to avoid tipping
off would-be abductors.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm system relies on radio waves to operate. It goes off
only when radio waves sent out by the detectors bounce back from
the stickers on the babies.
</P>
<P>
   Other alarm manufacturers are more specific about where their
sensors are placed. For example, Prosec Protection Systems, in
Lakewood, N.J., places its sensors on the umbilical cord clamps
that most babies wear for the first few days of life.
</P>
<P>
   But nurses frequently must take babies beyond the invisible
electronic walls that protect them _ to get X-rays, for example. In
such cases, the nurses must punch in a code on the computer that
controls the alarm system to shut it off for that particular
sensor. If not, or if someone actually abducts a child, an alarm
will sound when the baby nears the door.
</P>
<P>
   At some hospitals, the alarm locks doors automatically and stops
elevators. Other options for alarms include flashing lights,
recorded messages that tell listeners to ``step back'' and security
cameras that are prompted to make a continuous recording, instead
of recording every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Saddleback's system features only an alarm, partly because the
cost of equipping the hospital's many exits with additional
security equipment would have been too high, Ramsey said. There
have yet to be any attempted kidnappings there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nationwide, abductions from maternity wards are rare,
considering that millions of children are born each year. John
Rabun, vice president of the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children, said that five children were stolen from the
nation's hospitals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are not high, thank goodness,'' Rabun said. ``But
when you look at this particular crime, it is one of the few crimes
that you should be able to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabun supports electronic security systems in maternity wards,
but only to a point. He called them ``a hundred-dollar cure for a
one-dollar problem.'' He recommends simple precautions like posting
a guard at the door, confronting suspicious visitors and requiring
that babies be moved only in bassinets.
</P>
<P>
   Webb essentially agreed, saying, ``If you take a look at the
number of babies stolen, you have a much greater chance of being
hit by lightning.'' He said accidental infant switching was
probably far more common and thus provided a better rationale for
countermeasures like scanners, which his company also produces.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity ward security systems sometimes go off by accident.
Jan Kidwell, director of women's services at White Memorial Medical
Center in Los Angeles, said nurses and parents there occasionally
forgot about the alarm and set it off by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time that thing goes off, we blast out the door,'' Ms.
Kidwell said. White Memorial's alarm was installed after a baby was
abducted from the hospital in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that only a fraction of the nation's 4,500
maternity wards have alarms or infant identity systems, though the
number is increasing. Rabun estimated that 700 hospitals had
electronic security.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons that hospital executives give for not
installing such systems is the cost. The alarm systems can cost
tens of thousands of dollars, while the scanning system at
Saddleback that uses data chips costs about $20 per baby; the newly
developed bar code system costs $5 to $7 per baby. There are also
complaints about false alarms and the belief that less
sophisticated deterrents are more effective.
</P>
<P>
   One such hospital is Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in Long
Beach, Calif., which has considered buying an electronic security
system. But so far, officials there have decided that training
nurses and parents to be diligent is the best remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that after spending that much money, you would want a
system that offers 100 percent protection,'' said Paula Gillette,
executive director of the women's hospital at the Long Beach
medical center. ``But it doesn't. The best way to prevent problems
like these is to keep the staff aware and drill to not give their
babies to people who don't have hospital badges.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am in the process of applying plywood paneling to the walls
of my large family room. There is a brick fireplace and chimney in
the center of one of the long walls and I won't be covering the
bricks with the wood panels. My problem is how to get a neat fit
where the plywood panels meet the brick wall of the fireplace. I
don't want to use any kind of wide molding to cover the seam or
joint, and don't think a wide bead of caulking would look right.
What can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest and neatest method is to scribe the edge of the
panels so they form a snug fit against the rough edges of the
brick. An ordinary pencil compass is used as shown here so that the
pencil moves along the face of the panel while the metal point is
dragged along to follow the contour of the brick. Before doing this
tack the panel temporarily in place so it is plumb and cannot move
while you are scribing. After scribing use a jig saw or scroll saw
with a narrow blade to trim the edge of the panel along the profile
line drawn on the plywood. This will insure a snug fit when the
panel is installed next to, and butting against, the brick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After an unexpected cold spell the water pipe leading to my
laundry room froze. After about 36 hours the pipe thawed with no
damage, but I've been told that it is best to thaw the pipe out
promptly _ especially since we were unable to use the washing
machine for two days. If this happens again and I don't want to
wait for the pipe to thaw by itself what can I do to safely thaw
the pipe in a hurry, and how can I prevent this happening next
winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you can get at the pipe that supplies water to this spigot
you can thaw it safely by applying mild heat from a heat lamp,
portable hair dryer, or a heat ``gun'' set on low heat. First make
sure the faucet is open, then start applying the heat right next to
the faucet and work away from it gradually. Keep working back to
the faucet so that as the ice melts the water will run out. To
prevent this happening in the future wrap the pipe with electric
heating tape if you can get at it. Otherwise you will have to
install a shut-off valve on that water line somewhere inside the
heated part of the house or basement so you can shut off the water
supply to that faucet when a freeze is expected (remember to open
faucet after you shut off water supply to drain any water in the
pipe).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house has light brown aluminum siding on the outside and
after 25 years this looks dull and faded looking. I've considered
painting, or completely replacing the siding with new plastic
siding which would be a lot more expensive. Is painting practical?
</P>
<P>
   A: Painting is practical over old aluminum siding. First wash
off all dirt and powdery chalkiness, then paint with two coats of a
good quality latex house paint _ preferably one that says on the
label it is recommended for use on aluminum siding. Most require no
separate primer, but check the label for specific recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a flagstone patio that was laid on top of a poured
concrete slab. Some of the flagstones have come loose and I've been
told that the flagstones can be cemented back with a special
masonry adhesive without need for chiseling out the old concrete.
Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes _ as long as the concrete under the flagstones is still
sound. You can use one of the mastic adhesives that have been
around for some time, but probably the strongest adhesive you can
use is a two-part epoxy cement. Various brands are sold in most
home centers, as well as in hardware stores, marine supply stores
and from masonry supply dealers.

the brick onto the wood panel so that it can be trimmed for a snug
fit to the side of the brick fireplace and chimney.

TRACKING THE MAJORS, OR A LEAGUE OF YOUR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: in parenthetical equations, replace the word `plus' with
the typographical symbol) 
 (bl)  
 By JIM LUTTRELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each winter I feel the warmth of Florida and Arizona radiating
from every newsstand as dozens of annual baseball preview issues
trumpet the arrival of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   But it has become evident that the canned heat is fueled by
stale news and by analyses that are often amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a nationally published annual baseball magazine
showed David Wells in pinstripes on its cover with a headline that
said he would be leading the Yankees in search of a second
consecutive World Series title. Retailers will be displaying this
magazine until July, when Wells might very well be with yet another
team. And I wouldn't be surprised if the magazine's Toronto edition
featured Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Like any fantasy-baseball team owner or rotisserie league player
or anyone who plays any of the myriad games that depend on the
stats of major leaguers, I'm looking for the latest news and
insider information that can tell me which players will be primed
for a breakout season and which phenom (pronounced FEE-nom) I can
build my team with.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan of the game _ from the smell of newly cut grass to the
physics of what makes a four-seam fastball rise (yeah, yeah, I know
scientists say it can't rise) _ I'm looking for more than the
fluffy feature articles and the hometown boosterism that are aimed
to excite fans in every city where a magazine appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web has supplied a vast assortment of baseball
information, but seam-heads should be wary. You can't just holler,
yahoo and ride your search engine directly to a field of dreams.
There are thousands of baseball sites on the Web, including those
that just want to sell you baseball cards and memorabilia, sites
that try to entice you into playing fantasy games for cash prizes
and others that promise to process your rotisserie league stats for
fees ranging from $20 to $50 or more per team. (There are perfectly
reputable companies who will manage your league stats free.)
</P>
<P>
   And because starting a Web site is relatively cheap and the
booming popularity of fantasy sports leagues has created a cottage
industry, there is often the possibility that the ``expert'' who is
telling you about the 35-year-old right-hander who has just learned
to throw a change-up might know less than you know.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious sites tend to follow in the tradition of Bill
James, who popularized baseball research and analysis in his annual
Baseball Abstract, and by the Society for American Baseball
Research, a group of more than 6,700 members dedicated to fostering
the study of baseball and disseminating baseball research. (The
word sabermetrics, meaning baseball research, is derived from the
society's acronym, SABR.) Its site (www.sabr.org) contains some of
statistical research, although much of its work is not available to
the public. The site is a good place to visit if you want to have
your own baseball research or ideas published.
</P>
<P>
   Sabermetrics, James wrote in his Baseball Abstract, is about the
search for objective answers about baseball, such as, ``Which
player on the Red Sox contributed most to the team's offense?'' or,
``How many home runs will Ken Griffey hit next year?''
</P>
<P>
   So you must decide whether you want simply the answers to
questions like these or if you want to know exactly how those
answers were derived. If you choose the second path, pocket
protectors are optional.
</P>
<P>
   JIM FURTADO'S BASEBALL STUFF
</P>
<P>
   www.baseballstuff.com
</P>
<P>
   The site's master invites you to pour a cup of coffee and look
around. Decaf is fine, but sip it slowly because there's a lot to
see.
</P>
<P>
   The meatiest page is the Baseball Think Factory. While Furtado
promises information for both fantasy-game players and
sabermetricians, most of the articles were heavy on the math. Not
all of them required advanced degrees, but several left me
remembering why I had struggled through calculus.
</P>
<P>
   The page is dominated by text and virtually devoid of graphics.
One enjoyable feature uses a formula for something called Bases per
Plate Appearance (Total bases plus walks plus hit by pitch plus
stolen bases - caught stealing - grounded into double play) divided
by (at-bats plus walks plus hit by pitch plus sacrifice flies) to
compare how Mark McGwire's 70-home-run season stacks up against the
best of all time. McGwire's BPA of .799 was the best ever in the
National League but third overall, behind a couple of Ruthian
seasons: .863 in 1921 and .862 in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature, Introducing XR, discusses a process to predict
runs scored using an extrapolated runs formula. Like most of the
complex features, this one finds its origins in previous
statistical work, and some background information is available. But
for the newcomer, learning that Estimated Runs Produced equals (2 x
(TB plus BB plus HP) plus H plus SB - (.605 x (AB plus CS plus GIDP
- H))) x .16 can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Furtado plays Strat-O-Matic Baseball, originally a board game
using dice and individual player cards and now available as a
computer game. He gives his opinions of the best hitters' cards for
the 1998 version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The site's Newsstand page supplied quick links to many baseball
publications, including magazines, multimedia and newspapers in
each major league city.
</P>
<P>
   I had high expectations for the Ask the Baseball Scholars Forum
page, but while few of the questions were trivial, too few were
actually answered and only a couple stimulated any debate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stathead Consulting's Baseball Engineering Library
</P>
<P>
   www.stathead.com
</P>
<P>
   What is it with Red Sox fans? Jim Furtado of Baseball Stuff is
an acknowledged Red Sox fan, and Keith Woolner, who is the Chief
Stathead of Stathead.com, manages the team's mailing list, among
other duties. Tom Fontaine and Nate Calvin, two other senior
statheads, also root for the Fenway crowd. I suppose that given
another Red Sox statistic _ the team hasn't won a World Series
championship since 1918 _ their fans must look elsewhere to enjoy
the game.
</P>
<P>
   When not breaking into cold sweats at the thought of Bill
Buckner, the statheads focus on performance forecasting and
economics as they relate to actual baseball decisions. Their
seemingly most important statistic is Value Over Replacement Player
(VORP). That is not exactly one of the triple crown categories, but
the statheads will have you believe it is a key economic factor to
major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   What does VORP mean? Roughly, it is the expected level of
performance a team can obtain if it replaces a starting player at
minimal dollar cost. It puts great weight on playing time and
favors a consistently average player over a short-term flash.
</P>
<P>
   Putting faith in VORP means believing Albert Belle (100.2 VORP)
was more valuable than Mark McGwire (94.7) in 1998, and that Tom
Glavine (76.0), the National League Cy Young Award winner, is
baseball's fifth-ranking pitcher, behind Greg Maddux, Kevin Brown,
Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   There are other lists, including one that shows how each ball
park influences players' hitting or pitching. For example, you can
see how playing in a shooting gallery like Coors Field benefits
Colorado's Larry Walker, while the cavernous Astrodome slows down
Houston's Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Engineering Library has a thorough index that makes
it easy to find desired topics. Among the articles on offense,
there are a couple that claim there is no such thing as a clutch
hitter. One study, about 10 years ago, showed that hitters with
reputations as clutch performers actually had only one more hit a
year in late-inning situations or with runners in scoring position
than the average player.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the articles venture into sabermetrics, but an easily
accessible glossary helps the lay person negotiate the mathematical
maze.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointment: There were only two articles listed under Just
for Fun, which were supposed to poke fun at analysts' obsession
with numbers, and one of them could not be found. But luckily, the
archives contained columnist Mike Royko's prediction that no team
with three or more former Cubs players could win a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs. Where would Red Sox fans be without them?

   Any sports tavern worth its lager has a Baseball Encyclopedia
behind the bar to settle disputes. And while the bars may never
replace that eight-pound tome with a laptop, the Baseball Database
could probably settle a few arguments and maybe start a few more.
</P>
<P>
   The database contains career and season-by-season statistics for
nearly 15,000 players, dating back to 1876. There is information on
any team from any season and extensive data on every ball park that
a big-league team has ever called home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features allows a user to instantly
determine how many times a player finished in the top five in an
offensive or pitching category. It's a great tool when comparing
Greg Maddux to Sandy Koufax or Joe DiMaggio to Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Mays finished in the top five in batting average
seven times, and DiMaggio only four. And Mays was in the top five
in runs 11 times, DiMaggio only six. There were no stats covering
grace or fewest times diving for a fly ball.
</P>
<P>

which ball parks have the deepest center fields (Coors Field at 415
feet is the deepest, Fenway Park at 390 the shallowest); or which
American League teams had the best earned run average in say, 1982?
(Detroit led the league with a 3.80 ERA but finished fourth, 12
games behind Milwaukee, which slugged 216 homers.)

   Using this function for the 1990 season, I was left wondering
how the statistically dominant Mets lost to the Pirates. I guess
there's no statistic for heart.

   However, I was disappointed, to not find any post-season
statistics beyond the number of championships for each team.

   Stats Fantasy Advantage

</P>
<P>
   Want to know how Mike Piazza hit last season with two strikes?
Stats Fantasy Advantage has the answer (.248). Why was the Yankees'
Orlando Hernandez so tough? Leadoff batters hit .250 against El
Duque, but with runners in scoring position, that average dropped
to .218, and with two out and runners in scoring position, it fell
to .148.
</P>
<P>
   The Stats Fantasy Advantage is aimed at fantasy players, but it
is really a statistical smorgasbord with a sabermetric flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The site runs three columns that are updated at different times
during the week. Two of the three columns during the week of March
22 centered on the injury to the Cubs' second-year pitcher Kerry
Wood. One quoted an article that Bill James wrote for the Stats
e-mail network shortly after Wood's 20-strikeout performance last
season. In it, James discussed the effect that stress could have on
an immature arm, and he predicted that Wood would not win 100
games. The second article used the Wood injury to launch a
discussion of the importance of pitch counts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Web site, subscribers will also receive At The Park
Scoreboards, which will cover each regular-season game, pitch by
pitch, and will include situational statistics, like
batter-vs.-pitcher matchups. A less-detailed version, without the
situational stats, is available to AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   The Player Portfolio feature allows subscribers to track
individual players over the course of the season. However, an
attempt to register a team required technical help. While the
feature is certainly helpful to follow fantasy players in spring
training, once the season starts, it will duplicate what most
online statistical services supply.
</P>
<P>
   If you depend on this site for a real fantasy advantage, though,
be careful. Under recent injuries listed for March 22, we were told
there were no injuries in the previous two weeks. But Boston's
Nomar Garciaparra, Atlanta's Kerry Ligtenberg and Cincinnati's Pete
Harnisch as well as Wood had all been hurt in the previous few
days. If they were omitted because they had not yet been placed on
the official disabled list, this should have been made clearer.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some inconsistencies. For example, under
Projections, which makes predictions for the 1999 season, the
Angels' Justin Baughman was expected to get 164 at-bats. But under
News and Notes, we read that Baughman might face a second surgery
for a broken left leg and could miss the season.
</P>
<P>
   What you end up with is a contradiction: a great site for the
casual fan, but one that has deficiencies that even the casual fan
would notice.
</P>
<P>

WOMAN'S BONES ARE NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 13,000 YEARS OLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MELINDA BURNS   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ A prehistoric woman whose bones were dug
up on Santa Rosa Island in 1959 has turned out to be one of the
oldest-known humans in western North America, according to a new
report from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Based on new advances in bone chemistry and radiocarbon dating
technology, the woman's bones have been determined to be 13,000
years old, said anthropology curator John Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The new date makes the Arlington Springs Woman, as she is
called, a contemporary of the Stone Age people who hunted Columbian
mammoths on the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   It also places her at the end of the Ice Age and within striking
distance of the pygmy mammoths _ elephant-like animals the size of
cows that roamed the Channel Islands 15,000 years ago. The islands
in the Channel Islands National Park off the Santa Barbara coast
are the only islands in the world where the remains of pygmy
mammoths have been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arlington Springs site is a tantalizing glimpse of the
people who were here,'' Johnson said. ``Were those people witnesses
to the last of the pygmy mammoths?''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington Springs Woman originally was identified as a man
when two of her thigh bones were discovered four decades ago,
sticking out of a canyon wall on the northern side of Santa Rosa
Island. Subsequent dating fixed the age of the remains at 11,600
years, and it is this age that now has been pushed back by more
modern dating methods, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington Springs Woman lived on Santa Rosae, the giant land
mass that once lay offshore of what is now Santa Barbara. Santa
Rosae was largely submerged during the melt-off at the end of the
Ice Age. Today, only its mountaintops are visible: They form the
islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there may be many more skeletons like the Arlington
Springs Woman on the islands, but they are under water.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that the woman was older than previously thought
is important, Johnson said, because scientists still are debating
how the first humans entered North America. For some time, it had
been hypothesized that they came through a corridor left by
retreating ice sheets in Canada. More recently, scientists have
hypothesized that people also came down the coast in ice-free
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The find on Santa Rosa Island indicates there were people on
the coast when the sea level was 300 feet lower,'' Johnson said.

 &HT;    COST OF FIRST LADY TRAVELS A 'MYSTERY'
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who returns
Thursday from North Africa, has set travel records in her role as
roving U.S. emissary.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco brings to 58 the number
of countries that Mrs. Clinton has visited on 19 solo trips abroad
since her husband took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is how much the journeys have cost, and
exactly how expenses are budgeted for the most widely traveled
first lady in history.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day trip with daughter Chelsea included visits to
villages, a ceremonial feast hosted by King Hassan of Morocco, and
a camel ride through the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady delivered ``four or five significant speeches,''
said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, in a telephone
interview from Morocco. ``It's a very important part of the world
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, like the first lady's past travels, was designated by
President Clinton as an official diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come under the expense of the State Department,'' Berry
said Wednesday in explaining that there were no cost estimates for
the tour. She referred a reporter to State Department.
</P>
<P>
   However, the State Department press office declined to provide
budget information. ``Questions in reference to the first lady
should be referred to the White House,'' said a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a first lady's travel has long been vague. ``It was
a mystery to me,'' said Sheila Tate, who served as press secretary
to first lady Nancy Reagan. ``There were allusions made to a
budget. I never saw one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tate said that Mrs. Reagan's office felt pressure to
limit travel, in part because of the expense. An overseas trip for
two private citizens might cost a few thousand dollars, she said,
but ``if the first lady goes, it must cost hundred of thousands of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For her visit to North Africa, Mrs. Clinton brought about 20
administration officials, including her three spokeswomen. About a
dozen journalists, whose companies pay their expenses, joined the
group aboard an Air Force Boeing 707 specially outfitted for VIPs.
</P>
<P>
   Extra expenses for such a trip also include sending staff
members in advance to make arrangements, diverting local embassy
resources, arranging for complex ground transportation needs and
providing round-the-clock security with three shifts of Secret
Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes out of various budgets,'' including the Defense
Department, the Treasury Department and State, Tate said. ``So
there's no way to figure out how much a trip costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, solo first lady trips had been relatively rare.
In President Reagan's two terms in the White House in the 1980s,
Mrs. Reagan took only three solo trips to three countries. She took
three other brief side trips as she traveled abroad with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   During President Bush's single term, Barbara Bush traveled alone
outside the United States only twice, to Costa Rica and to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mrs. Clinton, the most widely traveled first lady was
Eleanor Roosevelt, who took Navy warships to Europe and to the
Pacific front to help boost the morale of U.S. troops during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known exactly how many countries Mrs. Roosevelt
visited as first lady, said Nancy Snedeker, a researcher for the
Franklin D. Roosevelt presidential library. However, the library
estimates that Mrs. Roosevelt, who later became ambassador to the
United Nations and traveled extensively, visited 53 nations in her
lifetime.

   Members of the military that search for downed pilots are called
``pararescuers,'' it's reported. Not, we bet, by them.

   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says things
balance out. As some teams head north soon, their odds of winning a
pennant will head south.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight and Final Four are finally down
to the Obnoxious One _ the office pool winner.
</P>
<P>
   That American pilot rescued after ejecting from his plane near
Belgrade was on the ground seven-plus hours, it's reported. If he'd
had a Yugo as a get-away car, he could have traveled several miles
in that time.
</P>
<P>
   What does NATO stand for these days? Now Against Tito's Oddment?

   ``Americans have learned the hard way,'' says Mr. Clinton,
``that our home is not that far from Europe.'' Especially Americans
with vacation homes in Morocco, just across the Strait of Gibraltar
from Spain.

   For a time this week, 4,000 refugees an hour arrived at the
Kosovo-Albanian border. It's looking as if Slobodan Milosevic isn't
going to win a Nobel Peace Prize.

   It looks as if BP Amoco may buy Atlantic Richfield. To keep up

   Paraguay's president, Raul Cubas, has resigned. And wouldn't it

</P>

   There are early signs in Asia of economic recovery. But so far
no one is suggesting the name be changed to Singarich.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows Americans support NATO's air strikes by a 2-1
margin. Someone must have asked the three Americans who understand
what's going on there.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls showed 57 percent of Americans couldn't name Kosovo
as the Serbian province under fire. Bet more than that can name the
Oscar winner for best special effects in a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   People who have read history know that in our Civil War air
strikes meant little more than ballast thrown down at soldiers from
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   After days of work on NATO air strikes, Mr. Clinton broke away
the other day to play golf. Or, as the game is known in his
foursome, ground strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin says he'll do all he can ``to put an end to
military actions in Yugoslavia.'' If he can get his nurse call
button to work.
</P>
<P>
   An independent military analyst in Washington says the Serb
military isn't very good and is ``not capable of offensive
operations.'' Wrong. Ethnic cleansing is as offensive as you can
get.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign has entered what's called its second
phase. Couldn't we get right on to phase three so Serbia can't say
NATO is two-phased?

<P>
   As part of a clampdown on news organizations last week, Yugoslav
police raided the offices of Radio B92, the single independent
radio station in Belgrade, the capital city, and pulled the plug on
its transmitter. Unfortunately for police, they had no way to pull
the plug on the Internet, where the radio station continues to put
out its reports.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, police told the station that its broadcasts were
violating transmission laws and arrested the station's editor in
chief, Veran Matic. He was released eight hours later. According to
Ari Schwartz, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington, Matic then began uploading reports onto
the Internet, where they can be accessed on a Web site,
www.opennet.org. (The station also maintains a Web site at
www.helpb92.-xs4all.nl.) The BBC downloaded the content and
broadcast it back into the Balkans by radio.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Democracy and Technology, B92
broadcasts music and news that is not officially sanctioned. In
recent years, the station has been shut down several times by
Yugoslav police.
</P>
<P>
   Until its broadcasts were banned, most listeners in the United
States faced a language barrier _ except for a five-minute English
program every morning, B92 broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian. But since
the ban, the Opennet Web site carries an English translation of its
news content, while the Helpb92 site contains some material in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the experience of B92 shows that governments
cannot easily stop the flow of information in the Internet age.
``In today's day and age, it is much more difficult to censor,'' he
said. ``Governments have to learn new ways of openness.''

   Color-Coordinated Software to Go With Your iMac
</P>
<P>
   With hardware vendors scrambling to create stylish peripherals
to complement Apple Computer's trendy translucent iMac, it was
probably only a matter of time before software manufacturers
followed suit. Grolier Interactive Inc. has just created a special
edition of its popular multimedia encyclopedia CD-ROM that is
specifically tailored for iMac users.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia Deluxe 2-CD iMac
Edition not only offers users a program interface that nicely
matches the original iMac's Bondi Blue case color, but also has
been enhanced to take advantage of the machine's advanced video and
stereo capabilities. The two-disk set contains 36,000 articles,
15,000 pictures and graphics, and 1,200 maps, plus video and
digitally remastered sound clips. An additional 22,000 articles are
available through online access to two more encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   The program will work on iMacs or Power Macs running Mac OS 8
(or higher), with at least a 603/200 MHz processor. The program
sells for $59.95, and the company is offering a $20 mail-in rebate
until Aug. 31. And don't worry if you have one of the
second-generation machines. The program interface offers other
color schemes that won't clash with your lime or strawberry iMac.

   Spanning the Continents
</P>
<P>
   Paving the way for worldwide wireless phone use (and possibly
some whopping roaming charges), Motorola is introducing a new
mobile telephone that can be used in the United States, Europe, the
Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The phone will be able to receive radio signals from the
predominant digital frequencies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East
(900 and 1,800 megahertz) and in the United States (1,900
megahertz). The phone will be available in the second quarter of
this year. The price has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, mobile phone users have not been able to use the same
phone across continents, due to differing frequency standards. Yet
Motorola's development is still just the beginning; it still does
not receive the 800 megahertz frequency, which is a predominantly
analog (as opposed to digital) frequency used by 85 percent of
mobile phone users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds confusing, that's because it is confusing, points
out Herschel Schosteck, a wireless market analyst from Wheaton, Md.
However, Schosteck said that the significance of the Motorola
announcement is that it paves the way for telephones to work across
numerous standards, technologies and radio frequencies _ and hence
to make the situation far less confusing to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he said, wireless phones will work in many places
around the globe. ``For the group of people who are international
travelers, this is going to be very useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Automotive CD Player That Uses Your Car Radio
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the newest in-car CD player from Emerson is that
it requires no installation. The downside is that there is a slim
chance the CD player will play music in nearby cars, potentially
leading to some ugly music-related road rage.
</P>
<P>
   The Emerson Research Personal CD Player attaches to speakers not
with wires but by radio waves. It sends a signal to the car
antenna, which in turns directs the signal to an unused frequency
on the car's radio dial; the signal then is played through the
car's speakers as if it were coming from a radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that it is possible the signal could be picked
up by neighboring cars. It is unlikely, but possible, that use of
the device could lead to some confrontations by the side of the
road between fans of classical music, rap and country and western.

   Wake-Up Calls at Home, Complete With Advertising
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, deep sleepers can get the same wake-up
service they enjoy at hotels for free at home. But they'll have to
put up with the dulcet tones of early morning marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A new web site, www.mrwakeup.com, allows people to program in
their phone numbers so they can be called back at a specified date
and time. A computer then places the call, and the recipient is
greeted with a synthesized computer voice intoning a reminder that
it is time to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wake-up calls, the service can be programmed to
provide short news blurbs, weather updates, horoscopes and 125-word
reminders the recipient types in and that are read by a
text-to-voice synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free, with a catch. Each call begins with a
message from the call's sponsor; among the sponsors during the
two-month old consumer test are Amazon.com and Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Yeh, president of iPing Inc., the New York company
behind the site, said he is planning to offer different voice types
for the call. ``Soon you'll have a variety of voices, including
female, one like a comedian, and someone who sounds crazy, like
nuts,'' Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a Single Computer Into an At-Home Network
</P>
<P>
   For homes where family members or roommates constantly fight
over use of the computer, a California company offers an answer
short of group therapy: a buddy system that shares hard drives.
Specifically, the technology, which goes for $149 from Vega Systems
in Emeryville, Calif., allows people to use a single computer while
working on different monitors, using separate keyboards and mice.
</P>
<P>
   The system works through a VGA card inserted into a slot inside
the computer. The card is a attached to a cable that runs to a
connector box into which the second mouse, keyboard and monitor can
be hooked.
</P>
<P>
   The technology uses a feature in Windows '98 and '95 that allows
users to work concurrently on two separate applications, such as
word processing and a spreadsheet, but in different windows. The
``buddy system'' essentially moves one of those windows to the
second monitor.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a sure cure for the blues?
</P>
<P>
   Just head for the New Victory Theater in the new Times Square
and latch on to a ticket for ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that title bears some parsing, because this rich,
evocative, rousing show, with some 50 musical numbers ranging from
African chants and spirituals to Delta and Chicago blues, with
plenty of stops along the dusty roads, river banks, broken country
hearts and juke joints in between, is more than a musical feast.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its cornucopia of splendidly interpreted song, ``It
Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' through April 11, is a potent blend
of visual eloquence and historical sweep that engages the eye and
touches the heart while its songs soothe the ear, occasionally work
mischief on the funny bone and always raise the spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As the splendid cast assembled by the much-praised Crossroads
Theater Company of New Brunswick, N.J., applies its individual and
collective vocal, musical and actorly talents to songs like ``I've
Been Living With the Blues,'' ``Blues Man,'' ``My Man Rocks Me''
and ``St. Louis Blues,'' photographs projected onto screens behind
the performers brim with history.
</P>
<P>
   Here are sketches of slave auctions and pictures of thirsty
women working the fields with their little children nearby, a black
man dangling from a lyncher's noose, rural poverty, a riverside
baptism, country churches, the great blues man Robert Johnson, and
changing fashions in clothes and entertainment, as well as the
economic, social and cultural upheaval surrounding the great black
migration from the South to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in association with the San Diego Repertory Theater
and the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, ``It Ain't Nothin' but the
Blues'' is based on an idea by Ron Taylor, who wrote it with Randal
Myler, its director, and Lita Gaithers, Charles Bevel and Dan
Wheetman.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, Bevel and Wheetman, with Gretha Boston, Carter Calvert,
Eloise Laws and Gregory Porter, constitute the powerhouse lineup of
singers who step up, step out and put over one number after
another. Depending on the song, they can be heartbreakers,
heartbroken, sexpots or absolute rapscallions. And after
intermission, when they trade their simple attire, rustic airs and
simple instruments for shapely gowns and stylish suits, each seems
good-naturedly determined to outdo another, as they make their way
with the backing of an enhanced band through pieces like ``I'm Your
Hoochie-Coochie Man,'' the sly, slinky, humorous ``Crawlin' King
Snake,'' ``Walkin' After Midnight,'' the bitter ``Strange Fruit''
and ``Let the Good Times Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time the band is making the floor vibrate, and the cast
and audience are raising the roof.

<P>
   It's a politician's nightmare: a request from a newspaper
reporter to read all the e-mail the public official has received in
the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, Wash., that request from a Spokesman-Review reporter
several months ago yielded e-mail messages from two Spokane County
commissioners discussing public business like employee pay raises,
the number of workers to hire and public leases. Since there are
only three commissioners, two constitute a quorum, so such
communications come close to violating laws on open public
meetings, according to experts on ``sunshine laws,'' which require
officials to conduct public business in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem that the Legislature has never recognized,''
said Chip Holcomb, a senior counsel at the state attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is supplanting to a large extent face-to-face
communications among all sorts of people _ co-workers, relatives,
high-school classmates. Yet e-mail communications about public
business raise new questions: if officials discuss public issues by
e-mail or even, in some cases, make decisions that way, have they
deprived citizens of the right to watch the making of policy? How
do those e-mail exchanges differ from phone calls or voice-mail
messages or, for that matter, letters carried through rain and
sleet and snow? And will the unseen back-scratching of politics be
different if it takes place via e-mail, instead of, for example,
over the phone? Finally, are e-mail messages among public officials
public documents that need to be preserved, or can they be deleted?
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages can bump into the public's ``right to know'' in
two ways. While state open-meetings laws vary and allow exceptions,
like closed meetings to discuss personnel issues, members of the
public are supposed to be notified about governmental meetings and
invited to attend. The federal government also has a sunshine law.
If a meeting takes place via e-mail, of course, that can be seen as
circumventing a sunshine law.
</P>
<P>
   The public also has a right to see public documents, and e-mail
between public officials is increasingly being put in that
category. E-mail was officially included as a public record under
federal rules in 1996, and local jurisdictions are beginning to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spokane commission had to hand over its e-mail, one
thing changed for certain, said a county commissioner, John
Roskelley. ``I found it changed the way we do business here,'' he
said. ``We eliminate all e-mails, delete them instantly from our
mailbox, which in one respect cleans up our hard drive, but on the
other side of the coin, we do not have a history of what goes on. I
just chose to eliminate them rather than have someone else go
through my e-mails.'' The county's server keeps e-mail messages for
just a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Roskelley's reaction is perhaps understandable, the
fast-changing body of case law on electronic records seems to
indicate that deleting e-mail messages concerning public policy is
a questionable practice and may not even work, as deleted messages
may be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ingredients in the law, when it comes to the
public's rights, involves the ability to observe the performance of
public officials,'' said Robert J. Freeman, executive director of
the New York State Committee on Open government. ``The point is, we
can't simply obliterate the record because we're finished reading
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, other people might be interested in the making of
public policy via e-mail or records of such activity. In April
1996, a city councilwoman in Phoenix sent an urgent e-mail message
to all the other council members, advocating the sale of the
Phoenix Art Museum to private owners. The discussion of the
proposal occurred via computer, according to e-mail messages
obtained by The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also quoted e-mail messages between council
members calculating how many votes they needed to pass the
financing for neighborhood improvement projects and crime fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it loses 5-4, but I think that it makes some sense
to force a vote,'' one councilman wrote, according to accounts in
the newspaper; another replied, ``Who is the fourth, and who can we
work on to become the 5th?'' At the time, the two councilmen
involved in the discussion made up two-thirds of the Housing and
Neighborhoods subcommittee. (A pending bill in the Arizona Senate
would impose a $500 penalty on anyone using e-mail to get around
the open meetings law.)
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and
Technology, based in Washington, said, ``In a lot of cases, it is
the public that gets injured when meeting laws have been worked
around or if people are trying to cover things up.''
</P>
<P>
   When a new technology comes along, politicians have often been
quick to use it to their advantage, prompting watchdogs to try to
determine how to keep the officials from exploiting it. For each
innovation _ telephones, voice mail, conference calls, faxes, chat
rooms, instant messaging and video conferencing, as well as e-mail
_ there have been concerns that the technology could be used to
conduct the public's business outside of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine laws stem from the first open meetings law, which was
passed in Pennsylvania in the 1880s, said Tim Delaney, the chief
deputy attorney general of Arizona. In the aftermath of the
Watergate break-in in the 1970s, ``all the public attention was
focused on trying to get government to behave,'' he said. Both
meetings and records became more accessible. During the Iran-contra
scandal in the 1980s, e-mail recovered between Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North and Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security
adviser, yielded information important to the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to most sunshine laws, a majority of a panel is not
allowed to meet to discuss policy unless the public is notified. In
Scottsdale, Ariz., where the school board has been found by the
attorney general to have committed more than 40 violations of open
meetings laws, one board member has complained to the state
attorney general's office about an e-mail message the board
president wrote that summarized the board's closed-session
discussions about the superintendent's midyear review, according to
The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   That board member, Kristy Ryan, has also criticized the
president's request for comment by phone or e-mail on a draft of
the job review for the superintendent, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney, of the attorney general's office, said the Scottsdale
board's ethics monitor had been asked to review the e-mail issue to
see if the open meetings law had been violated. ``We're not quite
sure if there was a violation,'' said Delaney, who is chairman of
the state's Open Meeting Law Enforcement Team. (It is called Omlet
_ ``we break a few eggs,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of that panel, Delaney trains public officials about
the use of e-mail. ``People say it's like a conference call, and I
say that's also no good, and the same with faxes,'' he said. ``I
don't care if you're doing it by pony express, if all of you are
reaching consensus where the public can't see it, it's wrong.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not only e-mail that raises open-meetings questions. In
1995, for example, a school board president in Jefferson County,
Colo., left a voice-mail message for other school board members
about his planned testimony against a state school-governance bill.
Two other board members accused him of violating the state
open-meetings law. They were supported by Troy Eid, executive
director of the Institute for Information, Law and Policy at the
Center for the New West, who wrote an op-ed article in 1995 in The
Rocky Mountain News that said: ``The Jeffco controversy shows how
information technologies can be abused to short-circuit the
public's ability to monitor and influence government
decision-making. The solution is not to abandon these technologies,
but to ensure that the law keeps pace with the people who depend on
them.'' But no formal complaint was ever filed.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1995, the chairman of the board of regents of the Nevada
state university system sent a fax to all but one of the other
regents, seeking their approval to issue a press release
criticizing the regent left out, who had questioned the hiring of a
new president for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The state
attorney general's office filed a successful lawsuit that said such
communication violated the law on open public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Once an official's e-mail is available to the public,
voluntarily or through the filing of a Freedom of Information Act
request, it can present an accurate portrayal of what a politician
was thinking at a certain time _ more accurate, in fact, than most
letters on paper, said Patrick J. Carome, a lawyer in Washington
who specializes in open-government and Internet law.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say things with less care and formality and thought in
e-mail than in a formal document, and therefore what we're finding
is we're getting something akin to the real thought process of
people, as freely stated as in a phone conversation,'' said Carome,
who worked for the House Select Committee during deliberations over
access to e-mail in the Iran-contra affair. ``As a result of the
new technology, we have much more after-the-fact hard evidence of
what was said or done.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is inevitable that some legislative and
administrative deals will be cut outside public view, whether
behind closed doors, on the phone or behind the lid of a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can predict sometime this year two county commissioners will
have a private conversation to which there will never be a witness,
and they will make a decision,'' said Gary Lowe, executive director
of the Washington State Association of Counties. ``It's human
nature. There will never be an end to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, that is not a terrible thing, he said.
Referring to three-member commissions, he said, ``I would hate to
see the day come when these three have to read the newspaper to
even know what the other two are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   While e-mail has been determined to be a public record on the
federal level, the issue is a perennial question on the local
level. Further, as new public officials take office and more people
turn to e-mail and discover its convenience and speed, practices
change and public servants need up-to-date training.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, which has one of the strongest sunshine laws,
written into the state constitution, Mike Berry of The Orlando
Sentinel is able to get all the e-mail messages from the school
board he covers. In Clearwater, Fla., the city manager, Mike
Roberto, prints out all his e-mail for the press to read because
reporters have asked for that. Statewide, one council member can
send letters or e-mail to another council member as long as there
is no response and the message is saved as a public record.
</P>
<P>
   In Longview, Wash., all the e-mail between City Council members
is put in a public folder for anyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, the City Council is fighting a request from The
Tab, a local weekly, to see all the council's e-mail from Jan. 3 to
Jan. 16 as part of the paper's research into the city's
redevelopment of its seaport. While some council members have
complied, the council president, James Kelly, said he would fight
any decision on the part of the state attorney general's office to
make him turn over the files.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would be committing a major violation of the
confidence that's placed in me if I were to make that available to
the press,'' he said. ``Ninety-five percent of it is something that
I'm sure whoever sent it would not have a problem with me
disclosing that to the public by way of the press, but 5 percent of
it is of a personal nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he did not want to ask people if he could turn their
correspondence over to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while people might just stop writing to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to notices from Carolyn Kelly MacWilliam, the
supervisor of public records in Massachusetts, ``e-mail created or
received by an employee of a government unit is a public record.''
Starting with the presumption that each missive is public, the
content is judged by her or by the court system as to whether it

many people had argued _ unsuccessfully _ that e-mail should be

MELISSA AND HER COUSINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Calif.)   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melissa is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus,
one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide
since its discovery less than a week ago. It has already cost
millions of dollars in lost productivity, experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   And what a bargain it has been, because Melissa is relatively
sweet, as viruses go. The next time around _ and there will be a
next time _ a Melissa-type virus could be much more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa has focused the computing world's attention on the
rapidly growing threat of computer viruses in the Internet era and
underscored the need of all PC users to take virus protection
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, as the new viral vixen was named by its creator _ as
yet unknown _ combines elements of both a computer virus (spreading
from file to file) and a worm program (spreading from computer to
computer over a network). It is only one of several recent viruses
designed to prey on an otherwise useful feature of Microsoft Word
that enables macro programs _ automated scripts that trigger one or
more actions in the host computer _ to be started from within a
file.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa is mainly a nuisance. It will not erase your files,
demagnetize the stripes on your credit cards, reset your VCR clock
to flash 12:00, remove your mattress tags or hide your car keys. It
is not destructive, except to the extent that it clogs e-mail
systems and forces system administrators to spend most of their
time cleansing the virus from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively benign, easy to detect and simple to
disable, at least in its current form, Melissa is alarming to many
virus experts because it represents the first worm program to sweep
through common desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa typically enters a computer hidden in a Microsoft Word
97 or Word 2000 file attached to an electronic mail message. It can
also travel via diskettes and downloaded files, but electronic mail
is an exquisitely more efficient carrier, given the millions of
e-mail messages that traverse computer networks every day.
</P>
<P>
   This particular worm virus' preferred mode of travel is
Microsoft Outlook 98, the part of the popular Office suite that
handles electronic messages. Computers without Outlook 98 can be
infected, but they cannot pass along the virus to others except on
disk. If Outlook is installed but is not the user's primary e-mail
program, Melissa will try to seduce Outlook into helping it along.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how it arrives, Melissa can infect any computer that
uses Microsoft Word, including Macintoshes (but Macs cannot pass it
along via Outlook). Once in the computer it will infect any Word
files that the owner opens or creates, and it will rifle through
his or her Outlook address book and send a copy of itself, embedded
in a Word document, to the first 50 people or groups on the list.
</P>
<P>
   If the victim is unfortunate enough to open or create a
sensitive file using Word 97 when Melissa kicks in, it will
surreptitiously send that file, infected with the virus, to those
50 addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those who open the document could potentially send it to
50 others, and so on. The damage is amplified if any of the
addresses are to mailing lists, like ``A-team,'' ``book club'' or
another list early in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients will receive a message with the subject line
``Important message from (your name)'' and the message ``Here is
the document you asked for. ... don't show anyone else ;-).'' An
infected Word file is attached to the message.
</P>
<P>
   The original virus file was called list.doc and was a list of
passwords to pornographic Web sites. As the virus spreads, the file
certainly will change. Keep in mind that computer viruses can
mutate quickly and alter their modus operandi. There is already
evidence that Melissa variants are in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the attachment triggers the virus, unless an updated
antivirus program is on guard to stop it. Dont open it. And if the
program asks whether you want to allow macros to run, just say no.
</P>
<P>
   If Melissa succeeds in infecting the computer, once an hour it
can insert a snippet of dialogue from a ``Simpsons'' television
episode into any Word 97 document that is open at the time:
``Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus 50 points for
using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With some simple modification, Melissa could have copied
critical data from the victim's computer and sent it to Bulgaria,
reformatted the hard disk, changed random zeros to ones in a
spreadsheet and perhaps even erased any trace that it had been
there. But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Because Melissa is not destructive, there might be a temptation
to shrug it off as a transient blip in Internet security. Instead,
it ought to highlight how vulnerable all computers are to viruses
as the world's communications and commerce systems become more
dependent on the Internet each year.
</P>
<P>
   So the first rule is to install a tough antivirus program. No
computer connected to the Internet should be without one.
</P>
<P>
   An antivirus program is designed to recognize telltale virus
signatures and to intercept and destroy the rogue code before it
has a chance to infect the computer. But such programs are useful
only on viruses the software has been trained to catch. When a new
virus like Melissa appears, it could slip past any antivirus
program that has not been updated to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   The two best antivirus programs I have used are Norton Antivirus
5.0 from the Symantec Corp. (www.symantec.com) and Virus Scan from
the McAfee division of Network Associates (www.nai.com). Both are
about $50 and include a one-year subscription for online updates,
and both quickly posted Melissa updates on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   The second rule is to update the software frequently. New
viruses are being created all the time. Jeffrey Carpenter, team
leader at the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie
Mellon University, said reports of virus attacks have increased
significantly since last August.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the major antivirus programs can easily be updated
over the Internet, through a relatively quick download that updates
the program's database of known virus signatures. In some cases the
user does not have to do anything; the downloads are performed
automatically. Not using this feature in effect defeats the purpose
of the software.
</P>
<P>
   The third rule is more Draconian: Never open e-mail attachments
or download files unless you are absolutely confident of their
contents, even if they are not Word files. It would be trivial for
a malicious programmer to modify Melissa to affect Excel files, for
example, and apparently someone has done just that, in a new virus
called Papa.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional advice is never to open any attachment sent by
a stranger, but with Melissa, and with several other new viruses
designed to propagate via e-mail, the files almost always come from
acquaintances, even friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you use Word 97, go to the Word toolbar and click Tools, then
Options, then General, then make sure there is a check mark in the
box labeled ``Macro virus protection.''
</P>
<P>
   More tips are available from several Web sites, including
www.microsoft.com and www.cert.org. It might be a good idea to
bookmark them, because Melissa is unlikely to be the last such
virus we will see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far the most prolific threat I've seen in a long
time,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at the Symantec
Antivirus Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif., adding that
future virus worms will spread faster as more PC users connect to
the Internet through always-connected high-speed phone lines and
cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed hope that once Melissa's author is identified
and tied to the whipping post, others will be deterred from
releasing such viruses into the world.

A PIECE OF JANIS JOPLIN'S HEART, AND SOUL, IN CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The combination of theater and rock-and-roll, the
success of which has long been devoutly wished by theater producers
eager to build new audiences, has rarely flourished in regional
theaters, where the subscribers that sustain them tend to be
graying and traditionalist. But at the venerable Cleveland Play
House here (at 83 years old rather graying and traditional itself),
the melding seems to have worked in its current production.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Love, Janis,'' is a kind of concert version of the
rise-and-flameout story of Janis Joplin, and it includes 20 of her
songs, played by an onstage rock band cranked up to relatively
earsplitting levels _ relative, that is, to your average production
of Shakespeare if not quite to your average production at the old
Fillmore East in New York, where this psychedelic-era rocker used
to perform before her death from a drug overdose, at the age of 27.
It is a rollicking success story here.
</P>
<P>
   The show has now been extended twice, through April 11, and is
among the top five revenue-generating productions in the theater's
history. And though it has attracted a fair number of people the
Play House hasn't seen before _ Hell's Angels, Joplin impersonators
and other patrons who tend to dance in the aisles during the show _
the older subscribers, by the evidence at a couple of recent
performances, are digging it as well, bobbing their heads in their
subscribers' front row seats even as they hold their fingers in
their ears, singing along with the a cappella Joplin satire of
capitalism, ``Mercedes-Benz,'' and leaping up at the end of the
show to applaud, rock concert fashion, with their hands above their
heads. (The audiences stopped short of lighting matches, but just
barely.)
</P>
<P>
   And though some patrons have complained about the volume (during
intermission at one show the stage manager sent a pair of earplugs
to a man in the front row who looked particularly uncomfortable)
the older audience members mostly seemed giddily energized.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a zinger!'' said Ken Kress, 72, an electrical
contractor from Elyria, Ohio. ``The talent on that stage!'' Kress
said he had never particularly paid attention to Janis Joplin
before, and though he vaguely recalled his children listening to
her music, ``I might have just tuned her out.'' After seeing
``Love, Janis,'' he said: ``I think I'll reconsider and give it a
listen. It's history and it's marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show's reception has to do with context as well as
music. And it also has to do with Janis Joplin herself, a brassy,
ambitious woman, sexy without being particularly attractive and
possessed of a potent, gravelly voice with the power of a blues
shouter.
</P>
<P>
   She was, arguably, the leading female icon of rock in the late
1960s and certainly its leading female martyr, belonging, with Jimi
Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Otis Redding, to the pantheon of stars of
the era whose lives ended prematurely. She is, in any case, the
kind of character whose life and legend inspire awe and admiration,
particularly among women and maybe even more particularly among
performers who are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been so inspired and humbled by the level of this
woman's intelligence, love, passion and her uncompromising focus,''
said Beth Hart, a rock singer from Los Angeles who as one of two
singers sharing the role of Janis is making her theatrical debut in
the show. (Because of the vocal demands of the part she alternates
performances with Andra C. Mitrovich, a singer from Austin, Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Janis was really a warrior,'' Ms. Hart said. ``God bless her,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Created four years ago by Randal Myler, who is also the
director, the show (which has had previous productions in Denver
and Austin) is built on a framework of Joplin's best-known songs,
including ``Piece of My Heart,'' ``Get It While You Can'' and ``Me
and Bobby McGee.''
</P>
<P>
   But the narrative that ties them together is based on letters
that were written by Joplin, mostly from San Francisco, to her
family in Port Arthur, Texas, from 1966, when she first left home,
to 1970, when she died in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The letters (many are being exhibited across town at the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum) portray an unfamiliar Janis
Joplin: thoughtful and self-aware but deeply insecure, occasionally
girlish, and frequently lonely. Mostly she reveals herself to be a
loving daughter courting her parents' support and approval, a small
town girl discovering the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people from Mercury records will be there to hear the
Grateful Dead (with a name like that, they have to be good),'' she
wrote in June 1966 about a dance that was to be her San Francisco
singing debut, ``and Big Brother et al., and I'm going to get to
sing. Gosh I'm so excited!''
</P>
<P>
   All in all it's less an image of a profligate rock star than
that of a tremulous college girl, and it clearly resonates with the
theater's older patrons. As one woman said wistfully in the lobby,
``She was so good to her mother!''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hackett, the theater's artistic director, said: ``What
we're finding is with a lot of the older people, they're relating
to the letters. People in 50s and down are getting hooked by
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turns out that many people are returning to the show
to hear the other Janises sing. Both have strong voices; both have
long brown hair with blond highlights. Ms. Vitrovich, a rock and
cabaret singer who has performed in theatrical parts before, has a
greater sense of stage decorum; Ms. Hart, who has been known to
scold audience members for not looking happy enough and to kick her
shoes off into the crowd during the final musical number, brings
more barroom to the stage. Neither, however, has much introspection
to engage in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to overanalyze Janis,'' Ms. Mitrovich said. ``She
never resolved her issues. So what, man?''
</P>
<P>
   The show has its shortcomings. The storytelling structure is
unwieldy. The script calls for two Janises in each performance, a
kind of split personality; one sings, the other doesn't. The
singing-performing half is supposed to represent the public Janis
(the role shared by Ms. Hart and Ms. Mitrovich); the one who
doesn't sing, ostensibly the private Janis, is played in all
performances by an actress from New York, Catherine Curtin, who is
presenting a reprise of the role she played in Denver and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   As the introspective Joplin, she delivers the contents of the
letters, and Ms. Curtin brought herself nearly to tears talking
about the inspiration she found in the singer's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal, who hasn't been there?'' Ms. Curtin said of Joplin's
self-destructive streak. ``That doesn't mean you don't want to go
forward. It doesn't mean you bottom out on life. Men, a lot of
people, thought she was just an ugly chick who could sing, but she
was more than an ugly chick who could sing. Me. I mean, I play this
part every night, and people are cheering and laughing and I still
come off the stage going, `Am I any good?' She's teaching me, man,
teaching me to give more.''
</P>
<P>
   So there are actually  &UR; three &LR;  actresses playing Joplin. And if
that's not confusing enough, the public and private Joplins are
often onstage at the same time, either talking to one another or to
an offstage interviewer. Still, at two recent performances no
audience members seemed to be talking about what they did not
understand. Everybody got it.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Linkow, a small woman with blue-gray hair who would not
divulge her age but said her children were teen-agers in the 1960s,
put it succinctly during intermission at a recent matinee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love rock-and-roll,'' she said, and returned to the
auditorium for the second act.

 (For release Sunday, April 4)  
 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA NEED ANSWERS ,
 (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's armed intervention in Yugoslavia raises
questions once more about our national interest, our humanitarian
obligations and our leadership in international organizations
created as a result of our conviction that collective security is
essential to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The effort of U.S.-led NATO forces to halt the slaughter of
civilians in Kosovo through air attacks has created consternation,
confusion and outright opposition among many in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What, many critics ask, is our national interest in a country
that has often been a cauldron of competing ethic, religious and
political forces since it was created by the Treaty of Versailles
80 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Does America, as the world's only superpower, have a
humanitarian responsibility to protect the innocent victims of
ruthless aggression and restore peace to lands shattered by
warfare? If so, does that responsibility extend to Africa and Asia?
</P>
<P>
   Is NATO's armed action in Yugoslavia a natural and legitimate
outgrowth of the internationalism that has been the guiding force
in U.S. foreign policy since the United Nations was founded in 1945
and NATO in 1949?
</P>
<P>
   Does the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, created as a
barrier to Soviet aggression in Western Europe during the Cold War,
still have a viable mission?
</P>
<P>
   There are other pertinent questions: When and how do we end the
shelling of Yugoslavia and bring our forces home? Will massive
bombing eventually force the ruthless Slobodan Milosevic to the
peace table? Will it become necessary for the NATO allies,
including the United States, to commit troops to the fighting and
then to the peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Those last three questions may be the most important to American
families.
</P>
<P>
   Answers are vital to preservation of a foreign policy that has,
for the most part, served us well and to an understanding of that
policy.
</P>
<P>
   First, it should be noted that what we are trying to achieve in
Kosovo already has been achieved Bosnia, where violence reigned
before to NATO's intercession.
</P>
<P>
   Our current national interest, like that of our NATO allies, is
in ending the genocide that has taken the lives of thousands of
Kosovar Albanians and the forced evacuation that has uprooted
hundreds of thousands more from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, before jet planes, trans-ocean rocketry, computers
and far-reaching communications networks tied us all together in
one enormous, if not necessarily happy, human family, many
Americans would not have accepted such a national interest. But, in
today's world, we are separated from each other only by minutes
rather than days and weeks. Isolation must be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken us a long time to realize the wisdom of words
written by John Donne 375 years ago: ``No man is an island,
entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part
of the main ... any man's death diminishes me, because I am
involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the
bell tolls; it tolls for thee.''
</P>
<P>
   As a nation blessed with tremendous power in all phases of our
existence, America does carry a special burden to help those
nations that it can help. But we have been burned in places like
Vietnam and Somalia, and we have an obligation to our people to
pick and choose where we interject ourselves and to do so only
where we are convinced we can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, when we defeated vicious foes in Europe and
Asia, we have, through the United Nations and NATO, sought to use
our power to halt aggression and genocide. We have not always done
so wisely, but at least we have tried.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the coin is that thousands of people around
the world who now are protesting our bombing raids sat in serene
silence during the months that ethnic cleansing killed, maimed and
uprooted innocent people in Kosovo. Some others who now protest our
action clamored for action in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   NATO remains vital as one of the great peacekeeping institutions
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Critics ask what our exit strategy is. The answer should be: to
force Milosevic and the Serbs back to the conference table, to make
them accept NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo to protect the
embattled ethnic Albanians there _ and, ultimately, to oust
Milosevic from power.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has sought to explain the bombing of
Yugoslavia in terms of World War II. He pictures Milosevic as the
reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and himself as a latter-day Winston
Churchill, warning that the villainous Yugoslav dictator can spark
a war that will engulf neighboring nations, including Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics see the war in Kosovo as another Vietnam, a civil
war in which the United States has no abiding interest. They fear
that America and its allies can become mired in a tragic conflict
that is unwinnable without ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that massive bombing of London by the Nazis in
World War II did not break the spirit of the English people. Nor,
they add, did the bombing of Hanoi force the North Vietnamese to
capitulate. In the Persian Gulf War in 1991, airstrikes played a
vital role, but it was the ground troops that drove Iraq's forces
back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   But such an outlook is extremely pessimistic. While the outcome
in Yugoslavia remains uncertain, the truth is that America and its
NATO allies are committed to saving the lives and villages of the
people of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise of power to help other peoples is a duty that
entails sacrifice, and that is the price we now are paying for a
better world.

   DOW-QUARTER _ The first quarter was a wild one for the stock

spiraled downward. And technology stocks, a major component of the

short-term fixes and financial goals more than creative strategy.

THERE'S LOTS TO LIKE ABOUT `10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spirited teen comedy ``10 Things I Hate About You'' employs
what could be called the Throw It Against the Wall Rule, i.e, if
you put enough jokes into your script, some are bound to work. Hey,
it worked for the Marx Brothers and early Woody Allen; why not for
an adolescent take on ``The Taming of the Shrew''?
</P>
<P>
   And hey, who knew that Shakespeare dude could be so
entertaining? References to him abound in this messy but enjoyable
movie, right down to the use of a remake of Nick Lowe's ``Cruel to
Be Kind.'' But you don't have to be a fan of the Bard to like this
affable film.
</P>
<P>
   It might help if the film had Cliffs Notes, though: There's a
lot going on, especially for a teen movie. To sort it out: Cameron
(''3rd Rock From the Sun's'' Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new student
at Padua High, quickly develops a crush on pretty sophomore Bianca
Stratford (Larisa Oleynik of Nickelodeon's ``The Secret World of
Alex Mack''). Two catches, though: Bianca has her eye on hot boy
Joey Keener (Andrew Keegan, who looks like Andrew Shue except that
his mouth forms shapes besides circles); and Bianca's
overprotective obstetrician dad won't let her date till older
sister Kat (Julia Stiles) goes out with a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. Kat is known around the school for having a chip on
her shoulder; even the teachers are getting tired of her attitude.
But then along comes supposed delinquent Patrick Verona (Australian
actor Heath Ledger), setting into motion a convoluted plan to get
Kat a beau so that Cameron can score Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is, after all, trying to cram five acts' worth of
material into a little more than an hour and a half. Apparently
sensing this, debut feature director Gil Junger _ who did the
coming-out episode of ``Ellen'' _ films everything fast, rolling
right past the jokes that don't work to get to the ones that do,
sometimes so quickly that they're gone before you realize you
should have laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, by newcomer team Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten
Smith, occasionally rings of too much deja vu _ how many more teen
movies are going to include: a) a scene in which the new kid gets a
guided tour of his school's cliques; b) a big party scene; and c) a
big prom scene? But if Lutz and Smith's screenplay is derivative
and formulaic, at least it doesn't take itself too seriously, and
Junger handles it with a surprising amount of unself-conscious
flair for a first-time big-screen director. A longtime TV veteran,
he seems to know instinctively what to do with the more expensive
toys he's allowed to play with here.
</P>
<P>
   As much flash as Junger shows, though, his real coup is in
getting buoyant performances out of his young cast (it helps that
the majority are actually young enough to be in high school).
Oleynik, who is completely charming, has the makings of someone on
the verge of a breakthrough, and Stiles, who many TV critics
thought was the best thing about NBC's ``The '60s,'' radiates an
intelligence that seems less forced than some of her teen
counterparts (see Rachael Leigh Cook in ``She's All That).'' The
adults _ Larry Miller as the Stratford girls' father, plus Daryl
``Chill'' Mitchell, Allison Janney and David Leisure as wacky
faculty members _ steal every scene they're in.
</P>
<P>
   So does the school where ``10 Things'' was filmed, Stadium High
School in Tacoma, Wash. Usually a school setting wouldn't be worth
comment, but this place is amazing; it's a castle-esque waterfront
school that looks as if it was built in the Elizabethan era
(fittingly, the prom scene is filmed as if it took place in the
Globe Theater). The campus alone is enough to make you wish you
were back in high school. So's the movie, which for once is light
on the angst and generous with the humor. It's often uneven, but it
works more than enough to get by.

INJURIOUS GEORGE CASHES IN WITH SELF-SERVING MEMOIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loyalty is a dubious quality in politics, particularly for those
who work in the White House. Toe the mark no matter how odious the
orders, and you might end up being indicted. Quit, and you're
deserting the leader of the Free World.
</P>
<P>
   Write about everything, noting often how much you regret giving
the impression you're betraying your former boss, and you make a
lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   So, in one sense, we have to hand it to George Stephanopoulos.
The munchkin whose name is impossible to spell signed on to Bill
Clinton's '92 campaign, rode that train all the way into serious
White House power, was essentially shoved out when he lost an
internal power struggle with pollster Dick Morris, and now finds
himself on the receiving end of a $2.75-million book contract and
the chance to take all the cheap shots he wants. ``All Too Human''
(Little, Brown, $27.95) is a masterpiece of literary back-stabbing;
if Ken Starr gets around to writing his version of Monicagate, he
ought to hire Georgie S. as his ghostwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bill Clinton ``et al'' deserve much loyalty;
Stephanopoulos makes that plain. As depicted by his former senior
adviser, our president is a foul-tempered, foul-mouthed dissembler
who bases his lifetime beliefs on whichever poll he read last.
Hillary Clinton's greatest skill is conjuring up tears and telling
staffers to get out if they aren't 100 percent behind her and her
husband _ in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is a nasty piece of work who holds an
exceptional grudge; Stephanopoulos says he got on the veep's bad
side by daring to work temporarily for Dick Gephardt before signing
on with Clinton. Morris, whom Stephanopoulos clearly hates most of
all, is depicted as a sex-obsessed manipulator who appeals to
Clinton's easily aroused dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Why, to hear Stephanopoulos tell it, during his five years in
the Clinton White House there was just one essentially decent
person in the building: the author. Much of ``All Too Human'' is
taken up by Stephanopoulos whining about all the difficult moral
decisions he had to make, and how, when no one else would, he took
a deep breath and reminded Bill Clinton of the right choices.
(Welfare reform, especially, and darned if that stubborn president
didn't go out and do the opposite of what Stephanopoulos had told
him to do!)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, sweet little George tumbled into depression,
requiring psychologists and medications to sleep at night. He
eventually resigned to teach at Columbia University, although it's
questionable how much his students see of him, since he's now a
ubiquitous presence on TV news shows dissecting the remains of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too bad for ``All Too Human'' that Stephanopoulos
exited stage left before Clinton's dalliance with Lewinsky. Since
he wasn't there, all he can do in his book is moan about how he'd
always believed Clinton was too smart to do THAT ``in the White
House.'' But the 38-year-old, at least, has more patience than the
president. ``All Too Human'' was about to go to press when
Monicagate broke, and the book was delayed so that Stephanopoulos
could add a Lewinsky chapter. The object, ostensibly, was to give
readers as much information as possible, not to time the release of
the book to ensure maximum sales on the new tidal wave of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Too Human'' and ``Monica's Story'' are only the first in a
flood of Clinton books coming in the next 18 months. It will be
just about impossible for anyone to read all of them, so each must
try to make a special case for consumer attention. Stephanopoulos,
to be sure, has an insider's story to tell, and a smooth,
nonself-incriminating way of telling it. Just don't ever hire him
to work for you. In the end, people like Stephanopoulos are always
working for themselves.

A GODSEND FOR TROUBADOUR BELIEVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with love or the fortunes of a favorite baseball team, music
can be feast or famine :one good CD after another coming out or
weeks going by with nothing genuinely interesting hitting the
racks.
</P>
<P>
   In folk music, the past couple of weeks have definitely been a
banquet: A trio of great CDs by Terry Allen, Tom Russell and Chris
Smither has just been released.
</P>
<P>
   All three men are serious, veteran troubadours, all have highly
idiosyncratic vocal and/or writing styles, and all have strong
connections to Texas: Allen is part of the large handful of
talented Lubbockites, which includes Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore
and Butch Hancock; Russell lives in El Paso; and New Orleans-raised
Smither has recorded for years in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three _ Allen's ``Salivation'' and Russell's ``The
Man From God Knows Where'' _ are overtly concept records, song
cycles based around one subject or series of events.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Russell, whose CD may be the best of the bunch.
It's a folk opera that traces his roots (Norway and Ireland) and
paints the immigrant experience with fine detail and deft interplay
of folk, Irish instrumentation and traditional songs from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Russell casts himself as the title character, a sort of
proto-immigrant, and enlists several other vocalists (among them
Iris DeMent, Dave Van Ronk and Dolores Keane) to interweave
different stories and points of view.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Russell says in the liner notes, his shot at letting his
ancestors rise up out of their graves to tell their stories. And as
such, it's all but a complete success. Russell has been one of folk
music's guiding lights, but he has gone to a new level here.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Allen, meanwhile, is still his irascible, semisacrilegious
old self, a uniquely talented Renaissance man who recently hosted a
benefit show in Dallas that also featured appearances by David
Byrne and Lucinda Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He has long mused about our relationship with God: In ``Gimme a
Ride to Heaven, Boy,'' perhaps his best-known song, a hitchhiker
claiming to be Jesus steals at gunpoint the car of a guy who has
stopped to give him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salivation'' is like that song to the power of 10. With help
from Charlie Sexton, Lloyd Maines and sons Bukka and Bale, Allen
muses on the impending end of the world in the title track and in
``Southern Comfort,'' comments on how people use God for
fund-raising purposes in ``The Doll,'' and sweetly bids us farewell
with the 1957 country hit ``Give Me the Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   This last track is one of the loveliest songs ever about
appreciating people while they're alive instead of crying over them
when they're dead, and it perfectly ties these tunes together. In
addition to the new material, he also includes a medley of songs
from his ultra-rare ``Pedal Steal'' CD, which is available only at
Allen's live shows.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smither's ``Drive You Home Again'' is a fine collection of
songs from a man who has long kept audiences rapt with his mix of
folk and acoustic blues. Smither sings in a weathered voice about
weathered people and weathered emotions, and in that way, ``Drive''
fits well with his previous work.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also something of an artistic left turn. The third CD
he has cut in Austin, ``Drive'' has producer and Fort Worth native
Stephen Bruton fusing Smither's acoustic, lived-in sound with horns
on numerous tracks, such as ``Hold On II,'' which features John
Mills on saxophone as Smither sings about keeping the faith.
``Drive'' is both comfortably familiar and different enough to give
Smither's sound a fresh tweak.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw a fistful of memorable
folk/Americana/whatever-you-call-it CDs, among them Lyle Lovett's
``Step Inside This House,'' Lucinda Williams' ``Car Wheels on a
Gravel Road'' and the Billy Bragg/Wilco summit meeting, ``Mermaid
Avenue.'' But with the release of these three CDs and ``The
Mountain,'' Steve Earle's immersion into bluegrass, 1999 is shaping
up nicely, too.

MIFFED MOTORIST STEERS DRIVING STORY ON ARCHER TO MEDIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As chairman of the influential House Ways and Means
committee, Rep. Bill Archer is accustomed to being treated as a
VIP.
</P>
<P>
   But a motorist was miffed that the Texas Republican was
apparently using his status to drive solo on the HOV lanes on
Interstate 66 near his home in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter tipped off The Washington Post that a car sporting
the license plate ``U.S. Congress Texas-7 '' was sighted on the
lanes restricted to two or more occupants at 8:40 a.m. March 24.
Archer represents the 7th Congressional District in Houston and
parts of Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   The source also informed the Post that the car held up traffic
at the entrance ramp as he tried to see if the Arlington police
were handing out tickets to HOV violators.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Archer had a right to be on the lanes as Virginia laws
grants HOV exemptions to members of Congress when lawmakers are in
session or 15 days before or after the official business.
</P>
<P>
   Archer could not be reached for comment because he is spending
the congressional break this week in Australia, where he is
receiving an award from the Australian Parliament and holding talks
with the finance minister. The trip is being sponsored and paid for
by the U.S.-Asia Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman Sean Rushton said he could not confirm whether the
congressman was the person driving in the restricted lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the highway where the car was spotted is ``one
of the main routes that goes back and forth from where he (Archer)
lives to the Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushton also acknowledged that Archer seeks the most expedient
ways and means to get to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing can be explained by Mr. Archer's anxiousness
to race to the Capitol, to save Social Security, pay down the
national debt and provide tax relief to hard working Americans,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton added that rules governing the HOV lanes are confusing.
He noted that Archer's intern, who is staying in the congressman's
home and using his car while he is Australia, was just ticketed
this week on the same HOV lanes where the congressman was spotted.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last few years, computer and electronics stores have
become crowded with handheld digital devices that are capable of
stirring technolust in the most analog of hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how smart, convenient and seductive these devices
_ like palm-size personal organizers, super-high-resolution digital
cameras and elaborate wireless telephones that are compact enough
to get lost in a purse, to name a few _ they have all been hampered
by the same thing: skimpy memory.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't cost _ at current prices, around two cents a
megabyte, memory is cheap and plentiful. The hindrance is physical
size. The 3{-inch floppy disk, one of the most widely used forms of
portable memory storage, has been around since 1981. While it
remains a workhorse for storing data and physically moving modest
files and programs between personal computers, the floppy is too
big to insert in a device like a cellular phone. And with its low
memory capacity, 1.44 megabytes, it is hardly worth the trouble to
try to adapt it.
</P>
<P>
   For greater memory capacity, the increasingly affordable (about
$300 to $500) CD-RW and DVD-RAM drives have made it easy to store
scads of data optically on CD-ROM and DVD platters. But those disks
are even bigger than floppies. Flash memory, the coin of the realm
for most mobile digital devices, is the right size and shape, but
it is expensive. A 40-megabyte Compact Flash memory card costs
about $150 ($3.75 cents a megabyte), about half the cost of some
digital cameras. And some forms of flash memory are too fragile
after they are removed from a device to be reasonably portable.
</P>
<P>
   So small portable devices seldom carry more than eight megabytes
of data storage, a thousandth of the amount on a respectable PC.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many owners of digital cameras complain that
they can snap only a handful of pictures before the memory is full.
And most palm-size organizers must download information from a
desktop through cable connections because the data cannot be
directly inserted by way of a removable memory card or device. What
consumers need, many industry consultants say, is a form of rugged,
inexpensive memory storage that can be used interchangeably in all
these devices.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies, Sony Electronics, Iomega and International
Business Machines, are trying to provide just that. They have
developed new forms of mini-storage memory and are jumping into the
market, hoping to win converts. Two approaches are new
interpretations of existing technologies, and the third could mean
that digital devices like printers and cellular phones could speak
more easily to one another without using the PC as an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   The new products are the microdrive, from IBM; the Clik Mobile
Drive, from Iomega, and the Memory Stick, from Sony Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, the microdrive is garnering the most attention
from computer industry consultants because of its engineering and
potential uses. Announced last fall, the microdrive is a
mechanical, magnetic hard drive the size of a matchbook and can
hold up to 340 megabytes of data. It operates like the full-size,
multigigabyte drives in desktop PC's. The device is scheduled to
reach stores this summer, but some consultants pointed out that
earlier deadlines had not been met.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle McIntyre, an IBM spokeswoman, said the microdrive could
be slipped into different devices, giving a digital camera, for
instance, the capacity to store hundreds upon hundreds of pictures,
rather than the few dozen possible now with standard flash memory.
The drive's tiny platter can store the equivalent of 300 long
novels, which would consume 236 floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   At 1.68 inches long, 1.43 inches wide and just 0.188 inches
thick, the microdrive is designed to fit into slots on portable
devices that now accommodate many flash memory cards, known as
Compact Flash Type II.
</P>
<P>
   While IBM has not said how much the new drive will cost,
industry experts say it will probably run $340 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. McIntyre said, the microdrive is being embraced by
Cannon, Minolta, Hitachi, Clarion and Hewlett-Packard, which are
expected to offer products using it.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of corporate confidence, IBM prefers the lowercase
spelling of microdrive, saying it will be a new standard for
memory, not a brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Clik Mobile Drive has been aggressively promoted since
December by Iomega, known for its popular Zip drive. Aimed directly
at users of handheld computers and digital still cameras, the Clik,
about the size of a silver dollar, stores 40 megabytes of data on a
spinning disk that sells for about $10 when bought in a 10-pack.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the power of portable devices growing exponentially,''
said Michael Joseph, general manager of Clik products for Iomega,
which is based in Roy, Utah. He said the growing use of much
smaller PC's meant that memory needed to be more readily available
and more portable.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Iomega's Zip and Jaz cartridges, the 40-megabyte Clik
disk does not work without its separate drive device, at least so
far. A Clik drive and reader about the size of an electric shaver
works with digital cameras, while a smaller unit, about the size of
a television remote control, is for use with laptop and handheld
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega officials say devices with built-in Clik slots are being
developed or are under consideration by Kodak, Hitachi, Compaq
Computer and Sharp Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Using Clik's disk with an outside attachment takes several
steps. To store digital photographs requires inserting the flash
card memory from a digital camera into one end of a Clik drive
reader and inserting the Clik disk in the other end. Once that is
done, however, the reader takes only seconds to transfer the data
to the Clik.
</P>
<P>
   The Clik drive, which comes with one disk, costs $199 for mobile
computers and $249 for digital cameras; a package of a drive,
reader and attachments to use with both types of devices costs
$299.
</P>
<P>
   J.Gerry Purdy, president and chief executive of Mobile Insights,
a company in Mountain View, Calif., that studies major developments
in mobile computing, said he gave the Clik a few years to be
``supplanted by either flash or microdrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most radical rethinking of portable memory comes
from Sony Electronics, which has developed the Memory Stick.
Officially introduced in the United States earlier this year, the
Memory Stick is a collection of microchips encased in purple
plastic that is not quite as big as a stick of chewing gum. Sony
officials say the stick, which comes in 4-megabyte or 8-megabyte
sizes, will slip into a slew of devices, including still and video
cameras, PC's and printers _ made primarily by, of course, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can get more value if they can get these devices to
work together,'' said Mark Viken, senior vice president for imaging
marketing at Sony Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Highly portable and capable of storing more information than a
stack of five floppy disks (this summer, that capacity is expected
to quadruple, to 32 megabytes), the Memory Stick is designed to
move text, sound, images and graphics easily.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the IBM microdrive and the Clik, the Memory Stick is
chip-based, so it uses no moving parts. At its core is flash memory
with an on-board controller chip, Sony says. The sticks are much
smaller than Compact Flash and Smart Media memory; Sony says they
are more durable.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-megabyte sticks cost $39.99 each. Sony also sells a PC
card adaptor, much like those that accept flash memory cards, that
permits anyone with a computer that has a PCMCIA slot to use Memory
Sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The Memory Stick could become the first dependable form of
memory to free a wide range of users from the PC. A Sony photo
printer scheduled for store shelves next month can accept and print
images directly transferred to it from a camera by way of a Memory
Stick. And a demonstration of a future use of the technology showed
that home movies taken with a digital video camera could
transmitted over phone lines by inserting a Memory Stick containing
the video images in a special telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory Stick is the next dimension in how you can share
information between products,'' said Jay Sato, vice president for
digital imaging at Sony Electronics' consumer products marketing
group. ``It can do everything. You don't need different mediums in
the future to do different types of applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Memory Stick technology is being incorporated into products by
companies that include Aiwa, Casio, Fujitsu, Olympus, Sanyo and
Sharp, Sony officials say. But not surprisingly, Sony this month
released the first major device to use a Memory Stick, the Vaio
slimtop LCD computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is developing some other devices to take advantage of the
Memory Stick. Next month, the company plans to release a $1,000 LCD
picture stand that will display digital snapshots and video clips
that can be turned on and off with a wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   What does the dawn of these new storage systems mean for
consumers and the devices they use? Within five years, Purdy said,
memory technology should advance to the point where flash memory
will become cheap enough to have 100 megabytes of the stuff selling
for $50 and 5-gigabyte microdrives will not be unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows whether a single standard for small, portable
memory will become as ubiquitous as the old 3{-inch floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Malmed, senior vice president for marketing and sales for
Sandisk in Sunnyvale, Calif., the leading maker of Compact Flash
memory cards, is understandably skeptical of the new memory
devices. Compact Flash cards can already hold 32 megabytes or more,
he said, have a price similar to that of Memory Sticks and fit into
a broad range of devices _ many more, he contended, than Clik disks
will manage in their first full year. Malmed added that the
microdrive's miniature moving parts would be vulnerable to damage
and that it cost too much for most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But the makers of the microdrive, Clik drive and Memory Stick
press on. At IBM's offices in Manhattan, an engineer recently
pulled a microdrive from his pocket and talked happily about one
day snapping it into a Walkman-size Thinkpad laptop, a portable
computer that would be worn on the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be done,'' he chirped.

`THE WOUNDS': SERBIAN THUGS IN A DISINTEGRATING CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Emir Kusturica demonstrated with ``Underground,'' the anguish
in the Balkans may be better conveyed through raucous, stinging
satire than by more conventionally compassionate means. For him and
now for Srdjan Dragojevic in ``The Wounds,'' the madness and moral
chaos of wartime call for rowdy cinematic outrage in response.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tactic that explodes any last trace of ordinary existence
and shows just how uncertain the future appears. And in the case of
Dragojevic's film, it helps to define a new generation of thugs who
arouse both horror and pity. The two young Serbs who evolve during
the course of ``The Wounds'' from relative innocents to flashy
hoodlums are not condemned by the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story about young criminals who I believe have a
deep moral right to be violent, even to murder, despite the
political unacceptability of this idea,'' Dragojevic has said. ``An
insensitive society and a totalitarian Serbian regime have made
thousands of Serbian teen-agers dangerous, senseless killing
machines, ironically whose main victims are themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wounds,'' which spans the period from 1991 to 1996, begins
with a glimpse of its two main characters after they have been
molded into the ruthless, anesthetized brutes he describes. Then it
moves back five years to discover just how Pinki and Kraut (played
by two effective newcomers, Dusan Pekic and Milan Maric) got that
way.
</P>
<P>
   With improbable raffishness, it shows how the teen-agers fall
into the orbit of Dickie (Dragan Bjelogrlic), a flamboyant crook
and black marketeer who whispers ``Versace'' as if the word were
magic. Dickie, who could easily have stepped out of Kusturica's own
rogues' gallery, revels in the chance to teach the lads everything
he knows about whoring, drugs, gold chains and illicit commerce.
``Thank god for sanctions!'' is his credo.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed with enough stylistic bravado and sardonic narration to
recall ``Trainspotting,'' ``The Wounds'' sustains its sense of the
tragically absurd while Pinki and Kraut grow tougher. It places
them in the middle of a disintegrating culture where the coolest
criminals become television stars, where a billboard advertises a
brand name called ``Democracy Light,'' and where the right tribute
to a fallen comrade is a bottle of Scotch poured over his grave.
Though Vukovar and Sarajevo are bombarded during the story, the
boys show little interest in the battles raging around them. Only
when they inevitably begin harming each other do the consequences
of their corruption hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to care about something,'' Pinki insists late in
the story. ``What if you can't find anything?'' Kraut asks. ``The
Wounds'' is best appreciated as an answer to that question.
</P>

 &HT;    SECURITY WILL BE TIGHT FOR NATO SUMMIT IN U.S.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With NATO warplanes bombing Yugoslavia, security
will be a priority when the alliance holds its 50th anniversary
summit here this month.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO summit, being held in conjunction with a meeting of the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, will draw 43 heads of state, the
most ever to assemble in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Such a high-profile gathering is an inviting target for
terrorists, so the U.S. Secret Service is coordinating 16 other
agencies in safeguarding the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some events will be held at the new Ronald Reagan Building,
which government consultants have repeatedly warned is vulnerable
to terrorist attack because of its large underground parking garage
and unrestricted entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the escalating air strikes against Serb forces in
Yugoslavia, ``canceling or postponing the long-standing NATO
meeting is now now _ nor has it ever _ been considered,'' said a
White House official involved in planning the event.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to security concerns, the April 23-25 summit is
expected to spawn traffic jams of historic proportions. Motorcades
for the world leaders will compete with hundreds of school buses
bringing students from across America on the traditional spring
trips to Washington and the usual tens of thousands of commuters'
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Security and transportation planners are working with the
District government and Metro mass transit system on ``an
appropriate plan so the city is not in total gridlock'' on the
Friday the three-day commemoration opens, said the White House
coordinator, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Some streets will be blocked off and some Metro stops may be
closed. There is even consideration to giving federal workers a day
off to ease the congestion.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 delegates and representatives are expected to attend
the meetings, and 3,000 members of the world's media will be issued
credentials to cover them. In addition to the heads of state, the
foreign ministers and defense ministers of each country will
attend.
</P>
<P>
   From NATO, there will be representatives of the United States,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the
United Kingdom _ and the alliance's three newest members, Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   From the Euro-Atlantic council, leaders will come from Albania,
Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova,
Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the events will be held at the Mellon Center, where the
treaty creating NATO was signed on April 4, 1949. The building is
located on Constitution Avenue, about midway between the White
House and Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton will host two dinners for
the top leaders and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will welcome
spouses to a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams will host a gala at the National
Building Museum. Most, if not all, of the events are closed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent press conference, Williams said the summit offers a
chance to showcase Washington as ``a city that can work in the eyes
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pomp and parties, the summit will have
substantive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``recent events underscore the importance'' of this
opportunity of NATO leaders to come together, said the White House
official.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shards of memory often tell a story best, as Marcel
Proust and James Joyce, among others, have taught us. The Margaret
Jenkins Dance Company from San Francisco took this nonlinear lesson
to heart on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater with the New York
premiere of ``Breathe Normally,'' a polished mix of speech and
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The impression, from early reports, that the actress Olympia
Dukakis would appear live with the company proved mistaken. But Ms.
Dukakis is heard on tape, and it was her recollection of a family
trauma, a car crash, that was the piece's springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Like most recent works by the Jenkins Company, ``Breathe
Normally'' came out of a collaborative process. Ms. Jenkins has
been more equal than others in the troupe she founded in 1973, but
this time Ellie Klopp, her longtime associate, is listed as
director of ``Breathe Normally.''
</P>
<P>
   With a fragmented but meticulously constructed narration, the
tape and onstage performers fuse a text by Rinde Eckert with music
by Jay Cloidt and Ms. Dukakis' remarks, overlaid at the end with
the recollection of the crash by another woman, presumably Ms.
Dukakis' mother.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Breathe Normally'' makes for compelling theater,
allowing a specific event to resonate into a more universal
meditation on life and death and on memory's coloring of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, here disguised as the unpredictable, is the theme. When
the pieces are gradually put together, the story becomes a simple
tale with complex, even mysterious ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a fabulous set of wood-paneled walls by Tom
Bonauro that evokes Frank Lloyd Wright in his Japanese mood. Philip
Agee has created a set of exquisitely sculptured chairs. Alexander
Nichols' lighting gives a sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the lives of ordinary people can be transformed by
an unexpected event is not new, but it is given a twist on two
levels in this case. From the start, there is another story in the
text that runs in counterpoint to the car crash tragedy. The
narrators initially refer to a grandfather ``in the old country''
who jumps off a train and dies. Since the man had made such leaps
countless times as his homebound train slowed down, the initial
wisdom is that he had lost his agility as he grew older or had a
heart attack. Additional information throughout the evening raises
the possibility that the grandfather caused his death as a catalyst
for his family to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   In the new country, or rather Massachusetts, three generations
of the Dukakis family, which is not called by name, pile into a car
driven by an uncle. A photograph of the large family, which Ms.
Dukakis identifies as her own, is repeatedly reduced to close-ups
of two young women that the actress speaks about.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the narrators speak of another trip taken countless
times, as in the grandfather's case. There are 10 singing and
shouting people in the car. The uncle swerves and only two women
(including Ms. Dukakis' mother) survive. The question asked: Did
the uncle swerve by accident or to scare his passengers into
silence?
</P>
<P>
   The choreography for dancers and actors, ranging in age from 32
to 72, is straightforward, formal stuff, clean in its angular
shapes, spiraling torsos and swinging arms. There was a striking
moment of stillness when the ``family'' posed in profile, evoking
immigrants looking out to sea or shore.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hiken, the senior performer, is the grandfather and
Everyman who is told to breathe normally, as in the title, while
anatomical images show up on slides. His death onstage is one of
several crises in the piece, but it also suggests death as part of
life. A nuanced actor, he gives the text an added import. As
dancers, Ms. Jenkins and Ms. Klopp, like Paul Benney, Doug Hara,
Sue Roginski and Rebecca Rossen, move through their multiple roles
with a typically luminous clarity.

RELYING ON THE COMPETENCE OF STRANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash., Texas)  (js) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan jury was startled when a woman carrying a
garment bag interrupted a murder trial. She turned out to be the
justice's personal shopper. ``She took out three or four outfits,
and the judge chose from among them,'' said Kevin Scott, one of the
jurors. Then the trial resumed.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun Microsystems engineer in Silicon Valley, his wife and
their 3-year-old son had not slept for two nights after the boy
misplaced his favorite teddy bear. Les Concierges, a San
Francisco-based company that runs bothersome errands
internationally, found a replica 2,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Rothschild, the president of Cross It Off Your List, a
personal services company in Manhattan, bubble-wrapped homemade
matzohs and sent them to Hawaii by Federal Express in time for a
Passover dinner.
</P>
<P>
   From the specialists who locate objects of desire to those who
locate other specialists, there are now alluring experts for every
household quest. With people spending more hours at work than a
decade ago, the do-it-yourself movement, as an approach to home
decoration and an outlook on life, has declined, giving way to a
wide-ranging ``let others do it'' trend. Its credo is simple: to
save time, just delegate others to pick up the dry cleaning, pamper
the pets, coddle the offspring. Emerson, advocate of individualism,
would be alarmed to learn that these others include professional
organizers, new mentors called ``life coaches'' and household
managers _ updated butlers who will supervise any other others you
may hire.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the boom in personal services as a sign of rising
polarization and specialization: the rich get richer, and the poor
get to run their errands. But some of the runners aren't poor, and
many of their clients aren't rich. What they are is overworked,
insecure and increasingly dependent on the competence of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give that custodian, that administrative assistant,
that salesperson, the feeling that he can get the same thing that
the CEO gets,'' said Phil Wexler, an executive vice president of
Les Concierges, which has 600,000 corporate and private customers.
One client had Les Concierges orchestrate his marriage proposal.
And last Thanksgiving, 27 million Americans ordered in.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to self-reliance? During the last two decades,
employment in private-sector day-care centers increased by more
than 250 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And
that's not counting the many au pairs and sitters operating without
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pets now have sitters, too _ not only cats and dogs but also
ferrets, snakes and birds. ``Ferrets are getting popular,'' said
Marianne McDermott, the executive director of the National
Association of Professional Pet Sitters, which is based in
Washington and whose members visit an estimated 169,000 households
a year. For $45, the Puddles pet service, in Manhattan, offers pet
sleep-overs, in which an employee has a slumber party with your pet
when you leave town. And it has a 24-hour beeper service for
last-minute business travelers who suddenly need to page a pet
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not always this way.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1976, with the do-it-yourself movement
flourishing, John Spadola, a private-school math teacher, decided
to transplant his family from the Upper West Side to a mountain in
rural Maine. He planned to build a house by himself from scratch,
no contractors or decorators allowed. His 6-year-old daughter,
Meema, learned to build a fire and immersed herself in the ``Little
House on the Prairie'' books.
</P>
<P>
   Like most postmodern pioneers, they found that doing it yourself
is harder than it looks. Spadola's family ended up living in a tent
from June until October. Today, his house is still not finished.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, customers had become so overwhelmed that the Home
Depot, the dream mall for the truly motivated, and Ikea, the
home-assembly furniture empire, added decorating departments with
design consultants. So did ABC Carpet and Home, Pottery Barn, Ethan
Allen and Hechinger's.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing nationwide study begun in 1995 by the Joint Center
for Housing Studies at Harvard University shows that many projects
historically done on a do-it-yourself basis are now being hired out
to professional contractors. ``During the '70s and '80s, there was
an awful lot of do-it-yourself home remodeling,'' said Kermit
Baker, the director of the study and a senior research fellow at
the center. ``And there is less of that done now than there was 10
years ago, and we project there will be less of it in 10 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of hours a woman spent on housework in America
dropped from 27 hours a week in 1965 to 15.6 hours in 1995, said
John Robinson, the director of the Americans' Use of Time Project,
a national survey conducted through the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in drudgery chores reflects many social shifts _ more
women in the workforce, more men agreeing to vacuum _ but it also
portends the privatization of housework, which now extends beyond
drilling and dusting to the mere act of being at home.
</P>
<P>
   Les Concierges will wait around for the cable guy or the
plumber, take your dog to the vet, pick up a guest from the
airport. Les Concierges procured a live Siberian tiger for one
client and a World War II military tank for a private event. ``It
had to be fully operational,'' said Valerie Raszka, the company's
director of marketing relationships.

   Once available only to corporate clients, Les Concierges now
offers a full range of services to private members for a monthly
fee of $500.

   Ms. Rothschild, of Cross It Off Your List, once obtained a
British telephone booth for a party. More typically she helps
customers move households or overhaul closets. ``Paper is a big
problem for a lot of people,'' said Ms. Rothschild, whose rates
start at $65 an hour.

   But many personal services, often part time or once in a
lifetime, are no longer just for the rich. Starting at rates of $15
an hour, errand-service providers will do your holiday
gift-shopping. For $12 to $15, a pet sitter will visit a lonely
tarantula. For $8 to $16 a person per meal, a personal chef will
get fresh groceries, visit your home and make your favorite food
for your family. David MacKay, a co-founder and the executive
director of the United States Personal Chef Association, which
started in 1991 with five members and now has nearly 2,500 members
nationwide, estimates that 60,000 clients use personal chefs. He
said that he and his wife, Susan Titcomb, the other co-founder,
wanted to take having a personal chef ``out of the realm of the
wealthy,'' as housekeeping services had done regarding private
maids. The average combined family income of surveyed customers is
$80,000. MacKay believes the service is so popular because it
caters to individual whims. ``When you go out to your favorite
restaurant, you can't say to the chef, `I really like your beef
stroganoff, but can you make it a little extra spicy and leave out
the onions?' '' he said. Chefs are trained to create anything from
creme brulee to chitlins.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind subcontracting the personal is to simplify one's
life. But it doesn't always work that way. ``Finding the right
people to delegate these things to is not easy,'' said Pepper
Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington in
Seattle. ``You may be spending more to delegate things than you
should. You may also lose the pride in creation of the actual
experience. You may also lose some experience of your own
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   All this delegating does create jobs. Eileen Appelbaum, the
research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington
research group, said that countries that have experienced the most
rapid employment growth, like the United States, Britain and
Sweden, are those in which household services and personal services
have increased. ``The real problem confronting the industrialized
economies is how to provide these personal services without
impoverishing the workers who provide them or having a tax burden
that burdens the middle class excessively,'' she said. ``We haven't
solved that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But are these the jobs we really want to be creating? Prof.
Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist, said the rise of personal
services reflects ``an increasing polarization of good jobs and bad
jobs.'' Prof. Schor, an author, whose books include ``The Overspent
American'' (1998), published by Basic Books, said: ``It's a sort of
new servant economy in a slightly different form, because people
are not specialized in one employer. You don't have all-purpose
servants _ you hire five different servants, and the servant has
five different masters.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many others just a cell-phone call away, it is hard to
remember to look for the answers within. Meema Spadola, who is now
29 and a filmmaker living in Manhattan, believes the hands-on ethic
of her childhood taught her crucial lessons. She admits that she
wouldn't try to build a house herself now. ``But I made a film,''
she said. And she still feels nostalgic in hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Goldstein, the author of ``Do It Yourself: Home
Improvement in 20th-Century America'' (Princeton Architectural
Press, 1998), said that there is a ``small niche of people who
really take this stuff seriously and have a lot of skill comparable
to a professional level of skill.'' She admires friends who do
their own sanding. But she doesn't have time to do it herself, at
home in Boston. ``I don't really have that many hobbies,'' she
said. ``Nor am I going to go around slapping up aluminum
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Martha Stewart, few are willing to slap up aluminum
everywhere. ``We don't make our own candles anymore,'' Prof.
Schwartz said. ``Should we spin our own linen? Imagine women's
lives in the 18th century. We don't want to get so nostalgic that
we forget how little of our time was left when we really had to be
self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegating one's personal life to others has obvious drawbacks:
the loss of family time, of self-expression, of basic abilities.
And with design consultants and personal shoppers in every other
store, there is no need to develop personal taste. Scott, the
Manhattan juror, not only was surprised that the state Supreme
Court justice allowed her personal shopper in the courtroom, but
also marveled at the justice's other decision. ``If you ask me, I
think she chose the wrong outfit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (This reporter has never consulted a personal shopper but did
once hire an organization consultant. The ``organizer'' completed
two hours of filing and went home, forgetting her sweater. The
irony was too delicious to ignore: I was relying on the
organizational techniques of an individual who had the same drive
toward entropy that I had.)
</P>
<P>
   And a message left one morning for the National Association of
Professional Organizers, a group based in Austin, Texas, with an
answering service stating that calls are retrieved daily, went
unreturned until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the potential for pure disaster, from the infamous
au pair convicted of shaking a Boston baby to death, to the more
obscure Upper West Side dog walker fired for losing the dog. It was
the walker's first day on the job. Which begs the question of all
who would subcontract important tasks: How do you distinguish
between the truly qualified and the cooing impostor? Worse, how do
you tell if your life coach knows a thing about life?
</P>
<P>
   At least with chitlins, you can tell whether they're chitlins.

A MODERNIST PLAYS WITH IDENTITIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time one still comes across the idea that modernist
music, by its very nature, is ugly and inexpressive, and that the
newly tuneful composers of the last couple of decades have saved
the art from going down some blind alley.
</P>
<P>
   If evidence were needed to counter that notion, a recent CD of
solo works by Brian Ferneyhough (Etcetera KTC 1206), played by the
extraordinary musicians of the Australian group Elision, would do
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Ferneyhough, an English-born composer who has been teaching at
the University of California, San Diego, for the last 12 years, is
a modernist by any definition, except in his choice of media. He
uses conventional instruments and even has a penchant for
traditional groupings, notably the string quartet, and for
historical models.
</P>
<P>
   One work on this disk, ``Kurze Schatten II'' (``Short Shadows
II''), for guitar, owes something to the Baroque suite: it has
several short movements in different tempos, a certain dance
flavor, if only intermittently (much in this highly volatile music
being intermittent) and a sense of practical handiwork, of music
springing from the way the instrument is handled and touched.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferneyhough's music speaks in a manner that is very much its
own, and indeed, his great effort is to create works that have
strong independent identities, works that are essentially different
from anything we might have known before. In the case of ``Kurze
Schatten II,'' perhaps the strongest characteristic is a careering
between extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the fourth of the seven movements seems to be saying too
much too fast, like a person who is breathlessly trying to get to
the end of a crucial message but keeps getting sidetracked and thus
frustrated, the third and fifth are blank, composed of furtive
stutterings and raps on the wood of the instrument. There are
extremes of sonority, too.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ferneyhough acknowledges how well the guitar accepts
arpeggios, his piece is full of unusual, vivid and often beautiful
effects, the most beautiful being its high harmonics and fast, wide
glissandos.
</P>
<P>
   The work also estranges the guitar by retuning its strings to
make quarter-tones available. As the sequence of movements
proceeds, the strings are returned one by one to their normal
tuning, until only one distorting string is left. This is a
brilliant and original justification for the division into
movements: there have to be gaps so the player can retune. But in
addition, the gradual normalization of the music's harmonic world
contributes to the formal shape.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay that gave the work its title, Walter Benjamin
writes, according to the composer, of ``the sun which, as it
approaches its zenith, casts shadows which become progressively
shorter and darker until, at noon, they are so perfectly united
with their objects that the latter stand uniquely and completely
themselves, naked, without residue.''
</P>
<P>
   To follow this analogy, each movement of ``Kurze Schatten II''
is a shadow cast by a new tuning on the multifarious possibilities
of the guitar. Or one might imagine in each movement a new net, a
different mesh, being used to catch different glittering fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurze Schatten II'' is brilliantly played by Geoffrey Morris.
But perhaps the most sheerly stunning performance here is Carl
Rosman's of ``Time and Motion Study I'' for bass clarinet, an
earlier piece, from the 1970s rather than the '80s, going back to a
steamier period in Ferneyhough's music.
</P>
<P>
   Rosman suggests something of the sound and atmosphere of a jazz
improvisation, and perhaps for Ferneyhough the bass clarinet was a
more eloquent, precise and versatile alternative to the baritone
saxophone. But those extras are vital. The piece covers the ground
from frenetic burblings to intense tones in a register one never
thought this instrument could reach, moving to a powerful climax,
after which all that is left is dust in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A companion piece, ``Time and Motion Study II,'' has a solo
cellist bound with contact microphones and tape delay systems; it
probably needs to be seen in performance as well as heard. Even so,
Friedrich Gauwerky's performance is forceful.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are ``Bone Alphabet,'' a labyrinth of pattering
cross-rhythms for a solo percussionist, and ``Unity Capsule'' for
flute.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Ferneyhough release (Accord 205 772) includes larger
and more colorful works, among them ``Carceri d'Invenzione III''
for an orchestra of winds and percussion, the clarinet
mini-concerto ``La Chute d'Icare'' and ``On Stellar Magnitudes,'' a
setting of weird little acrostics by the composer for soprano with
the instrumental ensemble of Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lunaire''
(another historical choice of medium).
</P>
<P>
   ``Carceri d'Invenzione III'' (``Prison of Invention III'') _ in
which a red-hot clarinet solo sparks a whirlwind of fire that burns
itself out to leave ashes of alto flute and percussion _ is
Ferneyhough's closest approach to the sound world of his compatriot
Harrison Birtwistle: it is imposing and gradual, though figured
with furious activity typical of its composer.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosive piccolo solo ``Superscriptio,'' also included
here, it forms part of a concert-length succession of seven works _
a supercomposition that desperately needs to be performed and
recorded complete. But all the performances here, by the Ensemble
Contrechamps of Geneva, are exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Stellar Magnitudes,'' sung by Luisa Castellani, is not the
only recent work by Ferneyhough to suggest a certain humor along
with the headlong inventiveness. And ``La Chute d'Icare'' (``The
Fall of Icarus'') is a gem. Listen to the star bursts of tuned
percussion and string glissandos around the romping soloist at the
start, or to the way the energy of the cadenza breaks out from the
solo instrument in a spurt of piccolo. This is a rare noise these
days: the exhilaration of discovery.

GROUND TROOPS NECESSARY IN KOSOVO, SAY FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A number of prominent foreign policy experts,
including two former advisers to President Reagan, on Wednesday
urged NATO to send ground troops into Kosovo to ensure that Serbs
are defeated in their rampage against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are in a war you need to do what is necessary to
prevail,'' said Frank Carlucci, former Reagan administration
defense secretary and national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in his call for a more aggressive military
campaign in Kosovo by Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations under Reagan, and several other former State
Department officials, at a National Press Club news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick said that NATO was justified in launching the
airstrikes against Yugoslavia because of the heinous acts of its
leaders, including ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct of the Serb government in regard to Kosovo is
unacceptable and uncivilized,'' she said. ``This has been an
assault on civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   She defended the NATO actions, arguing that world wars in Europe
might have been prevented if the allies had struck earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler would have been easy to deal with if he had been turned
back when he occupied the Rhineland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While urging patience with NATO's current strategy, Kirkpatrick
said that air power cannot stop the Serb troops from committing
atrocities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of public backlash and congressional opposition, the
Clinton administration has rejected the use of ground troops in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlucci said politically it might be worse for the
president if he does not eventually consent to ground presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically it is very difficult for a president to lose a
war,'' he said. ``And it is quite clear that air strikes cannot
stop the slaughter and displacement of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci acknowledged that a ground campaign would be difficult
considering the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather in
the region. Furthermore, he said there are only 16 access roads
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts could predict how long and how many ground
forces it would take to defeat the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must expect the worst,'' said Morton Abramowitz, the
former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz also said that even if NATO forces Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to the peace table, ground troops will be needed
to ensure the safety of displaced Kosovo refugees when they seek to
return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also said that the United States should scrap the
current peace treaty negotiated with the Kosovars earlier this year
at Rambouillet, France. They added that Milosevic should be treated
as the enemy and not someone to be negotiated with.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether defense hawks such as Carlucci and
Kirkpatrick will have an impact on congressional Republicans, many
of whom have been more influenced by the isolationist strain in
their party in recent years. A number of GOP lawmakers have been
highly critical of the Kosovo operation, arguing that the United
States should not be meddling in a civil war in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci said he had not advised Republicans in Congress.
Kirkpatrick noted that a number of Republicans, including former
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, have argued for military action
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Republican position on this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts calling for the use of ground troops were Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department official, and William Howard
Taft IV, former deputy secretary of defense and U.S. ambassador to
NATO.

A PILGRIM'S PERILS IN AN ANCESTOR OF B-MOVIES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Pilgrim's Progress,'' written in 17th-century England by a
Puritan preacher named John Bunyan, is a book many people have
heard of but few have read. Yet it was, along with the Bible, one
of the runaway best sellers in America before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story in two parts. The first was completed while Bunyan
was in prison for his dissident religious beliefs and describes the
journey of a man named Christian from the worldly City of
Destruction to the Celestial City, or Heaven. The sequel, published
years later, concerns the less pioneering tour of the same terrain
by the protagonist's wife, Christiana.
</P>
<P>
   Both excursions are a mix of character-building adventure and
leisurely travelogue. Both are written in a straightforward style,
with allegorical characters ( Worldy-Wiseman, Mercy, Lord Hategood)
and homely metaphors sprinkled like raisins in a pudding. And both
have the essential ingredients of fairy tales: goblins and spirits,
exotic locales, spine-chilling dangers and heroic acts of
derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   References to Bunyan linger on in American culture. Two of them
can be found on any newsstand: the magazine titles Vanity Fair and
House Beautiful are lifted straight from his book. And the story
itself, ``a psychological drama of salvation,'' as the art
historian Perry Miller described it, played an important role in
shaping a young country's self-image.
</P>
<P>
   The book no doubt had resonance in colonial America, where a
perilous wilderness and a Promised Land were immediate realities.
But it was during the early 19th century, when the wilderness was
all but gone, Westward expansion was under way, and a wave of
Protestant revivalism, charged with millenarian urgency, was in the
air, that ``Pilgrim's Progress'' caught the popular imagination,
and even generated an entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s and 40s, the book appeared in countless editions,
some lavishly bound, others produced on the cheap, with streamlined
text for easy reading. It was illustrated in penny prints, but also
in paintings by leading artists like Thomas Cole and Daniel
Huntington. But perhaps it's most accessible form was the moving
panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Such panoramas are often described as early versions of motion
pictures, and so they were. Shown to paying audiences in theaters
and church halls, they consisted of long strips of cloth painted
with sequential scenes. Attached to vertical hand-cranked spools,
the cloth was unrolled horizontally behind a proscenium, to the
accompaniment of sound effects and live commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these productions were quickie jobs turned out by hacks.
But in 1850 in Manhattan, a ``Pilgrim's Progress'' panorama was
created that had the cachet of an art-house film. Not only was it
executed by academically trained painters, but it included scenes
designed by Huntington and by rising art-world stars like Frederic
Edwin Church and Jasper Cropsey. The result was a smash hit so
successful that a road show edition was quickly whipped up to
travel the country.
</P>
<P>
   Few panoramas have survived, and the ``Pilgrim's Progress''
versions were assumed to have vanished, worn out from use or
discarded once their vogue had passed. Then in 1995, the traveling
edition was discovered at the York Institute Museum in Saco,
Mainee, where it had been hidden away in storage for almost
century.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was sent to the Williamstown Art Conservation
Center in Massachusetts for restoration. And about a third of its
1,200-foot length is now on view through May 2 at the Montclair Art
Museum in New Jersey, in an exhibition organized by Gail Stavitsky
and Diane P. Fischer of the museum, Tom Hardiman of the York
Institute and Kevin Avery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   A long-lost masterpiece of American art it's not. Meant to be
seen from a distance and in motion, the painting is done in the
broad-brushed, shorthand manner of a stage drop, and its figurative
style, much of it lifted from book illustrations, is bland. Yet as
an example of the melding of moral thought and popular art at a
particular moment in American history, the panorama is an valuable
and complex document.
</P>
<P>
   The sections on view at Montclair, wrapped floor to ceiling
around the walls of two galleries, begin well into the book, with
Christian escaping from the prison of Giant Despair. The panorama's
basic dramatis personae are in place: the hero dressed in Prince
Valiant armor; his blond male sidekick, Hopeful, in mustard yellow;
and, in the character of Despair, one of the several dark-skinned,
Incredible Hulk-ish villains they will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, high action alternates with pastoral repose.
Episodes illustrating ``The Fight With Apollyon'' (not included at
Montclair and in storage in Saco, Maine.) and ``The Fate of the
Apostate'' (which is on view) are monster-movie-style
extravaganzas. But in the scene where the pilgrims, looking a bit
like government surveyors, view the Celestial City from the top of
Mt. Clear, it is the wide expanse of open land and
pink-and-lavender sky that catches the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, in fact, spiritual drama is expressed through
landscape. In the lush, Edenic ``Land of Beulah,'' figures are all
but absent. The design for this sequence is thought to be by Jasper
Crospey. Both he and Church were already leading lights in what
came to be known as the Hudson River School. And their
contributions to the panorama make explicit the religious and
ideological underpinnings of much of the painting produced by that
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Beulah, in Cropsey's hands, is a familiar Catskill landscape of
mountains and fertile valleys, with the Hudson winding its way in
the distance. But here, upstate has turned transcendent. Jumbo
flowers in psychedelic colors fill the foreground; tiny angels, no
more than calligraphic scribbles, hover like Christmas ornaments on
high; an immense cross glows in the center of a refulgent sunset.
American nature and divinity are one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The depiction of Beulah, in fact, closely prefigures one of
Crospey's later paintings ``The Millennial Age'' (1854), with its
apocalyptic melange of lions, lilies and lambs. And the sentimental
piety of the scene saturates the second half of the panorama
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here the setting shifts to a Middle Eastern ``Holy Land'' of
fertile oases. The main characters are women and children. Picnics
outnumber battles. And although there are moments of tension _
including the rescue of all and sundry from the Valley of the
Shadow of Death by a strapping Roman centurion type _ gentility
prevails. It is in this section that a copy of Daniel Huntington's
1841 ``Mercy's Dream'' appears, one of the best-known pictures of
its day. And the whole story ends with Christiana and her party
ascending to their technicolor reward.
</P>
<P>
   But then, examples of moral uplift were everywhere in American
culture of the time, and Bunyanesque allegory was often used to
express them. One sees this at work in Thomas Cole's unfinished
painting series titled ``The Cross and the World'' (1845-46), two
oil sketches for which are included in the Montclair show.
</P>
<P>
   Riffs on Bunyan run throughout didactic literature. A book
titled ``Pilgrim's Progress in the Last Days'' published in the
1840s was an antislavery tract with a protagonist named Christian
Abolition. Another, titled ``The Pilgrim's Progress in the 19th
Century,'' was both a vehement reformist diatribe and a how-to for
stage-managing religious revival movements. A third, ``The
California Pilgrim,'' was set during the gold rush and combined
travel brochure descriptions of the far west with scathing accounts
of the iniquities of life in frontier towns.
</P>
<P>
   Bunyan's Everyman metaphor even found its way into the work of
some of the era's best writers. Notions of pilgrimage and progress
_ minus overt religiosity but infused with spiritual grandeur _ are
at the heart of Walt Whitman's great poem ``Song of Myself''
(1855). ``I tramp a perpetual journey,'' the poem reads, ``My signs
are a rainproof coat, good shoes and a staff cut from the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Whitman was writing, ``Pilgrim's Progress'' had lost
much of its status as edifying literature and was regarded
primarily as fiction. That's surely how many people in the New York
audiences in 1850 approached the panorama: as improving fun of a
kind that Disney specialized in a century later. And given its
``Fantasia'' flowers and ``Night on Bald Mountain'' atmospherics,
one is inclined to view the fragment at Montclair that way today.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pilgrim's Progress'' embodies a cultural history worth
remembering. Its narrative of a righteous journey through the
wilderness to stake a claim on a piece of Paradise was part of the
American foundation myth, one of struggle and entitlement, in which
ideas of divine mission, national destiny and nostalgia for the
past merged.
</P>
<P>
   The story's plain style _ hymnbook sonorities and folk-tale
flatness _ matched a nation's ``no-frills'' democratic self-image.
And its division of the world into clear-cut forces of good and bad
was suited to an American temperament unwilling or unable to deal
comfortably with the shades of moral ambiguity or paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the polarities of cautionary pessimism and spiritual
utopianism that sit at the very heart of Bunyan's tale are still
alive in America, though often difficult to sort out. They account
for both the most conservative and the most progressive aspects of
our culture, popular and otherwise, as the heaven-and-hell struggle
for a national soul that consumed the country in the 1960s
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bunyan's spirit seems to have survived primarily in
literature (where it began), we can also still detect its presence
in some of our century's art. In 1961, the Abstract Expressionist
painter Clyfford Still described his life in these words: ``It was
a journey that one must make, walking straight and alone. No
respites or shortcuts were permitted. And one's will had to hold
out against every challenge of triumph, or failure, or the praise
of Vanity Fair. Until one has crossed the darkened and wasted
valleys and come at last into clear air and could stand on a high
and limitless plain. Imagination, no longer fettered by the laws of
fear, became as one with vision.''

   Abstract Expressionism may not spring immediately to mind when
looking at the often maladroit, feature-length painting strung
around the gallery walls at the Montclair Art Museum. But the
colossalist impulse and driven idealism in American art, from
Church to Pollock, is certainly discernable here and is well worth
pondering. The rediscovered panorama may be little more than a
cultural artifact, but it is also, for better and for worse, a
mirror of ourselves.

<P>
   We had planned to remodel our home at some point.
</P>
<P>
   You know how things get after a few years with a growing family.
The paint is covered with fingerprints.MDNM/ and the carpet is
permanently stained. It's inevitable that a home that's truly lived
in will suffer wear and tear. However, I had hoped to remodel our
house all at once instead of slowly, piece by piece. But every time
I turn around, something else is broken and has to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   This week it was a light fixture. I had gone upstairs to water
the plants. When I walked into my son's room, I noticed that
something seemed odd. I couldn't put my finger on it until I
started to walk out and realized that one side of the room was much
brighter than the other. I looked up at the ceiling and discovered
that one of those glass deals on the ceiling fan was smashed. I
don't know exactly what they're called, but I know that they don't
self-destruct. There wasn't a micron of glass on the floor, either,
and the thing had been turned so that the side with the most damage
was facing the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known something was up when I heard my son
vacuuming last Thursday. It's hard enough to get him to do chores
on Saturday, but voluntary vacuuming in the middle of the week?
Yes, I should have run for the nearest exit right then.
</P>
<P>
   So I summoned little Benson and inquired about the damaged
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What light?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one,'' I said pointing at the offending glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's broken?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's broken, and I'm sure that you broke it because this
is your room and someone cleaned up the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Dad cleaned it up.''
</P>
<P>
   I noticed that he didn't go so far as to say that his father had
broken the light, but he was definitely stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shall we call Dad and ask him? He's watching the playoffs, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Don't call him! Hmmm, let me think. Yes, I guess it did
accidentally get broken one day when I was playing with my brother.
It's kind of his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does your brother have to do with this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he wanted to see me do this trick with my yo-yo, and
when it went up into the air, it hit the light and broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you tell someone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were real busy making a grocery list or something and Dad
was washing his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you tell us later?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how much it costs to repair a hole in a sofa
cushion? Do you have any idea what damage a spoon in the garbage
disposal can do? Just try to repair a rip in the wallpaper.MDNM/
and make it look as good as new.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. I dare you.
</P>
<P>
   The really bad news is that I only have a few more years until
my children leave me to go seek their fates in the great big world.
That's the sudden plot twist in every parent's life.
</P>
<P>
   We all know you can replace a light fixture.

`COOKIE'S FORTUNE' FEELS LIKE TIME WELL-SPENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 2 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casual is the word for Robert Altman's latest
ensemble comedy, ``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a murder mystery with no murder (nor, for that matter, any
mystery) set in a tiny Mississippi town. What little plot there is
here is just window dressing; the whole enterprise is just one big
excuse for a bunch of fine actors to run Dixie riffs off of one
another, which some do more successfully than others.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be Altman's least-demanding film, and perhaps
his most pleasant. The director's infamous misanthropy is reserved
for just a few of the eccentric characters that sprout like kudzu
in this particular corner of the Delta, and those unfortunates'
primary sin is the pretty venial one of pretentiousness. The vast
majority of sleepy Holly Springs' residents are showered with
directorial affection, which results in a film that's consistently
amusing but rarely very involving.
</P>
<P>
   Top performance nods go to Charles S. Dutton, Julianne Moore,
the legendary Patricia Neal and the surprisingly natural Liv Tyler.
Dutton plays Willis Richland, a likable middle-age guy with a taste
for Wild Turkey and no fixed profession. He does, however, take
excellent care of the town's wealthiest widow, Jewel Mae ``Cookie''
Orcutt (Neal), with whom he also enjoys a warm, almost mother-son
kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cookie misses her departed husband big time, and in an
Easter eve funk takes her own life. The body is discovered by her
snooty, low-rent Blanche DuBois of a niece Camille (Glenn Close,
overacting), who by some dubious plot logic thinks it's important
for the family's reputation to make the death look like a murder
rather than a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Camille easily convinces her slow-witted sister Cora Duvall
(Moore) to go along with the ruse, since Cora's limited brain power
already is overloaded with the demands of her leading role in
``Salome,'' a travesty of which Camille is directing down at the
Presbyterian church.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking anything else that resembles a suspect, the local
sheriffs (Ned Beatty and Danny Darst) arrest Willis, though they
know that their fishing buddy couldn't possibly be guilty. Cora's
daughter Emma (Tyler), recently returned to town after some
semi-illegal activity in Biloxi, knows her pal Willis is innocent,
too; she demands to be arrested for unpaid parking tickets so she
can keep Willis company in his unlocked cell. As a bonus, Emma's
former flame Jason (Chris O'Donnell) looks good in his new deputy
uniform and is working the station's holiday skeleton shift.
</P>
<P>
   More characters wend their way through the leisurely
proceedings, none to any particular effect beyond adding a wry note
or two. There's some good music at a nearby blues joint (former
Eurythmic Dave Stewart provided the unobtrusive, rootsy score),
something is kind of said about race relations in the New South,
fun is made of Oscar Wilde, and fish-catching techniques are
discussed at length.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it often seems like the whole film has gone fishing,
that the camera was left on with a few actors in front of it with
no one around to shape what went on. But like a pleasant afternoon
wasted away by the creek, ``Cookie's Fortune'' has an easeful,
lollygagging way about it. It feels like time well-spent
accomplishing next to nothing.

 &HT;    Blue Note tour a bold showcase
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Promising jazz musicians can find themselves caught in
a weird double whammy. Here's a signature American art form with
nearly a century of history behind it, a history of innovation.
Here also is a music that has, especially since the 1980s, fostered
a cult of youth that, lacking mastery, has often merely recycled
what came before.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bind that mainstream jazz has finally begun to wriggle
out of, as each new year seems to herald another generation of
talents sprung from late-night jam sessions or conservatories, high
school bands or intensive apprenticeships with more established
players. These musicians can't help but be mindful of tradition.
What's different is their commitment to sounding as much like
themselves as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a fairly bold promotional move, Blue Note, the legendary jazz
label that celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, has
dispatched some of these musicians on a 20-city tour, one that
deliberately avoids jazz venues in favor of ``alternative'' sites
such as the Echo Lounge in East Atlanta, where they'll perform
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the threshold of another creative cycle,'' says Greg
Osby, the 38-year-old alto saxophonist who has welcomed several of
these players into his bands. He's the elder statesman on what Blue
Note has dubbed its ``New Directions'' tour, which also features
vibraphonist Stefon Harris, 25; tenor saxophonist Mark Shim, 23;
and pianist Jason Moran, 24. (Bassist Tarus Mateen, well-known to
local audiences, and drummer Nasheet Waits complete the sextet.
Unlike the others, however, they have no new or recent Blue Note
releases to tout.) ``We had endured this impasse throughout the
'90s where people were riding the wave, people coasting on their
reputations and not offering anything dynamically conceptual.''
</P>
<P>
   Osby, whose 20-year career has ranged from stints with Dizzy
Gillespie to co-founding the Brooklyn M-BASE collective in the
1980s, always has been one to whittle an edge: whether attempting
to fuse jazz with hip-hop or capturing his latest album, the
spirited ``Banned in New York,'' on a mini-disk recorder during a
club date. If Osby often felt like he was thrashing amid a stasis,
he doesn't anymore. ``I'm seeing it on all sides,'' he says of the
surge. ``You go into these little clubs, see these new arrivals to
New York at little jam sessions. These cats are really burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for many potential fans, the heat can feel mighty distant.
``The touring circuit is dead,'' says Tom Evered, general manager
and vice president of Blue Note. ``Jazz musicians traditionally
made a living on the road because record sales can hardly be
considered a source of income.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true: Jazz accounts for about 3 percent of total domestic
record sales. Radio stations that play mainstream jazz, such as
Atlanta's WCLK-FM (91.9) and WREK-FM (91.1), tend to be
noncommercial.
</P>
<P>
   But artists such as Harris, perhaps the most widely noticed
up-and-comer on the New York scene, project an articulate
confidence. ``I'm not a person to record a bunch of standards.
There's no point in rewriting the same book over and over,'' says
the Albany, N.Y., native, who debuted on Blue Note with last year's
``A Cloud of Red Dust'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best approach to dealing with Dexter Gordon,'' he adds,
referring to the influential tenor saxophonist, one of the most
romantic players to pick up a horn, ``is don't do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's spring, the world is mud-luscious and the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra _ along with every other orchestra in the land _
sighs and pays its annual lip service to the pre-Mozart repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But it offers a twist this season in the person of Nicholas
McGegan, its British-born guest conductor for a program of Baroque
_ or ``ba-ROCK,'' as he pronounces it _ music.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been put off by the parade of penguins on the ASO
podium this season, take heart. McGegan, 49, is not a contender to
replace music director Yoel Levi. He likes what he does just fine,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Short, spry and puckish, with thinning blond hair, sharp eyes
behind gold-rimmed specs and an irreverent sense of humor, he's
also a jack-of-all-trades.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few works by Bach and Handel that have made it into
the standard repertory, music before 1750 is still a scholar's
field. In addition to being a conductor, McGegan is a researcher,
an editor, a translator and a storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a flutist, he also plays (and conducts from) the
keyboard, and he can turn his hand to other tasks. After his first
rehearsal with the ASO this week, he took a few sheets of music
manuscript paper back to his hotel, intending to rewrite the
timpani part.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this stuff,'' he said, ``the composers don't give you
much.''
</P>
<P>
   McGegan conducts Philharmonia Baroque, a San Francisco orchestra
that specializes in music from 1725 to 1800. With 50 subscription
concerts a year, it is the third-busiest orchestra in California.
It tours widely and records prolifically (on BMG).
</P>
<P>
   When McGegan took over Philharmonia Baroque in 1985, it was in
its ``Berkeley-Birkenstock'' mode: earnest, threadbare, resolute.
Fourteen years later, it has become -- after several English groups
_ the best-known ensemble of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   McGegan's cheerful presumption of interest is one of his most
marketable assets. When he works, as he often does these days, with
full symphony orchestras, he walks in without that early-music
attitude. ``I'm remarkably dogma free,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with today's musicians far more likely than their
grandfathers to have played music before Bach's time, they are more
than ready to give him a knowledgeable argument.
</P>
<P>
   His is not a world of quirky tunings, gut (instead of metal)
strings, clickety clavichords or illegible scores scratched out by
genuine 18th-century quill pens. McGegan comes armed with scores
and parts rewritten by Finale, a computer program for musical
notation.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise ASO flutist Amy Porter, whom he'll accompany in a
concerto by C.P.E. Bach, will play her own silver flute, not an
authentic wooden one from a collection of archaic instruments.
</P>
<P>
   About the only difference the ASO audience will notice is that
there will be fewer musicians onstage than it's used to seeing:
about 25, give or take a couple. That's to preserve clarity and
precision _ ``Otherwise it all begins to sound like Barbara
Walters,'' he said _ in a hall that was not designed with baroque
music in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think that modern orchestras could play this
music,'' he said, ``then I wouldn't conduct modern orchestras. . .
. And if the orchestra's not having fun, there's not much hope for
the audience, really.''

<P>
   &QR;  ``Music for the Royal Fireworks'' (George Frideric Handel).

   ``There's a connection,'' McGegan says. ``These works were both
written to celebrate the same peace treaty: the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle,'' which ended the War of the Austrian Succession
in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fireworks were a big fiasco _ they all blew up at once _
but luckily it was at the beginning of the program so everyone had
to sit down and listen to the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera acknowledges the recent treaty by presenting a battle
of gods and Titans. ``It's basically in favor of world peace,''
says the conductor, ``as are we all.''

 &HT;    With 218 beers on tap, the just opened Toco Mac in Cumming, Ga.
may be the largest draft beer emporium in the world
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The red-and-white sign would lead you to think it's
another Tex-Mex hash house. Taco Mac, it says, and beneath that a
claim about the wings. You can get tacos and you can get wings, and
connoisseurs of the latter delicacy give it four stars.
</P>
<P>
   But wings and tacos weren't the only reasons people were waiting
in line for an hour _ and then another hour for food to arrive _
when Taco Mac opened in Cumming last month. Many, perhaps most, had
come because it's the Taj Mahal of draft beer.
</P>
<P>
   From one end of the gleaming wood and brass bar to the other are
218 tap handles, and fittings are in place for 10 more. They
stretch almost 40 feet, one row atop another, like exotic birds on
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   In fast-growing Forsyth County, Andy Klubock has built what is
perhaps the largest draft beer emporium in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a record to me,'' says David Edgar, director of
the Institute for Brewing Studies in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The only competitor, says Tom Dalldorf, editor and publisher of
Celebrator Beer News, could be The Yard House in Long Beach,
Calif., but its 250 taps include many duplicates of the same beer.
Remove the duplicates, manager Peter Carney says, and the Yard
House only has 186 beers on draft.
</P>
<P>
   Only? K-2, at 28,250 feet, touches the clouds, but still looks
up to Mount Everest. At the lower ranges, a few multi-tap pubs in
such beer meccas as Denver, San Francisco and Seattle might have
upward of 100 selections. But Klubock's two other Taco Mac
locations, one in Snellville and another in Sandy Springs, already
top those with 120 each.
</P>
<P>
   Now those are in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I want 228 taps just to say I have the biggest in
the world, but that's not true,'' says Klubock. ``I want to give
people variety.''
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder how much variety a person wants _ or how much a
pub can adequately take care of. Once tapped, a keg of beer has a
shelf life of perhaps two weeks, three at the most. Beyond that,
the beer is no longer fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd prefer to see a somewhat smaller, well-chosen
selection,'' says Jim Dorsch, a beer writer based in Alexandria,
Va., ``Forty or 50 beers that were truly excellent would suit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Klubock bristles if you ask how he can keep 228 draft beers
fresh. ``We keep strict records of when each keg is tapped and when
the lines are cleaned,'' he says. ``If a beer doesn't move, it's
gone.'' He also insists that some breweries, whose beer might not
sell as rapidly as better known brands, ship him smaller kegs.
</P>
<P>
   But even Klubock's critics _ and he has them _ give him his due:
No one has done more to educate Atlantans about the many styles of
beer, from assertive pilsners to hoppy India Pale Ales to robust
porters and stouts. Klubock is passionate about beer as art and
craft, and wants Americans to know it's part of their history:
``The Founding Fathers were home brewers, you know. Apparently,
George Washington put out a pretty good porter.''
</P>
<P>
   For Europeans, beer is still an agricultural product that's part
of daily life, not a label or an ad line. ``They live much closer
to the product,'' Klubock says. ``In Germany, every region has its
own beer, and they're all different. We don't have that here. We've
standardized it to where it has no character.''
</P>
<P>
   Klubock seeks out individualistic beers that have fervent
followings elsewhere _ the 17 Rogue beers in his lineup, for
example, or Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale and the companion Hop Pocket
Pils _ and gives them a chance to make it in a local market
dominated by industry giants Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Coors.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a glass of Bud Light, Taco Mac will sell you a glass
of Bud Light. But if you want a Schneider Aventinus from Munich, it
will sell you that, too. Or it will sell you a glass of Bruegel
Amber Ale from Belgium, Rogue Shakespeare Stout from Newport, Ore.,
or Fuller's Extra Special Bitter from London. There are beers from
13 countries (and 16 states), all sitting in silver kegs in a
cooler that's set at 38 degrees Fahrenheit, each keg hooked to a
tap handle by a short plastic hose (''It's the only restaurant in
the country where the cooler was built first and everything else
was built around it,'' Klubock says).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you people haven't been buying Bud or
Miller, because some have,'' he says. ``And that's fine with me. I
just want people to try different beers, something they didn't know
before. This is my calling.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul was struck on the road to Damascus. Andy Klubock, who's
39, was struck at some point while studying political science and
history at Emory University. A native of Newton, Mass., he began
working at a Taco Mac in Virginia Highland in 1982 and took over
management of the Sandy Springs location on Roswell Road in 1990.
Three years later he opened a Taco Mac in Snellville.
</P>
<P>
   Both quickly became houses of worship for beer lovers, and not
just those from Atlanta. Klubock counts among his patrons a dentist
in Birmingham, Ala., and a psychotherapist from South Carolina who
make periodic visits to Atlanta, checking into a nearby motel for
the weekend to sample the variety and drink beer they could find
nowhere else in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, when the brewmaster of the renowned Pilsner
Urquell, the original pilsner beer, visited the United States two
years ago, he made a point of dropping by Taco Mac in Sandy
Springs. Even in the Czech Republic, brewers know who the opinion
leaders are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very good at selling myself, but I can sell beer night
and day,'' Klubock says. ``I haven't taken a vacation in 15 years
that didn't involve visiting a brewery.'' He has visited more than
300 breweries here and abroad. Last year he traveled to monasteries
in Belgium and Holland, watching Trappist monks make beer and then
staying for vespers.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask him why he opened the world's biggest draft bar
in Cumming, a town of 4,400, he answers, ``Because I'm a
missionary, that's why.'' He leaves it to them to figure out the
northward movement of commerce and the growth in Forsyth County.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that he is a missionary. Put a brown robe on
him and he could pass for Brother Dominic, the sly friar in the old
TV ad who found it easier to photocopy the abbey's sacred texts
than labor over them by hand. He believes people will try something
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were telling me people don't drink good beer, and I'm
here to tell you they do,'' he said a few days after Taco Mac
opened. The first keg that sold out was Hoegaarden White Ale, a
delicate, spiced beer from Belgium. It wasn't long before Sierra
Nevada Pale Ale, a benchmark in the new generation of American
craft beers, also sold out. And, oh yes, Bud Light was doing well,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a starvation for it up here,'' Roger Perkins
said. On a Saturday evening, Perkins waited in line while his wife,
Barbara, stood outside comforting a hungry 16-month-old. The
Perkinses are home builders and home brewers who moved to Forsyth
from Fulton County two years ago, and now they no longer had to
drive back to Sandy Springs to explore the wide world of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon Tuesday, Mark Fitzgerald, a sales representative for
Guinness, sat at the bar in an immaculate white dress shirt and
paisley tie. ``Where next, Andy? South Carolina ?'' he asked as a
plate of tacos and a pint of Guinness _ what else? _ were set
before him.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the polished bar, Brother Andrew nodded not very meekly
and said, ``Where there's bad beer, I'll go next.''

   MAKE MINE MEDIUM-RARE
</P>
<P>
   Women who eat their hamburgers, steaks and bacon very well-done
may be putting themselves at higher risk for breast cancer,
according to a recent study reported in the ``Mayo Clinic Women's
HealthSource''.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 women and concluded that women
who eat all their meat very well-done, even charred, have a breast
cancer risk more than four times greater than those who like their
meat rare or medium.
</P>
<P>
   Substances known as ``heterocyclic amines'' are suspected as the
cause. The substances form when meat is fried, grilled or broiled
at very high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, researchers were unable to show that eating
greater amounts of very well-done meat increased the breast cancer
risk. How much meat the women ate did not make a difference, they
said, only how well it was cooked.
</P>
<P>
   BIASED PYRAMID?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend two to three servings of dairy
products daily for every American even though the majority of
African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanic Americans and American
Indians are lactose-intolerant, the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine pointed out at a news conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali and a contingency of doctors led by former Surgeons
General Joycelyn Elders and C. Everett Koop said they are seeking
to rid federal diet guidelines of old racial biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidelines don't do enough to help prevent the many
chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and
hypertension, that take a disproportionate toll among minorities,''
says Dr. Neal D. Barnard, PCRM president. ``To help reduce our risk
of serious disease, the guidelines need to more vigorously promote
low-fat and vegetarian diets rich in vegetables and fruits.''
</P>
<P>
   MILD EXERCISE FOR HEART PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   Moderate physical activity _ not bed rest _ seems to be the best
medicine for individuals who suffer from ``stable'' congestive
heart failure, according to a study conducted by researchers in
Italy and the United States and reported in the latest issue of
``Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals with congestive heart failure who participated in an
exercise program lived longer and required fewer hospitalizations
during four years of follow-up than those who did not exercise.
</P>
<P>
   CHF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for people 65
and older. It is the only form of heart disease that is increasing,
with about 400,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
</P>
<P>
   The hearts of CHF patients no longer pump blood efficiently
throughout the body, and the patients typically have difficulty
breathing during exercise because of fluid accumulating in the
lungs.

COURT WEIGHS WHETHER STATE WORKERS CAN SUE USING FEDERAL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could affect state workers around
the country, the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about a
dispute pitting the state of Maine against a group of probation
officers over time-and-a-half pay.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision in the case, which is expected in
June, could define how vulnerable state governments are to being
sued when they violate someone's federally protected rights.
</P>
<P>
   The state-employed probation officers sued Maine in 1992 in
federal court, saying they were owed the extra pay guaranteed by a
federal labor law.
</P>
<P>
   But while their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 in another case that the Constitution's 11th Amendment, which
limits the judicial power of the federal government, shields states
from being sued against their will in federal court. The U.S.
District Court then dismissed the probation officers' suit, and
they refiled it in state court, still depending on the federal law,
known as the Fair Labor Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   However, a year later a Maine Superior Court in Cumberland ruled
that the 11th Amendment makes states immune from state court
lawsuits that would be barred in federal courts. The court also
said that the 11th Amendment makes a state totally immune from
being sued by employees who allege labor-law violations, although
it said federal labor officials still could sue the state seeking
to make it enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court agreed with that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday, Laurence Gold,
representing the probation officers, urged the justices to allow
his clients to file their lawsuit in state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state must be bound by federal law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold was supported by the Clinton administration. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman told the justices that because lawsuits against
states are now generally barred from federal court, citizens need
state courts to protect their federal rights. Waxman said that
without the option of going to a state court, a citizen's federal
rights might as well be ``written in disappearing ink.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``State courts may not deny a federal right absent a
valid excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maine Solicitor Peter Brann said the Constitution ``clearly
immunized states from being sued in their own courts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if a state violates a federal law, citizens may
bring their case to federal officials who may then sue the state in
federal court to enforce the law. ``The law still applies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the arguments, the justices struggled over how to
balance states' sovereignty against the federal government's power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent rulings over the issue, the court has split 5-4 with
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas
prevailing in favor of the states.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday it again appeared that the conservative justices
were again siding with the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying states are not sovereign where federal law is
concerned,'' Scalia told Waxman. ``What if there was a federal law
allowing the federal government to raid state treasuries?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said it was ``hard to conceive the founding fathers
believed states could be sued in their own courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But later in the arguments, Justice Stephen Breyer told Brann
that ``if you prevail, we're going to get some kind of hodgepodge
... of enforcement of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Maine case, the court has agreed to decide three
other states-rights issues within the next year. The questions are
whether states may be sued for patent infringement and for
violating a federal false-advertising law and whether state
employees may sue over alleged violations of the federal law
banning age bias in the workplace.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Javier Solana Madariaga, the
secretary-general of NATO, is running the biggest air operation the
alliance has carried out in its 50 years of existence. This is the
same man who opposed Spain's entry into the organization as a young
Socialist opposition politician in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never planned my life,'' Solana, a 56-year-old former
foreign minister, said with a laugh in his office this week at NATO
headquarters, just outside Brussels, as the allied bombing of
Yugoslavia entered its second week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life, and the wind of life, have taken me places I never
thought I'd be,'' he mused, in fluent if sometimes heavily accented
English. ``Look at me: I'm a theoretical physicist!'' he said, to
prove the point.
</P>
<P>
   He looks the part, dressing casually in black loafers, with
rimless glasses, and sporting a sparse, salt-and-pepper beard and
mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Solana has a Ph.D. in solid-state physics and, after graduate
study at the University of Virginia in the 1960s, became a
professor of physics at the Complutense University in Madrid in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   But politics has always been his true vocation; he likes to
describe himself as a social democrat rather than a socialist. Born
in Madrid on July 14, 1942, under the fascist dictatorship of
Generalissimo Francisco Franco, Solana quickly became a
troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Spain's underground Socialist Party in 1964, a year
after being expelled from the university where he later returned to
teach, because he had been active in youth organizations opposed to
the Franco regime. His older brother, Luis, was jailed for similar
activities while Javier was still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a European, and I come from a country that has suffered
very much in its history this century from a civil war,'' Solana
said, with images of Albanian civilians fleeing Kosovo on the
television screen in his spacious office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say very clearly that we cannot live together with
people in Europe who behave in this manner at the end of the 20th
century,'' he said, referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. ``The great frustration I've had in dealing with the
Balkans is a good number of leaders are people with their heads
turned to the past, not to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With his own head firmly turned to the future, Solana met Felipe
Gonzalez, a charismatic young Spanish Socialist leader, in the
early 1970s, when the party was still a clandestine organization.
When Spain established a constitutional monarchy with an elected
legislature after Franco's death in 1975, Gonzalez led the
Socialist opposition out into the open, with Solana at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gonzalez was elected prime minister in 1982, Solana
opposed conservative attempts to establish a close military
relationship with the United States. The future leader of NATO
opposed the presence of U.S. military bases in Spain and, after a
conservative Spanish government negotiated Spain's entry into the
North Atlantic Alliance just before the Socialists' election
victory in 1982, he opposed that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, the Socialists changed their minds. Solana then
played an important role in organizing a referendum in 1986
endorsing the participation of Spain in the alliance if it kept its
forces out of NATO's integrated military structure. Solana was
Spanish minister of culture from 1982 to 1988, and for the last
three years of that period also served as chief government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   After four years as minister of education and science from 1988
to 1992, Solana became foreign minister after the unexpected death
of Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, who helped organize the
groundbreaking Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Solana's summons to Brussels came at the end of 1995, after
Willy Claes, the secretary-general at the time, was indicted in a
Belgian military-procurement and bribery scandal stemming from his
years as a Socialist Party leader. The United States and its
European allies clashed over two other candidates, and Solana was
the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary-general, Solana has presided over the post-Cold-War
transformation of the alliance, including the political decisions
to send 60,000 peacekeepers into Bosnia, just after he took office,
and to take in three formerly Communist countries, the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary, at a summit meeting in Madrid in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now Solana presides over daily and often contentious meetings of
the 19-member North Atlantic Council to oversee the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The council gave him authority at the end of January to decide,
after consulting with President Clinton and other allied leaders,
to give the go-ahead to NATO's top military commander, U.S. Gen.
Wesley K. Clark.
</P>
<P>
   He took that step on March 23. Now his main job, another
military officer said, is to keep the allies in line. He has done
so with diplomacy and an easygoing, informal backslapping style
that many NATO diplomats credit with maintaining the fragile
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombing eventually succeeds in bringing peace to Kosovo,
Solana will be a hero in Spain, where he could run for prime
minister in elections that are to be held by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, he will be among the first political casualties,
close behind the alliance's relationship with Moscow that he has
tried to nurture despite Russia's opposition to the bombing. ``We
may fail, or not achieve 100 percent,'' he said with a shrug. ``But
we have shown we have the will to try.''
</P>
<P>
   His family life, he conceded two years ago, has suffered from
his work; his wife, Concepcion Gimenez, whom he met as a student in
the United States, lives in Madrid, where she works, with their
daughter, Vega, and son, Diego, while Solana commutes every weekend
or two from Brussels. But now, he said, he lives mainly in his
office.

PRODUCERS OF OLIVE OIL NOT IN IT FOR THE PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OLIVE-ETIQUETTE-NYTR) 
(rk) 
 By   TIM TESCONI and MIRIAM SILVER   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Olive trees can't compete with wine grapes
when it comes to profits, but that isn't stopping a growing cadre
of hobbyists, grape growers and corporate millionaires determined
to make olive oil from Northern California as well-known as the
area's finest wines.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to olives and the precious oil they yield, there's
more passion than profit among Wine Country producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the money. It's the romance of rebuilding an
old industry that was once so important in Sonoma County,'' said
Sonoma Valley vineyard manager Philip Coturri, who runs an olive
tree nursery in Sonoma and makes an olive oil marketed under his
family's Poggiolo label.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, only three California producers made small
batches of fine olive oil. Today, oils under more than 50 different
labels _ the majority of them from Northern California _ are
pressed or extracted in more than 14 mills.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, thousands of Italian varietal olive trees have
been planted in Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Marin counties by
landowners lured by the romance of recreating a touch of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As an industry, olive oil has little economic impact _ the value
of last year's crop in Sonoma and Marin counties probably does not
even approach $1 million. But it gets star billing among the
image-conscious who see the area as the nation's premier wine and
food region.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end premium olive oils sell for $20 to $50 and showing
up in New York restaurants and boutique groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in cultivating California olive trees and fine oil
include Ed Stolman, the creator of the Dove ice cream bar; Ridgley
Evers, who made a fortune designing computer software for Intuit,
and Nan McEvoy, the 79-year-old San Francisco Chronicle publishing
heiress whose west Marin County ranch is the largest purveyor of
estate-grown, extra virgin olive oil in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appetite for olive oil in this country is insatiable,
especially after all the press about how good olive oil is for
you,'' Stolman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, more than 3,000 acres of olive trees
were planted and then dwindled away. Today, some 400 acres in Napa
and Sonoma counties remain from those days and about 200 more acres
have been planted in the last decade, says Sonoma County
horticultural adviser Paul Vossen, an expert on olive production.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 13 olive oil growers, hobbyists and wineries bought a
half-million-dollar olive press from Italy, set up The Olive Press
in Glen Ellen, and are in the second year of processing their own
olives. They are increasing the number of olives coming into
production at wineries and country estates.
</P>
<P>
   Wineries such as B.R. Cohn are harvesting olives and pressing or
buying their own oil, labeling it ``estate-bottled'' and selling it
in their gift shops for up to $50 alongside premium cabernets and
silk-screened logo sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Other wineries such as Iron Horse and Jordan, which are not open
to the public, are pressing their own oil to cultivate the fine
food and wine image they already enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest in olive oil, however, is not matched by
financial success. Land is expensive and labor costs are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can earn three or four times more money per acre with
grapes than you can olives,'' Vossen said. Even so, he believes
olives have a place as a supplemental crop for some landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Often the olive trees are planted along driveways or rocky
hillsides that are inhospitable for grapevines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their high profile, the number of olive trees in
Northern California's wine-producing areas are no more than 1
percent of all the olive trees in California. Most California
olives are used for canning olives or ordinary cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   And California itself contributes less than 1 percent of the
world's production, which is led by Spain, followed by Italy and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil entrepreneurs compare their industry to California
wine production 20 to 25 years ago. They say winemakers, obsessed
with quality, proved California could make world-class wines
commanding premium prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Americans consume far less olive oil than their
Mediterranean counterparts, in the past decade olive oil
consumption has risen steadily among the health-conscious. Olive
oil is a cholesterol-free, mono-unsaturated fat. Such fats tend to
lower levels of LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad cholesterol that
causes arteries to clog.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons between olive oil and wine only go so far,
particularly when it comes to consumption, says a leader in the
olive oil industry who has become soured on the economics of olive
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I like a bottle of wine, I will go back and buy a case. If
I like a bottle of olive oil, I will go back a month or two later
and buy a bottle,'' said Ridgley Evers, who beginning with trees
imported from Italy in 1990 has planted more than 4,500 trees on
over 20 acres at Healdsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Evers is one of the most successful people in the California
premium olive oil industry. In 1997, his DaVero Extra Virgin Olive
Oil was the first American olive oil to meet the standards of the
International Olive Oil Council. And it can now legally be labeled
and sold in Europe as extra virgin, alongside the best that comes
from Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, DaVero won a tasting in Italy, beating out top French
and Italian olive oils.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Evers said that knowing what he's learned in the past 10
years, he would not go into the olive oil business if he had it to
do over. Even by charging $17 for a bottle, he is losing money,
Evers said. He believes the only people who will survive in the
olive oil business are those who don't have to make money at it.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper heiress McEvoy is the rising star in California's
olive oil industry, garnering lots of press attention for her olive
oil and the industry. With an estimated worth of more than $350
million, McEvoy is having the time of her life transforming her
550-acre former cattle ranch into America's leading olive oil
estate.
</P>
<P>
   She has imported and planted 11,000 olive trees and bought
expensive olive presses from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Like DaVero, McEvoy's olive oil is a rich, peppery Tuscan-style
oil that, at $15 to $40 a bottle, costs a lot more than most
consumers are used to spending for olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy didn't plan to become an olive grower. She just wanted
some land as a rural retreat for herself and her grandchildren who
live in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A maverick, she didn't want cattle and didn't want to be the
``5,999th'' person to plant wine grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Olives piqued her interest as she recalled visits to Italy when
she would cart home a few gallons of precious extra virgin olive
oil with her.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy says the more competition, the better because it expands
interest in olive oil among consumers. But the hardest part of
making olives go as a viable industry will be convincing Americans
to pay the higher prices for high-end oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously not everybody will like it. And you have to have a
little bit of extra money to want to spend $20 a bottle,'' McEvoy
said. ``But after you know what olive oil tastes like, you develop
a taste.''

   God, Sex and Women of the Bible
</P>
<P>
   By Rabbi Shoni Labowitz
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23
</P>
<P>
   What if women, instead of men, had translated the Old Testament?
</P>
<P>
   With a feminist view, Rabbi Shoni Labowitz demonstrates the
possibilities. Parsing Hebrew words to their roots and turning
letter combinations into acronyms, Labowitz reveals the women of
the Bible in a positive, sympathetic light. Among the matriarchs,
she finds not temptresses, but uncanny women of valor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Eve, traditionally the source of original sin,
emerges as a wife who shares discoveries with her mate. Leah, the
plain sister married to Jacob by a ruse, emerges as victim rather
than victor. She remains overshadowed by her pretty sister, Rachel,
who weds Jacob within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional translation of Numbers 12 depicts Miriam as a
gossip, punished with an attack of leprosy. This book's broad
translation of the passage paints Miriam as a concerned
sister-in-law overcome with God's warmth and light. Although this
analysis seems a stretch, many of Labowitz's interpretations are
sound, and all are intriguing. Altogether, her fresh perspective on
the matriarchs is a welcome addition to theological literature
dominated by patriarchal thought.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Labowitz extends her interpretations a giant step
further into the field of contemporary counseling. In rambling,
pedantic discourses, she uses the matriarchs as case studies to
help women cope with low self-esteem, stress, infertility,
menopause and widowhood. More biblical thought and less therapy
could have made God, Sex and Women of the Bible a more substantial
volume with wider appeal. _ Reviewed by Hollace Weiner &QL;

   Before there was Point of Grace, dc Talk, Jars of Clay or
Michael W. Smith, before contemporary Christian music was a
recognized genre, there was a man named Keith Green.
</P>
<P>
   He sang songs of total commitment to God, about living an
uncompromised life for Christ. He provided much of the sound track
for the Jesus movement of the late '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Green sang until he was killed in an airplane accident in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His songs are now available to a new generation, thanks to this
four-CD set (sold separately). The disc titles are ``Songs of
Testimony, Songs of Evangelism, Songs of Worship'' and ``Songs of
Devotion.'' Each includes cuts from his albums as well as live
versions, and each ends with a spoken message from Green.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the music sounds a little dated; after all, it is 20
years old. However, the message is as relevant and fresh now as it
was then, or as it was 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Green's passion for Jesus is unmistakable. His songs are
challenging, comforting and encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   They inspired believers 20 years ago. They should do the same
for a new generation. _ Reviewed by Simon Gonzalez

`OUT-OF-TOWNERS' REMAKE NEVER GOES FOR BROKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 2 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ What made ``The Out-of-Towners'' appealing in
1970 also makes it appealing in 1999. It's a fish-out-of-water
story about something most of us can relate to: what it's like to
fight the big city _ and have the city win. It also showcases two
likable stars _ in this case, Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what made the original unappealing still makes it
a little hard to take today. The new movie, based on Neil Simon's
script for the Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis version, is basically a
series of harrowing events in search of a story. After the first 45
minutes (or possibly sooner), part of you just wants the
beleaguered protagonists to admit defeat, turn tail and get the
heck out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then you wouldn't have a movie. And for all its
faults, this new film does have its moments and fills a need for a
light, adult comedy. It's just too bad that it's not better, given
all the talent involved.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry Clark, Martin subdues his wacky side to portray a
middle-age suburbanite who's a little tired of life _ and too proud
to tell his wife that he's lost his job as an advertising executive
to a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's subtlety comes at the expense of his wackier side, for
which he's best-known. The TV ad for the movie highlights the one
scene where Martin really gets to cut loose: After unknowingly
ingesting a hallucinogen, Martin is lovestruck in Central Park,
running after a young woman and calling out to Hawn, ``Honey, let's
do her!'' (actually, the line has been altered in the ad so that
Martin says, ``Let's get her!'').
</P>
<P>
   Hawn is Nancy Clark, Henry's sensitive and somewhat ditsy wife.
After their youngest son (played by Hawn's real-life son) leaves
the nest, Hawn wants to ``suck the marrow out of life'' and take on
new challenges and opportunities. Henry, of course, wants none of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn is good, as usual, and looks lovely (so much so, in fact,
that one wonders why it was deemed necessary in several scenes to
shoot her in soft focus). But whereas Martin's character may stray
too far from his specialty to really delight, we've seen Hawn play
this character before. In fact, we've seen a lot of women play this
character before _ the free-spirited girl who eggs her man on to
new things.
</P>
<P>
   The two go to New York to visit their older daughter and so
Henry can interview for a job. Unbeknownst to Nancy, Henry really
needs the job. Together, the couple experiences the Ten Plagues of
New York City. These include transportation woes, not having enough
money, getting mugged and stumbling into a kinky group therapy
session.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to portray such a series of woes and make it
screamingly funny. But it requires going for broke, something this
movie never does.
</P>
<P>
   As a prime representative of caustic British humor, John Cleese
almost pulls off this kind of transcendence in his few scenes.
Playing a condescending and secretly cross-dressing hotel manager,
Cleese gives the movie a kick in the pants whenever he's on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, everything is neatly wrapped up and
everyone is happy. The filmmakers miss an opportunity to give the
end a twist, but then, that's probably too much to ask of a remake.

INTERVIEW WITH A VAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Orson Welles called Eartha Kitt ``the most
exciting woman in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase that has stuck with her over the years, even
becoming the title for the 1991 film version of her cabaret
performances. And it's a good bet that if Welles were alive nearly
half a century later, he'd no doubt say the same thing about the
legendary entertainer for whom the word ``fabulous'' was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Eartha _ to call her Kitt doesn't seem right _ is once again
touring the country with intimate cabaret performances.
</P>
<P>
   After five decades of performing in concerts, movies, theater
and television _ who could forget her as the best Catwoman ever? _
Eartha still prefers to do it live.
</P>
<P>
   Performing live ``is my favorite,'' she says by phone from
Seattle. ``I wonder why we don't record live all the time. You have
an honest feeling from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Her shows are always a surprise, a mixture of classics such as
``C'est Si Bon'' and ``St. Louis Blues'' and new tunes. At age 72,
she's in great shape, and still dresses to show off those
sculptured cheekbones, that trim figure and beautiful skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like songs that I can connect with other songs that connect
with a story,'' she says. ``That way the whole evening has been
like a little vignette of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that she still doesn't get a little nervous.
``I think any of us, every time we step on the stage, it's another
request for another job. You never know what the audience is going
to be like. Especially after traveling, when the voice is tired and
the throat is dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   As famous as she is for her svelte purr of a voice, Eartha will
go down in the history as a woman who was not afraid to speak her
mind. In 1968, she was invited to a White House luncheon hosted by
Lady Bird Johnson, at which she condemned the Vietnam War. As a
result of spinning by President Johnson and of American sentiment,
Eartha was blacklisted by the U.S. entertainment community almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a free democratic (country) that says you're
entitled to your opinions. I was asked a question, and I gave my
opinion in a well-mannered way. I did not expect to be out of work
within two hours in my own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they wanted to hear the opinion of the 50 women in
the room. When I sat down, the lady sitting next to me bowed her
head so she wouldn't be heard, put her hand on my knee and said
`Thank you for what you said.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eartha subsequently lived and performed in Europe and found
greater popularity when she returned home in the early '70s. Her
thoughts on war remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the situation in Kosovo, she likens it to the Bay of
Pigs. ``I think that it has not been explained to the American
people enough for us to understand what is going on there. The
president doesn't want us to know, and he probably doesn't know.
He's told by his advisers what to do and what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you're going to settle wars, darling, is to be
able to control the population. Wars start because the population
outgrows the space and they need more territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my mind about anything. I'm on the side that
is right,'' she says with an irrefutable assuredness. And who would
argue with Eartha?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Did the du Ponts have any small children?'' a middle-aged man
asked the docent as the tour group stood in the delicate
18th-century yellow-cream-paneled dining room of Winterthur, the
175-room mansion created by Henry Francis du Pont for his
collection of American decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know that a child was still loose in the house,
now a public museum. She was the 77-year-old woman with the
Claudette Colbert hair and the large shaded eyeglasses who had just
passed behind him on her way to the private elevator, du Pont's
younger daughter, Ruth Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad to see you,'' she said in a low, likable voice to the
older guard at the new visitors' entrance, where her bedroom once
looked out over a meadow and cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always good to see you,'' he said, as he removed her visitor's
badge, signing her out. ``I hate to do that, but I've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ellen Lord has a very nearly unique relationship to
Winterthur. With her older sister, Pauline Harrison de Broussard,
she grew up there. Winterthur, a 2,400-acre estate in the
Brandywine Valley outside Wilmington, Del., was one of four family
homes. But by her account, Henry du Pont, who died in 1969, might
have been as surprised as the tourists visiting his house to
discover that there were small children who grew up in it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lord, a research affiliate with the Child Study Center at
Yale University, has written a book about her father and his house,
``Henry F. du Pont and Winterthur: A Daughter's Portrait'' (Yale
University Press), being published this month. It is a portrait in
search of its sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone, Ms. Lord is still growing up, and she is looking
for her father _ an elusive man, born in 1880, whom because of his
own shyness and the Victorian secrecies of his class, she hardly
knew. In her book and in conversation, she speaks of him with loss
and love, as though he were alive, and missing. In reunion, there
is hope for resolution, that he can prove he loves her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Where Ms. Lord had to look is at Henry du Pont's self-professed
legacy _ a monumental house where she, as though by coincidence,
had also lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorative arts aren't particularly my thing,'' she said. ``I
don't really know anything about antiques or care much about them.
I appreciate them, but I've never studied them in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Ms. Lord has kept Golf Cottage, a small,
19th-century house across a road from the nine-hole golf course on
the Winterthur property. She asked her father to leave it to her
instead of the large house he built to move into when the mansion
became a nonprofit museum in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   On a low butler's table in the tiny living room was a florist's
arrangement of flowers that Winterthur's publicity agent had had
sent for the interview. ``I didn't get around to tearing that up,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everything plain,'' she said, asked about a handful of
fresh daffodils in a teacup on the windowsill. ``The furniture?
It's nothing. Most of it came from Lord &AMP; Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   If objects tell stories, for all of the magnificence of
Winterthur, du Pont's relationship with his daughter was thinly
furnished _ a man with 58 sets of china who recorded in detail his
table settings for lunch and dinner for 50 years but found it hard
to choose words for his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost never spoke,'' said Ms. Lord, who worked with
archives at Winterthur and cases of correspondence to construct her
parents' half of her childhood. ``He was a very sort of kindly
person, but he was not intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   As is clear to a visitor, du Pont saved much of his affection
for things.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my father died, there was an Oriental rug that wound up
in Connecticut, in my house, which I thought was very pretty,'' Ms.
Lord said. ``One day I noticed that sewn into one of the corners,
which said `Albany' _ that was my room _ was, `When Miss R.E. is in
residence.' That was me. Ruth Ellen.'' Her father had what he
considered ``an inferior rug,'' Ms. Lord said, put down when she
was expected home. ``Obviously my father had a terrific distrust of
children, and he thought I was going to ruin everything, so the
good stuff was apparently moved out when I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf Cottage was empty when Ms. Lord was a child at Winterthur.
She went there, with her nurse, to row on the pond and catch
tadpoles. As a girl, she sat inside to smoke cigarettes ``with
pals,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, she has moved into her playhouse, maintaining it for
visits to Winterthur with her own family. Ms. Lord has three
children; her second husband, John Holmes, died in 1997. Golf
Cottage is everything Henry du Pont neglected to install in his
period rooms _ comfortable, cozy, familiar and worn, with what Ms.
Lord calls the ``relatedness'' that a small house excels at. At
Winterthur, her bedroom was two floors away from her mother's and
father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my parents weren't there, which was a lot,'' she said,
``I used to put obstacles all the way down the hall on the third
floor and zoom over them, pretending I was in the Olympics.'' In
one event, Ms. Lord recalled, she broke her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lord's book is not an ugly backstage peek, but a curious one
_ revisiting scenes from her childhood, like an adult's recurring
dream. The portrait that emerges of Henry du Pont is one of another
child _ as a boy, frail, awkward, insecure, the only surviving son
of seven children born to Henry A. du Pont, a Civil War hero and a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he was a bad student who was fond of flowers.
His best grade at Harvard was a B minus, for a garden study class.
He collected birds' eggs. He was dilettantish but acutely detailed,
describing in a list his birthday wish for waterproof cushions for
his canoe, not ``swell, just plain'' and ``fashionable English
paper with my initials on it.'' He was immature and close to his
mother, who died when he was 22.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock that he later said defined him, a rare reflection
he shared with his daughter. ``To have someone say, `When I was 22,
I gave up feeling,' was such an astonishing thing to hear,'' Ms.
Lord recalled. ``I speculate it had something to do with having
such an intense instinct for collecting. People who've had early
loss find collecting a kind of reassuring thing to do. Sort of an
island of safety, inviolable.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was still emotionally hesitant 13 years later, living with
his father at Winterthur and running the farms, when he became
engaged to Ruth Wales, of Hyde Park, N.Y., warning her in a letter
that she was about to embark on an ``uncongenial alliance.'' They
were married the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, now a father, du Pont began buying American furniture,
decorative objects and rooms of fine woodwork, inspired by a visit
to two houses, the 18th-century farmhouse of Watson and Electra
Webb in Shelburne, Vt., and Beauport, Henry Davis Sleeper's house
in Gloucester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Though a reticent man, he created a mountain of marvelous
things, like a gigantic toy, expanding Winterthur with 23 new
period rooms, an internal telephone line, a badminton court and a
bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to know where I was _ I was 9,'' Ms. Lord said,
like Eloise undelighted by the Plaza. ``But then there were these
wonderful things, like a swimming pool. I mean, the modern stuff
was just fantastic. The bathhouses were full of chrome and Art Deco
_ so there was a huge contrast to the antiques.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of domestic life gave du Pont an adult's
confidence. He liked running Winterthur.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was much more of a house person than Mother was,''
Ms. Lord said. ``It was he who planned the meals and planned what
the table was going to be set with. It was all determined by what
flowers were available. My father used to say, `The average person
never notices anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   By putting his interests on display, Henry du Pont might have
hoped to be able to share himself. But his wife hated Winterthur
and made no show of wanting to be there, spending most of her year
at their apartment in New York. She called the estate ``Frog
Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' she wrote to her own mother, ``inside your own
house, having to reach your husband by telephone.'' With du Pont
``knee-deep in flower and antiques catalogs or in journals like The
Holstein-Friesian World,'' Ms. Lord writes that her mother remarked
to her grandmother, ``Please deliver me from farming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very outgoing, great fun, a wonderful mimic,'' Ms.
Lord said. ``But she had a very dark side to her. She said she
thought nobody should be born in this `vale of tears.'''
</P>
<P>
   The collection and its costs also provoked a tragicomic kind of
subplot. Henry du Pont spent money like a du Pont, borrowing from
cousins when he got ahead of even his own fortune, cutting staff or
salaries and hiding the expenses of incessant buying from his wife.
He had 18 bank accounts and used aliases on shopping trips. During
the Depression, when he doubled the size of the house, du Pont's
lawyer warned him that Winterthur might be hard to mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the only regret he had about this was the things he
hadn't bought,'' Ms. Lord said. ``I speculate that there weren't
many.'' Her mother saved string and ribbon compulsively. She had
letters delivered by car to save the cost of a stamp.
</P>
<P>
   If families are trees, Ms. Lord made trees into her family. It
is an attachment she shared with her father. As the story has it,
Henry du Pont instructed his staff that if Winterthur caught fire,
they were to save the trees before the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a tree in this place that I didn't climb,'' his
daughter said. Many are now more than 200 years old. She speaks of
them like relatives. Perhaps she tackled them for their own kind of
living response _ rewarded by a rich solitude and a swaying vista.
Or perhaps a tree is a kind of lap to crawl into.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 34, she asked her father for Golf Cottage in a
letter.
</P>

COURT WEIGHS WHETHER STATE WORKERS CAN SUE USING FEDERAL LAW

   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could affect state workers around
the country, the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about a
dispute pitting the state of Maine against a group of probation
officers over time-and-a-half pay.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision in the case, which is expected in
June, could define how vulnerable state governments are to being
sued when they violate someone's federally protected rights.
</P>
<P>
   The state-employed probation officers sued Maine in 1992 in
federal court, saying they were owed the extra pay guaranteed by a
federal labor law.
</P>
<P>
   But while their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 in another case that the Constitution's 11th Amendment, which
limits the judicial power of the federal government, shields states
from being sued against their will in federal court. The U.S.
District Court then dismissed the probation officers' suit, and
they refiled it in state court, still depending on the federal law,
known as the Fair Labor Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   However, a year later a Maine Superior Court in Cumberland ruled
that the 11th Amendment makes states immune from state court
lawsuits that would be barred in federal courts. The court also
said that the 11th Amendment makes a state totally immune from
being sued by employees who allege labor-law violations, although
it said federal labor officials still could sue the state seeking
to make it enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court agreed with that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday, Laurence Gold,
representing the probation officers, urged the justices to allow
his clients to file their lawsuit in state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state must be bound by federal law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold was supported by the Clinton administration. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman told the justices that because lawsuits against
states are now generally barred from federal court, citizens need
state courts to protect their federal rights. Waxman said that
without the option of going to a state court, a citizen's federal
rights might as well be ``written in disappearing ink.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``State courts may not deny a federal right absent a
valid excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maine Solicitor Peter Brann said the Constitution ``clearly
immunized states from being sued in their own courts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if a state violates a federal law, citizens may
bring their case to federal officials who may then sue the state in
federal court to enforce the law. ``The law still applies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the arguments, the justices struggled over how to
balance states' sovereignty against the federal government's power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent rulings over the issue, the court has split 5-4 with
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas
prevailing in favor of the states.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday it again appeared that the conservative justices
were siding with the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying states are not sovereign where federal law is
concerned,'' Scalia told Waxman. ``What if there was a federal law
allowing the federal government to raid state treasuries?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said it was ``hard to conceive the founding fathers
believed states could be sued in their own courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But later in the arguments, Justice Stephen Breyer told Brann
that ``if you prevail, we're going to get some kind of hodgepodge
... of enforcement of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Maine case, the court has agreed to decide three
other states-rights issues within the next year. The questions are
whether states may be sued for patent infringement and for
violating a federal false-advertising law and whether state
employees may sue over alleged violations of the federal law
banning age bias in the workplace.

`COOKIE'S FORTUNE' FEELS LIKE TIME WELL-SPENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, April 2 by  NYTimes News Service clients )  
Our rating: 3 stars

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casual is the word for Robert Altman's latest
ensemble comedy, ``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a murder mystery with no murder (nor, for that matter, any
mystery) set in a tiny Mississippi town. What little plot there is
here is just window dressing; the whole enterprise is just one big
excuse for a bunch of fine actors to run Dixie riffs off of one
another, which some do more successfully than others.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be Altman's least-demanding film, and perhaps
his most pleasant. The director's infamous misanthropy is reserved
for just a few of the eccentric characters that sprout like kudzu
in this particular corner of the Delta, and those unfortunates'
primary sin is the pretty venial one of pretentiousness. The vast
majority of sleepy Holly Springs' residents are showered with
directorial affection, which results in a film that's consistently
amusing but rarely very involving.
</P>
<P>
   Top performance nods go to Charles S. Dutton, Julianne Moore,
the legendary Patricia Neal and the surprisingly natural Liv Tyler.
Dutton plays Willis Richland, a likable middle-age guy with a taste
for Wild Turkey and no fixed profession. He does, however, take
excellent care of the town's wealthiest widow, Jewel Mae ``Cookie''
Orcutt (Neal), with whom he also enjoys a warm, almost mother-son
kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cookie misses her departed husband big time, and in an
Easter eve funk takes her own life. The body is discovered by her
snooty, low-rent Blanche DuBois of a niece Camille (Glenn Close,
overacting), who by some dubious plot logic thinks it's important
for the family's reputation to make the death look like a murder
rather than a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Camille easily convinces her slow-witted sister Cora Duvall
(Moore) to go along with the ruse, since Cora's limited brain power
already is overloaded with the demands of her leading role in
``Salome,'' a travesty of which Camille is directing down at the
Presbyterian church.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking anything else that resembles a suspect, the local
sheriffs (Ned Beatty and Danny Darst) arrest Willis, though they
know that their fishing buddy couldn't possibly be guilty. Cora's
daughter Emma (Tyler), recently returned to town after some
semi-illegal activity in Biloxi, knows her pal Willis is innocent,
too; she demands to be arrested for unpaid parking tickets so she
can keep Willis company in his unlocked cell. As a bonus, Emma's
former flame Jason (Chris O'Donnell) looks good in his new deputy
uniform and is working the station's holiday skeleton shift.
</P>
<P>
   More characters wend their way through the leisurely
proceedings, none to any particular effect beyond adding a wry note
or two. There's some good music at a nearby blues joint (former
Eurythmic Dave Stewart provided the unobtrusive, rootsy score),
something is kind of said about race relations in the New South,
fun is made of Oscar Wilde, and fish-catching techniques are
discussed at length.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it often seems like the whole film has gone fishing,
that the camera was left on with a few actors in front of it with
no one around to shape what went on. But like a pleasant afternoon
wasted away by the creek, ``Cookie's Fortune'' has an easeful,
lollygagging way about it. It feels like time well-spent
accomplishing next to nothing.

<P>
   ROME _ Pope John Paul II, seeking to open a diplomatic channel
to end the violence in Yugoslavia, is sending the Vatican's top
diplomat to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican diplomat, Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, plans to fly
to Belgrade on Thursday and is expected to be received by President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Tauran, a French prelate serving as a kind of Vatican foreign
minister, will also meet Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic and the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch
Pavle.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said it was also ``very likely'' that John Paul
would issue an appeal in coming days for an interruption of the
hostilities during the Easter season that begins this weekend. But
a senior NATO official in Brussels ruled out such a temporary
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tauran could also be expected to sound out the Yugoslav
government as to what conditions it would accept in return for a
halt to the NATO air strikes; NATO's conditions include accepting
non-NATO forces from the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe or an armed U.N. peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said it was
``very likely'' that the pope would make an appeal for an Easter
holiday cease-fire. Roman Catholics celebrate Easter this year on
Sunday, while a majority of the Orthodox churches do so one week
later on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   But in Brussels, the chairman of NATO's military committee, Gen.
Klaus Naumann, said NATO rejected such a cease-fire proposal as
``deeply inhumane'' because it would give ``carte blanche to
Milosevic to continue with slaughter and ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's intervention follows the failure of Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to obtain concessions from Milosevic
acceptable to NATO leaders. Tauran plans to fly to Belgrade on
board an Italian military aircraft and to return to Rome on
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the NATO bombing, Pope John Paul has
called repeatedly for a cessation of the hostilities in Yugoslavia,
though he has been careful not to single out NATO or Belgrade as
the main instigator, possibly to avoid the image of being
anti-Yugoslav, an accusation that was made against the Vatican
during the NATO raids on Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, in an
interview with an Italian newspaper, chided the Vatican for failing
to speak out against the brutal treatment of the Kosovo Albanians
by the Yugoslav Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican initiative is a relief to the Italian government of
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, which has come under attack from
the left for supporting the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Cossuta, the leader of a splinter Communist party that
supports D'Alema's government, said Wednesday that his group would
withdraw its backing unless there was an Easter cease-fire. But
Italian officials said they doubted that would prompt an immediate
government crisis, given the availability of opposition
parliamentarians who back the government in such situations.

 &HT;    CLINTON OKs $50 MILLION IN REFUGEE AID

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton on Wednesday approved $50 million
for food, shelter and medical aid for the thousands of refugees
that fled Kosovo this past week.
</P>
<P>
   The president plans to give $25 million from the Emergency
Refugee and Migration Account to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), an international organization
already involved in the relief efforts in Kosovo. An additional $25
million will come from the Department of Defense in the form of
food, shelter, and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for population,
refugees and migration, said 107,000 refugees have fled Kosovo in
the past week. In the past 24 hours, 18,000 refugees entered
Albania, Taft said. Others are going to Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said warehouses in Kosovo used by many relief
organizations, including the Mother Theresa Society and UNHCR, have
been destroyed. There are supplies at relief warehouses that
haven't been destroyed, but the agency can't get to those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter is also a problem. Because of that, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) is ``moving tents, plastic
sheeting, sanitation kits, the type of items you need, into
Macedonia and Albania,'' said Roy Williams, who directs disaster
relief for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the agency also sent additional disaster relief
teams to Albania and Macedonia.

WNBA, UNION STILL AT ODDS ON 2 ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A minimum salary gap of $25,000 separates proposals from WNBA
players and the league, as collective bargaining negotiations draw
within 11 days of a league deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Agents confirmed that the players twice have reduced their
minimum-salary demand from $60,000 to the current proposal of
$45,000. The league is offering $20,000, a 33.3 percent increase
from 1998, when the salary range was $15,000 to $62,500 for all but
a handful of elite players with personal services contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The total salary difference between the two sides is between
$1.8 million and $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA officials have set an April 10 deadline for completion of
its first deal with the new players union, claiming that its
32-game season cannot begin on time past that date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll never be a situation where there is a lockout,'' said
New York Liberty forward Rebecca Lobo, who has sat in on several
negotiating sessions. ``The season would be a week long.''
</P>
<P>
   All first-year WNBA players, including the Mercury's Jennifer
Gillom and player representative Michele Timms, must be re-signed.
Training camps are to open May 14, and the season kicks off June 10
for some of the league's 12 teams. The Mercury's first game is June
12.
</P>
<P>
   The other key issue is the absorption of players from the
defunct American Basketball League. The league essentially wants an
open door, asking for a limit of 52 ABL players, while the union
wants protection for current WNBA players and a limit of 24 ABL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ABL players earned an average of $80,000 for a 44-game season,
but without sufficient television or sponsor support, the league
survived less than 2{ seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include creation of a 12th roster spot, health and
pension benefits and marketing rights.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA officials, including President Val Ackerman, are not
commenting publicly but do plan to allocate another player to each
of the two expansion teams Tuesday in conjunction with the
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The allocated players almost certainly will be former ABL
players, with speculation centering on guard Shannon Johnson to the
Orlando Miracle and forward Katie Smith to the Minnesota Lynx. Both
formerly played for the two-time ABL champion Columbus Quest.
</P>
<P>
   If the sides cannot settle, the WNBA could attempt to play with
only former ABL players, if they would sign, and college draftees.
A more likely scenario is that a settlement will be reached for a
minimum salary of about $30,000. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Two inches of snow fell in just one hour at Boise, Idaho, on
Wednesday, as the center of a cold, sprawling low pressure system
in the upper atmosphere drifted overhead. This slow system will
pose a variety of weather problems over the course of the next two
days across parts of the Rockies and Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, heavy, wet snow will fall across parts of northeast
Wyoming, southeast Montana and the western Dakotas as a jet stream
disturbance streaking northeast ahead of the sluggish upper-level
low causes low pressure to develop over eastern Nebraska. In turn,
moist, cold winds from the east-northeast on the northern flank of
the low will fuel a swath of snow. Snowfalls will be greatest on
high terrain, with a foot or more possible in the mountains of
northeast Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, a second volley of moderate to heavy snow
will develop over parts of the same area as the sluggish
upper-level low follows on the heels of Thursday's system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop
across parts of eastern Nebraska, Iowa, southern Minnesota and
eventually Wisconsin as increasingly moist winds from the south are
lifted by the Nebraska low and its associated warm front. A few of
the thunderstorms could approach severe levels, with hail and
strong winds possible in isolated spots.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, a few with moderately heavy rains,
will develop from the eastern Carolinas to north Florida as a jet
stream disturbance and a pool of tropical moisture push slowly east
toward the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rain Error
</P>
<P>
   The official rainfall measurements at San Francisco have been
erroneous for most of the current rainy season. During this decade,
many major cities around the nation have converted from human
observations to automated weather observing systems. The automated
gauge at San Francisco began reporting consistently low values for
rainfall during fall 1998. It is estimated that the reported
seasonal rainfall is about 25 percent too low. Now, the official
rainfall data must be carefully reconstructed so that
representative values can be archived at the National Climatic Data
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast For Thursday, April 1
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday: A push of polar air into the Northeast will
bring lower readings and mainly dry weather. Clouds and scattered
showers will mark the advance of cooler air into the Middle
Atlantic region. The Southeast will stay very warm and rather
humid. A disturbance moving across the southern Plains will trigger
strong thunderstorms in the Gulf states. Snow showers and chilly
conditions are likely across the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday: Cool air will reside over the Northeast as low
pressure in the Tennessee Valley is projected to pass through the
Carolinas. As a result, clouds and some rain will dampen the region
from the Ohio Valley to the Middle Atlantic states. The Southeast
will turn cooler, while the western Plains become brighter and
milder. A new disturbance moving into the Southwest will produce
clouds, cooler air and some showers.

FEARFUL REFUGEES TRY TO HEAD OFF MILOSEVIC'S BRUTALITY BY FLEEING
SANDZAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA PETERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ They cluster outside the Sarajevo bus station
after descending from a row of tour buses, men standing in groups
and looking around expectantly, women sitting on overstuffed duffel
bags with their heads in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They have all left their homes behind to escape the crusade of
brutality unleashed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not refugees from Kosovo. They are from the
Sandzak, another region of Yugoslavia with a deep Muslim tradition
that may be next in line to suffer the fate of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7,000 Sandzaki refugees have arrived in Bosnia since last
Wednesday, bringing stories of beatings and murders by Serb
soldiers, forced conscription into the Yugoslav army, and tanks
massing outside their villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   But having witnessed Serb attacks against fellow Muslims in
Bosnia and Kosovo over the past seven years, and the West's
apparent inability to stop it, the Sandzaki are trying to head
Milosevic off by escaping to Bosnia and talking about what they say
is happening in their homeland. Their region is split mainly
between the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, with
portions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because we are afraid of our Serbian neighbors,''
said Bjelak Latif. ``They are threatening us with death, and
Sarajevo is our only exit.'' He and his daughter traveled by bus to
Sarajevo from Prijepolje last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights abuses have been documented in the Sandzak ever
since Milosevic assumed power in Yugoslavia in 1989. The area takes
its name from the Turkish word ``sancak,'' or district, which it
inherited from the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the region from the
Eastern Orthodox Serbs and the Roman Catholic Croatians in the 15th
century. Over the centuries a number of Slavic families gave up
Christianity and adopted the religion of the conquerors, Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the three-year war between Muslim Bosnia and Serbia
erupted in 1992, roughly 54 percent of the Sandzak's 420,000 people
were Muslim. But since Milosevic rewrote the Yugoslav constitution
in 1992, Muslims have been denied constitutional status as an
ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bosnian war, Milosevic cracked down on the region in
order to quash burgeoning Muslim independence movements. The Serbs
removed Muslims from local governments and police forces, and
surrounded the Sandzak's principal city of Novi Pazar with tanks.
According to human rights organizations, Serb soldiers and police
embarked on a campaign of intimidation that included kidnapping,
murdering and assaulting hundreds of Muslims, often during random
house searches for weapons ostensibly stockpiled for secessionist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though some estimate that as many as 80,000 Muslims have fled
the Sandzak region since 1992, most have stayed put, reluctant to
leave the area's booming, Muslim-dominated shoe and
clothing-manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
   A recent repeat of the events of the Bosnian war, however, have
struck fear in many Sandzakis. Refugees arriving in Sarajevo say
tanks and troops are again building up around Novi Pazar, leading
them to fear that the Sandzak is the next frontier in Milosevic's
odyssey to cleanse Muslims from ancient Serbs lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Sandzaki, it's a pre-emptive flight. They're worried
because they see signs that they're next,'' said Wendy Rappaport,
Sarajevo spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough of a threat for these people to leave their
country and homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety increased in the region when Yugoslav soldiers began
rounding up Muslim men in the area Thursday to serve in the
military force Milosevic is mobilizing for the ground war against
NATO he anticipates over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Buses from the Sandzak region have reportedly been stopped at
the Bosnian border by Serb police who order men off at gunpoint.
One man who gave his name only as Alam said he escaped from the
army by faking sickness after he and other Muslims were beaten by
Serb soldiers and told that they would be placed on the front lines
without weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Though reports of abuse cannot be independently verified because
of the expulsions of truce monitors and journalists from
Yugoslavia, they match Milosevic's pattern of attacking ethnic
minorities to drum up support among Serb hard-liners in times of
stress such as the current NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the experience we've been having in the Balkans for
the past 10 years, and we had a very bitter experience here in
Bosnia,'' said Nudzeim Recica, the Bosnian government official who
oversees refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recica said the Bosnian government is lobbying the international
community to monitor the situation in the Sandzak to ensure the
conflict doesn't spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions (in the Sandzak) are rising and I'm afraid something
drastic could happen, but we're praying it won't'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason fleeing Sandzakis have chosen Sarajevo as their
destination is its proximity to Bosnia, while Kosovars head mainly
to Macedonia and Albania, which they can reach by foot. Another
reason is the Sandzak's long historical and political ties to
Bosnia, the post-war population of which is overwhelmingly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Few Sandzak refugees arriving in Bosnia have requested aid
because they are receiving shelter from family, friends or others
in Bosnia's Muslim community, Recica said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the aim of many Sandzaki refugees at the Sarajevo bus
station has been to enlist Bosnian Muslim politicians in supporting
the rights of Muslims in the Sandzak, a goal that, if reached,
could fan the flames of Milosevic's wrath even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because we want to make people aware of the
position of Muslim people in the Sandzak,'' said Fahrudin Mekic of
a Muslim political party with branches in Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
``We helped the Bosnian refugees when they came to Sandzak in 1992,
so we hope they will help us out now.''

RADIO PREACHER'S FRISCO CHURCH IS A BOOMING SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ Deborah Griffith beamed. She had just left a
church service after hearing Chuck Swindoll, one of the most
popular radio preachers in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's great,'' said Griffith, a sculptor who recently
moved to Texas from New York. ``I've listened to him for years on
the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she and about 2,000 other people hear him in person each
Sunday at the Stonebriar Community Church, a remarkable new
congregation founded by Swindoll in October.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation, meeting in temporary quarters in the gymnasium
of Collin County Community College's Preston Ridge Campus, is being
referred to by some church-growth experts as an ``instant
megachurch.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary dirt work began this month on a 2,500-seat church
sanctuary on 60 acres of prime real estate in Frisco. And that $7
million project is just the first phase. Ultimately, several church
buildings, including a 6,000-seat sanctuary, are to be built on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprise; it's all a surprise. I never would have
guessed it,'' said Swindoll, who was born in El Campo, 75 miles
southwest of Houston. ``God is at work here, or this would not have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a celebrated radio evangelist, Swindoll is
president of Dallas Theological Seminary. He is a prolific author,
and his ``Insight for Living'' programs, which began in 1997, are
broadcast 1,600 times daily on 400 radio stations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds have been increasing at the new church each week. Those
lucky enough to get a seat plop down on white plastic lawn chairs
bought at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love us at Wal-Mart,'' said Emily Edwards, an aide to
Swindoll. ``We just kept going back to buy more chairs. We've about
cleaned them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kathy Seei, who has seen her town grow from 6,000 to
27,000 in the past 10 years, says Frisco welcomes the church. The
city has accelerated street projects to help the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have worse things happen to you than having 6,000
Christians coming to your city,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll, 64, has experience in building large churches. For 23
years, he was pastor of the First Evangelical Free Church in
Fullerton, Calif., which grew to 6,000 members under his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasizes that the Texas church will have its own
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested in building a Fullerton, Calif., church in
Frisco, Texas,'' he said at a January town-hall meeting held to
discuss building plans.
</P>
<P>
   The newness of Swindoll's church will attract many, said Carol
Childress, communications director of Leadership Network, a Dallas
church-growth organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new kid on the block,'' she said. ``The real question
will be three or four years from now. There will be a certain
amount of fallout. It's a normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicts success for Swindoll, though, because of his
popularity and his experience in creating churches in high-growth
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll's style attracted Jim Gunn of Plano to become a regular
attendee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck is real. He comes down to our level. He appeals to the
common man,'' said Gunn, who formerly drove to downtown Dallas to
attend First Baptist Church. ``He's not only a preacher, he's a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Preaching is Swindoll's first love. When he accepted the
presidency of Dallas Theological Seminary in 1994, he told trustees
he ultimately would be pastor of a church, too. Seminary trustees
are supportive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically a pastor,'' Swindoll said during an interview at
his office on the seminary campus east of downtown Dallas. ``I love
what we are doing here at the seminary. But my world is a
practical, hands-on world. I try to help people who are hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   The phoenixlike church began springing up in mid-October when
admirers of Swindoll persuaded him to begin Wednesday-night Bible
studies in the club room of the Stonebriar Country Club in Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 200 people show up the first night,'' Edwards said.
``That went to 400 the next week and doubled again the third
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The church advertised only once, and the attendance jumped from
1,100 to 2,000, said the Rev. Mark Dane, associate pastor. No more
advertising is expected until the church moves into larger
quarters, Dane said.
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll is an evangelical conservative who believes that the
Bible holds the answers to life. While strongly opposing abortion
and supporting many views of the Christian right, he pointedly
stays away from politics. He centers his preaching on everyday
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been criticized for not taking a higher profile in
political things,'' Swindoll said. ``But I've found that when you
mix church and politics, the politics will eventually take over and
eat you up.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's annual budget is $1.7 million, including five
full-time and four part-time employees, church officials said.
Swindoll said he chose not to receive a salary at this time.

   SPACEY-ICEMAN-THEATER (New York) _ Kevin Spacey, resplendent in
black, from T-shirt to running shoes, is sitting amid the empty
seats of the Brooks Atkinson Theater, watching the international
scrum of lugs, louts and losers who frequent Harry Hope's bar in
``The Iceman Cometh'' by Eugene O'Neill. A respected and
prize-winning stage actor, he is probably best known for, and at
times hard to differentiate from, the dark, somewhat mysterious
characters _ all chilly control and sheen on the surface, all
menace and surprise underneath _ that he has played in films. These
include ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Swimming With Sharks,'' ``L.A.
Confidential,'' ``Hurlyburly,'' and ``The Usual Suspects,'' which
won him an Oscar for best supporting actor in 1995. Spacey spent
much of the last year in London playing Hickey in the critically
acclaimed Almeida Theater production of ``The Iceman Cometh'' on
which the current American revival _ opening on Thursday on
Broadway _ is based. By Peter Applebome. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ Picture a Mount Rushmore in honor
of the monumental characters of American drama. What faces do you
see there, carved in stone? Willy Loman, Blanche DuBois, Theodore
(Hickey) Hickman and Mary Cavan Tyrone. But has our country yet
produced drama worthy to set beside the Greek tragedians,
Shakespeare, Calderon, Schiller, Ibsen, Chekhov? I think not. By
Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COOKIE'S-FORTUNE-FILM (Undated) _ A proper Southern lady knows
what to do when she finds a relative upstairs in bed with a bullet
through her brain and the pistol still dangling from her right
hand. When this happens to Camille Dixon (Glenn Close, dressed like
a blend of Blanche DuBois, Isadora Duncan and a Talbot's catalogue
cover), she simply rearranges things to make it look like murder. A
lot of things about Holly Springs, the setting of Robert Altman's
new movie, ``Cookie's Fortune,'' seem familiar. But then I grew up
in Vincent, Ala., population 1,200 or so, where ``y'all's'' is an
accepted plural possessive and people still refer to ``passing
away.'' Altman, whose hometown is the very metropolitan Kansas
City, Mo., got a lot of things about small Southern towns right,
but then his screenwriter, Anne Rapp, once lived in Mississippi. By
Anita Gates. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-PSYCHO-FILM (Toronto) _ The humor being aimed for in
``American Psycho'' _ a swipe at the blind narcissism of the
youthful privileged class during the Reagan 80s _ is crucial to the
success of the movie, which may have more prerelease bias to
overcome than any film in recent memory. The 1991 novel by the same
name, on which it is based, depicts scenes of sadistic violence
narrated by Patrick Bateman in a seemingly indifferent manner that
by some literal readings was perceived as amoral. So much so that
many people who failed to recognize (or consider) the satiric
intent of the author, Bret Easton Ellis, thought the disturbing
work should not have even been published, much less made into a
movie. By Bruce Weber. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GYPSY-DANCE (New York) _ The Gypsy Caravan, a sextuple bill,
produced by the World Music Institute, comes to City Center on
Friday and Saturday. The Gypsy music and dance heritage stretches
all the way from India to Andalusia. It's a musical diaspora that
has survived poverty and persecution while transforming, and being
transformed by every culture it has touched. By Jon Pareles.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LE-CID-THEATER (Paris) _ The production of ``Le Cid'' was the
high point of last year's Avignon Festival, almost unanimously
praised by French critics as an intelligent and disturbing fresh
look at a dusty classic. Since then, it has been seen in many
French provincial cities as well as in London in February and most
recently at the Theatredes Bouffes du Nord, the Paris home of Peter
Brook's experimental theater company. Now it is ending its touring
life at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with seven performances _
accompanied by English-language surtitles _ at the Majestic Theater
from Tuesday through next Sunday. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTERTENORS (New York) _ Time to strike the male alto from the
rare-species list. To appreciate how well established this once
marginal vocal category has become, consider the case of David
Daniels, who makes his Metropolitan Opera debut on Saturday evening
in a revival of Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' with an encore
scheduled for April 27 in the form of a recital at Alice Tully
Hall. It was with the premiere of this Met production in 1988 that
Jeffrey Gall and Daniel Dash struck for their brothers the blow
that in 1955 Marian Anderson struck for blacks, opening the doors
of the nation's most visible opera house to a class of artists
formerly excluded. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   VENGEROV-MUSIC (Undated) _ The young Siberian Maxim Vengerov
continues to stake out his ground among the most gifted and
engaging violinists of, let's say, the last 25 years. Let's say
that, because ``half-century'' or, indeed, ``modern times'' has an
inescapable ring of hyperbole. Yet Vengerov's magnificent new
recording of Brahms's Violin Concerto, with Daniel Barenboim and
the Chicago Symphony (Teldec 0630-17144-2; CD), immediately brings
to mind classic performances available on compact disk. By Lawrence
B. Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FERNEYHOUGH-MUSIC (Undated) _ Brian Ferneyhough, an English-born
composer who has been teaching at the University of California, San
Diego, for the last 12 years, is a modernist by any definition,
except in his choice of media. He uses conventional instruments and
even has a penchant for traditional groupings, notably the string
quartet, and for historical models. A recent CD of solo works by
Ferneyhough (Etcetera KTC 1206), is played by the extraordinary
musicians of the Australian group Elision. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POP-SONGS-HERITAGE (New York) _ The noble parade of dead
songwriters in Lincoln Center's American Songbook series has begun,
starting with Harold Arlen in February and Richard Rodgers in March
and continuing in the fall with Jimmy Van Heusen and Jerome Kern.
The mission is nothing less than the preservation of our popular
song heritage. But is preservation enough? Clearly, the music of
that melodious roster of songwriting legends from the 1920s to the
1950s, like Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Irving Berlin and their
peers, will remain with us for the foreseeable future. Long-term,
though, their songs, written for a mass market that no longer
exists, employing standards of craft and sophistication that no
longer apply, seem destined for extinction. By Barry Singer.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIM'S-PROGRESS-ART (Undated) _ Few art panoramas have
survived, and the ``Pilgrim's Progress'' versions were assumed to
have vanished, worn out from use or discarded once their vogue had
passed. Then in 1995, the traveling edition was discovered at the
York Institute Museum in Saco, Maine, where it had been hidden away
in storage for almost century. The painting was sent to the
Williamstown Art Conservation Center in Massachusetts for
restoration. And about a third of its 1,200-foot length is now on
view through May 2 at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, in an
exhibition organized by Gail Stavitsky and Diane P. Fischer of the
museum, Tom Hardiman of the York Institute and Kevin Avery of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. By Holland Cotter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-BASILICA-ART _ (Assisi, Italy) _ The recent tragedy
at the 13th-century basilica of St. Francis, where the entryway and
the altar collapsed 18 months ago during an earthquake, has been
entirely rebuilt and reinforced. The quake shattered ceiling
paintings attributed to Cimabue and Giotto. By Ken Shulman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AWFUL-TRUTH (Undated) _ In the debut episode of ``The Awful
Truth,'' the new series created by the guerrilla-style documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore, viewers meet Christopher Donahue, a
Florida man with a life-threatening pancreatic illness. Donahue
desperately needs a transplant but his health care provider,
Humana, refuses to pay for the operation. Those familiar with
Moore's work, particularly his breakthrough documentary film in
1989, ``Roger and Me,'' and his Emmy-winning series ```TV Nation,''
will recognize that the basic ingredients remain the same in ```The
Awful Truth,'' which has its premiere next Sunday at 9 p.m. on
Bravo. By Warren Berger. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-LOVE-LETTERS (Undated) _ ``Love Letters,'' A.R. Gurney's
spare, episto-lary duet for the stage, is _ as the author himself
has pointed out _ a quasi-play. The original production opened in
New York 10 years ago with a revolving cast that began with John
Rubinstein and Kathleen Turner. Now, in a leap of artistic faith,
``Love Letters'' has become a full-length television film (ABC,
next Monday at 9 p.m.), with sets, costumes and the occasional
supporting player. The stars are Laura Linney (most recently Jim
Carrey's wife in ``The Truman Show'') and Steven Weber (who starred
in the sitcom ``Wings''). By Charles Strum. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   READING-ROOM-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The gloomy winter and the
bright spring have provided the proof. The glorious fullness of
light that the architects John M. Carrere and Thomas Hastings
envisioned 90 years ago for the New York Public Library's main
reading room has returned the Beaux Arts space to its former
splendor. The rescue was realized under Paul LeClerc, the president
of the library, through the largesse of Sandra Priest Rose, a
library trustee, and her husband, Frederick Phineas Rose, a real
estate developer, who gave $15 million to restore the space. By
Rita Reif. (Moved).

INTRODUCING ALEX RODRIGUEZ: NEW MARINERS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital) News story, Jan 22, 2003: To avert another work
stoppage that this time threatened the entire 2003 season, major
league baseball owners and the players union reached an historic
agreement unprecedented in sports: The owners sold all franchises
to the players. (end ital).
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The idea had been whispered quietly for months, but
didn't really become a plan, according to outgoing commissioner Bud
Selig, until Yankee owner George Steinbrenner six weeks ago weighed
in on a conference call with chilling news.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said that after projecting revenues from the new
Amazon.com/Giuliani Stadium, as well as TV revenues from moving the
Yankee broadcasts to the Playboy Channel, it still didn't pencil
out,'' Selig said. ``We were all shaken. George had been the last
big-time holdout, and when he said he couldn't make money in
baseball, well, it didn't take long to conclude that nobody wanted
to be the last fool out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The key was secrecy: Any disclosure and the subsequent
controversy might have doomed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to rare cooperation from players' union chief Don
Fehr, who is succeeding Selig as commissioner, an ownership group
negotiated quietly with Fehr and Alex Rodriguez, the Seattle
Mariners' All-Star shortstop who became major league sports' first
player-owner last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the transfer of ownership was patterned after the
Seattle model of 2002, when Rodriguez became the first player whose
contractual worth exceeded the value of the franchise. The Seattle
owners, a group of billionaire high-tech executives who never
figured out how to make a profit despite a new public stadium and a
successful team, deeded over the franchise to Rodriguez rather than
give him a contract extension that exceeded the club's estimated
$200 million value.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Seattle model, in which the franchise was held
and operated in a blind trust so that Rodriguez would not vote on
ownership matters while a union member, the players will now have
full control of each team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have no one to blame but ourselves,'' said Rodriguez
at a press conference, although he admitted after questioning that
that very point was troublesome for many players. After years of
laying off prolonged slumps and 100-loss seasons to lousy
ownerships and poor management, many were fearful of having to
assume personal responsibility and be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it wasn't a big deal,'' Rodriguez said. ``I said
we still have umpires, fans and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   What would seem to have been the most difficult issue, price,
was not a major stumbling block. Since all franchises were losing
money, thanks to soaring salaries, decline of broadcast revenues
and weather postponements of the last two World Series until
spring, nearly all ownerships were happy to receive merely the sum
of their net investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, some of the owners quite naturally wanted to get the
appreciated value,'' Selig said. ``We had some arguments, but the
fact that was irrefutable was that we were losing so much money
that we needed to dump this dog fast while we could come out
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fehr and Rodriguez considered waiting another year
until franchise values plummeted, but realized that timing was
important and the secret could not be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Financing the purchases was not a problem, either. Since the
takeover of world commerce by Microsoft in 2001, loans to large
entities such as the players union _ rated recently by the United
Nations Trade Commission as the world's 13th largest economy _ has
become easy. Fehr estimated that the players paid about 5 percent
down on the estimated $18 million collective purchase price.
Microsoft has its usual one-year balloon payment on the loan
balance, so the assumption is that major league baseball will
become absorbed into the Microsoft entertainment arm,
OpiatesForTheMasses.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior offered to pay the down himself,'' said Rodriguez,
laughing about his former teammate, Ken Griffey Jr. He said it was
hard to take the Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder seriously
because his recent purchase of Universal Studios left him a little
strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was some concern on both sides about how the
federal government would react to such an unprecedented shift in
what was once the national pastime, the White House reacted swiftly
with approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball doesn't need owners; hey, I never needed one when I
was rasslin','' said President Jesse Ventura during his first press
conference following inauguration. ``The Dubya Dubya Eff did just
fine without 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Play ball with ballplayers!' ''

   KUKES, Albania _ Serbian forces are now shelling villages, towns
and cities across a wide swath of Kosovo, driving over 10,000 more
ethnic Albanians from their homes, refugees arriving here Wednesday
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardment from tanks and mortars began in some areas around 9
p.m. Tuesday and continued Wednesday, refugees said. Villages and
towns were reported in flames in an arc surrounding the cities of
Prizren and Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said they were from Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
the first large group to arrive here from the city. They reported
that the city was in flames, with widespread death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels on Wednesday, Air Commodore David Wilby, a NATO
spokesman, said that a ``large number'' of refugees and some
separatist rebel troops were trapped in the Pagarusa valley, about
30 miles southwest of Pristina, where three brigades of Yugoslav
and Serb forces were ``raining artillery fire'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to confirm refugees' accounts, but there was a
stark difference in the appearance of the refugees who arrived in
Kukes on Wednesday from those who crossed the border on Tuesday,
having heeded Serbs' orders to leave or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the refugees seemed stunned, their faces frozen. On
Wednesday they look shattered, their faces contorted, many openly
weeping or on the verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were driving down the street, all the shops and houses
were burning on both sides around us,'' said an elderly man aboard
one of three city buses packed with frightened people that arrived
Wednesday afternoon from Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombardment has been going on since yesterday,'' said
Gjergj Mertur, 33, from the door of the first bus from Djakovica.
``There are hundreds of dead people. The police and the
paramilitaries are burning the houses.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man driving a tractor pulling a cart full of
refugees, said that in Prizren ``they attacked at 9 o'clock in the
evening _ boom, boom _ they fired with many types of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel of the next tractor, Zenel Kadashi said: ``All the
villages surrounding Prizren are burned down. On this tractor are
people from 10 different villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Prizren and Djakovica said that in both cities,
Serbian forces had moved from military-style encampments and taken
shelter in factory buildings to avoid becoming targets of the NATO
air strikes. There have been similar reports from other areas of
the Serbs dispersing their men and equipment for cover in civilian
areas.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 o'clock Wednesday evening, 10,000 people had passed the
border crossing at Morini, according to figures compiled by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, joining 84,600
since the crossing was opened on Saturday after being sealed for 11
months. About another 3,000 have managed to get over the border in
the rugged mountains northwest of here and are being assembled in
Kruma, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as rain began to fall, Albanian officials instituted a
new and cumbersome system of registering all refugees, who have
been routinely and methodically stripped of passports and all other
identity documents, and they processed only 200 in the space of an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   A long line of refugees, many of them on foot, was left
stretching back across the border into Serbian territory. Some
refugees estimated the length of the line at almost 10 miles.
Serbian officials asked the Albanians to please hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day it was the Serbs who delayed the flow. It
has become the custom of the Serbian border guards, after a morning
of robbing refugees and unbolting their license plates, to close
the border at midday while they enjoy a long lunch, coming back to
work at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Wednesday's refugees had been walking for three days
without food or water, they said. In some rural areas, people in
outlying hamlets went to a more central, larger village thinking
they would be safer there. One such gathering point was Rugova,
which took in people from a half dozen smaller places.
</P>
<P>
   But about 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the Serbs began shelling Rugova,
refugees from there said. They crossed the border during the night
and spent the dawn in an open field on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugova doesn't exist anymore,'' said Hasan Hyesenan, 45, who
had been a history teacher in the school there.
</P>
<P>
   Hazar Shala, 53, added: ``They started a heavy bombardment at 3
o'clock. I was one of the last to leave. They fired with tanks and
afterward they burned the village.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the rural villagers said they had hoped to be able to
remain in their homes, perhaps because they were too isolated, and
perhaps because they had not been visited by Serbian forces giving
the orders to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have an ultimatum, but hearing the shelling we left
on our own,'' said Rakip Kryezim, 30. ``At the border they took our
money, cars and identity cards. They also took 15 of the best cars,
Golf, Renault, Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man put in: ``The situation is very bad. We have nothing
with which to live.''

U.S. EVICTS YUGOSLAV DIPLOMATS, CLOSES EMBASSY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department closed the Yugoslav Embassy
here, evicting diplomatic personnel, some still clad in night
clothes, early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia declared it had severed diplomatic relations March 25
with the United States in response to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the United States notified Yugoslav officials that
under the Vienna Convention of 1961, which regulates diplomatic
relations, the Washington embassy had to be vacated by midnight
Tuesday, said Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We followed our standard diplomatic practice for cases of
broken relations,'' he said, adding that Yugoslav officials were
informed that the embassy was to ``cease operations, vacate its
diplomatic premises and send home all personnel who are not part of
a future interests section.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wedgwood, a senior fellow for the Council on Foreign
Relations, said it was a little strange that Yugoslav officials
wouldn't leave immediately after breaking off diplomatic relations,
but that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``probably thought
he could have his cake and eat it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said that although most
of the embassy's personnel have left the country, one Yugoslav
diplomat and a small support staff will remain with an ``embassy of
a protecting power.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements with another embassy, which under the Vienna
Convention would protect both Yugoslavia's national interests and
property, have not been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   Reports indicate that China is interested in serving as a
``protecting power,'' but the Vienna Convention states that the
third-party country chosen would have to be acceptable to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McClenny said, the United States will not
disturb any documents or property left inside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. will respect and protect the properties without
prejudice to the eventual settlement of property issues among all
the successor states to the former Yugoslavia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former nations of the old Yugoslav union have been fighting
over assets such as embassies since its breakup in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia had refused to turn over diplomatic missions and joint
financial accounts, but the takeover of the embassy may free that
property in Washington for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Similar embassy closings occurred after the Iranian revolution
in 1979 and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

JAPAN WARMING UP TO PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When Keizo Obuchi was seeking the prime minister's job
last summer, he was dismissed as having ``all the pizazz of a cold
pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The months since then have offered evidence that pizza can be
successfully warmed up. Nobody would describe Obuchi as
charismatic, but he is widely regarded as more effective _ and
ultimately more popular _ than most people had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to change my view on him, in that he has grown in the
job and been fairly effective,'' said John F. Neuffer, an American
who publishes a political newsletter in Tokyo. It was Neuffer who
coined the description of Obuchi last summer, causing the
expression ``cold pizza'' to be the rage of Tokyo and a new way of
describing anyone seen as dull and unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has certainly exceeded all expectations,'' Neuffer
continued, expressing a view that is widely shared, ``but he
started at such a low level of expectations that this wasn't hard
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One gauge of Obuchi's success is that he is no longer setting
records for unpopularity in opinion polls, and that his standing
has soared from execrable to merely dismal. Polls indicate that he
now has the support of 33 percent of the public, up from 17 percent
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has shown that he is a shrewd mechanic of the Japanese
political machine. It is running more smoothly than it has in
years, and this spring he pushed the national budget through
Parliament earlier than ever before in the post-World War II
period.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has forged alliances with the small Liberal Party and
with various factions, and his political skills have helped him
push a variety of economic measures into law.
</P>
<P>
   These range from a $200 billion stimulus plan to a
bank-recapitalization plan to a program to distribute shopping
coupons to people across the country in a desperate effort to get
them to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   There are mixed signs about whether all this may have halted
Japan's economic slide, and there is still vigorous debate about
whether the sparkle ahead in the tunnel is sunlight or an oncoming
locomotive. Obuchi has made no serious moves to restructure the
economy in basic ways, and critics say that restructuring is the
only way to revive Japan's fortunes in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi _ by all accounts an unusually nice and unpretentious man
in Japanese politics _ cheerfully pokes fun at his lack of star
quality, portraying himself as short on talent but long on
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a mix of three things: good luck, dullness and
perseverance,'' Obuchi told his hometown recently in a celebration
of his achievements. ``And I'm going to keep on plugging along with
those same characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone attended the celebration
and offered higher praise. Referring to his own five-year rule as
prime minister _ an unusually long reign for a Japanese leader _
Nakasone told Obuchi and the listening crowd: ``Five years is not
enough. You should aim for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   A six-year term seems a lifetime away in the politics of Japan,
but Obuchi may manage to stay in the prime minister's residence at
least for the rest of this year. He faces re-election as leader
within the governing Liberal Democratic Party in September, but as
long as the economy is holding its own he is expected to be
re-elected without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for the lower house of Parliament must be held by next
year, and the party might dump Obuchi in hopes of finding a more
charismatic standard-bearer to lead it before the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Liberal Democrat member of the Lower House wants to have a
general election under Obuchi,'' said Takao Toshikawa, editor of a
political newsletter in Tokyo. ``They don't trust Obuchi to be
their leader through a general election.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, as Toshikawa noted, no other Liberal
Democrat would clearly do better with the voters. And the
opposition Democratic Party is stumbling anew each week and now is
not expected to evict the Liberal Democrats from power.
</P>
<P>
   One area where Obuchi may leave a mark is in foreign affairs and
security policy, for he seems more willing to exercise force and
nurture military power than his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has moved to develop reconnaissance satellites and to join
an American-led missile-defense system, and in late March Obuchi
unhesitatingly ordered warships to pursue two foreign ships that
had intruded into Japanese waters, apparently from North Korea.

PROGRESS SEEN IN PATRIOTS STADIUM PROJECT STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ After weeks of stalemate, there may be
progress here in clearing the proposed stadium site for the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland Wednesday said the power
plant standing in the way of the $374 million project is a step
closer to moving.
</P>
<P>
   However, both sides said they did not believe a final agreement
assuring the steam producer's relocation would be in place by
Friday, the deadline by which the state must provide a status
report to team owner Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft is not convinced the open-air stadium can be built
along the Connecticut River by 2002, he can pull out of the deal
within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the steam plant quickly is critical to that time frame
because the location would need to be cleaned and ready for
construction by next spring to meet the 2002 date.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment on the news, other than
to say, ``We're waiting to see and review the reports that we
expect to get on Friday and then we'll take the time we need to
review those reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics said privately they expected Rowland to say,
before the deadline, that progress had been made, to avoid a public
relations disaster surrounding an issue that has won him national
attention, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the governor's office said CTG Resources Inc., the
owner of the power plant, had become more flexible in its
negotiations with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, the
nearby quasi-public agency that is trying to replace the need for
the steam plant.
</P>
<P>
   With talks stalled for weeks, CTG seems more willing to accept
some of the environmental responsibility for the contaminated site
and seems more agreeable to some tax issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if a deal to move the steam plant succeeds, another
major problem looms: Moving CTG's corporate headquarters, which
also sit on the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   CTG's chief executive Arthur Marquardt has said the company
wants $48 million to replace the 1960s building, but experts
working for Rowland have insisted that figure is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Connecituct business leaders have pledged as much as $25 million
in private donations to help defray the moving costs for the
headquarters building. None of the $374 million in funding approved
by the General Assembly in December would pay for clearing the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland met with about 20 other business leaders in the state
Capital Wednesday, reportedly to ask them for additional monetary
help.
</P>
<P>
   But after the meeting, which increasingly skeptical local
reporters were calling a ``death watch,'' the governor said he had
asked for no such thing. Rather, he requested aid in the form of
in-kind help, such as donations of free legal work and loan
guarantees, to help defray costs.
</P>
<P>
   And with a University of Connecticut poll showing public support
for the project sagging, he also asked the executives to get out
and trumpet the civic and economics benefits of a downtown stadium
_ effectively a not so-subtle pressure campaign for CTG to move
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still unclear how moving the corporate headquarters
would be fully paid for, a spokeswoman for CTG said the company was
now willing to consider other less-expensive relocation sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much more optimistic,'' said CTG spokeswoman Lynn
Blackwell, adding that the company has ``moderated our position. .
. . The point is, we're flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is a change from earlier this month, when
Marquardt and Rowland held dueling press conferences criticizing
each other and saying negotiations were going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides seem to be communicating much better now,''
Blackwell said. ``Sometimes a deadline will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an agreement by Friday ``would be pretty optimistic,
but anything can happen,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said significant progress was made over the last two
days and that the report will be delivered on time to Kraft.
``They've been briefed,'' Rowland said of the Patriots owners.
``And it looks as if they may be opening an office here soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is not an option. The Patriots will be playing in
Hartford.''

FEARFUL REFUGEES TRY TO HEAD OFF MILOSEVIC'S BRUTALITY BY FLEEING
SANDZAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA PETERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ They cluster outside the Sarajevo bus station
after descending from a row of tour buses, men standing in groups
and looking around expectantly, women sitting on overstuffed duffel
bags with their heads in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They have all left their homes behind to escape the crusade of
brutality unleashed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not refugees from Kosovo. They are from the
Sandzak, another region of Yugoslavia with a deep Muslim tradition
that may be next in line to suffer the fate of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7,000 Sandzaki refugees have arrived in Bosnia since last
Wednesday, bringing stories of beatings and murders by Serb
soldiers, forced conscription into the Yugoslav army, and tanks
massing outside their villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   But having witnessed Serb attacks against fellow Muslims in
Bosnia and Kosovo over the past seven years, and the West's
apparent inability to stop it, the Sandzaki are trying to head
Milosevic off by escaping to Bosnia and talking about what they say
is happening in their homeland. Their region is split mainly
between the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, with
portions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because we are afraid of our Serbian neighbors,''
said Bjelak Latif. ``They are threatening us with death, and
Sarajevo is our only exit.'' He and his daughter traveled by bus to
Sarajevo from Prijepolje last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights abuses have been documented in the Sandzak ever
since Milosevic assumed power in Yugoslavia in 1989. The area takes
its name from the Turkish word ``sancak,'' or district, which it
inherited from the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the region from the
Eastern Orthodox Serbs and the Roman Catholic Croatians in the 15th
century. Over the centuries a number of Slavic families gave up
Christianity and adopted the religion of the conquerors, Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the three-year war between Muslim Bosnia and Serbia
erupted in 1992, roughly 54 percent of the Sandzak's 420,000 people
were Muslim. But since Milosevic rewrote the Yugoslav constitution
in 1992, Muslims have been denied constitutional status as an
ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bosnian war, Milosevic cracked down on the region in
order to quash burgeoning Muslim independence movements. The Serbs
removed Muslims from local governments and police forces, and
surrounded the Sandzak's principal city of Novi Pazar with tanks.
According to human rights organizations, Serb soldiers and police
embarked on a campaign of intimidation that included kidnapping,
murdering and assaulting hundreds of Muslims, often during random
house searches for weapons ostensibly stockpiled for secessionist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though some estimate that as many as 80,000 Muslims have fled
the Sandzak region since 1992, most have stayed put, reluctant to
leave the area's booming, Muslim-dominated shoe and
clothing-manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
   A recent repeat of the events of the Bosnian war, however, have
struck fear in many Sandzakis. Refugees arriving in Sarajevo say
tanks and troops are again building up around Novi Pazar, leading
them to fear that the Sandzak is the next frontier in Milosevic's
odyssey to cleanse Muslims from ancient Serbs lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Sandzaki, it's a pre-emptive flight. They're worried
because they see signs that they're next,'' said Wendy Rappaport,
Sarajevo spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough of a threat for these people to leave their
country and homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety increased in the region when Yugoslav soldiers began
rounding up Muslim men in the area Thursday to serve in the
military force Milosevic is mobilizing for the ground war against
NATO he anticipates over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Buses from the Sandzak region have reportedly been stopped at
the Bosnian border by Serb police who order men off at gunpoint.
One man who gave his name only as Alam said he escaped from the
army by faking sickness after he and other Muslims were beaten by
Serb soldiers and told that they would be placed on the front lines
without weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Though reports of abuse cannot be independently verified because
of the expulsions of truce monitors and journalists from
Yugoslavia, they match Milosevic's pattern of attacking ethnic
minorities to drum up support among Serb hard-liners in times of
stress such as the current NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the experience we've been having in the Balkans for
the past 10 years, and we had a very bitter experience here in
Bosnia,'' said Nudzeim Recica, the Bosnian government official who
oversees refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recica said the Bosnian government is lobbying the international
community to monitor the situation in the Sandzak to ensure the
conflict doesn't spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions (in the Sandzak) are rising and I'm afraid something
drastic could happen, but we're praying it won't'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason fleeing Sandzakis have chosen Sarajevo as their
destination is its proximity to Bosnia, while Kosovars head mainly
to Macedonia and Albania, which they can reach by foot. Another
reason is the Sandzak's long historical and political ties to
Bosnia, the post-war population of which is overwhelmingly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Few Sandzak refugees arriving in Bosnia have requested aid
because they are receiving shelter from family, friends or others
in Bosnia's Muslim community, Recica said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the aim of many Sandzaki refugees at the Sarajevo bus
station has been to enlist Bosnian Muslim politicians in supporting
the rights of Muslims in the Sandzak, a goal that, if reached,
could fan the flames of Milosevic's wrath even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because we want to make people aware of the
position of Muslim people in the Sandzak,'' said Fahrudin Mekic of
a Muslim political party with branches in Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
``We helped the Bosnian refugees when they came to Sandzak in 1992,
so we hope they will help us out now.''

</P>
<P>
   ACUPUNCTURE FACE-LIFTS _ Acupuncture, the 5,000-year-old Chinese
healing practice, is used in the United States not only for
preventing and treating diseases, relieving pain and anesthetizing
patients for surgery, but also for face-lifts.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTIONS _ While on-line auctions have become the World Wide
Web's latest big thing, with such sites as eBay and Auction Auction
holding 24-hour global sales of everything from jewelry to
jukeboxes, the public auction is here to stay. From the community
event of a farm equipment and livestock sale to hushed art
offerings at Sotheby's on Manhattan's Upper East Side, millions of
people still buy and sell the old-fashioned way. According to the
National Auctioneers Association, 17,000 auctioneers sell an
average $162 billion of merchandise yearly.
</P>
<P>
   BAGPIPES _ Above the wail of the bagpipes, the sharp roll of the
snare drums and the silent march of sneakered feet, there is the
faint but unmistakable smell of garbage. It is the minor
inconvenience the New York City Department of Sanitation's bagpipe
band puts up with when practicing for several St. Patrick's Day
parades coming up. But for the band, whose members ordinarily spend
their days navigating a massive Staten Island landfill or operating
mechanical street sweepers, the cavernous sanitation truck garage
on the shores of the East River seems a fitting practice locale.
</P>
<P>
   BLUES _ Scott Sharrard takes the stage at Terra Blues in
Manhattan. At 22, he hardly resembles a veteran blues man. His
scanty brown goatee does not hide his fair complexion. Yeah,
Sharrard is white. But so are most of the people in the audience.
And judging from the way the crowd is swaying at the Greenwich
Village club, Sharrard can play the blues.
</P>
<P>
   CLOCKS _ Digital displays counting down the seconds to the year
2000 are cropping up faster than you can say Y2K. Countdown clocks
can be found everywhere from Times Square in New York City to the
Eiffel Tower in Paris to the desktops of computer programmers
trying to solve the millennium computer problem. But the cottage
industry that has sprung up as a result of this fascination with
the year 2000 is counting something else _ dollars.
</P>
<P>
   DATING _ A New York-based organization is playing Cupid for the
mentally retarded. The National Institute for People With
Disabilities, the largest nonprofit of its kind in the state, is
introducing a program to teach mentally retarded people dating
skills _ and then let them mingle with potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   MORMONS _ The Mormon church is taking root in Harlem. Last
November, the Mormon congregation of Harlem moved into its own
small church and membership is growing. The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, as the church is officially known, did not
even allow black men to attain the priesthood until 1978. But
Harlem is one of the communities here where the church is growing
the most quickly.
</P>
<P>
   TOKEN GARB _ A clothing company, Straphanger Designs, has put
out its new line of ``subway chic'' casualwear. The buttons and
snaps in each of the shirts are authentic ``Y-cut'' subway tokens,
direct from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL _ A new technology promising high quality audio and
video on PC's may one day bring scripts shunned by Hollywood to
people at home, complete with a virtual cast, and any musician will
be able to have music performed on computer-constructed
instruments. These are the scenes painted by visionary engineers
and analysts about the MPEG-4, a small ripple in the growing tide
of computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   WEDDINGS _ Increasingly, African-Americans are embracing what is
now called Afrocentric weddings for reasons that range from the
symbolic to the aesthetic to the cultural.

ACUPUNCTURE FACE-LIFTS, A SOLUTION FOR WRINKLES

   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people spend hundreds of dollars on skin-care
products in attempts to regain a more youthful look and to smooth
wrinkles. They try creams, ointments and herbs, as well as plastic
surgery. Or acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, the 5,000-year-old Chinese healing practice, is
used in the United States not only for preventing and treating
diseases, relieving pain and anesthetizing patients for surgery,
but also for face-lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture has been used to improve appearance for at least two
decades in this country, for patients who do not want to undergo
surgery. But only some acupuncturists will do this.
</P>
<P>
   Many practitioners find the corrective work less professionally
satisfying than treating diseases and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture is based on the Chinese philosophy called Dao. Dao
is believed to be directly related to health and well-being,
moderation and harmony in mind and body. Practitioners seek to
restore this balance through Chi, or Qi, Shen and Jing.
</P>
<P>
   Chi is said to be the energy found in the heart and lungs, in
circulating blood and oxygen. The Shen is the soul, manifested in
personality, perception and awareness of self. The Jing is
responsible for growth, development and reproduction. According to
the philosophy, the acupuncturists' role is to help people balance
their life of excesses__stress, vices, bad diet__ to achieve a
long, healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   In an acupuncture face-lift, 36-millimeter needles are inserted
into facial muscles. These needles are believed to produce tiny
electric stimulation in anatomic points bringing the blood to the
surface, in this case, the face, for better circulation, said
Phyllis M. Shapiro, an acupuncturist licensed by New York State.
</P>
<P>
   In acupuncture, there are about 2,000 spots in the body, or
acupoints, used for different treatments. The points are connected
through 12 main channels, or meridians, according to
acupuncturists.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture ``can make the skin look healthier,'' by increasing
the blood flow to the tissues, Mitchell said, ``but can't produce
drastic changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acupuncturists say it is more stimulating treating patients
to restore their health rather than enhance appearance. ``There's
less diagnosis,'' said acupuncturist Craig Mitchell from Pacific
Institute of Oriental Medicine in New York. ``It's not necessary to
have a thorough interview'' with the patient if she wants to tone
up her face, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   For him as for other colleagues, using acupuncture as a tool for
healing is a more challenging job than making people feel good by
``pumping up'' their faces, said acupuncturist Cameron Bishop of
Western Communities Family Practice Association in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Face-lifts are ``like washing a car,'' Bishop said. ``It's
boring work. Would you rather wash a car or do something more
interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   For patients seeking a faster and more permanent alteration in
their appearance, plastic surgery is the best solution. Plastic
surgery is often recommended for patients who are 45 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery uses incisions to cut the loose skin and fat off
the face. ``It's not just stretching and pulling the skin,'' said
Minas Constantinides, who is a plastic surgeon who works on
face-lifts and is a member of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Face-lift surgery is an operation that costs between $7,000 and
$20,000 and it lasts for years. Acupuncture treatments would take
at least 10 weeks to show improvement and do not assure a permanent
physical change. But with acupuncture the treatment is much
cheaper, costing about $115 per session, at one session a week.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture is one of the least expensive ways to have a
face-lift without spending time and going through surgery trying to
look younger. And while some acupuncturists prefer an in-depth
diagnosis and a healing treatment, if they have to ``lift faces to
make people feel younger and happier'' they will do it, Bishop
said.

PUBLIC AUCTIONS: STAYING ONCE, STAYING TWICE, HERE

   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From a raised lectern in a hardware-cluttered
workroom, Tom Perillo glared out over the hundred or so men waiting
for a piece of the action. Time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirtythreehundred, thirtythreeyeah, thirtyfourthirtyfour
too-slow,'' Perillo sang out. Burly, hard-handed contractors
nodded, raised fingers, and flashed numbered cards with surprising
grace and speed. Perillo seemed to need another pair of arms to
signal each bidder. ``Fortythreesir. Now fortyfour yes-or-no,
yes-or-no? Fortythreehundred I've-got-it-now, sold! At
fortythreehundred to buyer number seven-four-nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perillo had unloaded a floor-to-ceiling rack of sheet metal
before the second hand of his watch hit 60. The next item, enough
fasteners to fill a truck, moved even quicker. Piece by piece, the
mild-mannered, business-suited auctioneer sold off a Bronx
metalworking and roofing company _ $95,000 worth of materials,
power tools, and heavy machinery _ in under four hours.
</P>
<P>
   While on-line auctions have become the World Wide Web's latest
big thing, with such sites as eBay and Auction Auction holding
24-hour global sales of everything from jewelry to jukeboxes, the
public auction is here to stay. From the community event of a farm
equipment and livestock sale to hushed art offerings at Sotheby's
on Manhattan's Upper East Side, millions of people still buy and
sell the old-fashioned way. According to the National Auctioneers
Association, 17,000 auctioneers sell an average $162 billion of
merchandise yearly.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Despite the convenience of an on-line auction,
nothing compares to the retail theater of a live event. At
Perillo's auction, even the company's former owner, retiring after
50 years, watched the show. ``It's not sad at all,'' said Leonard
Kent of Pelham, N.Y., who attended with his wife Jan. ``I have a
lot of interest in what things go for.''
</P>
<P>
   The public auction also offers an in-person look at the
merchandise. ``You want to kick the tires. You get a total view,''
said Dennis Hado, a New Jersey machinery dealer. Hado visits
auctions to hear what people will pay for used equipment. He's
usually surprised _ as he was when an industrial press he'd valued
at $18,000 went for double that price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no bargains at auctions,'' Hado said. ``People
get auction fever and they're hoping to win the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rittenhouse, a plumbing contractor from Quakertown, Pa.,
added, ``You got to know what you got going in. [Most people] get
it in their minds they want it, they'll go home thinking they got a
good deal whether they did or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Most auctiongoers disagree. Tom O'Donoghue, a metalworker from
Mount Vernon, N.Y., insisted he had not only beaten the market
price on a drill press and several other items, but also purchased
quality in the sturdy old hardware. ``You can't buy that anymore.
If you can't buy it, it's a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advantages of the public auction include the efficiency of
a one-day sale; the thrill of live, competitive bidding; and, of
course, the auctioneer's chant, a way to move a lot of property in
a little time that no computer scoreboard can rival. ``That's
something that can't be duplicated,'' Perillo said.
</P>
<P>
   As the most memorable aspect of the auction, the chant has,
fairly or unfairly, stereotyped the auctioneer. ``So many people
have this image of the auctioneer as rural, wearing a cowboy hat,
who talks fast,'' said Holly Neuman, director of publications for
the National Auctioneers Association. A good auctioneer, she said,
is also a skilled businessman, or businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good career for someone who wants to be fairly
independent,'' she said. ``You own your own business, set your own
hours, and can earn a lot of money doing it. Plus it's a family
atmosphere.'' Many in the business today follow in the steps of a
parent or grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   If Dad wasn't an auctioneer, though, an aspiring bid-caller can
still learn the ropes at auction school. The Missouri Auction
School in St. Joseph, Mo., founded in 1905, is the oldest and
largest. Six hundred students a year attend the school's nine-day
course to earn the 85 credit hours some states require for
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are diverse, said K Talbot, assistant to the president.
``Small towns, big towns, they come from overseas. Doctors,
lawyers, judges, we've had a nun. These are not farmers and
hick-town people.''
</P>
<P>
   For $625, the school Newsweek dubbed ``the Harvard of
auctioneering'' teaches practical business, product knowledge, and
yes, public speaking. Under the instruction of state champion
bid-callers, students develop a patter through the use of ``filler
words'' _ any word that isn't a price _ tongue twisters, and smooth
elocution. Homework includes nightly practice at Kansas City
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Students don't compete against each other, Ms. Talbot said. They
just better themselves. ``They don't have to be fast. They just
have to be clear.'' Overcoming stage fright is not an issue at the
school. ``If you're scared of that,'' she said, ``you're in the
wrong profession.''
</P>
<P>
   For graduates, though, the job is guaranteed to splash into
their personal life. ``It's a novelty, not like accountants or
attorneys,'' Tom Perillo said. ``People always want to you talk
fast, or sell something. They try and become an auctioneer
instantly.''

WHITE BOYS SING BLUES: NEW GENERATION REINVENTS TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By MICHAEL SANDLER  
 c.1999 COLUMBIA NEWS SERVICE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Sharrard takes the stage at Terra Blues in
Manhattan. At 22, he hardly resembles a veteran blues man. His
scanty brown goatee does not hide his fair complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Sharrard is white. But so are most of the people in the
audience. And judging from the way the crowd is swaying at the
Greenwich Village club, Sharrard can play the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blues is really your love,'' said Sharrard, the lead
vocalist and guitarist for the Chesterfields, a three-piece blues
and R&AMP;B band from Milwaukee. ``It's your voice. It's got nothing to
do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north of the club, one longtime music producer says
that while white guitar players have plenty of talent, they will
never understand the roots of blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't play it because they haven't lived it,'' said Bobby
Robinson, a music producer in Harlem who has been recording blues
artists in New York for nearly 60 years, including the legendary
Elmore James. The crowd hanging around his store, Bobby's House of
Music on Eighth Avenue, echoed this sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped a growing number of fans from plunking
down cash and credit cards for CDs by white blues musicians. In the
past few years, blues music has enjoyed a major resurgence and
crossed over to pop charts. New York club owners report larger
crowds at blues shows. House of Blues, a mega restaurant and
merchandise corporation, has spread to six cities. The franchise
has hotels in Chicago and Las Vegas and its own music label.
</P>
<P>
   While the blues were originated by black sharecroppers singing
about hard times, today's two hottest blues stars are young and
white. Both musicians are being marketed to an audience younger _
and whiter _ than the legendary Delta could ever have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kenny Wayne Shepherd, a 22-year-old guitar player from
Louisiana. His second CD, ``Trouble Is...,'' went platinum and was
named Blues Album of the Year by Guitar World Magazine, which also
named him its Blues Artist of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider Jonny Lang, an 18-year-old whiz from Fargo, N.D. His
debut CD, ``Lie To Me'', went platinum in 1996 when he was just 15.
His current release, ``Wander This World,'' was No. 1 on Billboard
magazine's blues chart, No. 109 overall and has sold more than
412,000 copies since its October release.
</P>
<P>
   These young musicians are reaching new audiences. And in some
stores, their CDs are found in new sections _ easy listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are more hip to it,'' said Duggins King,
a part-owner of Terra Blues, which features live blues seven nights
each week. ``I think it is becoming a lot more in the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   And while both Lang and Shepherd win praise for their guitar
playing, the blond lads also have sex appeal that promoters have
been quick to market. Vanity Fair photographed the pair for its
January 1999 issue. The black-and-white glossy of Shepherd shows
him lying outdoors, his long dirty blond mane mussed in the grass.
Lang gets two pages where he looks more like a J Crew model than
America's No. 1 blues artist. Think Hanson. Think the Gap, for whom
Lang played a riff on a TV ad. Both musicians have Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish well for any artist,'' said Clarence Spady, 35, a
Pennsylvania blues guitarist who is black. ``But to give Jonny Lang
a blues riff in a Gap commercial? How many Gap commercials have you
seen Johnny Copeland in? Today, when people come to see a blues
band, they expect to see a zoot suit. The record companies are
really playing a marketing game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gap is a long way from the Mississippi Delta where Robert
Johnson and Charlie Patton helped found this innovative sound in
the 1920s and 30s. It was the music of sharecroppers during the
Depression. They sang hard-luck stories about women who done them
wrong. Many lamented the racism of the day. Some of the saddest
songs were written from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know guys who earned 50 cents a day-half a dollar a day!''
said Robinson, who as a child listened to the original blues men in
South Carolina of the 1930s. ``These guys came up with a rough
time. Sharecroppers on cotton farms. They had no money and they had
to do something on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Chuck Berry incorporated the roots of blues into a
style now known as rock-n-roll, and Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye
blended it into soul and R&AMP;B in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, white musicians sang the blues long before Shepherd,
Lang and Sharrard were born. Elvis Presley used it to jumpstart his
career. Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck updated the sound in the 1970s
by using slow, pronounced guitar strokes. And the late Stevie Ray
Vaughan added a raw style of guitar that crossed over to white
fans.
</P>
<P>
   With these white artists, the guitar _ not the singer _ became
the dominant element of the blues. Purists insist the blues must be
sung. But superstar Kenny Wayne Shepherd doesn't even sing on his
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are guitar players,'' said Bill Sims, 50, a blues
singer and musician who is black and has been playing blues since
the age of four. ``The audience became predominantly white. For me,
the blues has always been a vocal tradition of what is around
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most musicians agree that rap music is the new blues. And once
again, the voice is the vehicle. Today's stars still sing about
racism and women, but they also criticize the new hard times in the
inner city. Robinson added rap artists to his list in 1979 with
groups like the Funky Four and Treacherous Three. With the
exception of the Beastie Boys, few white artists have sustained
lasting rap careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rap music is in the tradition of the blues,'' said Sims,
who was turned on to the music by his four children. ``They are
talking about the blues, about hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharrard concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap is about oppression,'' said Sharrard, a rap fan. But
``blues is about pure human suffering and it does not have to be
black or white. It is American music. It belongs to all of us.''

   NEW YORK _ Digital displays counting down the seconds to the

fascination with the year 2000 is counting something else _
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going very well,'' says John Leung, president of
the Acimex Corporation of Northfield, Ill. Leung anticipated that
American companies would be interested in millennium promotional
products two years ago, when he began importing countdown products
from the Far East. Today he buys thousands of mass-produced key
chain clocks, watches and calculators, affixes a company logo and
resells them to clients such as ADP and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea,'' Leung said, ``even though it is not really
the millennium.'' Technically, the new millennium does not begin
until 2001, but that makes little difference to those cashing in on
calendrical fever.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Levitt, president of Philadelphia-based Data Display
Systems, plans to spend New Year's on a quiet beach. Nevertheless,
like other countdown clock manufacturers, he is enjoying the
booming business while it lasts. His company sells $15 desktop
clocks as well as more expensive, larger displays to retailers,
like Bloomingdale's. ``This is one of the biggest events ever in
the way of promotions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's, for instance, has 20-foot-long clocks on display
outside its stores to promote gifts priced from $5 to $95 that
include T-shirts, hats, hair clips and, of course, miniature
countdown clocks. JC Penney, Macy's and other retailers offer
similar products.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Postal Service, which purchased 8,000
eye-catching countdown clocks from Data Display Systems, is using
them to advertise its ``Celebrate the Century'' stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch handed out countdown clocks last year during a
conference it sponsored to examine the various industries that
would be affected by the year 2000. None of the company's analysts,
it turns out, specifically monitors digital clock manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 is not a huge money maker for all clock
manufacturers. Franklin Instrument Company of Warminster, Pa., says
millennial countdown clocks are only a fraction of its overall
business, which consists primarily of developing clocks and timers
for schools, drug companies and the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's just another date,'' Larry Fischer, vice president
of sales at Franklin, said of the turn of the century. ``But I
guess as a public service or a novelty, the millennium is a big
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin recently sold a customized 2-foot-long timepiece with
5-inch digits to an ABC-News affiliate in Tampa, Fla., for $600.
But the company hopes that before too long it can land a multiple
clock order like its competitor Data Display Systems. ``I'm
disappointed that we didn't get to bid on the government
contract,'' Fischer said of the lucrative postal service deal.
</P>
<P>
   A.H. Greenwald, 54, a mail handler at the 112th Street post
office in New York City, says customers have told him that the
millennial countdown clock in the lobby is incorrect. ``Someone
said the clock is off,'' he said. Nevertheless, Greenwald is so
used to the rapid-fire backward counting that he has become
proficient at reading the large digital display as a regular
timepiece.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the model, once the clocks finish counting
backwards, they will either function as regular clocks that count
hours, seconds and minutes or as digital calendars that mark
months, days and years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the days are numbered for digital clock
manufacturers and retailers, who realize that no matter how good
business may seem today, all the fuss will be over in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as a relief to Adrienne Casco, 31, a graphic designer
at Bernard Hodis Advertising in San Francisco. Casco says the large
digital displays are disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one outside of Macy's is constantly ticking,'' she said.
``It's kind of nuts. I feel like I'm going to blow up.''

SANITATION WORKERS PLACE MUSIC IN A DIFFERENT BAG 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANDREAS TZORTZIS  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Above the wail of the bagpipes, the sharp roll of the
snare drums and the silent march of sneakered feet, there is the
faint but unmistakable smell of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   It is the minor inconvenience the New York City Department of
Sanitation's bagpipe band puts up with when practicing for parades.
But for the band, whose members ordinarily spend their days
navigating a massive Staten Island landfill or operating mechanical
street sweepers, the cavernous sanitation truck garage on the
shores of the East River seems a fitting practice locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's nice, we march out on the pier, with the beautiful
yachts and water,'' said the band's president, Jim Moran. ``When
the weather outside is bad, we march up and down rows of sanitation
trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   From the quietest hamlet to the busiest metropolis, the powerful
cacophony of bagpipe music is wont to sound on any holiday marked
by a parade, traditionally from a police or fire department
ensemble. But in New York City, where the department of sanitation
wears uniforms and features a hockey team and a resident artist who
crafts art out of garbage, it's almost a foregone conclusion that
the department's employees should form a bagpipe band to join the
city's police officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to kill me to hire a band,'' said Dennis Diggins, the
band's pipe sergeant, and the lead soloist. ``We have 7,000
uniformed members. For us not to have a bagpipe band, to me, was
blasphemy.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Moran assembled 15 pipers and drummers in 1993, all of whom
had no idea how to play. It took the sage instruction of
ex-sanitation department employee and pipe playing veteran Danny
Sprague to get the group ready for its first gig: the Emerald
Society's annual dinner in April, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped get us over the wall.'' Diggins said of Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Since those awkward first two years, the band has been building
a reputation. Last year, the now 30-piece ensemble, which includes
one woman, played at Shea Stadium, in parades all over New York on
Memorial Day, and for John Glenn's ticker-tape celebration on Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have in a very short time shown themselves to be full of
beautiful hot air,'' said Paula Young, a spokeswoman for the
sanitation department. ``They certainly do show that we are strong
and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from New York City's three uniformed departments, a host
of state and city agencies and groups also have bagpipe bands. The
large number is indicative of the instrument's popularity, which
has rocketed over the past 20 years, according to Jock Nesbit, the
owner of the Pipers Cove in New Jersey, a store carrying Scottish
and Celtic items.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Scottish immigrant has been playing the bagpipes
since he was 10. He has owned the Piper's Cove _ where a full St.
Patrick's Day kilt set rents for $110 a day _ for 20 years and has
seen business expand with the popularity of the instrument.
Recently, he compiled a list of local bands in the metropolitan
area and discovered the number has climbed from 10 to 80 since the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nesbit attributes the growth to the burgeoning Irish population
in New York City. But Judy Collins' recording of ``Amazing Grace''
probably didn't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they want a piper when somebody dies,'' he said.
``They want to be buried to the sound of Amazing Grace. ''
</P>
<P>
   For band members, making a connection with an Irish heritage is
interesting, but not crucial. Other than becoming a member of the
Emerald Society, a city organization that celebrates Irish culture,
there is no requirement that band members be of Irish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Pipers must pay for their own bagpipes, which start at $1,000,
and drummers for their own drums. The group's board of directors
organizes fund-raising drives to cover the costs of kilts, reeds
and instructors, which sometimes climb to $25,000, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid success the band has experienced has a lot to do with
the time its members put in, Sprague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy because they put so much into it,'' he said.
``They meet extra days a week. There was never a time when I
thought they'd never make it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The band practices once a week together, but many of the pipers
and drummers take private lessons on the side. The pipers also
bring their brand of Irish and Scottish culture home to their
living rooms and basements.
</P>
<P>
   But their neighbors and spouses alike were glad to hear that, to
become a successful piper, band members must first practice on the
long-stemmed recorder known as the chanter, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those chanters probably saved a couple of marriages,'' said
Mark O'Brien, 46, who would play in the basement at work and move
to the roof when it got too loud.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, polishing their skills and performing is
important to the members because they see their band as a way to
dispel a stereotype of the New York sanitation worker as
uncultured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive image,'' said Dennis Shock, a union
representative for the sanitation workers by day and band member by
night. ``People see that we're not just sanitation, we're people
who play pipes and do other things.''

DATING SERVICE FOR THE MENTALLY RETARDED 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired. (EDITORS: In graph 4, Bobra is correct.)   
 By ALISSA LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For mentally retarded people, dating can be an
insurmountable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Their acquaintances are typically limited to housemates,
co-workers or people they meet at day habilitation facilities. Not
only is their pool of potential partners constricted, but they
sometimes lack the social skills necessary to successfully develop
romantic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a New York-based organization is playing Cupid. The
National Institute for People With Disabilities, the largest
nonprofit of its kind in the state, is introducing a program to
teach mentally retarded people dating skills _ and then let them
mingle with potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's sexuality is a human right,'' said Bobra Fyne, who
developed the program, ``the same as the right to breathe and eat,
and we'll support that.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization, commonly referred to by its previous
name, the Young Adult Institute, provides support services for more
than 12,000 mentally retarded individuals in New York City, Nassau,
Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's clients were largely on their own when it came
to romance. And that led to frustration and hurt feelings. Fyne
recalled an instance when someone in the agency joined a dating
service and was continually turned down by non-retarded women.
``That's the disappointment we don't want people to have,'' Fyne
said.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles that mentally retarded people face in their love
lives may get considerable attention soon. The new film ``The Other
Sister,'' starring Juliette Lewis, tells the story of a ``slightly
retarded young woman'' who finds love and etches out a life for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Hollywood to acknowledge that people with a disabilities
need to date is unbelievable,'' said Pat Sutherland-Cohen, who
supervises the new dating program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``You And I,'' came about after seven months
of discussions among agency staff. Applicants must have a standing
relationship with the agency, be capable of consenting to sexual
relations, and have three letters of recommendation confirming that
they do not exhibit behavior potentially harmful to others.
</P>
<P>
   After satisfying those criteria, the person schedules an
interview with a program volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid disappointment and frustration, the staff strives to
ensure that ``everyone is on the same page _ looking for a
potential companion,'' though not necessarily a sexual
relationship, Fyne said. The organizers weed out people who are
merely looking for ``brunch dates,'' she explained. People who
answer with statements like, ``I want to be somebody's soul mate''
and ``I want to find the right person to share my life with,'' are
prime candidates for the service.
</P>
<P>
   After passing the initial screening process, program members
attend skill-building socials. At the first one, held last month,
about 30 people participated in activities intended to maximize
interaction, such as a scavenger hunt, picking conversation
starters from a bowl of prepared questions and finding someone with
whom they had ``three things in common.''
</P>
<P>
   At the socials, agency staff teach classes that address topics
as serious as preventing sexually transmitted diseases and as light
as 101 places to go on a date. Participants also learn dating
basics, such as making sure they leave the house with money, who to
call when in danger and how to walk away from a potentially
hazardous situation.
</P>
<P>
   While the staff does not play ``matchmaker,'' they do try to
offer encouragement and suggestions to the inexperienced
participants. At the first meeting, one woman finally had the
chance to talk to the man she had had a crush on for the past year,
Fyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Program leaders don't know yet if any love connections were
made, but they did see people exchanging numbers. ``It went 1,000
times better than I expected,'' Fyne said. ``I really thought we
would have to work much harder as staff to make sure people were
mingling.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``You and I'' is clearly serving a need, there are plenty
of mentally retarded couples within the agency that have found each
other without the help of a dating program. Larry Weiss, a
51-year-old Manhattan native has been dating Elaine Bernstein, 52,
for 19 years. The couple, both mildly mentally retarded, met while
living together in a group home in Astoria, Queens. Now on separate
floors of a group home on East 36th Street in Manhattan, the couple
do laundry every Friday, watch television and visit each other's
families during the holidays. On the weekends, they venture out
into the Murray Hill section of Manhattan to find a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Elaine wouldn't speculate. But Larry had
definite ideas.
</P>
<P>
   After almost two decades, ``as far as marriage,'' Larry said,
``I'm ready to go.''

THE MORMONS BRANCH OUT IN HARLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By TANYA WEINBERG  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Freckle faced, smiling, and with his brown hair
freshly clipped, Shawn Warren looked like he just stepped out of a
Norman Rockwell painting on a recent Saturday afternoon. But the
wide concrete sidewalk was part of a New York City landscape,
complete with boxy housing projects. In midtown Manhattan, he said,
he'd be lucky if one person stopped to hear what he had to say as a
Mormon missionary. But he likes approaching passers-by in this
neighborhood. This is Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 20, is from Provo, Utah, and prone to calling things he
likes ``neat.'' In navy suit and a name tag, he walked up to three
middle-aged black men who chatted along a wire fence outside the
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, how you guys doin'?'' he asked, broadening his smile.
</P>
<P>
   The men stopped their conversation and each in turn took
Warren's extended hand in greeting. He introduced himself as Elder
Warren and told them he had an important message about Jesus
Christ, a message that would strengthen families.
</P>
<P>
   The men did not interrupt, but politely declined to make an
appointment for another day. Warren told them to call the number on
the church's television commercials if they changed their minds or
wanted a free video, Bible or Book of Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed and another round of handshaking and smiles
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Karl Malone to get out of Utah and come play for the
Knicks!'' one of the men joked, calling after Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church's taking root in Harlem may seem as
incongruous as the presence of an eager, young man from Utah. But
last November, the Mormon congregation of Harlem moved into its own
small church and membership is growing. The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, as the church is officially known, did not
even allow black men to attain the priesthood until 1978. But
Harlem is one of the communities here where the church is growing
the most quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Race is an issue for Warren and his partner missionary, or
``companion,'' Robert Ferguson as they preach the gospel to the
black and Hispanic residents of Central and East Harlem. They have
been shouted at on the streets, called ``cracker'' and ``white
devils,'' and they encounter people who say the Mormon Church is
racist. But over all, they say, they are received warmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the graciousness and cultural hospitality that you will
find in most black communities around the country,'' said the Rev.
Raphael Warnock, assistant pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock said he was aware of Mormon evangelism in Harlem: ``I'm
suspicious of it, quite honestly.'' He said that most white
churches have some racist history and the Mormon Church once had
explicitly racist policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the church denies any racism and points to recent growth in
Africa and South America. Since the early 1980s the Mormon Church
has doubled its membership to more than 10 million. The church does
not keep statistics based on race, a spokesman said, but it has
noticed growth in urban, multi-ethnic neighborhoods in the United
States. Roughly half of the growth in the New York area is among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The church sends about 60,000 people, most of them young men on
a two-year mission, and some women, to 160 nations or territories.
Stationed in the metropolitan area, Warren and Ferguson rotate
through different neighborhoods and will spend only a few months in
Harlem. ``It's kind of like going to a foreign country,'' said
Ferguson, 20. He said he loved the people he had met, but he missed
the mountains of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday services the congregation meets in the small building
acquired from the Jehovah's Witnesses. For a year before the move,
they met in the banquet rooms of Sylvia's Restaurant, famous for
its soul food. The congregation's president, Ron Anderson, who is
white, introduced two guest speakers, who were white, to the 53
mostly black congregants.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCallister, a member of the church high council,
illustrated a talk on self-reliance with anecdotes about growing up
in Happy Valley, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny Wells, 42, who grew up in the Bronx and lost her husband
in a shooting, was baptized into the church the week before, along
with her five of her children. At the service they became full
members. Four white men and one of the president's two black
counselors, or assistants, put their hands upon her head and called
upon the Holy Spirit to enter her body.
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas, Wells had nearly been evicted from her
apartment. When an agency came to her rescue, she credited God.
Wells called the Mormons after seeing the television ad offering a
free Bible. She knew nothing about the church. After the
missionaries came to her apartment a number of times to teach her
about the church, she decided to join. ``I'm looking for a better
life, a happy life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After services the men and women broke off into separate groups.
Brenda Woods, one of the leaders of the Women's Relief Society,
searched the hymnbook for a song people knew. She had little luck
and the women had trouble following the tune she picked.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is black, said things would have to change for the
branch to prosper. Church officials said that they wanted people
from the community to run the Harlem branch themselves but that the
membership was not ready. Although average attendance has doubled
to 60 in the last year, almost all the members are new to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' husband, Van, is one of the church counselors and the son
of Sylvia, of Sylvia's Restaurant. He became a Mormon in 1979 in
South Carolina. ``It was just something that felt right,'' he said.
But he is too busy running aspects of the family business to take
on the branch presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we want to see some blacks up there,'' he said,
nodding to the humble dais. ``That'll make a difference.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ride it or wear it. The public now has a choice when
it comes to the subway, one of New York City's leading tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A clothing company, Straphanger Designs, has put out its new
line of ``subway chic'' casualwear. The buttons and snaps in each
of the shirts are authentic ``Y-cut'' subway tokens, direct from
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tokens are a real piece of New York history,'' said
Straphanger owner George Stydahar. ``New York City is identified by
its subway system, one of the biggest in the world. Why not make
something to commemorate that?''
</P>
<P>
   When the New York subway fare was raised from 10 to 15 cents in
1953, the Metropolitan Transit Authority introduced the Y-cut
token. Commuters had previously dropped nickels and dimes into the
subway turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than a dime, the token displayed an ``NYC'' logo in the
center. The Y was cut out, so commuters could easily distinguish it
in their pockets from other coins. The Y-cut tokens were retired in
1970 in favor of larger tokens.
</P>
<P>
   The Metrocard, a small plastic card used to swipe in at the
turnstiles, was introduced a few years ago. There speculation among
some subway riders that the Metrocard could eventually phase the
token out of use. Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The token is just a cool piece of memorabilia,'' said David
Adelson, 22, a day-trader from Manhattan, who bought a shirt from
the Straphanger line. ``It's just classic, the definition of
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Stydahar's customers are baby-boomers who ``want
to own a piece of New York history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot from the customers, especially when they're
ordering online,'' Stydahar said. ``A lot of them talk about how
when they were growing up, they remember taking that subway ride to
Yankee Stadium with their buddies. They said that the token
represents their youth and New York's wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Will something so utilitarian be accepted as fashion statement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about anything goes in fashion these days,'' said Bob
Antoshak, a fashion consultant with Information Resources
International, which deals with international textile trade. ``It's
certainly a new thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoshak said the token-as-button idea was too new for him to
predict success, but he asked, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The subway token as accouterment is not new. Ms. Johnson, a
jewelry artist in Manhattan, used tokens to make pendants during
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I did was legal,'' she said, not wanting to
publish her full name. ``I did change the wording on the token.''
</P>

   Johnson etched ``Native New Yorker'' onto each of the pendants
and plated them with 14-karat gold. She sold the pendants for $75
each in her booth in the Diamond District. What galvanized all of
her customers was that each wanted to grab onto something that is
truly New York, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA and the Straphanger Design are banking that same emotion
will build business. Each shirt in the subway chic line has more
than two buttons, so consumers will be able to display both sides
of the token. The face reads, ``New York City Transit.'' The back
reads, ``Good For One Fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Straphanger received a license from the MTA to use the vintage
tokens. When the company approached the authority to ask if tokens
were available, ``they told us that they had about two million of
them stashed away in a warehouse in Queens,'' Stydahar said.
``They're in a secret location, and they won't tell us where it is.
That's a lot of tokens, but if we need more, the MTA will
manufacture them.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the subway chic line are T-shirts, a sweatshirt and
a denim button-down shirt. Prices range from $20 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts are on sale at New York Transit Museum gift shops,
FAO Schwarz, Pants And..., located in Rockefeller Center, and
online at www.straphanger.net.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious Straphanger line is doing well, especially at the
New York Transit gift booth in Times Square, said employee Julia
Mulero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out of our entire stock, with people coming in and
buying stuff for Valentine's Day,'' she said. ``They're just doing
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in Times Square, Mulero said, she sells shirts mostly to
tourists. They are also a big hit among Transit workers who want to
take their work home with them, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who come in here to buy the shirts, they
know what they're coming for,'' Mulero said. ``The only
advertisements I've seen for them is in the MTA employee newspaper,
but a lot of people seem to know about it, the New Yorkers do.''

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PICTURE AND A THOUSAND WORDS

   NEW YORK _ A new technology promising high quality audio and
video on PC's may one day bring scripts shunned by Hollywood to
people at home, complete with a virtual cast, and any musician will
be able to have music performed on computer-constructed
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   These are the scenes painted by visionary engineers and analysts
about the MPEG-4, a small ripple in the growing tide of computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may take a few years, the technology is expected to
change the way people do business, shop, watch television, view
film, listen to music and interact with one another by computer.
</P>
<P>
   MPEG-4, or the Motion Pictures Expert Group 1, layer 4, which
compresses data and sends it over phone or Internet connections in
smaller bits at a faster pace, was approved last October by the
International Organization for Standardization, an international
group of engineers and academics.
</P>
<P>
   A non-governmental organization, ISO _ which comes from the
Greek word ``isos'' or equal _ established a standard for MPEG that
will allow corporations to create products that can be used
interchangeably, like a Panasonic VCR can be used with a Sony TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is working on a handheld video recorder that can be used
with Windows software to play videos on a PC. Microsoft has already
begun working with the technology, said Gary Schare, product
manager for Windows Media Technology. One example: corporate
training videos available over the Internet that would eliminate
the need for executives to travel for training or bring carts of
video equipment into a conference room to play a VHS tape, he said.
News broadcasts will also be available at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Small or individually owned businesses are also likely to
benefit from the technology. For example, an architect could
recreate the design of a house and all its furnishings in three
dimensions without eating up space on the PC, said Peter
Glaskowsky, senior analyst for Microprocessor Report newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally the difference between a picture and a thousand
words,'' he said. ``You will be able to recreate a scene by giving
your computer a description, not just transferring a photo.'' The
computer with MPEG-4 technology has the ability to decode the
description and the capabilities to create the described in a very
refined form.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual orchestra could be brought to life on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an instrument sounds like is very different than digital
music,'' Glaskowsky said. ``It's much more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   MPEG-4 will also deliver interactive TV, said Professor
Alexandros Eleftheriadis, associate professor of electrical
engineering at Columbia University. Consumers will be able to order
their household appliances and jewelry by opening a small window on
a shopping channel. Sports fans could call up data on their
favorite player at will during a game and movie buffs will be able
to channel-surf during films, keeping up with a small summary in a
window to one side. Chat rooms will be furnished with graphics and
video images.
</P>
<P>
   It will be like VH-1's Pop-Up Video. Except, ``instead of VH-1
making those comments you could make them and only your friends
would see them,'' said David Card, a senior media analyst at
Jupiter Communications, a new media research company.
</P>
<P>
   Card likened the ISO's standards for MPEG_4 to buying a wrench
at Sears. ``Somebody has decided the size of the nuts and bolts,
otherwise you could have never made wrenches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MPEG-4 is another tool that has its good and bad points like
anything else. If it takes off in the next 10 years, Glaskowsky
said, the real influence it will have will be on the film and
television industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Hollywood and New York have interesting ideas,'' he
said. ``But there's a whole lot more interesting people and ideas
that we don't get to see. I have no access to those people or ideas
until they get work in Hollywood or on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they have the tools, ``500 digital TV channels are
nothing compared to 500,000 TV transmissions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that MPEG_4 will bring interactivity
to television.
</P>
<P>
   Though the technology will bring television-quality images to
the Internet, said Joe Jennings, a vice president for InterTrust
Technologies Corporation, the people who use computers and those
who watch television are very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV market is a 'sit back and view,' the computer market is
a 'sit forward and interact,' '' Jennings said. ``I hate to be a
skeptic but I'm not convinced that TV viewers are going to want to
interact with their television.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Wanda Wright talks about her recent,
African-theme wedding, she glows with a contagious excitement
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally different,'' Mrs. Wright said, her voice liquid
with laughter. ``Absolutely beautiful. I couldn't believe it
myself. I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her second wedding. Ms. Wright, 44, cried not because she
ended a 13-year spell as a divorcee, but because of the
symbol-ridden ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Her runner was hand-painted in gold with African mystic symbols;
the altar of the church in Brooklyn was draped with an image of a
slave ship.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Sherman Wright, wore head-turning, flowing
African attire. They invoked the spirits of their African ancestors
and poured libations. Then, they jumped the broom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has more meaning,'' Wright said in reference to how her
second wedding compared to her first, which was totally Western.
``We wanted a ceremony that would reflect who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone in this yearning. Increasingly,
African-Americans are embracing what is now called Afrocentric
weddings for reasons that range from the symbolic to the aesthetic
to the cultural.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for ways to connect uniquely to their own
history and fortify their unions,'' said Harriette Cole, former
fashion editor of Essence Magazine and the author of ``Jumping the
Broom: An African American Wedding Planner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``White wedding dress, for example, is Victorian,'' said Cole
who married in African fashion in 1993. ``But I am not part of
Victorian history. It is important for us to know that there are
aspects of our culture that are powerful and useful. That awareness
has grown dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Afrocentric weddings have grown in the last five years, as have
the number of African-American wedding dress designers and
Afrocentric wedding fairs in response to this trend, said wedding
consultants and planners.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Brawley, who officiated at the Wrights' wedding,
said his church has performed 35 Afrocentric weddings in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the African traditions resonate with us more than the
Western ones,'' said Brawley, an assistant pastor at the St. Paul
African Baptist Church in Brooklyn. ``We keep Christ, but we also
have culture. For us as a church, Afrocentric wedding has more
meaning. It is spontaneous, personal and communal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, people are now realizing that they have an
alternative,'' said Gboyega Adewunmi, a Brooklyn-based designer
with Nigerian Fashion and Fabrics, the fashion outfit that designed
the Wrights' wedding clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Afrocentric weddings you can live your culture,''
Adewunmi said. ``You can choose fabrics that appeal to your taste
and shape. You can choose from a range of colors, not just white.''
From a shy start in 1992, he now takes about 50 wedding orders a
year.
</P>
<P>
   This evolving tradition takes different forms. Some differ only
in the use of African fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Others incorporate pulsating African drums and music and dance,
and serve African food at receptions. And yet others invoke
ancestors' spirits and pour libations. Some use spices to explain
married life and bless their union. Many more jump the broom, a
trend gaining popularity in marriage ceremonies of middle class
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumping the broom was started during slavery when it was
illegal for slaves to marry,'' Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our forefathers found a way of marrying without alerting
the slave masters,'' he added. ``So when we do this now, it is a
tribute to the resourcefulness of our ancestors. We are saying if
it wasn't for their struggle we would not be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   It also symbolizes jumping to a new life, others say.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Willie Wilson of the Union Baptist Church in
Washington, D.C., uses 12 different symbols in his wedding
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the spear and shield to talk about protection and
leadership in marriage,'' said Wilson who is also the author of
``The African American Wedding Manual.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also used the kolanut, a two-sided, bitter tropical
nut, ``to talk about the difficulty of being one, that there would
be bitter moments in marriages and there should be commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbols help us to explain and remember things that could be
abstract,'' said Wilson, who was ordained as a traditional African
priest in Gambia and Ghana. ``Then we have the drummers and the
dancers. Apart from having more meaning, African weddings have more
excitement when compared to the non-feeling, staid and more solemn
European weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said Afrocentric weddings started gaining popularity in the
United States after a television series was made out of ``Roots,''
a novel by Alex Hailey. Increased cultural awareness in
African-Americans in the 1980s, and the proliferation of African
magazines, wedding books, wedding fairs and street festivals also
broaden the appeal of African marriage ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Some ceremonies, such as pouring libations and invoking spirits
of the ancestors, seem at odds with Christianity and Islam. Some
ministers would never have them in their churches. Wilson is not
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not antithetical to Christianity,'' he said.
``Communion in Christian church is nothing but libation. There is
not lot of difference at the core of all religions. For long,
Europeans made us reject our culture as primitive or pagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those taking to African wedding thus see it as a
political point, an attempt at redeeming values that have been
demonized and despised. ``People are saying I choose to reject many
of the wrong assertions made about us for many years,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think ancestral ceremonies and values help spice up
ailing marriages. ``A major difference is that African weddings are
unions of two families not just two individuals,'' said Cole, who
said the web of family support has helped in her marriage. ``If you
get the blessing of all family members and everybody was involved,
this could be an insurance for the marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high divorce rate in America,'' Cole said. ``People
are asking, 'How can we fortify our marriages?' They are not
finding the answer in Western traditions. The values of African
culture could be useful to all, not just people of African descent.
This is an alternative that works.''

A-ROD'S NUMBER, PLAYING STYLE HONOR BOYHOOD IDOL DALE MURPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the generation that grew up south of Baltimore and
east of St. Louis in the 1980s, there was only one baseball team _
and it was something of a national joke. Every night, on every
cable system, TBS pumped in the Atlanta Braves, hyping them as
``America's Team.'' Problem was, the Braves lost 90 games a year
and were about as popular as mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   One Miami boy felt sorry for them. Alex Rodriguez would finish
his homework and hop over to the couch every night at 7:40, ready
to call balls and strikes for Rick Mahler or Pascual Perez or some
other hapless hurler. He admired the way the Braves played hard, no
matter the score. And he couldn't take his eyes off the guy wearing
No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Murphy won the National League Most Valuable Player award
in 1982 and '83, and excelled in all phases of the game. A
prodigious power hitter who also could run and field, the Portland
native has Hall of Fame credentials. But what impressed Rodriguez
most was Murphy's attitude: he never complained, never argued,
always carried himself with dignity and class.
</P>
<P>
   So Rodriguez wore Murphy's number. He still does. When he was
17, and Miami had a major league team of its own, Rodriguez went on
the field before a Marlins game to accept an award as the national
high school player of the year. The Marlins were playing the
Colorado Rockies, and Murphy was in his last days as a major
leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked up to him, I didn't say much,'' Rodriguez said.
``I was very shy. I was in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy greeted Rodriguez warmly, and wished him luck. Now living
in Belmont, Mass., while supervising a five-year Mormon mission,
Murphy said he wants to see Rodriguez again.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days, I'd like to thank him for what he's doing
for the game,'' Murphy said. ``He is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is humbled by those words, the same way Murphy is
humbled to know Rodriguez wears his number. A father of eight,
Murphy said he appreciates the positive impact players like
Rodriguez have on children. The ex-player in Murphy calls Rodriguez
the player he always wanted to be, an infielder who could do it
all.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century approaches with Rodriguez poised to be what
Murphy was for a five-year period in the '80s: the very best in
baseball. At 23, Rodriguez already has a batting title and a 40
home run/40 stolen base season. His ``understated excellence''
recently drew comparisons to Christy Mathewson, Joe DiMaggio and
Cal Ripken in a Newsweek piece by George F. Will.
</P>
<P>
   And his looks and charisma make him one of the most marketable
athletes in sports. Think you've heard the name ``A-Rod'' a lot
already? Just wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is going to be one of, if not the, icon of baseball for
the next 15 years,'' said Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras. ``He's
that type of player, he's that type of person. Really, the sky's
the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a baseball player that will end up with national
endorsements, end up as an icon, it will be him. When we
copyrighted the `A-Rod' name when he was in the minor leagues, he
kind of laughed. I said, `That monicker is going to be used quite a
bit.' Sure enough, that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A-Rod active wear? A-Rod breakfast flakes? Eu d'A-Rod cologne?
Rodriguez said he will take it as it comes. As the A-Rod tidal wave
comes in, it is the old-school values, instilled partly from
Murphy's example, that Rodriguez calls on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing concerns me about him, because he's already shown such
good perspective at such a young age,'' Murphy said. ``But I think
one thing that's always a challenge for an athlete is losing
perspective of who he really is, his place in the game, putting
himself on a different level than everybody else. That can tend to
happen with athletic success, and you lose respect of people inside
and outside the game when you do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex has a great gift, but I think he knows it doesn't really
make him any different than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez nods in agreement. He said he wants coaches and older
teammates to get on him when they see the need. He likes that about
baseball, and points to the educational system as a parallel. There
is a hierarchy, Rodriguez said, with coaches and teachers above and
players and students below. It's the way things should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people treat you like you're a king or something, which
is not really right,'' Rodriguez said. ``See, that's the one thing,
you cannot be complacent about treating people right, treating
people with respect and really staying grounded. And my attitude
is, I do everything in life _ the way I save my money, the way I
try to pursue my education, the way I treat people _ like I've
played my last day yesterday. Just realize, hey, this is almost a
fake world we're living in, because everything is catered to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And when you are not expecting it, Murphy said, that world can
disappear. Age caught up quickly to Murphy, who retired at 37 two
homers shy of 400, and he cautioned that Rodriguez must maintain
his work ethic without being consumed by increasing demands on his
time.
</P>
<P>
   But one of those demands _ for all people, Murphy said, not just
athletes _ should be community service. Rodriguez took that to
heart this winter, building lights at a Miami youth baseball field,
donating $20,000 to the Sammy Sosa Foundation for hurricane relief
in the Dominican Republic and raising $140,000 for the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Miami at his annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial concerns will occupy Rodriguez's time before
long. Rodriguez's contract expires after the 2000 season, and
speculation already has begun on the when, where and how much of
his next deal.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said, and Rodriguez agreed, that contract negotiations
are the least enjoyable part of a player's job. Murphy never
shopped his talents as a free agent, and Rodriguez signed a
four-year contract in 1996 that let the Mariners buy out his
arbitration years for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ridiculed by everybody for my contract, but at 20 years
old I was secure for the rest of my life,'' Rodriguez said. ``I
know exactly what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His next decision will be more complicated. Like Murphy with
fans in the South, Rodriguez has developed a bond with fans in the
Northwest. He treasures that, he said, but he also doesn't want to
end up without a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who spent his prime with poor Atlanta teams and never
reached the World Series, understands Rodriguez's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard thing for fans to understand why a player would
leave,'' Murphy said. ``It's nothing personal. It happens all the
time in the business world, but nobody knows about it. He can have
an impact wherever he plays, but when you become part of a
community, you can just be part of some great things for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wanting to win, I think that's a healthy attitude for him
to have. That's why he's out there, and that's what he should
desire in his career. I regret the chance not to have a ring, sure.
Those were some frustrating times. I was optimistic we'd be on the
verge of something, but it never worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez doesn't want to say the same thing when his career
ends. Players in Murphy's era made millions, too, but as Rodriguez
points out, teams like Minnesota and Kansas City still won
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the Mariners ever can. Rodriguez is
anxious to see the impact of Safeco Field on the Mariners'
competitiveness in a system increasingly weighted toward
high-spending clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not on three or four teams, you're not going to
win,'' Rodriguez said. ``Bottom line. You're not going to kid each
other. The team that's going to spend $90-115-140 million in the
future is the team that's going to win. That's a sad situation, how
baseball let it get to this. So if you say, well, I'm going to play
for a team in Milwaukee, you're going to choose to stay in
Milwaukee your whole career and you're 100-percent guaranteed
you're not going to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when Dale Murphy played, all it took was probably two
good pitchers who weren't going to cost you $100 million, probably
more like $14 million between the two, and you had a chance to win.
So the difference between a middle team and a great team wasn't all
that huge, money-wise. Now you're talking about the Yankees' $100
million payroll compared to Montreal at $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest thing is I love the people in Seattle and the
following I have with the people in Seattle, and the organization
has been really good to me, too. I still feel we have a chance to
win here. It's just a matter of getting the right pieces to the
puzzle. We have a new stadium now, so we'll see what happens.''

LET'S SAVOR DOW'S RISE TO 10,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) To paraphrase Bogie's wistful remark to Bergman in
``Casablanca,'' ``We'll always have Dow 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Dow Jones industrial average does in the
months ahead, its close Monday above 10,000 was a memorable moment.
If you have any emotional stake whatsoever in the stock market,
cherish it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who dismissed it as inconsequential should be reminded of
Oscar Wilde's definition of a cynic as someone who knows the cost
of everything and the value of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They're intellectually impaired, because they have no sense of
history. Either that or they're too young to have ever experienced
a spirit-crushing bear market. Remember that bleak December day in
1974 when the Dow bottomed at 578? That was almost 460 points lower
than its then-record closing high in December 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a longer-range perspective, from May 1969 to November
1979 the industrials lost almost 18 percent. It didn't get better
as the '80s dawned. The market tried to recover but fell back with
a thud. Remember the depths of despair reached in August 1982, when
the Dow industrials bottomed in that bear market at 777? From peak
to trough, the average plunged nearly 25 percent in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1980 to November 1982 there was a double-dip
recession. Unemployment was in double digits, and the economy
wasn't growing. Unless you were there and actively involved in the
market, there is no way to understand the atmosphere of utter
hopelessness that existed for stock investors. For the better part
of 15 years there had been no sustained period during which
Americans could feel unreservedly optimistic about their economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as it turned out, an extremely difficult time to make
money in the stock market. Not surprisingly, many individual
investors lost interest and withdrew to lick their wounds.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, those who have been involved in the stock market
only since the mid-1980s have experienced a few brief scary moments
and some protracted periods of doldrums. Nevertheless, none of them
can relate to the sort of despair that preceded the current market
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Making money in stocks today must seem the easiest thing in the
world. Polls of investment-oriented Americans bear this out
regularly. Most surveyed expect double-digit returns from stocks in
the years to come, but this view ignores the reality of history.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed over the long 20th-century continuum, the last few years
have been the exception, not the rule. The exception may continue
its run for a good while longer, but this doesn't make the Dow's
ascent to 10,000 any less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 16 years from the first time the Dow briefly
crossed 1,000 during intraday trading in early 1966 until it
finally closed and subsequently held above this elusive plateau for
good.
</P>
<P>
   From then to now, it took just a tad longer to add 9,000 points.
By any standard, this is impressive stuff. Stock market winners of
the last few years who try to pretend otherwise betray an inability
to appreciate the good fortune they probably don't deserve.

ETHNIC CLEANSING ALMOST COMPLETE, SURVIVORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KULA PASS, Kosovo _ Driven from their homes, stripped of every
official document that might prove their identities, numbed by
shock and bitter cold, the refugees, in their long columns,
materialized from a driving snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``God alone knows where my family and I are going,'' said Kurtes
Rama, a 30-year-old postal worker from the Kosovo city of Pec
(pronounced Pesh), as he floundered through the drifts late
Wednesday with his wife and two small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friendless in the world. I don't even have a scrap of
paper to show my name. They took my work card, they took my
passport, they took my driver's license.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo is not only continuing in the
face of NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, it is rapidly
heading toward completion. Refugees trying to escape the tormented
province told of whole communities emptied of ethnic Albanians, and
all but obliterated by rampaging Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few days, there will be no one left in Kosovo except the
Serbs and the dead,'' said Shureje Gogon, 41, who with her
9-year-old daughter, Fitore, pushed for three days through the
frigid mountains to escape the ethnic vengeance of Serb
paramilitary forces in Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the houses in the Albanian neighborhoods were burning,''
she said, trembling greatly, her eyes vacant of everything but
sheer exhaustion. ``The smoke was so thick it blotted the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, Pec was a thriving community of 100,000.
More than 80 percent of its population was of Albanian heritage.
Today, according to fleeing inhabitants, the city is a smoldering
ghost town, as Serbs torch Albanian houses and level larger
structures with tank shellfire.
</P>
<P>
   In a cruel twist, Serb squads are confiscating all
identification documents, and even children's medical
perscriptions. ``It is the way they say to us, `See, you don't even
exist,' '' said Halid Madupi, a middle-aged factory worker. His
face was swollen and reddened from what he said were blows from
Serb police angered when he did not hand over his work card quickly
enough. They said, `You have no job, from right now. There is
nothing for you. You must leave.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Madupi said he and his wife were force-marched from the city of
their birth in a long column flanked by armed Serbs dressed in
camouflage and jaunty red berets. ``They said, `Stay in line. If
you turn left, we will shoot you. If you turn right, we will shoot
you. If you stop, we will shoot you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to Madupi, when a boy of about 16 panicked and tried
to break ranks, he was shot dead. An older man also sought to
escape and was shot, though Madupi said he was unsure if that man
died.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has been sealed from the outside world by the Yugoslav
military since the start of the American-led NATO bombing campaign
meant to force the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to pull back his army from the province and allow an international
military force to guard the province's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be few Albanians left to protect. A pair of
American reporters who entered Kosovo Wednesday by way of a remote
mountain pass near Pec encountered a seemingly endless stream of
refugees, many driven from their homes just hours before.
</P>
<P>
   The escapees told consistent tales of Albanian neighborhoods
methodically emptied, then destroyed. All the refugees interviewed
said the ultranationalist Serb militias seemed especially obsessed
with taking away every form of identification.
</P>
<P>
   The luckiest refugees were allowed to escape in cars. Others
traveled crammed into the backs of trucks. One elderly man drove a
vintage tractor, pulling a produce wagon loaded with 30 members of
his extended family. He declined to give his name. ``I am too
scared to tell you,'' he said. ``At 6 this morning, Serbs pushed
into our home and said we must leave immediately. They told us this
land we call our home can never be our home again. We must go
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees were trudging out of Kosovo on foot, some
wearing only sweaters and shivering uncontrollably in the fierce
cold.
</P>
<P>
   They did not fit the world's usual image of refugees _ they were
not starving or ragged wretches fleeing some Third World horror.
Instead, the tragedy unfolding in Kosovo is one of ancient
animosities flaring against an eerily modern backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees were often ill-dressed for the weather, but they
were well-dressed, a few men even in suits and ties and many women
in brand-name outdoor wear. And if the narrow road they followed
led mainly through thick forest, they also marched miserably past a
new ski area, its fancy chalet lodge and lifts closed because of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   None of the refugees interviewed seemed to harbor much faith
they would ever return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finished,'' said Maslum Redepi. ``Kosovo has been
ethnically purified. The Serbs laughed as we left and said we would
never dare come home.''

U.N. RIGHTS INVESTIGATOR OFFERS ANOTHER BLISTERING REPORT ON IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ President Saddam Hussein's rule in Iraq has one of the
bleakest human rights records of any country since the end of World
War II, an investigator for the United Nations said Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Max van der Stoel, who has surveyed Iraq since
1991, said the country's leadership systematically denies freedom
of thought, expression and association to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regime that is not capable of starting to open up,
but feels it must remain in power by ruthlessly suppressing any
other opinion,'' van der Stoel declared shortly before presenting
his report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has refused to allow van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign
minister, to visit the country since his first report in 1992.
Since he could not investigate at first hand, van der Stoel said,
he was forced to gather information from Iraqis who had left the
country and from nongovernmental organizations that monitor the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has reacted furiously to van der Stoel's latest report, one
of a dozen he has produced in the last seven years. When the report
was announced, Baghdad issued a statement accusing him of
``inventing lies'' and of being a ``dishonest observer, reckless
and incapable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruling Iraq, the investigator said, ``entails systematic and
systemic violations throughout the country, affecting virtually the
whole population.'' He described a grim picture of wholesale
executions, military attacks on civilian populations,
disappearances and forced relocations, and accused Iraq of not
trying hard enough to obtain adequate food for its citizens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Iraqis have ``no freedom of speech or action, since
the mere suggestion that someone is not a supporter of the
president carries the prospect of the death penalty,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome, he told a press briefing, are the
continued killings of Shiite clerics. The killing of Ayatollah
Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr and his two sons on Feb. 19, he said, was
the third of Shiite religious figures in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unconfirmed reports of strains between Shiite
Muslims and Saddam's majority Sunni government, including
widespread demonstrations and riots, since al-Sadr's death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government says the killings were a result of disaffected
Shiites trying to drive a wedge between the government and the
Shiites, but van der Stoel dismissed this notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many indications that the government is not so
innocent as it claims to be,'' he said. ``We've seen three murders
in one year in a country where security services dominate the whole
of life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van der Stoel also cited an attack on Grand Ayatollah Sheik
Bashir Najari on Jan. 6 by armed men who used a hand grenade. The
attack left three people dead and others, including the cleric,
wounded.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not offer evidence that funds have been
diverted, he said Iraq needed to do more to ensure that its people
have adequate food and that money is not spent on ``building
splendid palaces.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van der Stoel also cited Iraq's failure to trace the 625
Kuwaitis who have been missing since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
He said only three cases had been resolved and information given on
only 150 of those missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, van der Stoel said the human rights situation in Iraq
had ``few comparisons in the world since the end of the second
World War.'' Since then, he said Wednesday, he ``has had no cause
to change'' his view.

RUSSIAN SHIP READIES FOR DUTY NEAR YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia has until now tempered its harsh criticism over
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia with pleas for a political
solution. But Wednesday, Moscow added a little muscle,
</P>
<P>
   preparing one warship for travel to the Mediterranean and
readying as many as six others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a senior Russian commander said that Moscow would
not hesitate to use its nuclear weapons, if forced. And Russian
lawmakers asked the Kremlin to begin arms shipments to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came as Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov returned
empty-handed from a one-day trip to Belgrade and Bonn aimed at
stopping the fighting in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said one warship of the Black Sea
Fleet would leave the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol Friday and
another six were ready to sail ``to ensure Russia's security when
the Defense Ministry considers it necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has escalated its protests against the bombing of
Yugoslavia by saying NATO's action threatens Russia because it sets
a precedent for intervention in local conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the ships, most likely missile frigates and
antisubmarine frigates, would be used to gain information about
NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said Russia was considering other ``decisive actions,''
but did not elaborate. The chairman of Russia's General Staff,
Anatoly Kvashnin, chose the moment to remind the world that Moscow
no longer ruled out the option of launching a preemptive nuclear
strike against a potential foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes to a matter of whether Russia will exist or not,
then everything the military has, including nuclear weapons, should
be used,'' Kvashnin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the Kremlin had said it would only use nuclear
weapons in retaliation to a nuclear attack. But that doctrine has
been widened to include conventional conflicts in which Russian
forces were outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure'' Kvashnin's comment ``was intended as a semi-veiled
threat,'' commented Pavel Felgenhauer, military analyst for the
daily newspaper Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, which has cultural ties with its fellow Orthodox
Christian Slavs, the Serbs, has revived the language of the Cold
War to condemn the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov lashed out at what he
called the ``barbarous aggression against Yugoslavia,'' and called
Western reports of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo by Serb forces an
``American propaganda campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, passed a resolution asking the Kremlin to consider
arming Yugoslavia with Russian weaponry, such as the latest
antiaircraft technology.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin and Primakov have said that Russia
would not get involved militarily in the conflict over the
separatist Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Both have said they want
Russia to continue its partnership with the West, despite the split
over NATO's airstrikes. And Russia's tough economic situation makes
it hard to make good on its threats.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a spokesman for the Black Sea Fleet acknowledged a
lack of fuel that would make it difficult for many Russian ships to
reach the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia. And Felgenhauer said the
fleet lacked sufficient provisions for many ships to sail.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's show of force, however symbolic, raised concern
from US officials. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States did not view the deployment ``as a particularly
helpful gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior US government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity expressed hope that Yeltsin intended to stick to his
promise, delivered in his state-of-the-nation address Tuesday, not
to let Russia become involved in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the harder times'' in US-Russian
relations, the US official said. But he added: ``What I'm hearing _
and these are high-level people _ is that there is every desire to
keep the bilateral programs going.''
</P>
<P>
   While Russia has pulled out of military cooperation with NATO to
protest the airstrikes, the official said that the alliance and
Russia had agreed Wednesday on amendments to a Cold War-era treaty
limiting conventional forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the US Embassy in Moscow, closed for the last
four days, would began issuing visas Thursday. Police promised
protection after last week's raucous demonstrations and a failed
rocket attack on the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
   Popular reaction has been so widespread that some moderate
Russian politicians express concern that NATO is inadvertently
helping Communist and nationalist parties in Russia gain support.
</P>
<P>
   But many Russians say they oppose NATO's airstrikes not because
they want to vote communist, but because they think they are wrong.
Some Russians have signed up to fight in Yugoslavia. But according
to a poll published in the newspaper Kommersant, 57 percent of
those surveyed said Russia should use diplomacy to stop the
fighting, while only 2.8 percent said Russia should get involved in
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that our young democracy has already taught its
citizens to live according to the norms of international law,''
Kommersant concluded. ``Russia has become a completely democratic
state.''

   Hey, it's easy. Just pour the oil on your bread. If you get a
small saucer, pour the oil on the saucer and dip your bread. Pour
directly or dip. Either way is OK. If there is one plate of oil for
the whole table, just share, family-style, politely.
</P>
<P>
   More and more restaurants, especially Italian ones, are adopting
the Mediterranean tableau, serving olive oil as a regular
condiment, leaving the butter in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to have bread and butter too, don't hesitate to ask.
In most restaurants, the customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   But when the oil is there, consider pouring it on your bread, or
drizzling on top of a hearty vegetable soup or grilled vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur Michael Hirschberg remembers shocking his staff 10
years ago when he said he wanted to put olive oil instead of butter
at the table at his Ristorante Siena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiters reacted in horror. I might have said we are going
to put rat poison on the table,'' Hirschberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that restaurant is Mistral and there still is olive oil,
with a pour spout, at every table. Mistral serves 100 lunches a
day, and gets maybe one or two requests for butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to understand. Some people pour it on to the
bread, others on the plate and dip. I don't know if there is a
proper way,'' Hirschberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Marin County olive oil maven Nan McEvoy pours her signature oil
into soup and onto fresh bread. Healdsburg olive oil producer
Ridgley Evers likes drizzling his on fresh fish or delicately
cooked French lentils.
</P>
<P>
   The point of fine olive oil is that it enhances the taste of the
food.
</P>
<P>
   Save the very best as an exquisite flavoring in butternut squash
soup, over grilled vegetables or dotted on gently steamed fava
beans, Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one best oil. You should buy an inexpensive oil to
cook with and you should use a series of very good oils to finish
with. You will end up with better flavor, less fat and spending
less money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the wine connoisseurs like to say: Try it. Your opinion is
the most important one.

PROGRESS SEEN IN PATRIOTS STADIUM PROJECT STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ After weeks of stalemate, there may be
progress here in clearing the proposed stadium site for the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland Wednesday said the power
plant standing in the way of the $374 million project is a step
closer to moving.
</P>
<P>
   However, both sides said they did not believe a final agreement
assuring the steam producer's relocation would be in place by
Friday, the deadline by which the state must provide a status
report to team owner Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft is not convinced the open-air stadium can be built
along the Connecticut River by 2002, he can pull out of the deal
within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the steam plant quickly is critical to that time frame
because the location would need to be cleaned and ready for
construction by next spring to meet the 2002 date.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment on the news, other than
to say, ``We're waiting to see and review the reports that we
expect to get on Friday and then we'll take the time we need to
review those reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics said privately they expected Rowland to say,
before the deadline, that progress had been made, to avoid a public
relations disaster surrounding an issue that has won him national
attention, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the governor's office said CTG Resources Inc., the
owner of the power plant, had become more flexible in its
negotiations with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, the
nearby quasi-public agency that is trying to replace the need for
the steam plant.
</P>
<P>
   With talks stalled for weeks, CTG seems more willing to accept
some of the environmental responsibility for the contaminated site
and seems more agreeable to some tax issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if a deal to move the steam plant succeeds, another
major problem looms: Moving CTG's corporate headquarters, which
also sit on the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   CTG's chief executive Arthur Marquardt has said the company
wants $48 million to replace the 1960s building, but experts
working for Rowland have insisted that figure is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Connecituct business leaders have pledged as much as $25 million
in private donations to help defray the moving costs for the
headquarters building. None of the $374 million in funding approved
by the General Assembly in December would pay for clearing the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland met with about 20 other business leaders in the state
Capital Wednesday, reportedly to ask them for additional monetary
help.
</P>
<P>
   But after the meeting, which increasingly skeptical local
reporters were calling a ``death watch,'' the governor said he had
asked for no such thing. Rather, he requested aid in the form of
in-kind help, such as donations of free legal work and loan
guarantees, to help defray costs.
</P>
<P>
   And with a University of Connecticut poll showing public support
for the project sagging, he also asked the executives to get out
and trumpet the civic and economics benefits of a downtown stadium
_ effectively a not so-subtle pressure campaign for CTG to move
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still unclear how moving the corporate headquarters
would be fully paid for, a spokeswoman for CTG said the company was
now willing to consider other less-expensive relocation sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much more optimistic,'' said CTG spokeswoman Lynn
Blackwell, adding that the company has ``moderated our position. .
. . The point is, we're flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is a change from earlier this month, when
Marquardt and Rowland held dueling press conferences criticizing
each other and saying negotiations were going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides seem to be communicating much better now,''
Blackwell said. ``Sometimes a deadline will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an agreement by Friday ``would be pretty optimistic,
but anything can happen,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said significant progress was made over the last two
days and that the report will be delivered on time to Kraft.
``They've been briefed,'' Rowland said of the Patriots owners.
``And it looks as if they may be opening an office here soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is not an option. The Patriots will be playing in
Hartford.''

FLUSH WITH CASH, BUSH HINTS AT PRESIDENTIAL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bolstered by more than $6 million in donations
in less than a month, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday he
was leaning more toward announcing a campaign for the presidency
because of the early outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign,'' said Bush, who formed a presidential
exploratory committee last month. ``I wanted to make sure that
behind the polls and the phone calls that there was some substance.
I think this is the first indication that there is good support.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was inching closer to making a decision to seek the
Republican presidential nomination, he responded: ``More than
inches. It's feet and yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presidential exploratory committee, which he formed to
test the waters for a possible run for the White House, opened a
bank account on March 4. By Wednesday, more than $6 million was on
deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not held a single fund-raising event and has made few
political appearances outside Texas. The committee raised the money
through ``friend-to-friend'' contacts and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, has campaigned steadily and has held several
fund-raising events. Gore's campaign has raised $7 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored that we've raised, I think, a little more than $6
million, and our accountants are still counting,'' Bush said after
giving a speech to the Conference on Right Choices for Youth.
``This is just the beginning, and I've got a lot more work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to see if there was true support for his
candidacy before officially deciding to become a candidate _ a move
he won't make until after the state Legislature wraps up its
business May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarterly reporting period ended Wednesday, and Bush's
committee will release the names and home states of contributors
when it files its report with the Federal Election Commission on
April 15.
</P>
<P>
   All presidential hopefuls must report to the FEC on April 15 how
much they raised between Jan. 1 and March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been ahead of his potential GOP opponents in the polls
and appears to be leading them in terms of fund-raising as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the vice president under Bush's father, former
President George Bush, is expected to have raised about $2 million
in the first reporting period, a spokesman said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, conservative leader Gary Bauer and
Ohio Rep. John Kasich are expected to report at least $1 million
each in contributions, their campaign officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is considering bypassing federal matching funds for the
primary campaign, a move that would allow him to disregard federal
campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   If he isn't tied to financial restrictions in the primary, he
might be able to compete better against millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who is financing his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matching-fund decision will be made later on next fall,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign advisers have said the governor would need to raise
about $50 million to forgo the federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be pleased if we can raise double the amount of money
we've raised thus far by June 30,'' Bush replied when asked how
much money he expected to raise in the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Bush visited with another GOP delegation that
wants him to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to ask Texas to share him with America,'' said Alan
Novak, the GOP state committee chairman in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Novak was joined by Republican National Committee members Bob
Asher and Christine Toretti and other GOP officials from
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been approached by a number of delegations of
Republican state lawmakers, other governors and members of
Congress, urging him to seek the nomination.

THORNTON CENTRAL TO BRUINS' EFFORT AGAINST CANADIENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- No. 1 in the draft. No. 1 in the hopes and wishes of
Bruins fans. And Thursday, in the city that once boasted the Forum
of Horror, Joe Thornton is expected to be in the middle of the
Bruins' No. 1 line when they face the Montreal Canadiens at the
Molson Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton practiced Wednesday at the Ristuccia Center outside of
Boston with Sergei Samsonov and Dmitri Khristich as his wingers.
Until further notice, which in these changing times could be as the
puck leaves the referee's hand for the opening faceoff, that would
make Jumbo Joe the center between the club's two most talented
wingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good with the puck, just great with their hands,''
said Thornton, less than 24 hours after the Bruins played in a
lethargic, near-hitless 2-1 loss to the Kings on FleetStreet. ``All
I have to do is get them the puck in open space and let 'em do
magic with their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's ascension to the No. 1 pivot comes at a time when
center Jason Allison, who assumed the top job last season, is
struggling with a hand injury. It also comes at a time when the
Bruins are in need of re-establishing their skating and hitting
games. Allison wasn't anywhere close to his `A' game in the loss to
the Kings. Team-wide, the Bruins were far too lax in their skating
and, consequently, nearly non-existent with their hitting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cleaning the pool,'' said an animated Pat Burns,
implying that their sticks were nothing more than vacuums meant to
keep a pool fit for swimming. ``I was trying to be positive behind
the bench. I was back there, saying `C'mon, get in their faces . .
. get in their legs . . . lock 'em up.' I wouldn't say it was like
beating a dead horse _ because you would have shot it after two
periods.''
</P>
<P>
   A new line of Samsonov-Thornton-Khristich isn't going to change
all that. The Bruins are a troubling 0-1-2 in their last three and
need an 18-skater, 60-minute commitment to regain some momentum
before the playoffs start. For that matter, they still haven't
locked up a playoff berth, still in need of distancing themselves
from the Panthers and Rangers to solidify a second straight
postseason invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, provided he keeps the new combination intact, will look
for his new SKaTe line to rejuvenate an offense that has averaged
only two goals per outing over the last three games. Samsonov ended
a personal 10-game scoring drought Tuesday with his 21st goal.
Other than that, the Bruins rarely caused a threat once inside the
offensive blue line. Thornton had a golden opportunity to drill a
15-foot slapper from the slot but opted instead to carry deeper
toward the net, only to close so deep that he completely lost the
scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came down to (the Kings') level,'' said Thornton. ``We
didn't skate and we didn't hit. We thought that it was going to be
easier than it was, and because of that we didn't get everyone to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of what challenges the Bruins now, too, is their talent
level _ a point Burns subtly reminded the media of after practice.
He made a point of saying he called together his young line of
Landon Wilson, Shawn Bates, and Cameron Mann (the Baby BMW line)
between periods Tuesday night and showed them video of how they
missed opportunities to check and deliver hits that have to be made
if they want to remain off the route 95 shuttle to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Hey, I hear this stuff all the time _ the coach
doesn't like me, I don't get playing time, I'm not getting a
chance,' '' said Burns. ``Well, here's their chance. And I showed
'em on the video, they're out there checking with their hands and
sticks. You can't do that here, not in this league . . . I wish
people would understand that . . . I wish everyone would understand
that. Imagine going up against Rob Blake with a hand or a stick?
C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach added that the BMW trio wasn't alone in its lack of
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anson) Carter's got to be more physical, too,'' he said.
``And Heinzie (Steve Heinze), there's no reason for him not to
finish his hits. Allison is hurting a little bit, too, but he's
been so competitive lately _ I've no complaint there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, what Burns has is Thornton in Allison's spot. Nine
games to go and still tinkering. As the season draws to a close,
the Bruins are still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were 5-4-0 over their last nine games last season, a
mark that would all but guarantee their locking up a playoff berth
this season. The Rangers, with eight games left as of Wednesday
morning, would have to collect 15 of an available 16 points just to
tie the Bruins at 87 points. The Panthers, who began the day with
10 games remaining, would have to collect 15 of an available 20
points . . . With Thornton paired with Khristich and Samsonov,
Allison moved into a trio with Heinze and Carter.

   Astros
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BY its very nature, baseball is a game that almost forces us to
look to the past with a sense of romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   We genuinely believe the players of yesteryear played harder and
with more passion and zeal than today's major leaguers. We believe
they would have done so whether it made them wealthy or whether it
paid them like peanut vendors. We believe they would have done so
regardless of the fame or the status that comes with being among
the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   We long for that type of player; we search for any semblance
among today's stars and, if we're fortunate enough to find one, we
call him a throwback _ as in a throwback to the good old days, when
the game was played the way it was meant to be played.
</P>
<P>
   If such a player exists today, he plays for the Astros and he
answers to the name Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio or Ken Caminiti. All
three are throwbacks in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Biggio covered in dirt from head to toe, there can
be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Bagwell hustling down the first-base line on an
obvious ground-ball out with the enthusiasm of a Little Leaguer,
there can be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Caminiti willing himself onto the field with
injuries that would disable less courageous players, there can be
no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   They all are, and it's that type of will and desire that ranks
each among the best players to wear an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   From the days of the shooting-star logo to the wild colors of
the rainbow jerseys, if you're looking for Houston players who
elicit memories of baseball's glory years, look no farther than the
three stars the Astros are counting on to lead them to a third
consecutive National League Central Division title and the
franchise's first World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three guys play the game as well as it can possibly be
played from the standpoint of effort, determination and so on,''
Astros president Tal Smith said. ``I don't necessarily subscribe to
the fact the game was played so much better years ago, from a
standpoint of intensity, as it is today. We always _ from a
standpoint of nostalgia _ think it was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've followed baseball since the 1940s, so I can recall it
vividly. There are players today _ certainly (Bagwell, Biggio and
Caminiti) _ who are the epitome of anything anyone could ask for in
a ballplayer. Twenty years from now, I suspect people will be
referring to players as throwbacks to the way Cammy, Craig and
Baggy played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti broke into the big leagues in 1987; Biggio made his
debut the following year. They were fortunate enough to play with
veterans such as Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, Buddy Bell, Terry Puhl,
Craig Reynolds, Bill Doran and Alan Ashby, who taught them how to
play the game ``the right way,'' as Biggio often says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 22-year-old kid at the time,'' Biggio said. ``I
thought I knew everything when I actually knew nothing. I learned a
lot just by sitting, watching and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell wasn't so fortunate. When he arrived on the scene in
1991, the Astros were in the midst of rebuilding, and there were no
seasoned veterans to set an example for younger players _ only
Biggio and Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   What they may have lacked in baseball savvy, they made up for
with the effort that is their calling card to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way that I know how to play the game, and
that's to go all out,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't try to do it that
way; that's just the way it is. That's the way you should go out
there every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti first shared a big-league diamond
during the spring of 1991. Things were different then; Biggio was a
catcher, and Bagwell had come to camp to unseat Caminiti as the
Astros' third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, an Astros coach at the time, solved
that problem by suggesting Bagwell be shifted to first base. The
rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me all spring to make my conversion from catcher to
second base,'' Biggio recalled. ``But that spring, Baggy learned
how to play first base in two weeks because that's all the time he
had after they decided he was going to play first base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost 97 games in 1991, but it was obvious they could
build around their three stars-in-the-making, who were becoming the
best of friends. They were clueless as to the heights their careers
would reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rookie, and they were only in their third year or
so,'' Bagwell said. ``I didn't even know if I belonged in the big
leagues. Who could have known at that time what kind of players we
would become?''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, they made the All-Star team together and
Bagwell won the National League's Most Valuable Player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the year we knew that we had kind of arrived,''
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, one of the triplets was about to exit. After the
1994 season, the Astros' foundation was cracked by the rapidly
changing economics of baseball. With Biggio, Caminiti and Steve
Finley approaching free agency, the Astros were at a financial
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't agree on a new contract with Caminiti, so they
traded him and Finley to San Diego in a blockbuster deal that
brought current starters Derek Bell and Ricky Gutierrez to town.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the Astros' building blocks had been reduced
from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' Bagwell said. ``But we knew there was
a chance our team would be broken up if we didn't win in 1994. I
guess we just didn't know it would happen the way it did. We all
hated to see Cammy go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knew they were trading away a good player when they
dealt Caminiti to San Diego; Bagwell and Biggio believed their
sidekick was on the verge of a career breakthrough. But it's
doubtful anyone predicted the extent of Caminiti's breakout.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 30 home runs and 99 RBIs in four seasons with the
Padres _ his bests with the Astros were 18 and 80, respectively _
and won an NL MVP trophy of his own in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was capable of that, but he needed to prove to
himself that he was that type of player,'' Bagwell said. ``Cammy is
very emotional, and I would even say that he's insecure at times.
After that year, he believed in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti played two more seasons for the Padres before they
decided not to re-invest in the 35-year-old switch hitter. Now that
the choice was all his, there was no doubt where Caminiti wanted to
play. He turned down significantly more money from Detroit ($21.5
million over three years) to sign a two-year, $9.5 million deal
with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with this organization,'' Caminiti said. ``This is
where my family calls home, and this is where my two best friends
are. I was going to do everything I could to get back to the
Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since that spring day when the three
first took the field together. They have reached levels of success
others always knew possible, but Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti never
gave it much thought. They were too busy enjoying the game and
playing it the only way they know how.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, hopefully we'll all be able to
sit back and say we had a positive impact on the game,'' Biggio
said. ``But for now, we just respect the fact that we're able to go
out and play the game every day, because the fact is, this is
really what we all love doing. We've gotten a little older, but
that part hasn't changed from the beginning. We still just love to
play the game.''

TEXAS BOARD CHANGES DEADLINE FOR CLEMENCY FILINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Death row prisoners will have to file their
requests for mercy at least 21 days before they are scheduled for
execution, rather than just five, under new rules adopted Wednesday
by state parole officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole's six-member policy
council unanimously approved the new rule, which will take effect
in June. Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez has said the new deadline
would give board members more time to review clemency and
commutation requests.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the past two decades, the board has rejected almost
all clemency requests. The governor cannot grant such requests
without a recommendation from the board.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the rule will make it more difficult for condemned
killers to seek a reprieve or commutation of their sentences.
That's because many death row prisoners and their lawyers likely
will not be notified that an execution date has been set in
sufficient time to meet the filing deadline, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a worst-case scenario and the attorney is not notified of
the (execution) date, it's not outside the realm of possibility''
that an inmate will be precluded from seeking clemency, said Austin
defense lawyer Maurie Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time that happens, when there is a valid clemency
petition, is when this is going to blow up on them,'' said defense
attorney Bill Habern of Riverside, who testified on behalf of the
Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas junior Imelda Garcia of El Paso admonished
the board to remember with whom it is dealing, regardless of the
rules it adopts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life and death is in the balance ... and that's not something
to be taken lightly,'' she said. ``It's not just papers and files
you are dealing with. They are human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty appeals often involve a flurry of frantic,
last-minute legal pleadings, court appearances and even arguments
via telephone conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, noted that nothing precludes death row
prisoners from filing clemency petitions in advance of getting an
execution date.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also acknowledged that death row inmates usually get
anywhere from three to 10 execution dates, resulting in multiple
clemency applications and supplements being filed with the board.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and defense lawyer Rita Radostitz had proposed setting the
filing deadline 10 to 14 days ahead of the execution date. The
parole board had proposed 25 days, but amended it to 21 days after
Wednesday's public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The filing deadline is the first change the board has made in
its clemency rules in years.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency procedures came under intense scrutiny last year with
the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in
Texas in modern times and a widely recognized born-again Christian
whose religious transformation behind bars carried no weight with
the board. Procedures came under fire again later with the
near-execution of Canadian Joseph Stanley Faulder.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Faulder is facing a June 17 execution date and will
be one of the first inmates subjected to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' clemency procedures have been upheld by state and federal
courts as meeting the minimum requirements of due process. But the
judges have sharply criticized the parole board, particularly over
its secret meetings and refusal to say what criteria it uses in
evaluating clemency petitions. The parole board is exempt from
complying with the state Open Meetings Act.
</P>
<P>
   At least three bills are pending in the Legislature that would
address those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and Rep. Elliott Naishtat,
D-Austin, both have bills pending to require public meetings of the
board on clemency matters, Senate Bill 1698 and House Bill 397,
respectively. Naishtat also has filed legislation, HB 398, that
would specify criteria the board must consider in evaluating
clemency petitions.

Bagwell, Biggio, Caminiti: Astros throwbacks
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By iBy ts very nature, baseball is a game that almost forces us
to look to the past with a sense of romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   We genuinely believe the players of yesteryear played harder and
with more passion and zeal than today's major leaguers. We believe
they would have done so whether it made them wealthy or whether it
paid them like peanut vendors. We believe they would have done so
regardless of the fame or the status that comes with being among
the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   We long for that type of player; we search for any semblance
among today's stars and, if we're fortunate enough to find one, we
call him a throwback _ as in a throwback to the good old days, when
the game was played the way it was meant to be played.
</P>
<P>
   If such a player exists today, he plays for the Astros and he
answers to the name Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio or Ken Caminiti. All
three are throwbacks in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Biggio covered in dirt from head to toe, there can
be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Bagwell hustling down the first-base line on an
obvious ground-ball out with the enthusiasm of a Little Leaguer,
there can be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Caminiti willing himself onto the field with
injuries that would disable less courageous players, there can be
no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   They all are, and it's that type of will and desire that ranks
each among the best players to wear an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   From the days of the shooting-star logo to the wild colors of
the rainbow jerseys, if you're looking for Houston players who
elicit memories of baseball's glory years, look no farther than the
three stars the Astros are counting on to lead them to a third
consecutive National League Central Division title and the
franchise's first World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three guys play the game as well as it can possibly be
played from the standpoint of effort, determination and so on,''
Astros president Tal Smith said. ``I don't necessarily subscribe to
the fact the game was played so much better years ago, from a
standpoint of intensity, as it is today. We always _ from a
standpoint of nostalgia _ think it was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've followed baseball since the 1940s, so I can recall it
vividly. There are players today _ certainly (Bagwell, Biggio and
Caminiti) _ who are the epitome of anything anyone could ask for in
a ballplayer. Twenty years from now, I suspect people will be
referring to players as throwbacks to the way Cammy, Craig and
Baggy played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti broke into the big leagues in 1987; Biggio made his
debut the following year. They were fortunate enough to play with
veterans such as Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, Buddy Bell, Terry Puhl,
Craig Reynolds, Bill Doran and Alan Ashby, who taught them how to
play the game ``the right way,'' as Biggio often says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 22-year-old kid at the time,'' Biggio said. ``I
thought I knew everything when I actually knew nothing. I learned a
lot just by sitting, watching and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell wasn't so fortunate. When he arrived on the scene in
1991, the Astros were in the midst of rebuilding, and there were no
seasoned veterans to set an example for younger players _ only
Biggio and Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   What they may have lacked in baseball savvy, they made up for
with the effort that is their calling card to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way that I know how to play the game, and
that's to go all out,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't try to do it that
way; that's just the way it is. That's the way you should go out
there every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti first shared a big-league diamond
during the spring of 1991. Things were different then; Biggio was a
catcher, and Bagwell had come to camp to unseat Caminiti as the
Astros' third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, an Astros coach at the time, solved
that problem by suggesting Bagwell be shifted to first base. The
rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me all spring to make my conversion from catcher to
second base,'' Biggio recalled. ``But that spring, Baggy learned
how to play first base in two weeks because that's all the time he
had after they decided he was going to play first base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost 97 games in 1991, but it was obvious they could
build around their three stars-in-the-making, who were becoming the
best of friends. They were clueless as to the heights their careers
would reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rookie, and they were only in their third year or
so,'' Bagwell said. ``I didn't even know if I belonged in the big
leagues. Who could have known at that time what kind of players we
would become?''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, they made the All-Star team together and
Bagwell won the National League's Most Valuable Player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the year we knew that we had kind of arrived,''
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, one of the triplets was about to exit. After the
1994 season, the Astros' foundation was cracked by the rapidly
changing economics of baseball. With Biggio, Caminiti and Steve
Finley approaching free agency, the Astros were at a financial
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't agree on a new contract with Caminiti, so they
traded him and Finley to San Diego in a blockbuster deal that
brought current starters Derek Bell and Ricky Gutierrez to town.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the Astros' building blocks had been reduced
from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' Bagwell said. ``But we knew there was
a chance our team would be broken up if we didn't win in 1994. I
guess we just didn't know it would happen the way it did. We all
hated to see Cammy go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knew they were trading away a good player when they
dealt Caminiti to San Diego; Bagwell and Biggio believed their
sidekick was on the verge of a career breakthrough. But it's
doubtful anyone predicted the extent of Caminiti's breakout.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 30 home runs and 99 RBIs in four seasons with the
Padres _ his bests with the Astros were 18 and 80, respectively _
and won an NL MVP trophy of his own in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was capable of that, but he needed to prove to
himself that he was that type of player,'' Bagwell said. ``Cammy is
very emotional, and I would even say that he's insecure at times.
After that year, he believed in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti played two more seasons for the Padres before they
decided not to re-invest in the 35-year-old switch hitter. Now that
the choice was all his, there was no doubt where Caminiti wanted to
play. He turned down significantly more money from Detroit ($21.5
million over three years) to sign a two-year, $9.5 million deal
with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with this organization,'' Caminiti said. ``This is
where my family calls home, and this is where my two best friends
are. I was going to do everything I could to get back to the
Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since that spring day when the three
first took the field together. They have reached levels of success
others always knew possible, but Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti never
gave it much thought. They were too busy enjoying the game and
playing it the only way they know how.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, hopefully we'll all be able to
sit back and say we had a positive impact on the game,'' Biggio
said. ``But for now, we just respect the fact that we're able to go
out and play the game every day, because the fact is, this is
really what we all love doing. We've gotten a little older, but
that part hasn't changed from the beginning. We still just love to
play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt. &QL;

   Braves still class of division
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dominance during the 1990s _ winning seven
National League division titles _ the Atlanta Braves only have one
World Series championship to show for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently deciding enough was enough, the Braves did the
unthinkable _ they de-emphasized pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they still have Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John
Smoltz, but they used the other member of the Fab Four _ Denny
Neagle _ to acquire Bret Boone, who will shore up their defense and
provide more offense at second base than this team has seen in
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also upgraded the defense in right field, where
free-agent acquisition Brian Jordan takes up residence. Jordan also
will be a nice addition to the lineup, adding speed and additional
run production. Atlanta will need it in the absence of Andres
Galarraga, who is out for the season because of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves weren't the only team revamping in the NL East.
The Mets improved an already strong defense by signing third
baseman Robin Ventura and moving Edgardo Alfonzo from third to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Rickey Henderson gives the Mets an experienced
leadoff hitter and a proven winner. If Bobby Bonilla stays healthy,
New York will have a better everyday lineup than the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This is still Atlanta's division to lose, but the Mets should at
least be in the wild-card running. There's not much hope for the
Phillies, Expos or Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Phillies: They've tried to rebuild with a mixture
of young talent and veterans. But they've clearly had more success
with youngsters such as Scott Rolen, Bob Abreu and Doug Glanville.
If they don't lose sight of their long-range goals, the Phillies
could return to contention sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   Florida Marlins: Although they had plenty of talent in their own
system, the Marlins didn't do as well as they should have in
securing talent during the salary purge of a year ago. First
baseman Derrek Lee is the only regular they received in one of
their many cost-cutting trades. They're still far from
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, Braves: His power numbers have fallen each of the
past two seasons, all the way down to 18 homers and 70 RBIs in
1998. Manager Bobby Cox doesn't seem comfortable playing him
against lefthanded pitching, and his outfield defense has been
atrocious. Perhaps the move to first base will help.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, Mets: He carries himself as if he were one of
the top managers in baseball, and some people actually buy into it.
But he's under .500 as a big-league manager and has never taken a
team to the postseason. And let's not forget the way the Mets fell
apart down the stretch last season.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, Mets: As a former replacement player, Reed may not be
among the most popular players in the league, but he sure knows how
to win. He doesn't have the best stuff, but he may be the Mets'
best pitcher. Last year's 16-win season was not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Brogna, Phillies: First-round draft pick Pat Burrell is on
the way, which could spell the end of Brogna's tenure in
Philadelphia. But don't fret. There are plenty of teams who can
make use of a first baseman capable of driving in 100 runs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Anderson, Phillies: If the Phillies can be patient while
his defense catches up with his offense, Anderson could very well
challenge J.D. Drew for the NL Rookie of the Year award. He hits
for average and has decent power for a middle infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez, Marlins: The Marlins thought enough of him to
trade the best young shortstop in the National League, Edgar
Renteria. Gonzalez won't make anyone forget Renteria at the plate _
at least not initially _ but he can pick it with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley, Phillies: He never quite recovered from shoulder
surgery two years ago, and his one-year stint in St. Louis was a
disaster. By midseason, the Phillies will be regretting the day
they decided Brantley was a better late-inning option than Ricky
Bottalico.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, Mets: He's all you need to know about how thin
big-league-caliber pitching is. Teams were lining up for the
services of this former Cy Young winner. Hershiser's best days are
behind him, and he'd better hope umpires never start cracking down
on pitchers who doctor the ball.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wade, Phillies: Like Woody Woodward and Gord Ash before him,
Wade will be holding the prized pitching possession at some point
this season. Once the Phillies fall out of the race, Wade's phone
will start ringing with offers for Curt Schilling, and he'll be
under pressure to make the right deal.
</P>
<P>
   City of Montreal: You're about to lose your team if you don't
give commissioner Bud Selig a reason _ any reason _ to believe you
actually care. This could be your last chance. Otherwise the Expos
will become the first baseball team to relocate since the
Washington Senators moved to Arlington in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla finally gets healthy and plays the way he did in
1997 when he helped the Marlins win the World Series? The Mets look
good on paper _ real good. But they can't afford to have any
serious injuries if they want to end the Braves' dominance in the
NL East.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   How many times do you think we'll hear the phrase ``Preview of
the Subway Series'' June 4-6 when the Mets visit Yankee Stadium?
During the first month of the season, the Braves only play three
games against teams that finished above .500 in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The initial urge is to assume the Yankees couldn't possibly be
better than they were in 1998, when they won an American
League-record 114 games and claimed yet another World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we all know what they say about assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to believe the Yankees could be even better in
1999. The main reason is five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger
Clemens, who won 20 games for the Blue Jays in 1998. If he pitches
the way he has over the last two seasons, 25 to 30 wins are not out
of the question for him on a team of this caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, Tino Martinez and Andy Pettitte have all had
better individual seasons than 1998, and we have not seen the best
of Derek Jeter or Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be a pleasant thought for the Orioles, as they try to
rebound from a complete fallout of a season, or the Red Sox, who
played well enough to win the AL's other two divisions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They can only hope the Yankees don't get any better and that
they fall far enough back to the pack to make this a fair fight.
Otherwise, the wild card is the only chance the Orioles or Red Sox
have of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays: Although they didn't seem to get fair value
in the Clemens trade, the Blue Jays are moving in the right
direction. They have a nice collection of young players, and they
won't be fun to play. They'll probably take a few steps backward
before moving forward, but the future looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox: They overachieved in 1998, but they'll have no
such luck this time around. General manager Dan Duquette ran off
Clemens and Mo Vaughn and got nothing in return for either. Sooner
or later, that sort of mismanagement will catch up to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hamilton, Blue Jays: At one point he looked like one of the
best young pitchers in baseball. But his development ended
abruptly. His stuff is plenty good enough, but this guy is a mental
mess and he hurts himself by thinking too much.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stocker, Devil Rays: Tampa Bay thought so much of Stocker
that when it drafted Bob Abreu in the expansion draft, it
immediately shipped him to Philadelphia for Stocker. Abreu hit
.312; Stocker hit .208.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, Yankees: His fine season almost went unnoticed in
the Yankees' magic of 1998. But Posada is just a notch below
Charles Johnson and Ivan Rodriguez when it comes to defense behind
the plate, and don't forget that he hit 17 homers and drove in 63
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Portugal, Red Sox: He never seems to get his due because
he's always out of shape, injured or both. But when Portugal is
healthy, he produces. If the Red Sox have success this year, he'll
be a key figure.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon, Red Sox: He hits for average and power, runs with
speed and is above-average in the field. This Rookie of the Year
candidate could become the next star in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith, Devil Rays: This might not be his year to shine,
but give Smith time. His stuttered playing time doesn't reflect his
level of ability. Unfortunately for Smith, he plays third base, and
the Devil Rays want to see Wade Boggs reach 3,000 hits wearing
their uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo Berroa, Blue Jays: There must be some reason he is with
his fourth team in three years. He offers the promise of power, but
he failed to produce at his last two stops. He only homered once in
191 at-bats for Cleveland and Detroit last season.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Alvarez, Devil Rays: He could have just as easily made
the overrated list. Don't be surprised if he's not completely over
the injuries that contributed to his 14-loss season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Ray Miller, Orioles: His first year as Orioles manager was a
disaster, and you can bet owner Peter Angelos expected more than 79
victories for his $73 million payroll. Angelos is very reactive,
and he just might stick a quick hook in Miller if the O's don't run
off some early W's.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette, Red Sox: How does this guy keep his job,
especially in a sports-crazed town like Boston? First he ran off
Clemens, then Vaughn. He's one of the most unpopular people in
town. Alienating Vaughn could blow up in his face.
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. starts taking regular days off and his production
still doesn't increase? The popular theory over the past few years
has been that Ripken's production has tailed off because of
fatigue. The Orioles can only hope that's the case. Few AL teams
would be happy with a third baseman who hits only 14 homers with 61
RBIs, as Ripken did last year.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   May 18-20 could be interesting if Clemens' turn in the rotation
pops up. If the Fenway faithful was peeved at seeing him return in
a Blue Jays uniform, how do you think they'll react to seeing the
Rocket sporting the road gray of the hated Yankees? There's no
excuse for the Red Sox to get off to a poor start. Their first 15
games are against Kansas City, Tampa Bay, the Chicago White Sox and
Detroit. &QL;

 &HT;    REFUGEES CONTINUE ARRIVING IN ALBANIA WITH ONLY STORIES OF DEATH
AND SUFFERING
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Vesa Guci's face will heal, but her heart is
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three children; now I have two,'' she says, sitting on
the edge of a hospital bed, her face scored with tiny cuts, her
right eye swollen and bruised. She doesn't cry. Her eyes seem
empty.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:30 Sunday afternoon, Serb forces surrounded her Kosovar
village of Demjan, Guci says. As she talks, she tends
absentmindedly to her small children, six and four. They also bear
wounds and bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, the soldiers began a grenade attack on the
village, she says. A grenade came through the window of her house
as she held her 18 month old daughter, Ndricesa (CQ). ``The grenade
exploded,'' she says. ``I didn't any more see my child.'' Her skirt
is splattered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   In the next bed, beside a large open window that offers a view
of Kosovo's snow-capped mountain, her husband, Dulles (CQ), lies
curled under a thick wool blanket. His face also is flaked with
scabs. He says nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees continue to pour into Albania from Kosovo, the
cumulative scale of their tragedy is nearly overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers tell of losing children. Wives cry for their husbands.
Many weep for homes they may never see again.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many refugees crossed the border near
here since NATO air strikes began eight days ago. Almost no ethnic
Albanians coming from Kosovo have passports or other identifying
papers, and registration with exhausted border guards has been
haphazard at best.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimates that 85,000 of the more than 120,000 refugees who
have fled Kosovo have come to Albania, the poorest country in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite photographs shown on television here reveal waves of
refugees heading for the border. Serb TV broadcasts have shown
thousands of refugees leaving the provincial capital, Pristina, on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   About 17,000 refugees arrived in Kukes Tuesday, officials said.
Of those, about 9,000 arrived after dark and passed the night in a
muddy field strewn with rocks and litter just outside this small,
extremely poor town.
</P>
<P>
   Some slept on the blankets they carried from their homes. Others
slept on beds of straw spread on the floors of carts towed from by
tractors from Kosovo. Before the refugee crisis, the local Red
Cross had only 500 blankets in stock, never expecting such a flood
of humanity. Babies slept in wooden cradles carried by their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no camp fires to ease the chill of the cold mountain
air. Many found protection from the biting wind only by huddling
against a waist-high stone wall that runs between the narrow road
between the border and Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   Once they make it to Kukes, most refugees are dispersed to other
towns and villages in Albania. About 12,000 were sheltered
Wednesday in this town of 50,000, where unemployment is extreme and
an average family of five makes $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for the refugees here are miserable. Most stay in
private homes, but some have moved into vacant buildings and
covered the open windows with clear plastic to block the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Those with nowhere to stay must arrange for a place to sleep
every day. Many go door to door until they find a room.
</P>
<P>
   Housing them has been complicated because Kosovar families _
many numbering more than 30 _ often refuse to be separated.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Sulaz, (CQ BOTH) an official with the local Red Cross,
said this tendency is a source of his greatest frustration. ``You
can find people to host five or six people, but 30? Who can host
30?''
</P>
<P>
   For the young in particular, these frustrations shield darker
feelings. Ramadan Shigjeci (CQ BOTH) is angry enough to kill. He
says his 18-year-old heart is full of hatred for the Serbs, and he
wants to join the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to free
his homeland by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake, they are driving our spirit out of us,'' he
says, his shoulders tensing when he projects the words.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot think of a future beyond the day he can go home or
conceive of ever accepting life under the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart cannot allow this because they have killed our people
and burned our homes. We sleep out under the sky. Our hope now is
with NATO,''
</P>
<P>
   He taps a foreigner on the chest and asks ``When will we go
home. When will the Serbs be gone?''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an answer only causes more agitation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, it has become common to see KLA fighters in
camouflage walking the streets of Kukes. Before, such brazen
openness would have been shocking. But the war has given Kukes the
feel of a city on the front line, with the KLA one of the forces
waiting to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tragedy, there are also moments of joy.
</P>
<P>
   For five days, Skender Berisha (CQ BOTH) had been waiting at the
checkpoint between Kosovo and Albania. In the confusion following a
weekend Serb order for ethnic Albanians to evacuate the town of
Suva Reka (CQ BOTH), he became separated from his 13-year-old
daughter, Dasina (CQ). The elementary school teacher had found his
wife but hadn't heard from his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, he again he took up the vigil, gazing down
the road back into Kosovo, studying the thousands of passing faces.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the morning, something caught his attention. He wiped
his eyes and looked down the rolling column of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Then his face opened into a smile. He ran to a cart behind one
of the tractors. It was his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Convulsing with tears, Dasina put her arms around her father's
neck. He cried with her.
</P>
<P>
   He pinched her cheek, as if to remind himself again that she was
real. ``The world makes no sense,'' he told her as he walked with
her toward their uncertain future.
</P>

Astrodome's last hurrah
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that the seven original Mercury astronauts
simultaneously threw out the first pitch at the Astrodome's
regular-season debut in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The futuristic building was best described as ``out of this
world.'' These seven men had literally been out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   So it's just as fitting that Neil Armstrong will be the one to
throw that first pitch when the Astros play their final season
opener at the Astrodome on Tuesday. Like the first man to step foot
on the moon, the Astrodome also is an American original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astrodome was an extravaganza; it was unique,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``For me, it's still the best domed
stadium I've ever seen. It has stood the test of time as a
structure. But as a place to watch a baseball game, its time has
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that the Astrodome celebrated its
30th birthday. Four years later, the stadium that once set new
standards for comfort and ingenuity is being put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very sentimental person,'' said Astros owner Drayton
McLane, who led the charge for a new downtown stadium. ``I'll
always have great memories here, but we had to focus on what we
needed to be competitive and that was a downtown new arena, a place
where you can see the sun, the stars at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome has seen its share of stars. Billy Graham led a
crusade there and is credited with tagging it the ``Eighth Wonder
of the World.'' Muhammad Ali fought Cleveland ``Big Cat'' Williams
there in 1965 to put it into boxing's international spotlight.
Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs battled there for the sexes, the
30,472 fans in attendance setting a tennis record. There was the
``Game of the Century'' with Elvin Hayes and the Houston Cougars
vs. Lew Alcindor and the UCLA Bruins. There have been numerous NFL
games, college games, bloodless bullfights, rodeos, motocross,
gymnastics and rallies of all kind.
</P>
<P>
   But in most minds, the Astrodome will always be associated with
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was ingenious and practical in a city where even the nicest
summer nights can be sweltering and much of the sport's schedule
coincides with the rainy season. People came from all parts of the
world just to see it in the building stages. Never has a sports
arena drawn so much international attention at an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've covered several stadium openings, but this is the first
time I've ever had the stadium cover me,'' said Charlie Maher of
the San Diego Evening Tribune, one of the reporters on hand _ along
with 47,876 fans _ to watch the Astros beat the Mickey Mantle-led
New York Yankees 2-1 in an exhibition game. And it somehow seemed
appropriate that Mantle would etch his name into Astrodome history
with the first base hit and home run.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was an 18-year-old pitcher with the Astros when the Dome
opened. Like many others who walked in behind him, he was in awe
upon first sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the feeling I had when I first walked into
the Astrodome,'' Dierker said. ``I felt like I was walking into the
next century. It was a very dramatic experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming in from spring training, and it was nighttime.
The roof was just glowing. It was breathtaking. I had never seen
anything like it before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Judge Roy Hofheinz intended. He was the visionary
who was convinced that air conditioning, theater-style seats and
skyboxes would put Houston on the map. It put Houston on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first game I went to that first season,'' said
McLane, who wasn't at the opener but made sure to get his first
Dome experience that inaugural season. ``It was a Saturday night
game and I was driving to the parking lot and it was raining
really, really hard, and I thought, `This is crazy. They don't play
baseball when it rains really hard.' But of course, they did now.''
</P>
<P>
   They did a lot of things that had never been done before, using
4,500 skylights that stretched 208 feet tall, 6,600 tons of air
conditioning that blew so strong it could actually alter the path
of the ball, and those skyboxes, where hot meals were waiting for
special guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to look back now, with the technology we have, and
remember, but it was unique,'' said Astros president Tal Smith, who
was the Houston Sports Authority's liaison during construction of
the Dome. ``It was such a thrill to be associated with it. I think
everybody who had anything to do with it, down to the last
construction worker, had great pride and elation.''
</P>
<P>
   The most incredible sight was the giant scoreboard, with
electronic fireworks, charging bulls and cartoons. Fans, who in the
past only saw the basic game statistics, were suddenly bombarded
with information about pitchers and batters.
</P>
<P>
   That scoreboard, however, became extinct in 1988, when it was
torn up as part of a $50 million renovation that added 10,000 new
seats and 65 luxury boxes as a concession to Oilers owner Bud
Adams, who was threatening to move the team to Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one thing that really set the stadium apart,''
Smith said. ``Once you accepted that it was a domed stadium, that
scoreboard was the one really unique thing. That was something the
county didn't pay for, the club arranged. The judge (Hofheinz)
wanted something that was really different, really creative. That
was my biggest regret, losing that scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few mistakes along the way, but they mostly were
the result of having no proven blueprint from which to work.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known that the sun coming through the skylights
would sometimes blind the outfielders, making fly balls an
interesting challenge? Nobody had played baseball under skylights
before.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have known that when they painted those skylights to
remove the glare, the grass would die? Nobody had tried to grow a
baseball field indoors before.
</P>
<P>
   But those glitches did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there were plenty of skeptics,'' Smith said. ``But the
problems we had were because nothing had been tested before. There
were only two relatively new stadiums at that time, Dodger Stadium
and Candlestick Park. Candlestick Park wasn't a model anybody
wanted to use, and Dodger Stadium was an open-air stadium that
couldn't really compare. This was a novelty. Everything was for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine domes have been built since then, the most recent being the
Alamodome, which opened in San Antonio in 1993 and is still looking
for a football or baseball team to call it home. The one with the
biggest price tag is Toronto's SkyDome, which cost a phenomenal
$500 million to build, more than twice any other (Atlanta's Georgia
Dome is second with a $220 million price tag).
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome, which was financed by a combination of public and
private funds, cost a mere $31.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But with those new domes came new standards, most of them set by
SkyDome, which opened in 1989 and debuted the retractable roof,
guaranteeing perfect weather on any day or night. The SkyDome also
boasts a hotel, with rooms that overlook the outfield, a fitness
club, theater and seven restaurants and bars, including a Hard Rock
Cafe and the largest McDonald's in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Even non-domed stadiums have raised the sports-experience
expectation level with such amenities as shops, gourmet concession
stands, picnic areas and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome, on which there have been minor improvements over
time, needed a major face-lift to bring it up to those 21st-century
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about five years when the building itself drew
people,'' Dierker said. ``It was something to see. After that, it
wasn't such a wonder of the world anymore. The judge went bankrupt,
and it wasn't maintained the way it had been. By the late '70s, it
was an embarrassment. They later cleaned it up and it was looking
good again, but then they took the scoreboard down, and it was
never the same. It lost the look of being a ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   After this season, it will no longer be one.

WHITE HOUSE RAISES POSSIBILITY OF EUROPEAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its European allies launched
emergency efforts Wednesday to alleviate the deepening refugee
crisis along the borders of Kosovo in a move that raised the
possibility of British, French and Italian ground forces entering
Kosovo to create safe havens backed by U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the White House's National Security Council
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said European allies
have the option of dispatching ground troops to Kosovo at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of refugees has raised the prospect that NATO
ground forces might be called upon to thwart the campaign of
``ethnic cleansing'' that the Yugoslav government is carrying out
against the predominantly Moslem Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   To date, U.S. officials have ruled out the use of American
ground troops to supplement the eight-day U.S.-led allied air
assault against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an interview with CBS News broadcast
Wednesday night, continued to rule out U.S. ground forces entering
the fray in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he has chosen his words carefully in
describing U.S. policy about ground troops, Clinton said: ``The
thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a
hostile situation _ into Kosovo and into the Balkans _ is the
prospect of never being able to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that by inserting U.S. ground forces into Kosovo to
stem ethnic cleansing ``you could be put in a position of, for
example, creating a Kosovar enclave that would keep you there
forever. And I don't believe that is an appropriate thing to be
discussing at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, emphasized earlier
that: ``We have no intention of sending ground troops into a combat
situation. Unless and until there's a peace agreement to implement,
the U.S. has no intention to send in ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO troops other than American forces could be
used in Kosovo, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said
European nations could decide at any time to deploy ground forces
into Kosovo to protect besieged civilians and provide humanitarian
relief to tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian Muslims driven into
the mountains and forests by a relentless Yugoslav onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart added: ``I'm not aware that we would oppose or have any
objection. It would be up to those nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States would provide close air support to
European ground forces dropped into Kosovo, Lockhart replied:
``That's a hypothetical question that I haven't heard raised or
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   A precedent for such a move was created in 1995 when U.S.
warplanes provided close air support to British and French ground
troops guarding U.N.-declared ``safe havens'' in Bosnia where
thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees sought refuge from attacks by
Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has recently
overhauled its command structure to enable European nations within
the 50-year-old military alliance to launch independent military
operations using manpower, arms and materiel from the 19-member
Cold War-era alliance.
</P>
<P>
   British, French and Italian officials have underscored the
plight of civilians in an apparent effort to build up domestic
public support for possible troop deployments.
</P>
<P>
   Italian forces have moved across the Adriatic Sea into
neighboring Albania to help with relief efforts for an estimated
100,000 Kosovars who have fled into Albania. NATO officials have
dispatched an assessment team to Albania to examine what additional
assistance might be provided by allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson likens the Kosovo
massacres to the ``killing fields'' of Cambodia in the 1970s in an
apparent effort to sustain the support of 52 percent of the British
public who say they support the insertion of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, five former national security officials in
past administrations _ including former Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and former U.S. ambassador to NATO, William Howard Taft IV
_ urged the introduction of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon emphasized the
difficulty of moving allied ground forces into Kosovo, a
land-locked nation accessible only by air and 14 mountainous roads
that traverse either Albania or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be easy to go into Kosovo,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass, a former National Security Council official in
the Bush administration, said individual NATO members could move on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not obvious to me that you will necessarily continue to
have consent or consensus,'' Haass said, referring to NATO's
traditional approach to decision making. ``Clearly, not all 19
members of NATO are going to be sending ground forces _ a much
smaller number are if we get to that point. This is going to come
down to the few countries who are really able to contribute at that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration launched a wide ranging humanitarian
relief effort to augment allied efforts to deal with the
displacement of 580,000 ethnic Albanian Muslims in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Rubin said tens of thousands of
defenseless ethnic Albanian refugees have fled into the mountains
and forests of Kosovo to escape a relentless onslaught by some
40,000 Yugoslav troops and 300 Soviet-era tanks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120,000 of the displaced Kosovars have fled into
neighboring nations, including Albania, Macedonia and the former
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, announcing wide ranging U.S. efforts to lend a hand, said
the refugees were ``fleeing a murder machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration funneled $50 million in new relief
assistance _ including $25 million to airlift food and relief
supplies to the Balkans and $25 million to U.N. High Commission on
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said up to 75,000 Albanian civilians and Kosovo
independence fighters were trapped in the Pagarusa Valley, about 30
miles southwest Kosovo's capital of Pristina, where Yugoslav forces
were ``raining artillery fire'' on them.

Lucky for the Astros they move into a plush new ballpark next
season. It was becoming difficult to find space for division-title
banners in the Astrodome rafters.
</P>
<P>
   After winning two division championships in the first
quarter-century of the franchise's existence, the Astros begin the
season Tuesday in search of a third National League Central title
in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team comes into spring training expecting to get into the
postseason,'' said first baseman Jeff Bagwell. ``That's a realistic
goal. A lot of teams say it, but the realistic goal for our team is
to get to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball landscape in Houston has undergone some changes.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly two decades and a name change before the Astros
got their first division title in 1980, and another six years to
bring the second in '86. Who could forget the frustration from the
near misses that seemed to haunt the team over the next 11 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not winning for 11 years and all of a sudden doing it two
years in a row is something really special,'' second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``We're now at the stage where we want to continue
that winning. It's a contagious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, the elder statesman of the club who is entering his 11th
season, remembers a time when winning didn't come so easy. In fact,
it sometimes didn't come at all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, his third major-league season, the Astros underwent a
transformation period and lost a club record-tying 97 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when reality set in,'' Biggio said. ``It was like,
``You guys don't have a chance this year. You're not going to win.'
We had a good team, we just didn't know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a losing season since.
</P>
<P>
   After a break-even 82-82 season in '92, the Astros began their
current string of six consecutive winning seasons, a string
surpassed only by the Atlanta Braves (eight). Since 1993, the
Astros have the second-best winning percentage in the National
League (.546) and have finished no lower than third in their
division under current owner Drayton McLane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And they've done it without the greatest resource of all _
money. In each of the past two seasons, the Astros have had the
lowest payroll among playoff qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last four or five years, we've seemed to be in the
division race.'' Bagwell said. ``I think you have to start putting
us in the category (of successful clubs). We'll see what happens in
the years to come. Hopefully the new stadium will help out and we
keep the payroll up to continue having great players like we have
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with winning on the field has come a different attitude in
the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros called it ``a relief'' to finally end their 11-year
string of futility in '97. Last season, many believed they had the
most talented club in the NL after they won a club-record 102 games
and put the Central Division race to bed long before the September
stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Each venture into the postseason, however, has ended
prematurely. Because of that, the Astros are even hungrier entering
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys in this clubhouse that want to get back to the
dance and lose that black cloud hanging over us,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is set.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is no longer a wish, but an expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be a part of,'' Bagwell said of the team's
newfound success. ``Every year is a different year. I don't know if
we're going to win 102 games and have that special club like we had
last year again, but with the talent we have anything is
possible.''

Brewers' declining County faces last call
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
In its final year of major-league service, Milwaukee's County
Stadium clearly is past its prime. If it had one.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ahuja, author of Fields of Dreams: A Guide to Visiting and
Enjoying all 30 Major League Ballparks, calls it ``the league's
shabbiest outdoor stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter which league it's in. It has switched from
the National to the American and back to the National and found few
admirers in either place.
</P>
<P>
   It was gray and charmless when built, and a 1973 remodeling did
not redeem it. Technology has made limited inroads here; the
scoreboard graphics are basic.
</P>
<P>
   But however wonderful the new and nearby Miller Park turns out
to be, it's unlikely to match the welcome its forerunner received.
On March 15, 1953, some 10,000 people withstood freezing weather
for the first tour of County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, a stadium with 27,982 seats accommodated 53,357
as the Milwaukee Braves, formerly of Boston, beat the St. Louis
Cardinals 3-2 on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves drew a major-league record 1,826,397 in their first
season, and they set new attendance standards the next two years.
The honeymoon was extended when they won the World Series in 1957
and a pennant in '58, before losing a two-game playoff in '59.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 to 1961, the Braves were consistent contenders. A
heavy-wooded lineup helped pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette
collect a combined 344 wins during that nine-year period.
</P>
<P>
   But crowds dwindled when the pitching faltered and the Braves
slipped. By 1966, they were standing in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   County Stadium then lay dormant, except for a few Green Bay
Packers football games, until 1970. That year, automobile dealer
Bud Selig, who is now the baseball commissioner, bought the Seattle
Pilots, moved them to Milwaukee and renamed them the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed by a small-market budget, the Brewers haven't won a
division title since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium rarely fills its present capacity of 53,192. But
some say if the crowds were bigger, they'd be dangerous. This city
may be more interested in drinking beer than winning pennants.
</P>
<P>
   The County Stadium mascot, Bernie the Brewer, slides from his
chalet into a giant foamy mug following every homer by the home
team. Instead of the 1908 Broadway hit ``Take Me Out to the Ball
Game,'' Brewers fans in the seventh-inning stretch sing ``Roll Out
the Barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Brewers are losing, fans can drink to forget. But they
also have their fond memories. County Stadium was the workplace of
Eddie Mathews, Rollie Fingers, Paul Molitor and Robin Yount. It was
the first and last domain of home run king Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more subtle memories, equally cherished. Jeff
Torborg, a former big-league catcher and manager, has said: ``What
I remember most about the old stadiums are their smells. Ebbets
Field smelled like popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   County Stadium smells like spilled beer and smoked meats. The
juicy bratwurst beats a hot dog, and fans also appreciate a
convenient setting by Interstate 94 and an upper deck that offers a
panorama of steeples, smokestacks and the Allen Brady Tower's
imposing clock. The bleachers are inviting, with unobstructed sight
lines. On the other hand, the bullpens are the only ones in the
majors with restricted views of the field.
</P>
<P>
   The foul area is narrow, and fans are close to the action. A
longtime favorite Brewer, Gorman Thomas, observed: ``They know when
to cheer, they know when to boo, and they know when to drink beer:
They do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The drinking begins in the pre-game tailgate parties and flows
from there. Next year, the party moves to a park named for a beer
company. Expect the scene to be essentially the same. &QL;

CHINESE COMPANY LOOKS TO RIDE HDTV-WAVE INTO U.S. MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   Think ``Made in China,'' and plastic toys, T-shirts, sneakers
and simple tape recorders come to mind, all assembled cheaply in
anonymous factories for foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese manufacturer, Konka Group Co., wants to change that
image. With considerable hubris, Konka is seeking to make the leap
from a well-known brand in China to global consumer electronics
maker by grabbing a share of the U.S. market for television sets.
</P>
<P>
   The American market is among the toughest in the world, but
Konka is betting that it can compete in large part by being among
the first and the cheapest to offer Americans the next generation
of TV sets: those that will offer the digitally improved picture
and sound of high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to come up the food chain in terms of
technology,'' said Jack C. Fensterstock, president of the China
Capital Corp., a venture capital firm in Bethesda, Md., that
invests in Chinese companies, but not in Konka.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to start talking about China Inc., Konka's
plans point to new ambitions among Chinese manufacturers, ambitions
that echo those of young Japanese and South Korean manufacturers in
earlier decades. A slowdown in China, after two decades of
explosive growth, combined with fierce domestic competition, has
forced Chinese companies to consider how to pursue growth in
foreign markets more aggressively _ even if it means going
head-to-head against the world's leaders in technology and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese manufacturers ``really want to show that they've come a
long way,'' Fensterstock said. ``It's a national strategy to do
this in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Wu, Konka's head of sales and marketing in the United
States, said: ``We think we are strong enough to come to this
country. This is the right time. We don't see the right time in
another five years.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that other Chinese companies were tracking Konka's
progress in the United States. ``Everybody's watching us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But breaking into the $8 billion U.S. television market will not
be easy. Some 98 percent of households already own at least one
set. And Konka must still enlist a major distributor to get its
products in national chains if it is to face up to the firepower of
bigger and better-known manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans take their televisions very seriously,'' said
Nick Donatiello, president and chief executive of Odyssey Group, a
market research firm in San Francisco. ``This is not a frivolous
thing. Brand names matter a lot, and the top brands are very
powerful. It's not enough to have your televisions sitting in Good
Guys or Circuit City.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Konka's history fits a familiar pattern in consumer
electronics. Like the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan,
maker of the Panasonic brand, and LG Group of South Korea, maker of
Goldstar, Konka began assembling electronics for foreign
manufacturers drawn by cheap labor. And as those Asian giants did,
Konka is counting on taking a great leap forward in consumer
electronics through technology.
</P>
<P>
   Konka contends that high-definition television, still in its
infancy, offers an opening for a newcomer. The sale of HDTV sets is
but a trickle _ fewer than 20,000 sets since their introduction in
August _ and programming is limited. Yet as HDTV's bright, vivid
picture and crystal-clear sound seduce more consumers, and as
broadcasters step up their transition to digital programming, the
potential is vast in a nation of 250 million conventional sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the HDTV revolution as a great opportunity,'' Wei
Rong-chen, Konka's president, said in a telephone interview from
Hong Kong. ``As a new brand bringing in a new technology, we can
deliver a message to the consumer that Konka is not just a common
television manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   If Konka puts its sets on American shelves, _ no major regional
or national retailer has so far agreed to carry them _ many
consumer electronics analysts expect its greatest selling point
will be price. Konka plans to introduce a $3,000 32-inch-screen
HDTV set this fall. At the moment, that is less than half the price
of sets with more familiar names, now selling for $7,000 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, however, the price advantage will narrow
somewhat, as HDTV sets from RCA, made by Thomson Multimedia of
France, and from Panasonic and other big names are expected to be
offered for several thousand dollars less. Hitachi of Japan is
already selling an HDTV set for $2,999. Hitachi's and Konka's sets,
as well as most others, will still require the purchase of a
set-top box, costing at least $700, to translate analog signals
into digital ones until more HDTV programming becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Konka says its digital set is made with technology the company
developed in China and at its new research and development plant in
San Jose, Calif. The company will provide the cabinets and much of
the circuitry for the sets. The picture tubes, the most costly part
of a set, are provided by other electronics companies like Thomson
and Toshiba _ a common practice in the industry. And the HDTV chip
which powers the sets will also come from a foreign maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably won't be the highest resolution set,'' said
Richard Doherty, director of research at Envisioneering, a market
research firm, who saw a Konka set at a recent trade show.
Nonetheless, he believes that price alone can attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's the full quality of a Sony,'' he said,
``but wow, it's going to be an awful lot of value for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While price may give Konka an in-road in the United States, it
will never be able to compete with Sony and the other giants until
it develops its own technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time they have to wait for the Japanese companies to come
up with a new product, and then they copy,'' said Yasheng Huang, an
associate professor at the Harvard Business School. ``No Chinese
company has permanent competitiveness. You try to catch up with the
innovators, but you're never the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Konka is not wanting for ambition. It is entering the United
States on its own, a difficult task given that two much bigger
companies, Thomson and Royal Philips Electronics of the
Netherlands, established themselves by buying American brands.
Thomson bought RCA in 1987, and Philips bought Magnavox in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Konka began selling some of its conventional analog
sets, including models in bright blue or silver cabinets, in
California and Florida through small, regional consumer electronics
retailers like Brandsmart U.S.A and Fry's Electronics. The Home
Shopping Network has begun offering a white 13-inch Konka set for
about $120. Konka will also sell digital video disk players and two
television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Konka says it has shipped 25,000 conventional
televisions to the United States; its goal is 250,000 sets this
year, anticipating that only 2,000 will be HDTV sets. Those are
very modest goals, given that more than 26 million sets were
shipped to United States dealers last year, according to the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Konka, based in Shenzhen, a boom town on Hong Kong's border,
started assembling small, portable television sets for Thomson, and
others in 1979, when the Chinese economy first opened up. The
company began selling televisions under its own name in 1993 and
now has 25 percent of China's television market _ more than
Panasonic or Sony. Konka sold 4.7 million sets in China last year.
</P>
<P>
   It also tackled overseas markets in Australia, Russia, Latin
America and the Middle East. In those markets, Konka was able to
gain market share by using the same price strategy that made it a
success in China: underpricing better-known brands and offering
retailers greater margins to entice them to carry the sets. And
Konka placed stronger emphasis on advertising, marketing and brand
image than other Chinese exporters had done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing strategies that worked well in China and elsewhere,
however, may not translate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're aiming their pitch directly at price and at Sony,''
said Kathleen Maher, editor in chief of The Peddie Report, which
follows the graphics and multimedia industries. ``They have
televisions in colored boxes. I have no idea why American consumers
would be interested in colored boxes. If you're trying to compete
with Sony, it seems contradictory to have  &UR;  &LR; purple television
sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Konka does have other advantages. All its products are now
manufactured in China. Beginning in July, conventional television
sets destined for the United States will be made at a
30,000-square-foot plant it is building in Tijuana, Mexico.
Manufacturing in China and Mexico will help keep Konka's costs low.
Konka says it costs the company about $2,000 to produce an HDTV set
and about $400 to $500 to manufacture a 32-inch conventional set.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the big manufacturers on average about $12,000 for an
HDTV _ more than its price, as demand is still low _ and $650 for a
32-inch conventional set, Doherty of the Envisioneering Group
estimated. Konka has ``cost structures few companies can afford to
beat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Konka is barely on the radar screen of the
consumer electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Arland, a spokesman for Thomson, said the company was not
worried about the prospect of a $3,000 HDTV set from Konka, noting
that ``$3,000 is still a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   `` People pick names that they know, that have figured out this
technology and that they know are not going to disappear,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Konka executives are able to dispel whatever doubts
American shoppers may have about quality or about the wisdom of
purple TV sets, they can take heart in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point,'' Doherty noted, `` no one had heard of the
brand name Sony either.''

It's the final season for Tiger Stadium, an eyesore to some, a
keepsake to others
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
In this decade, the walls of baseball shrines are tumbling down:
Shoeless Joe Jackson's haunt, Comiskey Park, in 1991; Hank Aaron's
Atlanta Stadium in '96. And the pace of obsolescence is quickening.
Within the next year, Major League Baseball will abandon five
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Few may mourn the exodus from dowdy County Stadium in Milwaukee,
the wind-slapped Candlestick of San Francisco and the
once-futuristic domes of Houston and Seattle that are derided now
as synthetic and sterile.
</P>
<P>
   But Detroit's Tiger Stadium is another story, one that binds
history and myth and generations. On a sliver of acreage at the
fringe of downtown, Ty Cobb menacingly roamed, Al Kaline
methodically churned base hits, and Mark Fidrych stood on the mound
and talked to the baseball as he massaged it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone denies Tiger Stadium is long in the tooth. Its
annoying anachronisms include 5,000 obstructed-view seats and zero
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson, former Tigers manager, called it ``a rundown
shack'' and said, ``Those people who want to keep it for their
grandchildren have lost their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some baseball fans value tradition over marbles and
money. They claim the demise of Tiger Stadium was ordained only to
extract more revenue from luxury suites and the naming rights for
the new Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   When their storehouse of memories was assailed in 1988 as
outdated and worn-out, some 1,200 fans congregated on a chilling
rainy April day for a ``stadium hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Buchta, co-founder of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, said,
``There isn't a single spot in Detroit that carries more
associations for the people of this city than Tiger Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Some associations were pleasant, such as the 1984 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Some were not, such as the riot that followed that Series and
the accompanying fireworks: a police car billowing flames a few
yards from the ballpark's gates.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can blame the stadium, a classic on which the
fawned-over Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore was loosely
based.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's traditionalists eschew the new; they believe in
stadium reincarnation and prayed for it to happen one more time at
the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   From 1896 to 1912, that ground supported the wood-walled Bennett
Park, which originally seated 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the steel-and-concrete beginnings of Tiger Stadium,
which first seated 23,000 and was called Navin Field. This was the
stage for the indomitable Cobb, the spike-glinting, marauding
psychopath of the basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923 the grandstand was double-decked to seat 30,000. By
1938, the double-decking encircled the park, bringing capacity to
52,416. The seating has since been reduced to 46,000 with the
installation of a patio grill.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 renovation brought an endearing architectural anomaly.
An overhanging deck protrudes in right field, turning 315-foot fly
balls into home runs. Below, a 325-foot drive can be an out or a
blooper-film highlight, depending on how the fielder negotiates
shadows caused by the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium has a triples-inducing center field distance of 440
feet and homer-boosting power alleys of 365 and 370.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are closer to players than in any other big-league venue.
Detroit's Hall of Fame third baseman George Kell said, ``I always
liked to hear the people, and at Tiger Stadium I could hear
everything that was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon they'll all say goodbye to this eroded landmark, while
other baseball cathedrals are similarly besieged. The fall of Tiger
Stadium puts more pressure on Boston's quirky, cozy Fenway Park and
on New York's towering pantheon, Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is on the angled, aging walls. Owners of today's
baseball teams seem more interested in luxury suites than sweet
memories. &QL;

Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Rockies lay out millions to improve their
chances
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The most competitive division in baseball got a bit tighter during
the offseason, with every team in the National League West except
the Giants making major news.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers broke the bank by making Kevin Brown the
highest-paid player in the game, and they also hired Davey Johnson
to manage their pricey collection of players.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Colorado hired the man considered by most to
be the best strategic manager in the business. If Jim Leyland can't
figure out how to win consistently at Coors Field, perhaps no one
can.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks made their share of headlines, signing Randy
Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso to upgrade their
starting rotation significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The defending league champion San Diego Padres were in the news,
but for all the wrong reasons. They lost many key members of their
1998 team, including Brown.
</P>
<P>
   So which team maneuvered itself into the best position? Probably
the Dodgers. They are the early favorites to represent the NL in
the World Series, and with good reason. In addition to Brown, they
added Devon White and Todd Hundley, who, if healthy, gives them a
murderous lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies will be waiting in the wings if the Dodgers slip up,
and you can never count out the feisty Giants, who always seem to
find a way to plant themselves in the middle of the postseason
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks: Even after adding Johnson and the others,
perhaps they're premature when they talk of reaching the postseason
this year. But success is not far away. Give this team a year
together and some time to learn how to win, and they just might
make some noise.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres: The dismantling of their World Series team
wasn't quite as dramatic as what the Marlins did after the 1997
season, but it was enough to represent a major setback for the
Padres. They'll drop from the proverbial penthouse to the outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders, Padres: We'd rather not hear anything else about
how talented he is. We'd just as soon see it, and so far, we
haven't _ at least not with any consistency. The oft-injured
outfielder will break hearts in San Diego just as he did for years
in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek, Dodgers: As long as he was hitting, everyone
seemed willing to overlook the fact he was a defensive liability at
shortstop. But his offensive numbers have dipped in each of the
past two seasons, and his defense hasn't gotten much better.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent, Giants: There are so many good second basemen in the
majors that Kent often gets overlooked. But it's hard not to notice
his remarkable production. He hit 31 homers and drove in 128 runs
despite missing a month of the 1998 season because of a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy, Padres: This soft-spoken former Astros catcher is
respected by his peers, and players love to play for him, but he
seldom gets mentioned among the top managers in baseball. He pushed
all of the right buttons during the 1998 postseason. If the Padres
avoid the basement in 1999, it will be because of Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement, Padres: Management fought the temptation to rush
him to the big leagues last season, and it proved to be the right
move. The Padres went to the World Series without him. But now that
Kevin Brown is gone, they're looking for an ace in San Diego, and
Clement might ultimately fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre, Dodgers: The 20-year-old Dominican had no
business being in the big leagues last season. Then again, few
decisions made sense during the time Tommy Lasorda ran the Dodgers
last season. Is Beltre ready this year? We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson, Diamondbacks: Perhaps his 30-save season of a year
ago was a sign Olson is back. We think not. He's a good bet for the
biggest comedown of the season, and the Diamondbacks would have
been wise to sign a proven insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Rojas, Dodgers: A few years ago he was one of the
up-and-coming closers in baseball. But after failed stints with the
Cubs and Mets, Rojas is merely an overpaid middle reliever. He hit
bottom last season with a 6.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, Dodgers: We already expected a lot from him;
imagine how those expectations will increase now that he's being
paid $15 million a year. If he doesn't pitch the Dodgers to the
World Series, his seven-year, $105 million contract will face even
more criticism.
</P>
<P>
   John Moores, Padres: He truly is one of the most likable owners
in baseball, but the offseason series of events has threatened his
popularity after voters approved a new downtown baseball stadium.
The Padres better not finish in last place.
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown finally has an off year, Gary Sheffield's back
problems persist, and Todd Hundley never gets healthy enough to be
the player he was two years ago? The Dodgers would be in big
trouble under that scenario, and with an $86 million payroll, no
excuses will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   There will be several marquee pitching matchups on Opening Day,
but none better than the one at Dodger Stadium, where Kevin Brown
and Randy Johnson lock horns. Don't you just know Johnson is hoping
his turn in the rotation will come up during the July 18-20 series
when the Diamondbacks play at Seattle. The Big Unit makes his first
return to the Astrodome April 26-29. &QL;

Giants finally escape from Candlestick
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It has withstood raging gales and a deadly earthquake that barely
made it shudder. But Candlestick Park no longer can keep its
lifelong tenants. Next year the San Francisco Giants move to a new
home downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Many say good riddance. Whenever National League players are
polled on which stadium they least enjoy, cold, damp and blustery
Candlestick (now officially 3Com Park) wins overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   A former Giants first baseman, Jack Clark, was asked what could
improve the stadium, and he replied, ``Dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   Accessible only through a snarlway of traffic, a remote 12 miles
from America's most scenic city, Candlestick is the Mistake by the
Bay, a veritable Cave of Winds.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Stu Miller was blown from the mound as he began
his windup in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   This is where popups are adventures and outfielders run through
hot-dog wrappers leaping along the grass like baby kangaroos. The
Astros' Derek Bell was picked off base while enthralled by such
dancing garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Giants marketing director Mario Alioto said the team ``wants to
have some fun'' promoting the park's farewell season. So its
publicity campaign shows a picture of ballplayers turning double
plays while a tornado whirls around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love it or hate it,'' Alioto said, ``this park is where we've
had our baseball memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable event occurred on Oct. 17, 1989, when
an earthquake struck just before Game 3 of the World Series between
the Giants and Oakland A's. Remarkably, the sold-out stadium held
up to the magnitude 7.1 quake without anyone being injured.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, more soothing memories. Candlestick housed
four Hall of Fame players in the 1960s: Willie Mays, Willie
McCovey, Orlando Cepeda and Juan Marichal. The wonder is this
surfeit of talent never produced a World Series championship. Hal
Lanier, a Giants shortstop in the '60s, said the reason was that
``all that team tried to do was hit home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was understandable. The gusting wind suits fly-ball
hitters, though it favors lefthanded power over right. Originally,
the stadium seated 42,500 and was open-ended and even windier than
today's enclosed edition that accommodates 63,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Candlestick can be sunny and pleasant in early afternoon,
it turns into a baseball torture chamber near sunset, when dense
fog and 30-60 mph winds rush in. Fans know to bring coats and
blankets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the team began rewarding those who stayed for extra
innings of night games by issuing the Croix de Candlestick, a medal
portraying icicles hanging off the letters of the Giants logo.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Giants schedule more day games than any
team in baseball other than the Chicago Cubs. Of course, this means
attendance and revenues suffer.
</P>
<P>
   As ill-conceived as this facility seems, it made sense for
developer Charles Harney, who sold Candlestick Point to the city of
San Francisco in 1957 for $2.7 million. Harney showed the land to
mayor George Christopher and Giants owner Horace Stoneham in the
morning, when the weather is calmest.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was fooled. As the stadium was being finished, Vice
President Richard Nixon, a native Californian, gushed that it would
be ``one of the most beautiful baseball parks of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, soon after opening in 1960, it became one of the great
white elephants of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are confident baseball will boom in popularity when
Pacific Bell Park debuts next spring. The new stadium is located in
what is said to be the warmest part of the city. But it will be
nestled up to the bay, and many San Franciscans suspect it, too,
will be tormented by fog and wind.
</P>
<P>
   And they wouldn't have it any other way. &QL;

FIVE BODIES PULLED FROM RIO GRANDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ Five bodies were pulled from the muddy Rio
Grande here Wednesday, and investigators were trying to determine
whether they drowned while trying to sneak into Texas or were the
victims of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   This much was known: Four of the men died with their boots on.
</P>
<P>
   The decomposed bodies, first spotted by a Border Patrol
helicopter, were found along a four-mile stretch of the river near
the poor community El Cenizo, 15 miles south of Laredo, and nearby
Rio Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility of foul play because they were wearing
their boots,'' Santos Benavides, a justice of the peace, said.
``Nobody crosses the river with their boots on.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, all male, were found along stretches of the river
that are notorious for smuggling and illegal immigrants, but most
people wade the river in shorts and with their clothes wrapped in
plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like this,'' Benavides said as he
stood along a bank of the river where the bodies were photographed
and placed in plastic bags. ``Five at the same time _ never.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities reportedly pulled a sixth body from the
river.
</P>
<P>
   No identification was found on the bodies, but one had a silver
pendant of an elephant and two others had tattoos, one of a rose,
the other of the initials ``J.M.'' One was nude.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome discovery came in the wake of a Sunday incident in
which a Border Patrol agent jumped into the river and rescued three
Mexican men who were trapped in the current while trying to cross
on an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   The river is swollen by rains and the heavy release from a
nearby reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican consular officials were dispatched to the morgue in
Laredo late Wednesday to try to determine if the men were from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very sad,'' Luis Humberto Ramirez, the Mexican consul
said. ``We still do not know if they were Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their national origin, Ramirez said, the bodies
serve as a reminder that illegal immigrants risk their lives trying
to sneak across the river, known as the Rio Bravo, or Brave River
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rio Bravo is a river that looks calm, but it is always
dangerous,'' said Ramirez, who earlier this week met with Border
Patrol officials to discuss how to prevent more people from dying
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Mexican officials have again agreed to launch a joint
operation to warn people of the dangers of crossing into the United
States. They risk drowning in the Rio Grande, dehydration, falling
under the wheels of freight cars heading north out of Mexico, and
tangling with thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always dangerous,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogelio Nunez, the head of a Harlingen, Texas-based immigration
rights group, said more deaths would likely occur as new Border
Patrol operations force people to cross in more desolate and
unfamiliar areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in favor of increased enforcement and this policy
where they knowingly move folks from safer crossings,'' said Nunez,
executive director of Proyecto Libertad. ``Deaths will occur.''

   CURFEW-SUCCESS (Los Angeles) _ Stiff enforcement of a teen-age
curfew in the suburban northeast San Fernando Valley area of Los
Angeles has driven down burglaries and property crimes by 25
percent so far this year, but crime is up in other areas where the

   WELLPOINT-BID (Los Angeles) _ Officials at the nonprofit Rocky

a letter to Woodland Hills, Calif.-based WellPoint Health Networks
asking the company to clarify its bid for the plan. Earlier this
week WellPoint offered to buy the insurer for between $200 million
and $240 million after learning Rocky Mountain had agreed to be
bought by another managed care firm for $165 million. By Ben

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Since Friday, when Officer Marc Atkinson
was gunned down in an ambush in an industrial park west of the
freeway, all of the headlines and all of the TV newscasters and all
of the people who've stopped by at the improvised memorial at 30th
Avenue and Catalina have referred to him exactly that way _ as
``Officer`` Marc Atkinson. All the attention has been a comfort to
Atkinson's family, but they don't see him like we do. We mourn the
loss of a good cop. They mourn the loss of a good husband, a good
father, a good son, a good brother. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will

 &HT;    THE GARBAGE BUSINESS IS BECOMING COMPACTED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the government presses its widely publicized
charges that Microsoft Corp. tried to unfairly dominate America's
access to computer software, a rapid consolidation of corporate
power is quietly taking place around a humbler but equally
pervasive part of life: garbage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some critics think, your garbage bill inevitably
will go up and the national trend toward recycling will reverse.
</P>
<P>
   If a series of announced mega-mergers is approved, the country
will enter the next millennium with two companies in control of
picking up, hauling off, dumping and recycling more than half its
municipal and industrial solid waste.
</P>
<P>
   The two corporations will be Waste Management Inc. of Houston
and the entity created by the merger of Browning-Ferris Industries,
also of Houston, and Allied Waste Industries of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They will share more than $18 billion in annual revenue for
handling what's left when we get through with newspapers, coffee
grounds, milk jugs and, for that matter, just about everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than half of the estimated $35 billion Americans pay
every year for garbage collection and disposal. What's left will be
divided among local governments, one other national garbage
collector and several thousand small local and regional haulers.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidations are being driven primarily by the companies'
efforts to deal with depressed revenues caused by a national glut
of landfills and have been followed by price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also say the national trend toward recycling will
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Big solid waste companies lose money every time something is
recycled instead of going into one of their landfills, said Peter
Anderson, a Madison, Wis., solid waste consultant and recycling
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern I have is that recycling is going to be hitting
some rough times,'' he said. ``An oligopoly in waste will naturally
extend itself over recycling and put the brakes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks consolidation in the business is necessarily
a bad thing for consumers. Large companies may be more efficient
and cost-effective than small, ``mom-and-pop'' garbage haulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a landfill has gotten to be a pretty complex business
in a lot of respects,'' said Winston Porter, president of the Waste
Policy Center and a former assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``When I was at EPA eight or 10
years ago, there were 6,000 to 8,000 landfills in this country.
Today there are 2,900.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their size or the size of the company that owns
them, all landfills must meet federal environmental standards,
Porter pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the business of hauling and disposing of
municipal and industrial solid waste has been going on for years.
It has accelerated in the past decade, first because of new federal
regulations for waste disposal, and second because of an unexpected
national ``glut'' in waste disposal sites, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations were put into effect in 1989 and 1990 by the
EPA. They required that landfills be lined with thick plastic and a
layer of compacted clay several feet thick. The landfills also must
have systems of collecting and removing the water that leaches
through buried waste, wells for monitoring underground water
supplies, and systems for managing gases, principally methane,
given off by virtually every landfill.
</P>
<P>
   With these regulations, the local city dump was replaced by a
``solid waste landfill,'' a highly engineered system for managing
millions of tons of garbage. As economies of scale took over, the
landfills became very large.
</P>
<P>
   The country's busiest landfill, the county-owned Puente Hills
Landfill in Los Angeles, received 3.7 million tons of garbage and
other solid waste in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while city and county governments operate dozens of
``mega-landfills'' built or modified to meet the new EPA standards,
most facilities are privately owned. Until this year, four
companies _ Waste Management Inc., Browning-Ferris Industries, USA
Waste Inc., and Allied Waste Industries _ owned most of them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, USA Waste, the third-largest company, took over Waste
Management, the largest. And last month, Allied Waste Industries,
until last year the fourth largest, announced that it was taking
over Browning-Ferris Industries, the second largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of many years of activity,'' said Neil
Seldman, president of the Washington-based Institute for Local
Self-Reliance, a recycling advocacy group. ``The large companies
have spent years driving small haulers out of business or buying
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldman said that because they now control so many landfills,
the big companies can control the industry by setting the price for
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials say that when they issued the 1990 rules, they
expected large regional landfills to replace smaller local dumping
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not make good economic sense to build a small
landfill, if you could get together with your neighbor and build a
larger landfill,'' said Robert Dellinger, director of the EPA
division of municipal and industrial solid waste. ``We projected
there would be a reduction of the number of landfills.''
</P>
<P>
   What was not anticipated by EPA _ or anyone else _ was that the
a country that was worrying in 1990 about ``running out of places
to put garbage'' would overbuild and suddenly find itself with too
many landfills. As they grew and bought up competitors, the handful
of national solid waste haulers were largely responsible for this
development.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Anderson, a landfill glut has developed in the past
few years, resulting in prices that are depressed by competition.
Small ``mom and pop'' haulers, who typically empty their trucks in
downtown ``transfer stations'' operated by regional haulers and
landfill operators, could shop for the lowest fees.
</P>
<P>
   But as weaker landfill operators were bought up by the national
firms, these fees started rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'problem' pricing entities have been removed from most
markets,'' the investment banking firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
noted approvingly in a 1997 report. ``Mid-American Waste, which had
been in financial trouble for years, had been pricing low in order
to maximize cash flow throughout the Midwest and several other
markets. Mid-American was acquired by USA Waste in (the second
quarter of the year) and pricing was improved immediately
throughout these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell stock analyst says landfill
prices have ``improved,'' she does not mean your garbage bill just
went down.
</P>
<P>
   After USA Waste took over Waste Management Inc., it kept the
former company's name. It did not keep its landfill prices. Within
weeks of the Justice Department's approval of the deal, USA Waste
announced a 40 percent increase in these prices at many landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that while the Justice Department requires merging
companies to divest themselves of landfills in areas where mergers
would otherwise depress competition, he believes ``price
signaling'' and other informal means of avoiding competition will
inevitably lead to continuing price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Pressures on the industry will almost demand that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the industries of hauling and disposing of garbage
should be divided, so that haulers compete for local and regional
hauling contracts, and landfill operators then compete for the
haulers' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solid waste industry is about to reach its end game after
nearly three decades of consolidation,'' he said. ``That is the
point where two or three major integrated firms control the
landfills in many of the major markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Department of Justice seems to be
preoccupied with the giant Microsoft case and has little resources
to spare for the extensive effort that massive divestitures would
require,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the industry is under ``enormous pressure from
Wall Street to continue to demonstrate high earnings,'' but without
monopoly or oligopoly power is too low-tech to do that. The only
way to meet the pressure is to artificially raise prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the depressed landfill market is only one thorn in
the industry's side.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling is another.
</P>
<P>
   Seldman said studies have shown that hauling a piece of garbage
to a landfill is six times as profitable to a waste disposal
company as recycling it, even when the company collects an extra
fee for handling recyclable materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they do recycling is under duress,'' he said.
``They will use their size to control the bins and the trucks and
to discourage recycling wherever they can.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, about 27 percent of America's waste
stream is now recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to 55 or 60 percent diversion into recycling, then
the waste component will be the minority portion,'' Anderson said.
National waste firms ``are not stupid. They are not going to let
that happen. They have to make sure that recycling does not
maintain the option of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Railel, a spokesman for Waste Management, said the company
will continue to ``grow'' its recycling operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple answer is that recycling is part of our core
business,'' he said. ``We are continuing to grow that business. It
is part of the service that our customers are requesting, and we
will continue to provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Waste Management is the ``largest operator of
recycling facilities'' in the country and last year processed over
5 million tons of recyclables. Recycling accounts for slightly less
than 5 percent of the company's total revenue, he said, down by
about one-sixth from the revenue share it generated for the
previous Waste Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Allied Waste Industries did not respond to
telephone messages.

Astros' Reynolds might become an ace in place
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When it comes to the Astros' pitching staff, the talk always comes
back to the team's need for a No. 1-type pitcher, somebody to call
``ace.''
</P>
<P>
   They may already have one.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, righthander Shane Reynolds has faced
the acquisition of Randy Johnson, rumors of his name being on the
trading block and a failed attempt to land Roger Clemens. Through
it all, he remains in an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens are few and far
between,'' said Reynolds, set to make his fourth straight Opening
Day start Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs. ``If you are lucky
enough to have one of those guys, that's something special. We
found that out last year with Randy Johnson. None of us are
veteran, power-type pitchers that have that kind of leadership and
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   But last season, Reynolds had something equally important _
victories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he posted career highs with 19 wins and 209 strikeouts,
while ranking among the National League's top 10 in six different
categories. Only four pitchers had more victories. Two of them took
home Cy Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker, a former major-league pitcher for 14
years, thinks the only thing preventing Reynolds from gaining
mention among baseball's best is the ability to record successful
back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Only once has Reynolds, 31, posted double-digit victories in
consecutive seasons, winning 10 games in 1995 and 16 in '96. He
dropped to nine wins during an injury-plagued '97 season before
last season's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds came within one victory of being the first Astros
pitcher to win 20 games since Mike Scott in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the verge of being classified as a No. 1 pitcher. I
think Shane has pretty much gotten the respect of everyone around
the league,'' Dierker said. ``Most guys that you project as No. 1
pitchers are guys that throw real hard. What it boils down to is
making good pitches. Hitting the spots and having movement on your
pitches is more important than running the radar gun up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only gives you the aspect of a guy who doesn't walk
people, but he makes the hitters beat him instead of beating
himself,'' Dierker added. ``He can also get a strikeout with a man
on third and one out, which is one of the things you look for in a
No. 1 pitcher, a guy who can get out of a really tough jam by
getting strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of No. 1-caliber pitchers during the
club's 35-year history:
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Joe Niekro won 21 games during the 1979 season and
followed with 20 wins during the Astros' National League West
championship season in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Richard, one of the most overpowering pitchers in franchise
history, became a 20-game winner in 1976. He won 18 games each of
the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, with his bottom-dropping split-finger fastball, had
18-win seasons in 1985 and 1986 before breaking the 20-win barrier
in '89.
</P>
<P>
   After the departure of Darryl Kile to free agency last season,
Reynolds took on the responsibility of wearing the ``staff ace''
tag. Of his 19 wins last year, eight came after an Astros loss. He
went 7-1 following the July 31 trade for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In five full seasons, Reynolds' 63 victories rank 10th on the
club's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to take his place among the best (in club history)
if he does this for a few more years,'' Dierker said. ``If you
start getting yourself into the Top 10 pitching categories with any
team, that's a pretty good accomplishment. I don't think he's far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   What sets Reynolds apart is the way he is successful, relying on
placement rather than power. His split-finger fastball averages 87
to 90 mph, complementing a good curveball and cut fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key to success is when you go out and don't have your good
stuff, or don't feel good, and battle through it and keep a team
close, giving yourself a chance to win,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   This winter the Astros paid Reynolds the ultimate compliment,
signing him to a three-year, $21 million contract extension that
included a bonus: To quiet speculation of Reynolds' inclusion in a
possible deal with Toronto for Clemens, the extension had a
one-year no-trade clause and a limited no-trade clause for the
remainder of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' message: While a pitcher like Johnson or Clemens is
hard to find, so is a Reynolds. As long as he continues winning,
the Astros will possess the security blanket of an ``ace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice (to be considered the No. 1 pitcher),'' Reynolds
said. ``I think those guys are picked at the end of the year. The
guy you want to get the ball in a losing streak, the guy who took
the ball when we needed to win in a crucial situation. Those are
your No. 1s and your aces.'' &QL;

Wagner burns to join baseball's elite closers
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
For 24 outs, Billy Wagner finds a comfortable seat in the bullpen
and waits.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's time for the Astros' closer to make a cameo
appearance in the ninth inning, he suddenly can be thrown into the
leading role _ or become the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's job is simple, he says: ``Get the final three outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when legendary relief pitchers like Goose
Gossage or Rollie Fingers pitched three, sometimes four, innings to
pick up a save. Today, power has replaced endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a hitter hits the ball, there's a potential that the
fielder could make an error or the ball could fall in for a hit,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ``When you don't let the guy hit the
ball, there's nothing left to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of closer has taken on a specific definition, conjuring
the image of flamethrowing, strikeout-type pitchers. Only 27 years
old and with just two full seasons of experience, Wagner has
emerged as one of the game's best closers.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a fastball that can approach 100 mph, the lefthander
saved 30 games last year while striking out 97 in 60 innings. In
1997, he saved 23 games and struck out 106 in 66 innings. Each
season, the Astros won the National League Central with Wagner as
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how the game has changed,'' Wagner said. ``I
remember Gossage used to come in, throw three innings and get a
save. Now there are times when I might throw to one hitter and get
the save.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner didn't even begin his professional career as a closer.
The 12th overall pick of the 1993 draft was a starter until coming
up to the majors toward the end of 1995. He began 1996 as a starter
at Class AAA Tucson before making a full-time switch to closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a starter, I had to be able to pace myself and try and keep
my pitch count low to get to the sixth or seventh innings,'' said
Wagner, who converted 19 straight save opportunities last season.
``As a closer, I just come in and have one inning, trying to get
batters out any way I can. If it takes 20 pitches, so be it. If it
takes five pitches, it's just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Wagner's 30 saves last season, third-most in the 37-year
history of the Astros franchise, 10 came when he faced three or
fewer batters. Even more impressive: He struck out the side 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner likely will challenge Doug Jones' single-season record of
36 saves this season. No Astros pitcher has twice saved 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   Already Wagner ranks fourth on the club's career saves list with
62. Dave Smith holds the record with 199, set during an 11-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros believe the best is yet to come for Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dave Smith, you knew he would throw strikes,'' Dierker
said. ``With Billy, there is still the chance he may be a little
erratic, but he has the chance to be better than all of (the former
Astros closers). This year I think he may approach Smith in terms
of being consistently reliable. I still believe he can get even
better. If he doesn't encounter arm trouble, (he could) be the best
we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said there is no added pressure after the Astros gave him
one of the biggest raises, percentage-wise, in baseball history _ a
$10.3 million, three-year contract that boosted his 1999 salary to
$2.1 million from $280,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wagner has set his sights on reaching 40 saves,
generally the benchmark for closers. Last season, eight closers had
at least 40, including an NL record-tying 53 by San Diego's Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opportunity to get 40 saves, where in the last
couple of years it wouldn't have mattered if we had 160 chances
because I wouldn't have gotten 40 saves,'' he said. ``Last year I
got 30 and it was like scrapping to get there. In my mind, 30 saves
anybody can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   To help become one of the game's best, Wagner took notes during
an all-star tour of Japan last November. Tom Gordon, Dan Plesac,
Mike Jackson and Ugueth Urbina all suggested Wagner add a second
pitch to his repertoire. He spent the rest of the winter working on
a slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a step to being a complete pitcher,'' Wagner
said. ``If you've got guys coming up to the plate looking for that
first-pitch fastball and I throw them a slider they are still going
to look for that fastball. They would be crazy not to. Now I can go
out there and throw a slider, and every time they'll be going, `Now
what are you going to throw me?' It's a process that's going to
take some time.''

PRIME MINISTERS RETURN AS TALKS ON DISARMING IRA   CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, Northern Ireland _ For the third consecutive
night, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland pressed Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders Wednesday
night to compromise in the bitter dispute over the disarmament of
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is blocking the advance of the peace effort in this
British province.
</P>
<P>
   The two men left Ulster Wednesday morning after two days of
negotiations, took part in parliamentary debates in London and in
Dublin and returned Wednesday night to Hillsborough Castle, 15
miles south of Belfast, the residence of the Northern Ireland
secretary, Mo Mowlam, to try to reach a settlement by Friday, the
deadline set by Ms. Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can make it,'' Blair said before leaving Wednesday
morning, promising to return if he felt a compromise could be
reached Wednesday night. He returned in a helicopter about 8:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates, a group of Protestants aligned with the Rev.
Ian Paisley, who opposes the peace agreement, yelled ``Traitor!''
and ``No surrender!'' at official cars.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of the disarmament dispute would pave the way for
the transfer of home rule powers by Britain to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly. The transfer is part of the peace agreement
approved in Belfast last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives more political power to the Catholic
minority in Ulster and more influence in northern affairs to the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to settle the disarmament problem could lead to
increased sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting problem is that the transfer of home rule powers
may not start until the new Northern Ireland Assembly, led by a
Protestant first minister, David Trimble, forms a cabinet. Sinn
Fein, the IRA political wing, is to receive two of the cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble says he will not form a cabinet with Sinn Fein until
the IRA makes a ``credible beginning'' to disarming its arsenal,
estimated at 100 tons of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 20 months, which is
regularly cited by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, as proof that
the group supports the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the IRA issued a statement that was immediately and
predictably described as negative by Protestant Unionists and as
positive by Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, part of an annual proclamation marking the
anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising of Republicans against the
British colonial power, said: ``The IRA guns are silent. Over the
past five years, we have called and maintained two prolonged
cessations of military operations to enhance the democratic process
and underline our definitive commitment to its success. If the
political will exists, the peace process contains the potential to
resolve the conflict and deliver a durable peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestants, including Trimble, said the statement was
politically useless because it did not contain an unequivocal
promise to start disarming in the immediat

MARINERS FUTURE IN THE STARS: GRIFFEY AND RODRIGUEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Every night before he goes to sleep, Chuck Armstrong
says, he thinks of four words: faith, hope, competitive and fans.
With those thoughts on his mind, the president of the Mariners must
dream of a time when Safeco Field's roof is open and the stars are
aligned just right.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of his task _ making baseball thrive in Seattle
well into the 21st century _ must arrive with that first splash of
cold water in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, the Mariners' stars will be crossed, not
aligned. This, after all, is a franchise that took 15 years to win
more games than it lost. Just when it seemed time to print World
Series tickets for the next decade, along came a year like 1998,
when optimism crash-landed at nine games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field, opening in July, was thought to ensure long-term
prosperity. Now, with salaries skyrocketing and two-thirds of all
teams soon to be playing in new or remodeled parks, it has been
reduced to only part of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mariners' blueprint for long-term success begins with
the $498 million retractable-roof ballpark. The Mariners expect it
to make them an additional $20-30 million a year, much of it
earmarked to pay loans on the $80 million in construction overruns.
Armstrong is projecting a slight loss this year but would like to
break even, and the club hopes to start making money by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a pleasant change for an ownership group that has,
on average, lost almost $12 million a year since taking over in
1992. It's incentive enough to stay together, even after
accomplishing the initial goal of keeping the team in Seattle and
building a new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ownership group is absolutely stable,'' said chairman and
CEO John Ellis. ``Why in the world would it be otherwise? They've
taken all the beating and they've lost all the money. They're just
at the stage now where all the work that we've done should begin to
pay off in terms of a great facility and a competitive team,
hopefully a team that at least is in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense no inclination on the part of any portion of our
ownership to do anything. In fact, they're all looking forward to
probably the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, at 70, makes no promises about remaining with the club
past the opening of Safeco Field. But for now, as the newest member
of Major League Baseball's executive council, he is campaigning for
greater revenue sharing and other ideas to temper the growing
payroll disparity among teams.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the Mariners to leap to the wealthy side of that
payroll gulf. Neither Ellis nor Armstrong said Safeco Field will
significantly change the way the club pursues high-priced talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody gets a new ballpark and they take the increased
revenues that the new ballpark brings and they spend it all on
players, then we're back in the same fix,'' Armstrong said. ``We
haven't really improved ourselves; we've just racheted it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations, said
this fact is undisputable in today's game: to compete every year, a
team must be among the top 10 in payroll. The Mariners were seventh
in 1996, 11th in '97 and eighth at the start of last year. This
year, they will be 15th or 16th. Woodward is hopeful of returning
to the top 10, but said it will take more than a ballpark to stay
there year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new stadium should help us,'' Woodward said. ``(But) in
the long run, it's going to take a new system in baseball to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, the Mariners will have to make money in more
creative ways. Armstrong said the team has studied English soccer
fields to find out how to host non-sports events such as concerts
without damaging the turf. The team also would like greater
visibility throughout the Northwest with increased marketing of the
compass rose logo and farther-reaching TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the Mariners have drawn the highest cable
ratings share in baseball. Last year, the M's collected $16.2
million in local broadcasting rights. But, Armstrong said, the
Mariners are limited in how much they can make from TV because so
many road games start so early. The club still favors re-alignment
along geographic lines, which would make its TV package more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they do, and however the system is changed, it won't
change the fact that Seattle never will be New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our market will ever put us in position just to
buy a pennant,'' said Roger Jongewaard, vice president for scouting
and player development.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the burden for the Mariners' future falls on Jongewaard
and his staff, who have signed more major leaguers in the 1990s
than all but three teams. One way to get more of an edge on other
clubs is through international scouting, which essentially is a
free-for-all outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our scouts they probably won't make as much money and
they'll probably have to work harder,'' Jongewaard said. ``But
ownership has been very cooperative, and if we want a player bad
enough, they help us get him. We just don't get every player out
there. We have to be more selective and make fewer mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Korea have been fruitful for the Mariners, and Latin
America should play an increasingly important role with the opening
of a Venezuelan academy last year and expected forays into Colombia
and Panama. Jongewaard believes untapped talent sources remain,
including mainland China, Africa and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to keep any elite prospect a secret. Last spring,
the Mariners lost out on Orlando Hernandez when the Yankees gave
him more than $6 million, double the offer of other clubs. Seattle
favors a worldwide draft, Armstrong said, which would eliminate
bidding wars it could not win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jongewaard can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Jongewaard's track record is tremendous, and it's
overlooked far too often,'' Woodward said. ``This organization's
problem has not been bringing players through the system. It's been
being able to keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella and six players are signed through 2000. No
Mariners are signed beyond then. Ellis said Safeco Field should
make the franchise ``self-sustaining,'' finally able to keep its
own players. But the price for two of those could be staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, twin free agents after the
2000 season? The Mariners grappling with 29 teams for the two best
players in the game? It's a frightening thought, and the M's have
made it known they'll negotiate seriously whenever the players are
ready.
</P>
<P>
   The players also have made something clear: they won't come back
unless they know the team will be a consistent winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a third guy that says the very same thing,'' Woodward
said. ``Nobody thinks of that, do they? Do you ever hear me take
opposition to their comments about that? Because I'm the third guy.
I want to be able to compete and to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jongewaard, who has stocked the farm system with pitching, has
begun to shift the focus to position players, in part because it's
unknown what Griffey and Rodriguez will do. But Woodward said he
has not contemplated a Mariner roster without either star. He is
confident, he said, because Armstrong and Ellis are committed to
bringing both back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason that would prevent us from doing that,''
Ellis said. ``Anybody who thinks opposite is just crazy. If they
decide they don't want to, I don't have any control over that. But
we're going to do whatever it takes to sign these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If that means being the highest bidder in the mother of all free
agent sweepstakes, Ellis isn't saying. But if this winter's Kevin
Brown derby showed anything, it's that some teams can pay any price
for a player they think they need.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledges this. It's one reason the Mariners want
to sign the players before they reach free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what history says, because once a player goes on the
free agent market, you've got 30 bidders, and all it takes is one
to go (make an offer beyond baseball's established market) and you
lose your guy,'' Armstrong said. ``I think, and I've discussed this
with player agents too, that sometimes they're finding players
think the grass looks greener when they go someplace for the
short-term money, and the grass isn't greener. It becomes
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners probably will try to sell the players on the
benefits of spending an entire career in one city. Armstrong speaks
hopefully of Griffey and Rodriguez becoming to Seattle what Tony
Gwynn and Cal Ripken are to their cities.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this will come down to money. When asked if he was
confident the Mariners could make the financial commitment, Ellis
said, ``Sure,'' and would not elaborate. Armstrong answered the
question with two questions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to have to pay whatever the market is,''
he said. ``But what's the market? At what point is the market going
to go down?''
</P>
<P>
   Fair questions. Perhaps only this much is known: If either
player leaves, those comforting dreams of faith and hope quickly
turn into nightmares. The skies rumble, the roof closes up. Storm
front ahead.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Indians have another easy road to division title, but postseason
questions linger
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Forget about the Yankees being the best bet in baseball to make the
postseason. How about the Indians?
</P>
<P>
   They play in a division so weak _ the American League Central _
that no other team managed to play .500 ball last year. Still, the
Indians only finished nine games ahead of the second-place White
Sox, which is why some are starting to question their prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Indians have the second-best record in the AL over
the last five years, they have fallen short of 90 wins in each of
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Does playing in the weakest division in baseball make the
Indians soft when the postseason rolls around? Probably not, but
that's the popular theory these days. That doesn't take into
account the fact the Indians played in the World Series two years
ago and reached the AL Championship Series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there's talk that manager Mike Hargrove's job
might be in jeopardy if the Indians don't find a way to dethrone
the Yankees in 1999. Of course, it should come as no surprise that
the Yankees are used as the standard when it comes to evaluating
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland certainly has no competition in its own division.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Tigers: OK, we said the Tigers were ready to make a move
last season, and all they did was lose 97 games. Looks like the
rise to the top is going to take longer than anyone anticipated.
But you can expect to see progress this season, although they
aren't quite ready to compete for a postseason spot.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox: The White Sox didn't have far to fall, but
they managed to spiral themselves closer to the basement by losing
Albert Belle and Robin Ventura during the offseason. If Frank
Thomas ever returns to the playoffs, it won't be with the White
Sox. Expect to hear his name in a few trade rumors as the trading
deadline nears.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter, Tigers: He's had plenty of time to establish
himself as the next Kenny Lofton, which is what some observers said
the Astros traded away when they dealt Hunter to the Tigers three
years ago. He's still young, so there's hope; but any leadoff man
with a .298 on-base percentage has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair, Tigers: He won 16 games for the Tigers two years
ago and earned a fat contract from the Diamondbacks worth almost $7
million a year. He's not worth it, as last year's 5-16 record with
the Diamondbacks and the Mets proved.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson, Tigers: He doesn't get much notice because he's
played only on losing teams. But Higginson is a gamer who will hit
for power and average. He has more support in the Tigers' lineup
this year, and it could lead to a breakthrough season.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham, White Sox: And don't say he only made the All-Star
Game last season because every team must have a representative.
While Durham isn't the best second baseman in the AL, he's
certainly becoming one of the best. His all-around talents are
among the few bright spots on an otherwise dismal team.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson, Indians: He hit 11 homers in 174 at-bats last
season, and the Indians plan to use him as a designated hitter in
1999. Don't let his basketball player's build fool you. This kid
has some serious power, and he will become a fixture in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordoez, White Sox: With one full season under his belt,
the expectations will go up; especially with Belle and Ventura out
of the picture. But the 25-year-old outfielder has the tools to
live up to his billing. He could hit .300 with 20-25 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden, Indians: He's hardly the pitcher he once was. His
velocity isn't the same, and he's no longer a threat to toss a
shutout every time he takes the mound. He'll win games simply
because he pitches for a great team, but time is running out for
this once-great pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Navarro, White Sox: Signed three years ago to be the ace
of the staff, Navarro has been a major bust. He's just barely
hanging on to the fifth spot in the rotation. The White Sox have
tried to trade him, but they can find no takers. His best years are
past.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus, Tigers: His reputation for aiding the development
of pitchers has made the expectations almost unrealistic. If the
Tigers' pitching staff doesn't show improvement, Ausmus surely will
take some of the blame. However, if they do improve, his stock will
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas, White Sox: He hit just .265 and struck out 93
times last season, and he spent most of his time complaining about
the strike zone and how umpires were out to get him. It appears the
1999 strike zone will be more favorable to hitters. If Thomas
doesn't rebound, who's he going to blame this time?
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   the Tigers reversed their luck from a year ago and actually got
off to a fast start? That could make things interesting for the
Indians, who have grown accustomed to virtually wrapping up the
division before the All-Star break. If the Tigers' lineup is solid,
and if they get decent pitching, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   A good start seems certain for the Indians, who play Minnesota,
Kansas City and Oakland 16 times during the first month of the
season. The first possible preview of the ALCS won't take place
until July 23-25 when they visit Yankee Stadium. Meanwhile, the
Tigers' first six games are on the road against the Rangers and
Yankees. &QL;

 &HT;    THE GARBAGE BUSINESS IS BECOMING COMPACTED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the government presses its widely publicized
charges that Microsoft Corp. tried to unfairly dominate America's
access to computer software, a rapid consolidation of corporate
power is quietly taking place around a humbler but equally
pervasive part of life: garbage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some critics think, your garbage bill inevitably
will go up and the national trend toward recycling will reverse.
</P>
<P>
   If a series of announced mega-mergers is approved, the country
will enter the next millennium with two companies in control of
picking up, hauling off, dumping and recycling more than half its
municipal and industrial solid waste.
</P>
<P>
   The two corporations will be Waste Management Inc. of Houston
and the entity created by the merger of Browning-Ferris Industries,
also of Houston, and Allied Waste Industries of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They will share more than $18 billion in annual revenue for
handling what's left when we get through with newspapers, coffee
grounds, milk jugs and, for that matter, just about everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than half of the estimated $35 billion Americans pay
every year for garbage collection and disposal. What's left will be
divided among local governments, one other national garbage
collector and several thousand small local and regional haulers.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidations are being driven primarily by the companies'
efforts to deal with depressed revenues caused by a national glut
of landfills and have been followed by price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also say the national trend toward recycling will
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Big solid waste companies lose money every time something is
recycled instead of going into one of their landfills, said Peter
Anderson, a Madison, Wis., solid waste consultant and recycling
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern I have is that recycling is going to be hitting
some rough times,'' he said. ``An oligopoly in waste will naturally
extend itself over recycling and put the brakes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks consolidation in the business is necessarily
a bad thing for consumers. Large companies may be more efficient
and cost-effective than small, ``mom-and-pop'' garbage haulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a landfill has gotten to be a pretty complex business
in a lot of respects,'' said Winston Porter, president of the Waste
Policy Center and a former assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``When I was at EPA eight or 10
years ago, there were 6,000 to 8,000 landfills in this country.
Today there are 2,900.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their size or the size of the company that owns
them, all landfills must meet federal environmental standards,
Porter pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the business of hauling and disposing of
municipal and industrial solid waste has been going on for years.
It has accelerated in the past decade, first because of new federal
regulations for waste disposal, and second because of an unexpected
national ``glut'' in waste disposal sites, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations were put into effect in 1989 and 1990 by the
EPA. They required that landfills be lined with thick plastic and a
layer of compacted clay several feet thick. The landfills also must
have systems of collecting and removing the water that leaches
through buried waste, wells for monitoring underground water
supplies, and systems for managing gases, principally methane,
given off by virtually every landfill.
</P>
<P>
   With these regulations, the local city dump was replaced by a
``solid waste landfill,'' a highly engineered system for managing
millions of tons of garbage. As economies of scale took over, the
landfills became very large.
</P>
<P>
   The country's busiest landfill, the county-owned Puente Hills
Landfill in Los Angeles, received 3.7 million tons of garbage and
other solid waste in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while city and county governments operate dozens of
``mega-landfills'' built or modified to meet the new EPA standards,
most facilities are privately owned. Until this year, four
companies _ Waste Management Inc., Browning-Ferris Industries, USA
Waste Inc., and Allied Waste Industries _ owned most of them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, USA Waste, the third-largest company, took over Waste
Management, the largest. And last month, Allied Waste Industries,
until last year the fourth largest, announced that it was taking
over Browning-Ferris Industries, the second largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of many years of activity,'' said Neil
Seldman, president of the Washington-based Institute for Local
Self-Reliance, a recycling advocacy group. ``The large companies
have spent years driving small haulers out of business or buying
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldman said that because they now control so many landfills,
the big companies can control the industry by setting the price for
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials say that when they issued the 1990 rules, they
expected large regional landfills to replace smaller local dumping
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not make good economic sense to build a small
landfill, if you could get together with your neighbor and build a
larger landfill,'' said Robert Dellinger, director of the EPA
division of municipal and industrial solid waste. ``We projected
there would be a reduction of the number of landfills.''
</P>
<P>
   What was not anticipated by EPA _ or anyone else _ was that the
a country that was worrying in 1990 about ``running out of places
to put garbage'' would overbuild and suddenly find itself with too
many landfills. As they grew and bought up competitors, the handful
of national solid waste haulers were largely responsible for this
development.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Anderson, a landfill glut has developed in the past
few years, resulting in prices that are depressed by competition.
Small ``mom and pop'' haulers, who typically empty their trucks in
downtown ``transfer stations'' operated by regional haulers and
landfill operators, could shop for the lowest fees.
</P>
<P>
   But as weaker landfill operators were bought up by the national
firms, these fees started rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'problem' pricing entities have been removed from most
markets,'' the investment banking firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
noted approvingly in a 1997 report. ``Mid-American Waste, which had
been in financial trouble for years, had been pricing low in order
to maximize cash flow throughout the Midwest and several other
markets. Mid-American was acquired by USA Waste in (the second
quarter of the year) and pricing was improved immediately
throughout these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell stock analyst says landfill
prices have ``improved,'' she does not mean your garbage bill just
went down.
</P>
<P>
   After USA Waste took over Waste Management Inc., it kept the
former company's name. It did not keep its landfill prices. Within
weeks of the Justice Department's approval of the deal, USA Waste
announced a 40 percent increase in these prices at many landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that while the Justice Department requires merging
companies to divest themselves of landfills in areas where mergers
would otherwise depress competition, he believes ``price
signaling'' and other informal means of avoiding competition will
inevitably lead to continuing price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Pressures on the industry will almost demand that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the industries of hauling and disposing of garbage
should be divided, so that haulers compete for local and regional
hauling contracts, and landfill operators then compete for the
haulers' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solid waste industry is about to reach its end game after
nearly three decades of consolidation,'' he said. ``That is the
point where two or three major integrated firms control the
landfills in many of the major markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Department of Justice seems to be
preoccupied with the giant Microsoft case and has little resources
to spare for the extensive effort that massive divestitures would
require,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the industry is under ``enormous pressure from
Wall Street to continue to demonstrate high earnings,'' but without
monopoly or oligopoly power is too low-tech to do that. The only
way to meet the pressure is to artificially raise prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the depressed landfill market is only one thorn in
the industry's side.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling is another.
</P>
<P>
   Seldman said studies have shown that hauling a piece of garbage
to a landfill is six times as profitable to a waste disposal
company as recycling it, even when the company collects an extra
fee for handling recyclable materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they do recycling is under duress,'' he said.
``They will use their size to control the bins and the trucks and
to discourage recycling wherever they can.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, about 27 percent of America's waste
stream is now recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to 55 or 60 percent diversion into recycling, then
the waste component will be the minority portion,'' Anderson said.
National waste firms ``are not stupid. They are not going to let
that happen. They have to make sure that recycling does not
maintain the option of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Railel, a spokesman for Waste Management, said the company
will continue to ``grow'' its recycling operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple answer is that recycling is part of our core
business,'' he said. ``We are continuing to grow that business. It
is part of the service that our customers are requesting, and we
will continue to provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Waste Management is the ``largest operator of
recycling facilities'' in the country and last year processed over
5 million tons of recyclables. Recycling accounts for slightly less
than 5 percent of the company's total revenue, he said, down by
about one-sixth from the revenue share it generated for the
previous Waste Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Allied Waste Industries did not respond to
telephone messages.

Left a spot by injury, Hidalgo must produce
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Richard Hidalgo will eventually make a name for himself in the
major leagues. In the meantime, he will try to make people forget
another name _ Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to think Hidalgo can replace Alou, who fell off a
treadmill and onto the disabled list in February. What the Astros
envision, though, is Hidalgo establishing himself in his first
full-time gig in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to blossom,'' bench coach Matt Galante
said. ``He got his feet wet last year. It's not like he hasn't had
an opportunity to play. He's had enough at-bats in the big leagues
to come into his own. I would be very surprised if Richard didn't
have a really solid season.''
</P>
<P>
   With Alou out until at least August with a knee injury, the
Astros are counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, 32, has been one of the game's best throughout his
nine-year career, but never more than last year, when he finished
third in voting for National League Most Valuable Player after
hitting .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, 23, doesn't even have a full year under his belt. He
hit .303 with seven home runs and 35 RBIs in 74 games last season.
But since he was discovered in Venezuela and nurtured through the
Astros' farm system, Hidalgo has just wanted a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous,'' said Hidalgo, who shared center field with
Carl Everett last season before missing two months with a shoulder
injury. ``I've been waiting for a chance to play for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe in me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than he might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros protected Hidalgo instead of fellow Venezuelan Bobby
Abreu in the 1997 expansion draft. And they refused to include him
in trade negotiations last July with Seattle for Randy Johnson or
this winter with Toronto for Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should certainly reinforce in his mind that he belongs
here, that he's capable of playing here, and he's primed to take on
a greater role,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   In a short amount of time, Hidalgo has left a lasting impression
on the Astros' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hungry,'' said first base coach Jose Cruz, one of the
greatest to play in the Astros' outfield. ``Too bad somebody plays
because another guy got hurt. But he was going to get a chance
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo is projected to hit 25 to 30 home runs and drive in 100
runs someday. His biggest asset will be in left field, where he
will have one of the top arms in the NL. Since turning pro, Hidalgo
has played center field and right field. He will play left for the
first time in his career this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope some of those guys take chances on him,'' Galante
said, ``because normally your left fielder has the weakest arm of
the three outfielders. We have it where he is basically our
strongest arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Everett, ``Not to knock Moises or anything, but Richard is
a better outfielder. As far as hitting 40 homers and driving in 130
runs, you don't know that yet because he hasn't played a full
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems inevitable that every time Hidalgo, Everett and right
fielder Derek Bell take the field, they will be scrutinized more in
the absence of Alou. That's something they plan to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose any games and, say, the outfield goes
0-for-whatever, they are going to say, `What if Mo was here?'
Regardless, you're going to have your critics,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hidalgo) will not replace Mo,'' Galante said. ``Nobody can
replace Mo by themselves. We have to replace him by other guys
picking it up. Down the road, Richard may be a great player. It's
not his rookie year anymore and he's ready to take off, but
certainly he isn't in Alou's class at this point and time.''

NATO TIGHTENS `NOOSE ON MILOSEVIC' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO, opening the second week of airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, vowed Wednesday to leave President Slobodan Milosevic
no safe place from which to plan or execute his campaign against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the United States and its
allies were tightening ``NATO's noose on Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh night of the aerial bombardment, alliance
missiles slammed into the headquarters of a Serbian special forces
unit in Belgrade _ apparently the closest strike to the capital's
center so far, Bacon said. Coming days could see direct air assault
on such key installations as the Yugoslav Interior Ministry, home
of Milosevic's police force, allied sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Improving weather over the Balkans offered NATO the hope of more
sustained bombing by day and night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe,
confirmed that NATO political leaders had given him ``expanded
authority'' and said he would be looking at ``a larger array of
possible targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark refused to detail which sites had been newly opened to
NATO military planners, but said, ``We're going to take every
action that's available within our means and capabilities to bring
home the tragedy of his policy to President Milosevic and his
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that almost no target in Yugoslavia is off limits,
alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said: ``It's clear that no facility,
no unit, which is currently being used to plan, conceive, direct or
carry out the Yugoslav campaign against the Kosovars, is going to
be a sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to their attempt to dampen any thought that the air
campaign could succeed quickly, officials in several NATO capitals
talked about the long haul that may be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going away,'' British Defense Secretary George
Robertson told the House of Commons late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the mission will
not be defined by the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no firm timetable for this,'' Lockhart said. ``This is
going to move forward and either President Milosevic is going to
change his calculation or we are going to continually and
systematically hit his military and deprive him of the ability to
impose his will,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance air commander David Wilby said that the ``week of hard
work'' had taken its toll, even if Milosevic had refused the demand
to stop violence against the Kosovars and allow NATO to police a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he is running short of fuel,'' Wilby said at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. ``We are now starting to hit him
very hard on the ground. We've hit him in his command and control
facilities. You will start to see the resolve starting to crack
very quickly. I believe we've accomplished one hell of a lot in
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby also said Milosevic's air power ``is almost nonexistent
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees continued to flood out of Kosovo, although Shea said
the flow ``slowed somewhat'' because Yugoslav border guards
sporadically closed the border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton authorized $50 million from an emergency
account and the Department of Defense to aid Kosovar refugees who
have moved into Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said half of the money would be given to the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees and the remainder would finance
direct food and shelter assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent a
seven-member disaster assistance team to Albania, which has been
flooded with refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said most refugees
leaving Kosovo are women and children, ``and we are gravely
concerned by the whereabouts and fate of the missing men.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least two Kosovar Albanian leaders reported to have been
executed by Serbs are alive, U.S. diplomats said. NATO had reported
the killing of Fehmi Agani, a delegate to recent peace talks in
France, and Baton Haxhiu, a newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo ``are in a truly
precarious position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no food, no water, no shelter,'' Shea said. ``At
least those refugees outside Kosovo can be succored by the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Bacon said there was no feasible way to
attempt to aid ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to do it would be through airdrops, and I think
it is not a very hospitable area through which to fly airdrops at
this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said reports were increasing about Kosovars being stripped
of records, what the spokesman has called ``identity elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav forces, so we are learning, are destroying the
archives of the Kosovar people,'' Shea said. ``Property deeds,
marriage licenses, birth certificates, financial and other records,
public records are being systematically destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after a Russian mission to Belgrade failed to produce a
breakthrough in the international standoff, NATO leaders were faced
with a Kremlin plan to send a group of ships in the Mediterranean
Sea soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large
deployment might send to Belgrade and other countries in the
region,`` State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that although the Russian foreign ministry ``has made
it quite clear that Russia does not intend to become entangled in
the conflict in the Balkans ... the deployments of these ships we
don't see as a particularly helpful gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the Clinton administration ``is concerned the
development will encourage Milosevic to hold out. And that concern
has been communicated to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents moved into the Yugoslav Embassy in Washington
early Wednesday to enforce an evacuation order against Belgrade
diplomats. Yugoslavia announced a week ago it was breaking
diplomatic ties with the United States and other major NATO nations
because of the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade was closed last weekend.

Division full of big bats may be decided by pitching
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The American League West produced the only race in the junior
circuit in 1998, and it appears to be the most balanced division in
the league this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   Defending division champion Texas and Anaheim both sought
pitching help during the offseason but came up empty-handed. So
they settled for upgrading their offenses, and both acquired impact
players.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, who had 40 home runs and 115 RBIs last year in
Boston, gives the Angels the feared slugger they have lacked for
years. Along with Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad and Jim Edmonds, the
Angels' lineup now looks formidable. Vaughn also will bring
attitude to a team that has been considered soft.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers countered by signing Rafael Palmeiro, who hit 43
homers and drove in 123 runs last year in Baltimore. They already
had AL Most Valuable Player Juan Gonzalez (.318, 45 HR, 157 RBIs)
and five other players who hit 10 or more homers last season.
Scoring runs won't be a problem for either team.
</P>
<P>
   With Ken Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez leading
the way, the Mariners potentially could have a more potent offense
than either of the front-runners, but they also lack pitching
depth. A pair of 36-year-olds _ Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer _ lead
the Seattle rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Expect all three teams to be on the lookout for a legitimate No.
1 starter sometime before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever team strikes first could move into the driver's seat.
Oakland has the best starting pitcher in the division _ Kenny
Rogers _ and some of the best young talent in the game, but the
Athletics are not quite ready to bang with the big sluggers of this
division.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners: Surely they can't get much lower than they
were last year, when their best pitcher didn't want to be on the
team and their relievers couldn't protect a lead to save their
lives. With a few breaks, they could contend for the division
title.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Athletics: Only because someone has to fall into this
category. They haven't quite come out of the slide that has
engulfed them since their glory days of the late 1980s and the
early 1990s. But with a nice collection of young players, there is
hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey, Mariners: The former top prospect of the Mets put
up good numbers in the minors but hasn't done much at the
big-league level. If he doesn't hit homers at the Kingdome, he's
not going to hit them anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark, Rangers: He already was overrated; the Cubs made him
overvalued when they signed him to a one-year, $5 million contract
before last season. All they got in return was a 9-14 record. Now
he's the Rangers' problem.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, Mariners: You can always count on his batting
average to be near .300, and his power numbers are decent. But
Segui's best talent _ his defensive skills _ often goes unnoticed.
He's worthy of a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin, Rangers: He's one of the best leadoff hitters in
the majors, and also one of the most overlooked. Goodwin had a .378
on-base percentage and stole 38 bases last season.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez, Athletics: He hit 33 homers and drove in 132 runs
while jumping from Class A to Class AAA last season. Many believe
he will give Oakland its second AL Rookie of the Year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen, Mariners: He's the jewel of the package Seattle
received from the Astros in exchange for Randy Johnson. Guillen is
a flashy fielder who will post impressive offensive numbers for a
second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza, Rangers: He once was one of the most promising
young pitchers in the National League; now he's frustrating to
watch. The Rangers must be having second thoughts about trading
second-base prospect Warren Morris to acquire Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis, Mariners: He may as well play third base without a
glove. He couldn't do much worse. Davis committed 32 errors last
season, prompting the Mariners to move him to left field. He was
even worse there, so now he's back at third.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, Mariners: Ownership let the GM slide after last
year's fallout, but he probably won't be so lucky if things don't
get better in 1999. It would help his case if the three prospects
he acquired in the Johnson deal make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips, Athletics: He was lucky to get a job after a poor
showing in 1998 and drug problems in 1997. The 39-year-old veteran
simply can't afford another slip-up.
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   the Mariners get a step-up pitching performance from someone in
the bottom of the rotation _ perhaps rookie Freddy Garcia _ and
closer Jose Mesa finally rediscovers his dominant form? The
Mariners already have a potent offense. Maybe the AL West isn't a
two-team race after all.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   It won't take long for the Rangers and Angels to have their
first meeting. They will get together for a four-game series April
9-12 at The Ballpark at Arlington. The Mariners host the Rangers on
June 25-27 in their final series at the Kingdome, and they
entertain the Padres on July 15-17 in their inaugural series at
Safeco Park.

   CACAK, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav Army conducted its first guided
tour of significant bomb damage in Serbia Wednesday, taking
journalists to two central Serbian towns roughly 60 miles south of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The large Sloboda, or Freedom, factory here was destroyed in two
NATO raids involving some 10 missiles each over two different
nights, March 28 and March 30, local and army officials said. Ten
civilians were wounded in the attacks, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, including the angry general manager of the
factory, Radovan Ljujic, said that the factory produced only
civilian products, like vacuum cleaners, ovens and electrical
heaters, and had no military purpose at all. He estimated it would
cost $300 million to replace the factory, the largest in Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   Ljujic accused NATO of a callous disregard for the livelihood of
his 5,000 workers and their 15,000 dependents.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will they live now?'' he asked. ``All the stories that we
were producing military equipment are false.''
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Hadzi-Vukovic, a former journalist who joined the army
press center in Belgrade three days ago, said: ``If a vacuum
cleaner or a hair dryer can kill, then maybe this is a military
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Western military officials, reached by telephone, said that the
factory was also producing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, who were only issued wartime press passes on
Tuesday, had no way to judge the disparate assertions. Around and
inside the shattered buildings were ``Sloboda'' brand vacuum
cleaners in various states of destruction from the missile damage,
as well as spare parts, printed brochures, smashed ovens, heaters,
hair dryers and other domestic appliances. There was little sign of
fire damage.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also two large buildings of the factory that were
roped off by police tape. Press officers in civilian clothes said
the buildings were too dangerous to enter because of the bomb
damage. The police also continually demanded that journalists stop
interviewing the few factory workers who were milling around the
ruins in their royal blue overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Those workers who were interviewed mostly expressed their fury
and sadness at the loss of their livelihood and uttered patriotic
sentiments that seemed genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Mihajlo Draskovic, one of the workers, had red eyes and burst
into tears when asked to discuss the factory.``How will my family
live now when everything is destroyed?'' He has two children, he
said, and had worked for the factory for 25 years, making
approximately $50 to $60 a month. ``Why did they do this?'' he
asked, before striding away.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Djordjevic said he had worked for the factory for 30 years
as a mechanic making engine rotors. ``This whole assembly line was
Western equipment we paid for,'' he said, pointing to a broken
machine-tool. ``Now the West destroys our factory. You know, we're
just workers and honest people.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the army brought three busloads of journalists to
Kragujevac, where a large barracks and other military buildings had
been destroyed in the first night of the missile and bomb strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The tin roofs of the buildings had caved in and girders poked
through the rubble of an air force facility. Craters measured 20
yards across and about 5 yards deep.
</P>
<P>
   But army officials and spokesmen said there had been no
casualties from the strike. A farmer nearby said he had lost
several chickens in the blasts, but that his goat had survived.
</P>
<P>
   The town is famous in Serbia as the site of a horrendous Nazi
execution, in which 7,000 civilians, including several hundred
schoolchildren, were slain in retaliation for the killing of Nazi
soldiers. In a nearby park, there was a large anti-NATO rally under
a large stone memorial to the dead in the shape of a Roman number
V, to commemorate the students of the Fifth Class who were
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering usually takes place in October, but was moved up
to Wednesday because of the NATO bombings, and perhaps because of
the visit by the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 people came, with banners and signs, to listen to
music, speeches and angry poetry, and they applauded a release of
doves.
</P>
<P>
   Three teen-agers with pierced ears and ice-blue gel in their
hair said the bombings had made them feel very patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible what NATO is doing to the people in Serbia,''
said Ivica Cvetkovic, 17. ``We never dreamed this could happen to
us. We want to have peace and now we're in a big catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We blame NATO and the Albanian terrorists,'' said his friend,
Javan Skrbic, also 17. When asked if the Serbian government bear
any responsibility, Ivica thought and said: ``Yes, but Serbia bears
a very small percentage of the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would do if he were drafted, Javan said: ``If
called to the army, of course, we will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Petrovic, 16, said: ``Even we girls will go there.'' Three
of her male friends had already been called up to the army, she
said. ``One was in the barracks in Prokuplje and it was bombed, but
he told his parents he's okay,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the schools and movie theaters closed because of the
bombing, life is boring now, they said. ``It's boring with a big
psychological pressure,'' Tanya said. ``Our parents don't let us
out, and they make us spend all night and sometimes the day in the
shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   She wore a silver dogtag on a chain around her neck. ``It used
to be popular, but now it's popular again,'' she said. ``It's a
kind of war fashion.''

 CENTRAL-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Division front-runners are patching holes after season-ending
injuries in spring
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The early focus of the National League Central will involve who's
in the trainer's room rather than who's on the field.
</P>
<P>
   No contending team in the division has a right to cry about
injuries; they all know the feeling. The Astros are without Moises
Alou, the Cubs must learn to face life after Kerry Wood, and Matt
Morris will miss the season in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cardinals can look forward to getting Alan Benes
back after the All-Star break. The aforementioned players likely
will miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Depth takes on an added significance, and the Astros enjoy a
luxury in that department. They have enough firepower to sustain
the loss of Alou and claim their third consecutive NL Central
title.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely they will repeat their 102-win season from a year
ago, but they probably won't need to.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs don't appear to be as good as they were in 1998, and
the Cardinals enter the season with the same problem they had last
year _ injured pitchers. Without Benes and Morris, they'll be
tempted to rush some of their best young prospects into the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa no doubt will pick up where they
left off last year when it comes to hitting home runs, but long
balls don't win divisions; pitching does.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates and Brewers will battle to stay out of the basement,
but keep an eye on the Reds. They figure to be the most improved
team in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds: They added Denny Neagle, Greg Vaughn and Mike
Cameron over the offseason, which filled three big needs. If Barry
Larkin stays healthy, this team could be the surprise of the
National League. Regardless, they are certainly headed in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the slide
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs: They won 90 games last season, and Sammy Sosa
provided a truckload of excitement. But losing Kerry Wood will take
some of the air out of this aging team. The guess here is that the
Cubs will take a step backward in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Overrated
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blauser, Cubs: His range at shortstop has been on the
decline for years, and the Cubs should have known better to expect
him to come near his impressive offensive numbers of 1997. He could
lose his starting job by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Osborne, Cardinals: He says, ``Everyone knows what I can
do if I'm healthy.'' But when is that? All he does is get your
hopes up for a letdown. It's not like we're talking about a 20-game
winner, even when he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Underrated
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, Astros: All he does is hit .300 and drive in 100
runs with 15-20 homers year after year. Nevertheless, he's the
subject of trade rumors every offseason, and a perennial snub on
the All-Star team. It's a good thing he's so resilient.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz, Brewers: Funny how no one ever talks about this
guy. In only his second full season in the majors, Burnitz hit 38
homers and drove in 125 runs. If he played in New York, Burnitz
would be a bona fide star.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew, Cardinals: OK, we all took our shots at him during
his contract holdout, but Drew is the real deal. He hit five home
runs in just 14 games last season and is the favorite to win the
NL's Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey, Astros: Say what you will about his defense or
his ability to handle pitchers, but this kid can flat-out hit.
Because he'll be splitting time with Tony Eusebio, we may not see
just how good Meluskey is in 1999. But given time, he will impress.
</P>
<P>
   Down and out
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gaetti, Cubs: Don't get too caught up in his strong finish
to the 1998 season. The 40-year-old Gaetti has seen his best days
on a baseball diamond. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa loves the
older players, and even he gave up on Gaetti.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Avery, Reds: Once an up-and-coming star with the Braves,
injuries have made Avery a different pitcher. Reds general manager
Jim Bowden likes to try to rejuvenate the careers of fallen stars,
but he may be hoping against hope in Avery's case. Watch him lose
his spot in the rotation to Dennis Reyes at some point.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, Brewers: It's no secret. Garner is in the last year
of his contract and, if he doesn't work miracles, his days in
Milwaukee are numbered. That's asking a lot, considering the
Brewers are a mess. Don't worry about Garner. If it doesn't work
out in Milwaukee, he'll have no trouble finding another job.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo, Astros: The Astros have been projecting stardom
for the 23-year-old Venezuelan, and this is his chance to show it.
Because Moises Alou is likely out for the season, Hidalgo will get
his first opportunity to be an everyday player. All eyes will be on
him.
</P>
<P>
   What if
</P>
<P>
   the Cubs had not rushed Kerry Wood back to the mound last
season? Perhaps that had something to do with the elbow injury that
has wiped out his 1999 season. We can only hope Wood will make a
full recovery. Baseball needs a presence like his to take the game
into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule
</P>
<P>
   It won't take long for the division's two top teams from a year
ago to square off. The Cubs visit the Astrodome Tuesday through
Thursday for the season-opening series. Mark May 28-30 on your
calendars; that's the first time sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa will be on the same diamond. It's a weekend series at Wrigley
Field. The Astros will help to shut down stadiums. They play
Milwaukee Sept. 24-26 in one of the last series at County Stadium,
and they host the Dodgers on Oct. 1-3 _ the last regular-season
baseball games at the Astrodome. &QL;

<P>
   SHFAYIM, Israel _ The roar of the crowd's shouting, ``Bibi go
home!'' was barely audible in the tightly guarded City Hall, where
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was whisked to speak to a
handpicked audience from this Israeli Arab town.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Sarah, who wore a dove-shaped brooch,
Netanyahu brushed off the demonstration, organized by members of a
leftist Arab party, and promised his listeners another peace treaty
by the millennium and swift action to bring equality to the 1
million Arab citizens in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My government and I are committed to equal opportunity and to
closing the gaps,'' Netanyahu said, listing statistics that show
increased aid to neglected Arab communities. ``A human being is a
human being, and a citizen is a citizen. For me, the children here
are no different than Jewish children, and they deserve exactly the
same future. The real record shows what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling for every vote they can obtain in a tight race,
Netanyahu and his opponents took their campaigns this week to Arab
villages and towns, paying holiday visits during the four-day
Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice. Arabs make up 12 percent of the
electorate, and their votes could be crucial in determining the
outcome of the balloting on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the election in 1996 that brought Netanyahu to power, Arabs
voted overwhelmingly for Shimon Peres of the Labor Party,
preferring his dovish views to the harder line of Netanyahu, who
received 5 percent of the Arab vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arabs are quite likely to vote again for the Labor
candidate, this time Ehud Barak, although significant numbers could
support Yitzhak Mordechai, leader of the new Center Party and the
third main contender. Others might back a newly declared Arab
candidate, Azmi Bishara.
</P>
<P>
   On the Arab campaign trail, Netanyahu, Barak and Mordechai all
make the same double-barreled promise of peace and equality. They
pledge to make peace with Israel's neighbors and to solve the
problems of the Arabs in Israel, who lag significantly behind Jews
in living standards, employment rates and quality of government
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barak portrays himself as the successor of assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, following his policies of peacemaking and
improving the Arabs' lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we look our Arab neighbors in the eye while we have
such deep inequality in this country?'' Barak asked on a visit to
Baqa al-Gharbiya. ``There can't be one town with red-brick plazas
and another that has no sewage in the same country. That's not
equality. We are going to bring peace and equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai promises to appoint an Arab minister to the Cabinet
and to draw up five-year plans to upgrade roads and sewage systems
in Arab communities. The Iraqi-born son of Kurdish Jewish
immigrants, Mordechai peppers his holiday greetings with Arabic
phrases, showing off his Middle Eastern roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that next year we can be in Damascus and wish the
Syrians a happy holiday,'' Mordechai said on a visit to Abu Ghosh,
where he pledged to work for peace with Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians. He drew loud applause when he declared, ``I promise
you that when I am elected prime minister there will be an Arab
minister in my government.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with his opponents, the hawkish Netanyahu has a tough
job of selling himself to Arab voters. The protesters who greeted
him here held up signs saying, ``Netanyahu is persona non grata in
Shfayim,'' and denouncing him as ``an enemy of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   His emissary to the Arab communities, Gideon Ezra, a former
deputy chief of the Shin Bet security agency, was mobbed by an
angry crowd and had to be hustled away by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Hall meeting, Mayor Ursan Yassin, a political ally
of Netanyahu, read a checklist of troubles that plague this town of
30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shfayim is a city in name only, but it's actually a big
village,'' Yassin said. ``There are no pool, no youth clubs, no
public parks, and only 50 percent of the sewage system is complete.
In the Bedouin neighborhood there are no roads, no infrastructure,
no play fields. It breaks my heart to see our young people with no
place to spend their time. There are no budgets, no resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu responded with his own list of government-financed
public works in Arab villages and towns, noting that the sums had
grown despite budget cuts. He promised $7 million to Shfayim by
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of additional aid is Netanyahu's most potent weapon
in his campaign to woo Arab voters. In similar fashion, the
Sephardic religious party, Shas, whose control of the Interior
Ministry gives it power over local budgets and building plans, is
appealing for support from Arabs in the vote for Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The power of an incumbent prime minister will win Netanyahu more
Arab votes than he received in the last election, Ezra predicted.
``People are tired of the empty promises of a sterile opposition,''
he added. ``They want to be partners in government.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Abu Ghosh, Thabet Abu Ghosh said he was tired of all the
candidates' promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing this now for 50 years, and I'm not
impressed,'' he said. ``Every four years they come around and
promise that if you vote for them they'll appoint you director of
some government office. After the elections you knock on their
door, and they don't even recognize you.''

 &HT;    Money magazines getting tech-oriented
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's getting hard to tell mainstream business
magazines from high-tech, computer publications these days.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (April), The Wall Street Journal's personal finance
magazine, is the latest example with a 1999 Internet guide that
looks at topics from stocks to computers to travel deals.
</P>
<P>
   Given the thousands of sites on the Web, this is a reader
service, with a selection of Web sites the editors regard as
useful, and organized with 25 sites in 10 categories.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Smart Money looks at the next round of high-tech
winners in the stock market: ASM Lithography (ticker symbol ASML),
Broadcom (BRCM), Lucent Technologies (LU), PMC-Sierra (PMCS), PRI
Automation (PRIA), RF Micro Devices (RFMD), Texas Instruments (TXN)
and Uniphase (UNPH).
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned stocks
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the high-tech trend, not all investors are
comfortable with stocks that have ``.com'' in their names.
Bloomberg Personal Finance (April) recommends stable, growth stocks
from the food, drug and beverage industries that offer predictable
profit growth and beat the market over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks hold up well during economic slumps and down
markets because they are the stocks of companies that make products
that are always needed by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Among stocks on Bloomberg's list are Abbott Laboratories (ABT),
ConAgra (CAG), Merck (MRK), Schering-Plough (SGP), Bestfoods (BFO),
H.J. Heinz (HNZ), Kellogg (K) and Pfizer (PFE).
</P>
<P>
   Rescuing a TV network
</P>
<P>
   The CBS television network almost became a property of media
mogul Ted Turner some years back. Turner went on to do well for
himself, but CBS continued to stumble, according to Business Week
(April 5).
</P>
<P>
   Now, CBS' new chief executive, Mel Karmazin, has set out to turn
the network around with a formula of glitzy special events aimed at
wooing a young audience, NFL football and old-fashioned
cost-cutting. He paid top dollar for events such as the Grammy
awards, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   _ Business to Business celebrates its second anniversary as an
Atlanta business magazine with a cover profile of ``warriors'' who
have made sports their business. Among them are Evander Holyfield
(featured on the cover), Billy Payne, Stan Kasten and Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Milken, best known as the 1980s junk bond king who was
jailed for securities fraud, resurfaced in the '90s in several
enterprises. Now, says U.S. News &AMP; World Report (April 5), he is
about to become an entrepreneur with a stock offering for an
educational company known as Knowledge Universe.

PROFITS OFF DESPITE CONSUMER PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only days after investors pushed the Dow Jones
industrial average over 10,000, the government reported Wednesday
that corporate profits fell last year for the first time since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said after-tax corporate profits slumped
by 2.2 percent in 1998, the first drop since just before the
recession of 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
   With investors paying record-high prices for stocks, the profit
squeeze adds new urgency to the question of whether today's high
stock prices are justified, or due for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   On average, stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index are
trading at 34 times earnings, compared to 21 times earnings just
before the market crash of 1987. ``We're not only at a record high,
but blowing away anything we've ever seen before,'' said Greg
Jones, chief economist at Briefing.com, an on-line market analysis
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The dim profits news was accompanied by a report that the US
economy ended 1998 with a burst of growth. People are buying plenty
of goods and services, though at prices that do not produce profits
for companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government said US gross domestic product surged in the
fourth quarter of 1998 at an annual rate of 6 percent, a revision
from an earlier estimate of 6.1 percent. For all of 1998, the US
economy grew by a robust 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said those reports, as well as concerns over the
bombing in Kosovo, were behind a 127-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average Wednesday. The index closed at 9786.16, down
1.29 percent. .
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said stocks will rise in 1999 as the world
recovers from the Asian financial crisis. But Roger Brinner, chief
economist at the Parthenon Group, a Boston consulting and
investment firm, said the stock market is overvalued by about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Key to his analysis is the fact that bond yields have been
rising, making them a more attractive investment that could lure
money from the stock market. Bonds might become even more
attractive after the latest profits report, he said, ``because
rising share prices can't be defended by rising earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the United States is living through
``a peculiar economy where people are investing in `dot.com' stocks
with no profits.'' There's been considerable debate over whether
fast-rising Internet stocks are too expensive compared to their
profits, or if the dizzying prices of Amazon.com and America Online
are well-justified because those companies are on track to become
the brand-name giants of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the market will be flat or down somewhat this year.
``We will still see some numbers over 10,000, but the valuations
are a problem. . . . They're too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits had jumped 7.5 percent in 1997, 7 percent in
1996, 22 percent in 1995 and 16 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They declined last year, analysts said, because the tight labor
market pushed up wages, which are the largest cost in producing
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, companies have not been able to pass that cost
on to consumers. The key reason is the Asian crisis and its ripples
throughout the world. That has cut the demand for all kinds of
goods, leaving the world with an oversupply of everything from
soybeans and steal to automobiles. When consumers can pick among
competing products, companies find it hard to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   In service industries, intense competition has also made it hard
for companies to raise prices. ``Just look at telecom. Sometimes I
wish the competition wasn't so stiff,'' said Cynthia Latta, chief
US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI in Lexington, Mass.,
referring to incessant telephone marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Latta said, ``the pricing power of companies is nil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But American workers are thoroughly enjoying it,'' Brinner
said. ``What's a profit problem for business is a real wage and
price bonanza for the worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's government reports also showed inflation to be well
in check. A price index tied to the gross domestic product rose
just 1 percent in 1998. There hasn't been a rate that low since
1959, when it was also 1 percent, and there hasn't been one lower
since 1950.

 &HT;    Delta strategies weak, board member says
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is still ``desperately seeking
strategy'' from its new management, according to a stinging
critique by the pilot union's nonvoting representative on the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Halsor, a captain who holds the special board post, said
Delta has achieved strong results in some areas but remains weak in
overall strategy, especially regarding international routes and
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``With new managers in about 90 percent of Delta's top
management positions, the time for laying out a plan for needed
change is now,'' Halsor wrote in the latest pilot union newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The article conveyed Halsor's personal opinion. But his board
position lends weight to his views, and his open dissent
underscores shaky union-management relations as contract talks loom
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the carrier ``disagrees with Mr.
Halsor's comments. The company's strategic agenda is producing
record financial results, strong improvements in customer service
and aggressive moves in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Halsor, who attends board meetings but has limited input, said
that Delta's global position is weak despite statistical power in
Europe and a Latin expansion. CEO Leo Mullin's management team
``must simply lay out a plan to be the No. 1 carrier, or be part of
a No. 1 network, in all major world markets,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Halsor said customer service gains are offset by other changes
that ``appear to be focused on the customer as a problem or an
irritant.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a failed effort to impose a surcharge on non-Internet
bookings, an aborted plan to charge for Crown Room drinks and the
removal of sandwiches from ``an already pathetic'' SkyDeli lunch on
certain flights.
</P>
<P>
   Halsor also said management is wasting time and money trying to
prevent further unionization at Delta, the least unionized large
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``New management tells us we have a clear advantage over those
chumps at Southwest, American, United and British Airways. But ...
these companies regularly beat us in the marketplace even though
they must 'accommodate' their highly unionized workforces.''
</P>
<P>
   Halsor even berated Delta's advertising. ``Even a parrot
plinking on a piano beats us every time,'' he wrote, referring to
United's Gershwin melody theme.
</P>
<P>
   He moderated his comments when reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do support our management team,'' Halsor said. ``Overall
they've done a good job. I do disagree with certain steps they've
taken and some they've inherited or continued.''

 &HT;    Quarter ends with dim outlook
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stock market investors put an historic first quarter
behind them on Wednesday with heavy across-the-board selling and
not especially bright expectations for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter saw the Dow Jones industrial average top and
then retreat from 10,000, the impeachment of a U.S. president, the
outbreak of limited war in the Balkans, the spread of global
recession to Brazil and a classic investment ``bubble'' involving
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the major stock market indexes rose during the three
months ended March 31, but the gains were significantly smaller
than a year ago, and one index _ the small-stock Russell 2000 _
continued to retreat in a two-tiered market.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, analysts blamed the Dow's decline on Philip
Morris, a Dow component, whose share price fell $2.56 1/4 to $35.18
3/4 after an Oregon jury ordered the cigarette maker to pay $81
million in settlement of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite was buoyed by a strong performance in
technology shares, although the index ended with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's drop below 9,800 just two days after closing above
10,000 for the first time was indicative of the market's extreme
volatility in recent years, analysts said. They see little reason
to expect a change.
</P>
<P>
   With bond yields expected to decline and short-term interest
rates stable, the biggest influence over stocks in the next month
will be the barrage of first quarter corporate earnings reports.
The near-term outlook is not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   I/B/E/S International, which tracks analysts estimates, said
S&AMP;P-500 earnings fell 1.8 percent in 1998, the first decline since
1991. And while many analysts look for a return to double-digit
earnings growth for 1999,
</P>
<P>
   I/B/E/S analysts said it will be more like 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the bullish side, however, analysts continue to cite the
economy's performance as an underpinning for further stock market
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market's resilience has been impressive despite two
negatives,'' said Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins,
citing the recent rise in Treasury yields ``and the uncertainty
associated with NATO involvement in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said the strength of the market's gains since the 1998
correction ended last October _ a 28 percent rise for the Dow and
75 percent for the Nasdaq composite _ makes the market vulnerable
to a routine correction of 7 percent from market highs.
</P>
<P>
   But a 7 percent drop from the Dow's closing high of 10,006.78 on
Monday would take the index back to about where it regularly traded
in early January.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern of analysts is the development of a two-tiered
market, where big blue chip stocks lead the rally while smaller
stocks lag behind.
</P>
<P>
   At Interstate/Johnson Lane, technical analyst Ricky T.
Harrington said the average U.S. stock is still trading 22 percent
below its April 1998 high.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the stock market was not greatly concerned with
events in the world beyond Wall Street during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment of President Clinton was basically a nonevent,
because most traders assumed he would not be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's move to let its currency slide was a momentary fright,
which improved when a combination of outside help and internal
political moves appeared to ease the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The start of bombing in Yugoslavia did not have a major impact
in the first quarter, although analysts say it is the kind of event
that has the potential to depress stocks if it becomes a source of
major uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   And economic fundamentals were favorable enough to prevent the
Federal Reserve from making any change in interest rates at its
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Alan Greenspan had nothing to say about the decision,
but most analysts said that means the Fed is satisfied with the
economy's relatively inflation-free expansion.

DISPARTITY BETWEEN HAVES, HAVE-NOTS ONLY GETTING BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The greatest shame of the 1994-95 baseball strike was
not the rupture of two seasons or the cancellation of a World
Series. Worse than that, over 232 days in which the game's problems
were open to correction, baseball accomplished nothing. A judge
sent the players back to work, and the Basic Agreement reached in
late 1996 has failed to solve much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was filled with so many glorious highs that it was
easy to believe baseball was healthy again. Then came the winter,
filled with so many can-you-top-this free agent signings. A host of
teams enter the season with no hope of truly competing _ not just
now, but ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make future labor standoffs seem more ominous
than the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they shy away from correcting the problems the next time
around because they think they can't endure another work stoppage,
they're crazy,'' said NBC's Bob Costas, a leading baseball expert.
``What the game can't endure is another (begin ital)stupid (end
ital) work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA actually learned everything from baseball: a) you've
got to stop the problem before it gets totally out of control, and
b) if you're going to provoke a fight like that, you've got to come
out of the alley with something tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If owners have to blow off the entire 2002 season, if that's
what it takes, that's what they should do _ but do it with a plan
and an intelligent program.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's collective bargaining agreement expires after the
2000 season, but the players' union is expected to exercise its
option to extend it through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But as baseball crosses into to the 21st century, several teams
are stranded in the breakdown lane while others zoom by. No team
with a payroll under $48 million made the playoffs last season,
further evidence that in the post-strike era, you almost always get
what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that some teams can pay more than
others. High-end teams have operating revenues in the $175 million
range, five times the resources of some low-end clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap's going to get larger and larger and larger,'' said
Ken Towers, San Diego Padres general manager. ``From a business
standpoint, I think a lot of us have probably peaked. We're going
to have to keep payroll somewhere in the $50-60 million range.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue sharing is a possible solution, and commisioner Bud
Selig expects the top six teams to transfer $140 million to the
bottom six teams this season. But the problem with revenue sharing
has been the way funds are used: seeing no point in boosting a
payroll that can't grow big enough to produce a winner, some teams
use the money to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners chairman John Ellis, a member of baseball's Executive
Council, wants large-revenue teams to share proportionately with
teams in the middle, where Seattle now resides. But any large-scale
change in baseball's economics, he said, can't come from owners
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we need to create a partnership with the players
where we say, OK, guys, we divide up our revenues with you, all
revenues from baseball. You take X percent, and we'll take Y
percent, and now you figure out how you want to divide it up,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like salary caps _ it could be that, it could be
some other system.''
</P>
<P>
   But for players to agree to substantial changes in the game's
economic system, they first have to believe there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a lack of competitive balance yet, to
be honest,'' said Mariners catcher Dan Wilson, the team's player
representative. ``Just because the Yankees won it last year, I
mean, there's been a lot of teams that have done very well that
weren't up there like the Yankees and Braves. I don't think there's
enough evidence of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former union head Marvin Miller, whose efforts led to the end of
the reserve clause and the creation of free agency for players in
the 1970s, also has doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale revenue sharing is the obvious answer in an industry
where revenues are ample but the problem is simply distribution,''
Miller said. ``... The owners always give the poor man's talk. They
kind of exaggerate problems like this when it's to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were concerned about all the problems caused by a
disparity, self-interest would tell them they'd better do something
about this, have more revenue-sharing and stop complaining. Because
sooner or later, if the disparity is a real problem, the haves will
be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said the ``haves'' already are affected. Some have
suggested simply folding teams that can't make it, a notion the
commissioner rejects. If a team fails in any market, he said, it
benefits no one.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine the players union ever agreeing to
let teams fold, since doing so would eliminate jobs. Likewise, the
union would be skeptical of any form of salary cap. Even a salary
floor, which could help avoid the annual payroll purge of several
teams, might may not be popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any owner in this game should have players
telling them what they should spend or not spend,'' said agent
Scott Boras. ``I know from labor-management relations, we don't
want to put any restrictions on them (or have) them put
restrictions on players. That reduces the free flow of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at salary restrictions, the NFL is now giving us
a very interesting model: when you put caps on something, you take
away something that's very, very much a part of our game _
intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners president Chuck Armstrong takes the opposite view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry truly was competitive and truly had a level
playing field, then it's up to how smart you are, and that's what's
going to make it fun,'' Armstrong said. ``Because then you can
truly compete. The best model is the NFL. I mean, how can a team
exist in Green Bay, Wis.?''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal Towers favors is reducing free agent service time
from six years to four and eliminating salary arbitration. The idea
has been floated before, but it could make more sense than ever.
With the Yankees' Derek Jeter winning $5 million in arbitration
this winter after only three years' service time, it is becoming
harder for teams to lock up similar young stars through their
arbitration years.
</P>
<P>
   Some say these issues are really nothing new. Teams like the
Yankees always had greater resources than teams like the old St.
Louis Browns, Miller said, but the difference never showed up in
payroll because owners still held the reserve clause.
</P>
<P>
   Now that players have more freedom, he said, it's not up to them
to correct owners' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players can't say, `I'm going to strike if you don't do this
or that to help yourselves,''' Miller said. ``Despite all the
propoganda, there is a bigger percentage of clubs in contention now
than in the so-called good old days before free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The good old days. Baseball has more of them than any other
sport. As the game moves forward and gets its financial house in
order, Costas said, it also must celebrate its past. The only
unqualified success in the '90s, he points out, has been the
building of new ballparks with old-time charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to out-hip or out-Gen-X basketball, or match the
violence and testosterone-fueled rage of football, if you try to
play that type of game, you lose,'' Costas said. ``You can't crank
up the volume on baseball to that extent. They should be
unapologetically retro as their guide to the future. That doesn't
mean you can't use modern marketing techniques, but the essential
experience should be timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said he hopes to refine recent changes in the game, such
as interleague play, which still is limited to West vs. West, etc.,
and ``modest'' realignment, which he said is needed to fix
scheduling problems. Selig also wants to expand baseball's
international presence. He knows the time to act is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope these years will provide is the ability to take
this wonderful game and set up enough conditions so its competitive
nature is increased, its popularity is increased, we do go
international, do all the things that we're trying to do now,''
Selig said. ``What we do in the next four or five years hopefully
will ensure baseball's great popularity the first 20-30-40 years of
the 21st century.''

   Bagwell, Biggio, Caminiti: Astros throwbacks
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, baseball is a game that almost forces us to
look to the past with a sense of romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   We genuinely believe the players of yesteryear played harder and
with more passion and zeal than today's major leaguers. We believe
they would have done so whether it made them wealthy or whether it
paid them like peanut vendors. We believe they would have done so
regardless of the fame or the status that comes with being among
the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   We long for that type of player; we search for any semblance
among today's stars and, if we're fortunate enough to find one, we
call him a throwback _ as in a throwback to the good old days, when
the game was played the way it was meant to be played.
</P>
<P>
   If such a player exists today, he plays for the Astros and he
answers to the name Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio or Ken Caminiti. All
three are throwbacks in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Biggio covered in dirt from head to toe, there can
be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Bagwell hustling down the first-base line on an
obvious ground-ball out with the enthusiasm of a Little Leaguer,
there can be no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   When you see Caminiti willing himself onto the field with
injuries that would disable less courageous players, there can be
no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   They all are, and it's that type of will and desire that ranks
each among the best players to wear an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   From the days of the shooting-star logo to the wild colors of
the rainbow jerseys, if you're looking for Houston players who
elicit memories of baseball's glory years, look no farther than the
three stars the Astros are counting on to lead them to a third
consecutive National League Central Division title and the
franchise's first World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three guys play the game as well as it can possibly be
played from the standpoint of effort, determination and so on,''
Astros president Tal Smith said. ``I don't necessarily subscribe to
the fact the game was played so much better years ago, from a
standpoint of intensity, as it is today. We always _ from a
standpoint of nostalgia _ think it was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've followed baseball since the 1940s, so I can recall it
vividly. There are players today _ certainly (Bagwell, Biggio and
Caminiti) _ who are the epitome of anything anyone could ask for in
a ballplayer. Twenty years from now, I suspect people will be
referring to players as throwbacks to the way Cammy, Craig and
Baggy played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti broke into the big leagues in 1987; Biggio made his
debut the following year. They were fortunate enough to play with
veterans such as Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, Buddy Bell, Terry Puhl,
Craig Reynolds, Bill Doran and Alan Ashby, who taught them how to
play the game ``the right way,'' as Biggio often says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 22-year-old kid at the time,'' Biggio said. ``I
thought I knew everything when I actually knew nothing. I learned a
lot just by sitting, watching and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell wasn't so fortunate. When he arrived on the scene in
1991, the Astros were in the midst of rebuilding, and there were no
seasoned veterans to set an example for younger players _ only
Biggio and Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   What they may have lacked in baseball savvy, they made up for
with the effort that is their calling card to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way that I know how to play the game, and
that's to go all out,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't try to do it that
way; that's just the way it is. That's the way you should go out
there every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti first shared a big-league diamond
during the spring of 1991. Things were different then; Biggio was a
catcher, and Bagwell had come to camp to unseat Caminiti as the
Astros' third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, an Astros coach at the time, solved
that problem by suggesting Bagwell be shifted to first base. The
rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me all spring to make my conversion from catcher to
second base,'' Biggio recalled. ``But that spring, Baggy learned
how to play first base in two weeks because that's all the time he
had after they decided he was going to play first base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost 97 games in 1991, but it was obvious they could
build around their three stars-in-the-making, who were becoming the
best of friends. They were clueless as to the heights their careers
would reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rookie, and they were only in their third year or
so,'' Bagwell said. ``I didn't even know if I belonged in the big
leagues. Who could have known at that time what kind of players we
would become?''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, they made the All-Star team together and
Bagwell won the National League's Most Valuable Player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the year we knew that we had kind of arrived,''
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, one of the triplets was about to exit. After the
1994 season, the Astros' foundation was cracked by the rapidly
changing economics of baseball. With Biggio, Caminiti and Steve
Finley approaching free agency, the Astros were at a financial
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't agree on a new contract with Caminiti, so they
traded him and Finley to San Diego in a blockbuster deal that
brought current starters Derek Bell and Ricky Gutierrez to town.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the Astros' building blocks had been reduced
from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' Bagwell said. ``But we knew there was
a chance our team would be broken up if we didn't win in 1994. I
guess we just didn't know it would happen the way it did. We all
hated to see Cammy go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knew they were trading away a good player when they
dealt Caminiti to San Diego; Bagwell and Biggio believed their
sidekick was on the verge of a career breakthrough. But it's
doubtful anyone predicted the extent of Caminiti's breakout.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 30 home runs and 99 RBIs in four seasons with the
Padres _ his bests with the Astros were 18 and 80, respectively _
and won an NL MVP trophy of his own in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was capable of that, but he needed to prove to
himself that he was that type of player,'' Bagwell said. ``Cammy is
very emotional, and I would even say that he's insecure at times.
After that year, he believed in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti played two more seasons for the Padres before they
decided not to re-invest in the 35-year-old switch hitter. Now that
the choice was all his, there was no doubt where Caminiti wanted to
play. He turned down significantly more money from Detroit ($21.5
million over three years) to sign a two-year, $9.5 million deal
with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with this organization,'' Caminiti said. ``This is
where my family calls home, and this is where my two best friends
are. I was going to do everything I could to get back to the
Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since that spring day when the three
first took the field together. They have reached levels of success
others always knew possible, but Bagwell, Biggio and Caminiti never
gave it much thought. They were too busy enjoying the game and
playing it the only way they know how.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, hopefully we'll all be able to
sit back and say we had a positive impact on the game,'' Biggio
said. ``But for now, we just respect the fact that we're able to go
out and play the game every day, because the fact is, this is
really what we all love doing. We've gotten a little older, but
that part hasn't changed from the beginning. We still just love to
play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt. &QL;

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES $97 BILLION SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ House budget writers Wednesday approved a $97
billion spending plan for the next two years that maintains or
enhances current services while putting $4.3 billion in new
revenues into public schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, a 9.6 percent increase over the current budget, would
spend $5.5 million every hour to operate Texas government with a
combination of state and federal funds. It requires no new taxes;
accommodates at least $500 million in tax breaks and leaves $200
million unspent to keep the state's checkbook balanced, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased education funding includes $3 billion earmarked to
enhance public-school teachers' salaries and benefits, and provide
some property tax relief. How that sum will be divided among those
purposes will be decided later.
</P>
<P>
   With House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center, looking on, House
Bill 1 was approved unanimously by the House Appropriations
Committee, which began its line-by-line review of state agency
funding requests in February. The mammoth bill, which complies with
constitutional spending caps, is scheduled for a vote in the full
House on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   The sum, which is for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, includes $59.2
billion in state funds; $27.4 billion in federal funds; $1.8
billion from the settlement with tobacco companies; and $8.5
billion from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best it's gone. This is the best product we've
ever had,'' said a jubilant Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell,
D-San Angelo, who handed out Easter baskets to committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a bit of it is that we did have a little bit of money to
spend,'' he said, referring to a projected 1998-99 budget surplus
of at least $2.5 billion that makes the extra education funding
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good, tight bill,'' added Rep. Talmadge Heflin,
R-Houston. ``We're doing what we need to do in state government.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of $43 billion will go to education _ $30 billion for
public schools and $13 billion for universities. The outlay for
public schools represents a 13.4 percent increase from 1998-99,
while university spending would increase 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, lawmakers applied 63 percent of new revenue to
education; this time, they're applying 69 percent, said Rep. Henry
Cuellar, D-Laredo, who oversaw that part of the House budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go home and say that the commitment from the
Legislature is going to be in public and higher education,''
Cuellar told colleagues before they scattered for the holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in several budget cycles, no big-ticket
prison construction was authorized, though $41 million was set
aside for repairs. Additionally, $13 million was included to
continue the Harris County boot camp, with the understanding that
the county would share expenses in 2002, said Rep. Sylvester
Turner, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dealt with some tough issues, but one thing that we can
say is ... the process was fair,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity works,'' added Rep. Paul Moreno, D-El Paso, who
praised Laney for appointing a spectrum of Texans to the 27-member
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Laney said the committee's attention to detail would make it
unlikely that other members would be able to attach pet projects on
the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of you realize how much time you save the
members, because I've been here when we wrote the appropriations
bill on the House floor,'' Laney said. ``You've done a tremendous
job.''
</P>

Mariners first to go back outside to play, leaving gloomy Kingdome
for new park
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
In the 1970s, multipurpose domed stadiums were the rage. Houston's
Astrodome, the so-called Eighth Wonder of the World, had its
imitators: the Superdome in New Orleans, the Metrodome of
Minneapolis and the 59,166-seat Kingdome of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome, which opened in 1976, may be more blunder than
wonder. Sparky Anderson, former manager of the Detroit Tigers,
said: ``I walk in there and I'm not sure what I'm in. It's just a
big ball of cement. No color. It seems like a big factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some hitters will miss it when it closes in July, to be
succeeded by Safeco Field. Braves coach Don Baylor said of the
Kingdome: ``When you walk to the plate, you're in scoring
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's bias for hitting is a mystery. It's darker than
the Astrodome, and it has a 23-foot-high barrier in right field
that's nicknamed Walla Walla.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons no physicist has revealed, a baseball travels
better in the Kingdome than in the Astrodome. Sometimes it carries
into speaker boxes attached to the Kingdome roof. Dave Kingman once
launched a would-be 500-foot home run that bounced off a speaker
and was caught in deep left field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, a similar missile from Willie Horton struck a speaker
and dropped for a single. That same year, a pop fly by Ruppert
Jones lodged in a speaker in foul territory. That feat was
duplicated four years later by Milwaukee's Ricky Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The weird ricochets are an embarrassing trademark of the
Kingdome. But the building's main drawback is that the roof can't
be drawn back on days when Seattle's fickle weather favors outdoor
activity.
</P>
<P>
   When attendance lagged in the 1980s and early '90s, demand arose
for a retractable roof to keep the Mariners from drifting away as
the Seattle Pilots had done nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome became the place not to be. One Mariners fan,
Joshua Normand, recalled sardonically, ``What I liked most about it
is that you could buy a ticket at 6:45 and sit anywhere you want.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the canyon-like emptiness, echoes reverberated; the
public address system could be difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the Kingdome suffered its worst crisis: Ceiling tiles
broke loose the afternoon before a game, crashing into seats.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing the damage forced the Mariners on a 22-day, 20-game
road trip in midsummer. The acoustics were improved, but at a
tragic cost _ two workers were killed during the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome's best days came in 1995 when the Mariners advanced
to the American League Championship Series. Fans responded, jamming
the concrete bubble to create a deafening roar.
</P>
<P>
   There were doubts the enthusiasm would last, but in 1996 the
Washington state legislature authorized $320 million for a
baseball-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Following approval of the new ballpark, fans continued flocking
to the old one. The Mariners ranked third in AL attendance in 1997,
with 3.19 million. Even with a losing team, they drew 2.6 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Kingdome is not as drab as its reputation promises.
No stadium with Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez in it can fairly
be called boring. The scoreboard is technologically advanced, and
the concession stands offer Starbucks coffee and well-crafted beers
from local microbreweries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many sports arenas, the Kingdome has an attractive
location, near the entertainment center of Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field, which will seat 46,600, is farther from downtown,
in the aesthetically challenged Duwamish Industrial District. But
it will bring back real grass and sky. And it may have enough
luxury suites to bring sky-high revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kingdome, it will be demolished next year to make
room for a new football field for the Seattle Seahawks. Such is the
fate of multipurpose stadiums as the new millennium approaches. &QL;

MESA HOPES TO CHANGE MARINERS' DISMAL BULLPEN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As Jose Mesa trots in from the bullpen, reaches for
the ball from manager Lou Piniella and attempts to restore his
once-invincible reputation, a piece of advice for Senor Smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Head for the nearest exit.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners bring in a closer, that's usually where the
fans go, cursing another unwanted giveaway night.
</P>
<P>
   For some unknown reason, stoppers come to Seattle to die. Or get
lit up. No position has been so unreliable for the Mariners. So
agonizing. So Bobby Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I can change that,'' Mesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Brave man.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander from the Dominican Republic not only is being
asked to register baseball's three most difficult outs, but also
wipe away two decades of game-ending ineptitude. Talk about going
extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Every big-league team except recent expansionists Florida and
Tampa Bay had more saves than the Mariners (31) last year.
</P>
<P>
   Every team except 1990s expansionists Tampa Bay, Colorado and
Arizona has an individual save record better than Seattle (33).
</P>
<P>
   In 11 seasons that blown saves have been tracked, the Mariners
have rung up 20 or more on seven occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams have 13 to 17 a year,'' said Adam Loss, Rolaids
Relief Man researcher, which oversees those stats. ``Over 20 is
pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year the franchise was saved with a playoff run,
the Mariners still blew 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, with another team headed for the postseason, they
blew 27.
</P>
<P>
   The big-league record is 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. said. ``I'm not a closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should be. Everybody else has.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine different pitchers have registered Mariner saves,
which is part of the problem. The alumni list includes Randy
Johnson, Mike Hampton, Brian Holman, Dave Burba, Chris Bosio, Mike
Moore, Mike Morgan, Jim Beattie and Matt Young. Starters normally.
</P>
<P>
   The club relied on Bill Wilkinson in 1987. Nothing against the
lefty, but he was 22 and a rookie. Six years later, the club gave
the ball to Ted Power for half a season, after Norm Charlton was
injured. Power was 38, in his last year of baseball. The Mariners'
original closer was Enrique Romo, a Mexican League refugee. He
apparently wasn't too busy to start the second game in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from being around the league, it's always been a bullpen
by committee in Seattle,'' said Billy Swift, who closed for the
1991 Mariners. ``I hate to say that. But you need one guy doing it
day in and day out. It hasn't been like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 22 seasons, the Mariners have had just two high-quality
closers _ guys who stuck around for more than one season and were
ranked among the league leaders. Bill Caudill and Mike Schooler.
Between them, they were responsible for 150 of the first 401
Mariner saves.
</P>
<P>
   The club eventually traded Caudill to the Oakland A's to avoid
paying him a huge salary. Schooler blew a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Caudill, who saved 52 games for Seattle in 1982 and '83, lives
on the Eastside and coaches baseball on Mercer Island. Now 42, he
has watched recent Mariner closers with bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see pitchers trying to be too careful rather than too
aggressive on the mound, and it's not one person,'' he said. ``What
I see coming out of the bullpen more and more is people trying to
nitpick.''
</P>
<P>
   When the man known as ``the Inspector'' played, the Mariners had
a closer and seemingly nothing else. Lately, the opposite has been
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been interesting to me that they haven't gone out and
tried to sign someone to solidify that position,'' he said.
``They're running the organization and know better than I do, but
it's always difficult to get to the last game of the World Series
and win it without an effective closer.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Mariner response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Go around baseball and you will find more clubs have turnover
in the closer role than any other position,'' said Woody Woodward,
M's vice president of baseball operations. ``Guys like Dennis
Eckersley are exceptions to that rule.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past five seasons, the Mariners kept coming back
to Ayala, possibly the club's least popular player ever. He was
booed at the Kingdome. He was booed at spring training. He was
probably booed whenever he went to the grocery store. Failure
ostracized him.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala had a nasty split-finger fastball, but an even nastier
habit of leaving the door open. He blew 30 Mariner games, more than
enough to obscure the 56 saves he collected.
</P>
<P>
   The second coming of Charlton couldn't fix things. Nor did
trades for Mike Timlin and Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Mesa's turn to operate out of this little shop of
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to the Mariners with a high pedigree, yet baggage. For
Cleveland, he registered 46 saves in 1995, 39 in '96 and 16 after a
late start in '97. Then he blew the seventh game of the World
Series, against Florida, was traded to San Francisco and hasn't
closed since. It's been 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it happens, it's a tough job,'' he said. ``They put
you in for a couple years, you fail a little bit and they find
another guy. I think it was unfair. That really makes me mad, but I
keep pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Mesa not be up to the task, the Mariners can turn to
another Jose, Paniagua, who became a closer merely by chance late
last season and registered one save. Or newly acquired Mark Leiter,
who last year led Philadelphia with 23 saves but also topped the
National League with 12 blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   If desperate enough, the Mariners could even turn to another
offseason addition, Butch Henry. He saved seven games for Boston in
1997, after Slocumb was traded by the Red Sox to Seattle. He
enjoyed himself, as long as he knew the assignment was temporary.
He has a clause in his contract that he can ask for his release if
he is not a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a rush, or you're an adrenaline junkie, that's
what you shoot for,'' the lefty said. ``You could get hooked on it.
But I don't have the stuff to be a closer.''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff is usually a mid-90s fastball, an attitude, a Fu
Manchu mustache, a cheek bulging with chew, a stiff-legged walk and
a rigid routine.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, recently retired, would never speak or be spoken to
when he reached the bullpen in the seventh inning. Lee Smith, also
out of baseball now, used to sleep in the clubhouse for the first
five innings. They got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come into the dugout yawning,'' said Mariner starter
Jamie Moyer, who teamed with Smith in Boston and Chicago. ``That
was his way of doing it. Nobody ever confronted him as far as his
habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Closers are like football placekickers. They can have more
influence on the outcome of games than any other individual on the
field, but usually turn up in their jobs by accident or default.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are doing something about this. Last summer, they
drafted a closer from the college ranks with their top pick. Matt
Thornton of Grand Valley (Mich.) State is being groomed as the
Seattle stopper of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly a basketball player, Thornton threw just 21 innings as a
collegian. No matter, say the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I have the body and mindset for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Thornton wasn't a history major.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, it was the jobless recovery. Now it has
become the profitless boom.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy raced out of 1998's fourth quarter running at
a 6 percent annual rate, after-tax corporate profits fell 1 percent
from the previous quarter, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday. For the year as a whole, profits slipped 2.2 percent _
the first year in which profits have fallen in the 1990s _ despite
economic growth of nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That contradiction between zooming sales and sagging profits
inevitably raises questions about the future of stock prices and
may even point to weaknesses in the eight-year-old economic
expansion itself. At the very least, it helps explain why recent
gains in share prices have been concentrated in a relatively small
number of high-profile stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And it makes many analysts wonder how strongly corporations will
keep on investing and hiring. ``Stagnating profits are a sign of a
very mature expansion,'' said Robert Di Clemente, an economist at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Most American corporations, of course, are still making a
bundle. And profit margins _ while no longer as wide as they were a
year or two ago and not quite what they were in the golden era of
the 1960s _ are still a lot fatter than they were during most of
the long, strong 1980s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the profit picture has changed dramatically from
that in 1996 and 1997, when overall earnings were expanding 10
percent or more each year. Moreover, given that profits usually do
best not just when the economy is strong but when it is actually
accelerating, few economists think the outlook for future earnings
growth is glittering.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit behind the profit squeeze is not primarily rising
costs. If anything, corporations have reaped hefty savings from
last year's low interest rates and rock-bottom energy and commodity
prices. And last year's decent wage increases were mostly offset by
significant increases in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble, from the companies' point of view, is that
most of them are finding that, most of the time, they cannot raise
prices without losing so many customers that the attempted price
increases are self-defeating. ``Pricing power is almost
nonexistent,'' John Williams, chief economist at Bankers Trust,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many corporations are having trouble just holding the
line. The average prices charged by nonfinancial corporations _ 80
percent of the economy _ actually fell last year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that competition is as ferocious as it has ever
been in the careers of today's corporate chieftains. A long capital
spending boom has left American manufacturers with lots of spare
capacity. And that could even get worse. The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that factory orders were down 2.5 percent in
February, the biggest monthly drop in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, where huge swaths of the world are mired in recession
or at best growing far more slowly than the United States, there
are even more plants and equipment standing idle. Those that are
still operating have been slashing prices simply to generate cash
and keep their factories running. Overall, said Stan Shipley, a
senior economist at Merrill Lynch, ``prices are falling faster than
costs are rising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What makes life uncomfortable for company managers and
nerve-racking for investors is, as Adam Smith was the first to
point out, a boon for consumers. Gail Fosler, chief economist at
the Conference Board, a business research outfit in New York, said,
``Competition is as fierce as we always hoped it would be and in
that kind of environment, productivity gains tend to get passed on
as savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The forces that pressed down on profits last year had disparate
effects across industries. For some businesses, including
telecommunications, health care, much of high technology and
anything related to housing, 1998 was a banner year. For others,
like cars, entertainment, travel and financial services, it was a
mixed bag. And for energy producers, makers of basic industrial
materials like steel, chemicals and paper and energy utilities
bracing for the cold new world of deregulation, it was a year best
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists _ unlike many equity strategists _ do not see a
big rebound in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some things will change for the better, to be sure. For
starters, the big hits to profits in 1998 _ the General Motors
strike and the meltdown in emerging markets that took bites out of
auto and bank profits _ were special events. And the hundreds of
corporate revampings announced in recent months should begin to pay
off in terms of cost savings in coming ones.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces that have held earnings down will not
dissipate. Despite flickers of recovery in Japan, there is little
sign of renewed growth in Asia. Europe, where things were looking a
bit firmer just a couple of months ago, now seems to be softening
again.
</P>
<P>
   Costs, while not as critical up to now, are apt to creep higher,
too. Oil prices have already rebounded sharply. That may stop the
bleeding in the oil patch, but it will eventually exact a toll on
airlines, utilities and other big energy users. (According to one
estimate, $18-a-barrel oil would shave nearly 3 percentage points
off economy-wide profits; oil is now selling for $17 a barrel, up
from an average of $14 last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the labor market, which looks to stay tight, will
inevitably put continued pressure on wages.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to interest costs is a trickier question. If
the rest of the world remains stagnant, foreigners will keep
sending their money to the United States, inflation will remain low
and rates could stay down. On the other hand, weak profits combined
with determination to keep investing in new capital _ either to cut
costs or on the basis of optimism about future profit opportunities
_ has already led to a ballooning of corporate borrowing, which
only adds to pressures lifting long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``except in industries where supply is truly limited
like airlines, raising prices is no longer a feasible strategy for
raising profits,'' said David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard
&AMP; Poor's. ``You have to earn them the old-fashioned way.''

ADVERSITY FUELS WORLD SERIES CHAMPS ON HEELS OF RECORD YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just what the rest of major league baseball needed, a
newly-motivated New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As if it wasn't burden enough to try to back up a
record-breaking 125-win 1998 season. As if there wasn't desire
enough to go for a third World Series championship since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yankees can prove themselves a team able to overcome
great adversity _ if you can truly call adversity an organization
with an $87 million payroll that boasts last year's batting champ,
Bernie Williams, and just acquired baseball's only five-time Cy
Young Award winner, Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   From high profile trades to serious health problems, this New
York club has endured enough distraction and hardship during the
past two months to make its players wonder at times if they have
become the damned Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And yet New York remains the odds-on favorite to win another
World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   The best team in baseball has gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to live up to our reputation as a professional
team,'' said starting pitcher David Cone. ``And good teams get
through bad times.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training began last month with a blockbuster trade that
sent left-handed starter David Wells, lefty reliever Graeme Lloyd
and promising second baseman Homer Bush to the Toronto Blue Jays
for Clemens, who despite all his great personal triumph, has never
won a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily this kind of a deal alone would have dominated
headlines and spurred enough side stories to fuel a month of
papers. But a week into spring training Yankee great Joe DiMaggio
died and a crazy turn of Yankee fortune has followed:
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Darryl Strawberry returned to play March 10 for the first
time since undergoing colon cancer surgery last October and was
hobbled by, of all things, a sore knee. On the same day fans
welcomed Strawberry to the lineup again, Yankees manager Joe Torre
told the team he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's cancer is contained and doctors expect him to return to
his managerial post in 10 weeks. Strawberry, the Yanks' big-bat and
preferred left fielder, will start the year in Class AAA Columbus,
Ohio after finishing chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two weeks after Torre's announcement, Yankees minor league
catcher Jaime Torres was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don Zimmer, who will manage the club in Torre's absence, was
examined by doctors for a bleeding ulcer on March 24, less than two
weeks into his new position.
</P>
<P>
   -- Andy Pettitte, now the only left-hander in the starting
rotation, strained a muscle in his throwing elbow early in spring
and will start the season on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   -- Of course it wouldn't be a Yankees spring training without
controversy. Yankees boss George Steinbrenner and former player
Reggie Jackson made up this week after a short-lived feud.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time preseason was coming to an end, New York
newspapers had relegated themselves to full-length feature articles
about pitcher Hideki Irabu failing to cover first base in the
fourth inning of an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   A normal team might be distracted or overwhelmed by such an
eventful spring. But these are the New York Yankees. And they
remain every baseball pundit's pick to repeat as world champions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no weak link in a familiar lineup that is as deep as it
is talented. It's so stacked, World Series MVP third baseman Scott
Brosius will bat at the bottom of the order.
</P>
<P>
   It's a card that features Williams, shortstop Derek Jeter and
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who each scored more than 100 runs
in '98. Jeter and Knoblauch stole 30 and 31 bases, respectively.
First baseman Tino Martinez and right fielder Paul O'Neill each had
more than 100 RBIs. Martinez drove in a team-best 123 runs and hit
a team-high 28 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   With Clemens on board, baseball's most daunting pitching staff
has actually managed to improve. Clemens, last year's American
League Cy Young winner; Cone, a 20-game winner in '98; Cuban
sensation Orlando `El Duque' Hernandez; Irabu and Pettitte are
expected to anchor the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mariano Rivera had 36 saves, a 3-0 record and a 1.91 ERA
in 54 appearances last year and relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike
Stanton will again provide solid bullpen support. Ramiro Mendoza
was 10-2 with a 3.25 ERA as a spot starter and has also been
effective in relief. He could move into a starting role early this
season should Irabu continue his spring struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can look to your right and see the same guy and look
to the left and see the same guy you saw last year and do that at
every position, it's outstanding,'' said Knoblauch, a former AL
Rookie of the Year acquired by the Yankees just before last season.
It just adds to the uniqueness of this team and this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of inflated egos, the Yankees' pitching ace and team
leader, Cone, actually welcomed the Clemens deal _ even at the
expense of his No. 1 spot in the rotation. The team's young, flashy
All-Star shortstop, Jeter, sports a pair of World Series rings, but
he still refuses to address his manager as anything other than Mr.
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we have the same resolve on a day-to-day basis that
we had last year and not get caught up in our celebrity of last
year,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get to the World Series; it is a need. I don't
think it's a need just because we won 125 games last year. We need
to get to the World Series because of who we are.''

 &HT;    Yahoo! expected to acquire Broadcast.com
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo!, the Internet's No. 1 portal service, is
expected to announce plans today to buy Broadcast.com, a
Dallas-based provider of multimedia video and audio sports, news
and music events, for about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation for some time a deal was pending. The
acquisition would further expand Yahoo!'s considerable range of
goods and services, which now include free e-mail, news and stock
information, magazines, and even credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Yahoo! and other major Internet
companies are trying to make their Web sites more attractive by
adding products such as live audio and video. The idea is to lure
users and keep existing users sticking around their sites longer.
</P>
<P>
   The length of a visit is one way Web measurement firms determine
a site's popularity. Web companies can then sell more advertising
at higher prices and rent spots on their sites to sell goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com's technology could be used to attract more users
and small businesses to Yahoo! using streaming media, or combined
audio and video broadcasts on the Internet. The acquisition of a
company like Broadcast.com, which specializes in audio, video and
live Webcasts, could also signal Yahoo's desire to acquire content
for the world of high-speed broadband access. In today's dial-up
Web environment, Broadcast.com's offerings are difficult to view
even on high-speed T1 workplace connections. However, as users move
to faster cable modems and high-speed telephone connections such as
DSL, the experience will become better.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com stock has surged about 40 percent since Business
Week reported Yahoo! might be interested in buying the provider of
live event Webcasts. The Wall Street Journal followed with a story
that Yahoo! would buy Broadcast.com for $110 to $120 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! will reportedly pay about $130 a share for each share of
Broadcast.com. Calls to Yahoo! and Broadcast.com weren't
immediately returned, though both companies declined to comment
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! shares fell $3.93 3/4 to $168.37 1/2 on Wednesday and
Broadcast.com rose $4.81 1/4 to $118.18 3/4. Trading of both stocks
was later halted. Bloomberg News contributed to this article.

`MATISSE AND PICASSO' ENCHANTS DESPITE ITS FLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Yve-Alain Bois received his doctorate years
ago. But ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry,'' his most recent
curatorial project, still manages to read like a thesis exhibition
_ one predominantly brilliant but boneheaded in spots.
</P>
<P>
   You have until May 2 to see ``Matisse and Picasso,'' which
opened Jan. 31 at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, its
exclusive venue. It features more than 100 paintings, sculptures
and works on paper _ slightly more by Picasso than by Matisse _ and
is the first major museum exhibition devoted to the artistic
``chess match,'' as Bois calls it, between the two giants of
20th-century modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Bois' first stroke of brilliance: that he
thought to translate this well-known interaction into a show.
Surely it has been obvious over the years: If nothing else,
Francoise Gilot's 1990 book ``Matisse and Picasso: A Friendship in
Art'' spells out the mutual influence. Yet it took Bois to pursue
the obvious and the Kimbell to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, is Bois' greatest blunder: his failure to
translate the obvious into a coherent visual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry'' features stellar works
by both artists and is an overwhelming pleasure to view. But it's
organized as a linear chronology that generally doesn't allow for
side-by-side comparison of key works. And that makes it difficult,
although not impossible, to learn by looking.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Bois' bottom-line idea is so strong that it knits
the show together in spite of the way it's installed. The
interaction he addresses is so real, so profound and so
encompassing that it allows us to form our own ideas about what's
going on between artworks. And we can always simply savor the
individual works, most of which are truly magical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bois might have helped viewers out by placing small
reproductions or related works on the wall labels accompanying
certain pictures in question. This ploy would have been
particularly helpful early in the exhibition, because this part is
dominated by Picasso works.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Picasso's extraordinary ``Figure and Profile''
(1928) was painted in response to Matisse's ``The Piano Lesson''
(1916). ``The Piano Lesson'' is owned by the Museum of Modern Art
and probably wouldn't have been let go for this show, because MoMA
is co-organizing its own exhibition on Matisse and Picasso,
scheduled for 2002. But surely MoMA would have permitted a modest
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too _ intentionally or not _ Bois' exhibition presents
Matisse as the greater artist, even though there are more works by
Picasso on view and even though both artists are represented by a
number of inferior pictures that Bois chose to illustrate some of
his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the installation, Picasso is transformed from
the intensely focused aggressor, an artist in top form, to a
follower casting about for a new sense of direction. If he starts
off in a proactive mode, creating one picture after another that
make teasing references to Matissean themes, Picasso ends up
reacting to Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   For when Matisse died in 1954, he went out like a lion. By then,
he was at the height of his powers, having developed his audacious
paper cutouts and successfully executing his commission for the
Chapel of the Rosary at Vence.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, Bois' exhibition is stunning despite its flaws.
Walking through it is like attempting to wade through a heavy surf:
If you're not dragged bodily out to sea, you're at least knocked
off your feet by the art that has been assembled in the Kimbell's
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry'' is at its best in the
sculpture section, which presents several bronzes by both artists
in telling juxtapositions.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse, a master of modeling in clay, created pieces that hold
together as if by gravitational pull. Their integrity is innate.
Picasso, in turn, constructs his sculptures from individually
formed pieces of clay _ not unlike the assemblages and collages he
created from found materials _ that never quite relinquish their
separate identities. Even when they are masterfully incorporated
into works like ``Head of a Woman'' (1931), these components work
against the sculpture's integrity in an exciting way.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, both ``Head of a Woman'' and Matisse's ``Jeanette
V'' (1913) incorporate evidence of the processes of their making in
ways that enhance both finished pieces. Both were cast in bronze
from clay models. In his piece, Picasso additionally cast the
wooden armature that underpins that modeled clay. Matisse, on the
other hand, finished off his bust with a traditional pedestal, but
he permitted the seams from the sections of the plaster mold to
become part of the work, underscoring its cubistic qualities.

STEPPING UP THE SEARCH FOR MINORITY ADOPTIVE PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Gracie Bonds Staples 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ken and Heather Smith sit in a conference
room of the Edna Gladney Center with nothing more than hope. But
even that is more than they had a year ago, when doctors told
Heather she could not bear children because lupus had begun
attacking her kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if I'd lost a child to know I'd never be able to
experience childbirth,'' said Heather Smith, 35. ``I was really
taken aback.''
</P>
<P>
   But under a relatively new Gladney program designed to increase
the number of African-American adoptions, the couple can become
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The center launched its African-American and Biracial Children
program a year ago but recently stepped up efforts because more
birth mothers want minority parents to adopt their babies, said
Paige McCoy Smith, a spokeswoman for the center. Requests have
jumped from about 20 a year to double that number in the past two
years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney began public-service announcements starring TV
personality Nell Carter and established an advisory council of
minority community representatives and staff members to devise ways
to help raise awareness about their efforts. Revised brochures and
a Web site further emphasize the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout our history, Gladney has been placing children of
all races,'' McCoy Smith said. ``But we have found there is a
shortage of African-Americans, for whatever reason, who want to
adopt.''
</P>
<P>
   By increasing the number of black couples willing to adopt,
Smith said, the center can better accommodate birth mothers by
giving them more families to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 babies are adopted each year through the Gladney
Center, McCoy Smith said. Only 10 percent of those are placed with
African-American or biracial couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem. A huge need,'' said Retter Williams,
president of the Minority Adoption Council of Tarrant County, a
nonprofit support group. ``More children are coming into the system
than are going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the shortage, she said, are varied. Foremost is a
lack of African-American families able or willing to adopt; they
are either unaware of the need or cannot adopt because minority
children often come with a sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney's ABC program is one of several efforts launched across
the country in recent years to publicize the need for more minority
families to adopt and to encourage them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A group of African-American clergy members, for instance, began
a local affiliate of One Church, One Child four years ago. The
national organization matches homeless and parentless minority
children with caring families.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1993, Rose Jones, who for seven years helped recruit
adoptive families for Child Protective Services, started her own
agency, the Children and Family Institute in Fort Worth. The
institute finds permanent homes for children, including those with
special needs, and provides counseling and other services to birth
parents who want to keep their children.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raquel McFadden, an adoption caseworker and
coordinator of the Gladney Center's ABC program, the wait for a
child is generally six months to a year. But because of the
shortage of minority couples, their wait is less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the demand, we need more African-American
families,'' McFadden said. ``We need more Kens and Heathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smith, a 40-year-old financial analyst, and Heather Smith, a
product market manager, learned about Gladney and the program
through friends. After much prayer, they began the adoption process
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted was to have a family and raise a child
with my husband,'' Heather Smith said. ``I could do that with any
child.''
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, an estimated 100 African-American children in
Tarrant County are awaiting adoption, said Williams, who has eight
adopted children. In comparison, about 70 white children are
awaiting families at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 110,000 children are awaiting adoption, said
Joe Kroll, executive director of the North American Council on
Adoptable Children, a nonprofit agency that advocates for foster
children. Of those, about 59 percent are African-American, compared
with 10 percent Hispanic and 29 percent Anglo.
</P>
<P>
   Because costs are the biggest barrier to infant adoption, Kroll
and others said, Gladney's efforts are commendable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any effort by a private agency to be willing to put programs
in the minority community to recruit families we applaud,''Kroll
said. ``That's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Families pay as much as $9,000 to adopt a child through Gladney.
The fee covers a home study and a series of services to the birth
mother, such as medical care, legal services and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths said that they were attracted to the Gladney Center
because the program is comprehensive, well-organized and
internationally known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did they give us a lot of information,'' Heather Smih
said, ``they gave us a chance to interact with pregnant moms and
people who had already adopted from the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The dusty exercise equipment that once sat unused in the Smiths'
third bedroom has been removed, making room for a crib, a rocker
and perhaps a dressing table.
</P>
<P>
   Someday _ soon, they hope _ their newborn will fill this space
and their hearts with the wonder of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   So now, they wait like expectant parents in a hospital delivery
room. Boy or girl. African-American or biracial. They don't care.
They just want a healthy baby.

WHEN TALK TURNS TO AARON RECORD, GRIFFEY HAS A HAMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Enough already with this Y2K talk.
</P>
<P>
   There's potentially a far more disruptive element at work out
there. A threat to the daily balance that people across Seattle can
barely imagine. Paralyzing stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of a contemporary label, let's call it KGJ756.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 10 years from now, when people finally have sorted
through all the computer wreckage and recovered from that pesky
millennium bug, imagine a middle-aged Ken Griffey Jr., bald and
goateed like Jay Buhner and round around the edges like Tony Gwynn,
in the chase of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the 25th anniversary year of Henry Aaron becoming the
greatest home-run hitter of all-time, a possible successor has been
identified. To the next generation, the long-ball torch officially
has been passed.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can surpass Hammerin' Hank and his mammoth total of
755 big-league homers, the people's choice is Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The stat geeks agree on this. So do current and former Mariner
teammates. Even Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that Griffey, with all that radiant youth and
burgeoning talent on his side, stands the best chance of one day
sitting alone atop baseball's homer mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Junior stays consistent, sure, the record's in jeopardy,''
Buhner says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe it,'' Aaron said. ``If he stays on track and
keeps his eyes on the prize, he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   KGJ756.
</P>
<P>
   It stands for baseball record-breaker, not computer
circuit-breaker. It looks like an overseas flight number.
Ultimately it could be Griffey's personalized license plate number.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his 11th season in the majors, the Mariners' slugging
center fielder has accumulated 350 homers, ranking him 52nd on the
game's all-time list. He hit No. 300 last year in Cleveland and
easily could pick up his 400th somewhere this season.
</P>
<P>
   More compelling, the 29-year-old Griffey has collected 52 homers
more than Aaron and 112 more than Babe Ruth at a comparable age.
Aaron and Seattle's wunderkind won't be even again any time soon,
unless Griffey socks just eight over the entire 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bill James, baseball's ultimate stat wizard, is so impressed by
this feverish pace he gives Griffey the best chance _ 45 percent _
of surpassing Aaron's 755 total. To reach this conclusion, James
uses a homemade formula comparing the player's age and long-ball
momentum. In this case, it's a career expected to last at least
another seven seasons and 56 homers per season over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers come up Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a realistic chance he can hit quite a few more than
755,'' says James, a former Kansas school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He gives Mark McGwire only a 34-percent chance of breaking
Aaron's record. The St. Louis Cardinal strong man captivated the
sports world last year by hitting 70 homers in a season to undo
Roger Maris' longstanding single-season mark. Big Mac's heroics
appear more suited for the short term. Age _ 35 _ is his downfall
here.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, of course, has to be not only good but lucky to touch
3,024 bases with his home-run trot. He has to avoid injury, hope
that Safeco Field is four-bagger friendly and lobby against any
league rule changes geared to alter a game turned power hungry.
</P>
<P>
   James prefers to see Griffey making contact on the sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to imagine him not doing it,'' the stat man said.
``It's easier to imagine him doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Vincent, who tracks home runs for the Society of American
Baseball Research, has done his own detailed numbers crunch. He
estimates that Griffey will have rung up 485 homers by the time the
Mariner celebrates his 31st birthday, 605 at 34 and 725 at 38.
Aaron and Ruth didn't surpass 700 homers until they were 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Griffey decides he wants to play, and he stops running into
the center-field wall, he can do it,'' the Virginia-based Vincent
said. ``I have no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey dives out of the way when he hears all this.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing bat exploits never has been one of the Mariner's
favorite pastimes. To him, any acknowledgment that he has a yen for
socking balls halfway to the moon is braggadocio.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard Aaron single him out as the most likely successor
to obtain homer immortality, and appreciates the kind words from a
legend. But Griffey says he is not buying any of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be realistic,'' he said. ``I've got 405 to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey takes a few more cuts. On this subject, he swings from
the toes with scarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season must be getting close, because it's time to write
goofy things about Griffey _ Junior closing in on Hank Aaron's
record,'' he intones. ``It's not like it's 25; it's 405. It means
if I averaged 40 for the next 10 years, I'd still be five short.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates don't question his ability to pull this off. Just his
interest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about hypotheticals,'' Buhner said. ``That's a lot of
years. Who's to say in four or five years he doesn't want to do
something else? Say, if he wins two or three World Series?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mariner newcomer Butch Huskey, ``For Griffey to play past
14 or 15 years, it will be because he wants to break the record. It
won't be for financial reasons. It will be a heckuva lot of wear
and tear. He'll have to play first base or somewhere else down the
line. I hope I'm still playing to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Griffey came along, Alvin Davis was the Mariners' top
home-run hitter. He had 160 in eight seasons. Davis can already
picture himself trailing his former teammate by about 600 homers
when all the hitting is said and done.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing Griffey and Aaron long-ball totals, health will be
the determining factor, Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it that he can do it, but some things
have to happen for Junior,'' he said. ``You have to be consistent.
You have to play every day. Look at Hank's career: He was a very
healthy player.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron told the Post-Intelligencer two years ago that Griffey was
the likeliest candidate to replace himself as baseball's homer
king. Aaron reiterated that thought at an Atlanta luncheon two
months ago. He repeated it again to the P-I last week.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, when he is an opening-night visitor at the
Kingdome, Aaron likely will say it one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I talk with him, I'll tell him to keep doing what he's been
doing,'' the former Atlanta Braves slugger said of his impending
Seattle stop. ``Don't let anything change him. Records are made to
be broken. He's carried himself in such a way, everybody's going to
be pulling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, however, had a tremendous finishing kick at a late age to
catch Ruth's 714 total. He, too, wonders if Griffey will want to
stick around long enough to do wondrous things in the 21st Century.
Aaron wonders if he would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the catch, you can't do it in 15 or 16 seasons,'' Aaron
said. ``I hit a lot of home runs when ballplayers are usually
heading in the wrong direction. These guys are so filthy rich now
at such a young age, it's hard to stay focused. Today, I'd probably
be the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, Mariner vice president of baseball operations,
won't argue with Aaron. Or Davis. If Griffey plays long enough, all
kinds of records will be shattered, the exec says.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward won't project numbers. But he says Griffey is capable
of getting the homer record. Keeping it, however, might be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another guy who's going to be very similar in this _
Alex,'' he said, referring to Rodriguez, the Mariners' 23-year-old
shortstop. ``He just hit 40 homers and he's so young.''
</P>
<P>
   AR757, anyone?

   'Tis the day before April Fools',
</P>
<P>
   So make the most of this chance
</P>
<P>
   To trick friends and relatives with some fun-loving pranks.
</P>
<P>
   The sneaky CLASS ACTS team
</P>
<P>
   Has some crafty ideas up their sleeves
</P>
<P>
   That make getting a smile easy to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the urge to laugh when playing the jokes
</P>
<P>
   Or else you could be the one
</P>
<P>
   Who gets fooled next with a hoax!
</P>
<P>
   DOZENS OF WAYS TO TRICK YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Set all the clocks three hours early.
</P>
<P>
   Put grape-flavored Kool-Aid in big sister's shower head.
</P>
<P>
   The dead fish in the bathtub or backpack is always a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Have big bro or sis move Mom or Dad's car to an unannounced
location.
</P>
<P>
   Put clear plastic wrap over the toilet seat, then grease the
doorknob so that a furious family member will become further
outraged. (Get ready for some serious heinie-whipping).
</P>
<P>
   Slip a plastic fly or other insect into a friend's drink or
sandwich at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Drive your mom absolutely crazy by hiding her keys in her coat
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the driver's-side car-door handle with Vaseline.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a twin or have a sibling who looks like you, dress
alike for the day and try to pull a switcharoo on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tell a friend that his fly is open or that there's a rip in the
back of his jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Pretend you're giving a gift to a relative or friend. Get lots
of different-sized boxes and wrap them one by one with newspaper,
with each one inside the next larger one. In the smallest box, put
a note that says, ``April Fools'!''
</P>
<P>
   Conduct a panty raid and swap everyone's underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Hide a note from a ``long-lost secret admirer'' in a friend's
locker. Decorate the outside with dead flowers and black streamers.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the glove compartment with Silly String or marbles.
</P>
<P>
   Stick a fake dirty diaper into your friend's locker or book bag.
Buy a pre-made one or create one yourself by mixing peanut butter
with green food coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly rearrange the shoes in Mom's closet or socks in Dad's
dresser drawer, mixing up the pairs so nothing matches.
</P>
<P>
   Mix up oatmeal and scoop a pile of it on the kitchen floor so it
looks like the cat threw up.
</P>
<P>
   Or mix up oatmeal and pretend you're throwing up so you don't
have to go to school. Trick Mom later with ``April Fools'.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake up a person's soft drink so it will fizz in her face.
</P>
<P>
   Tie a $5 bill onto fishing line and strategically place it in
the hallway at school. Yank on the string as the person reaches for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Put salt in the sugar bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Reach out to shake a friend's hand in the morning, holding a
handful of shaving cream.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up early and stash the morning paper in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Put fake or candy worms in your brother's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Hide the charger or power cord of Mom's cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the batteries of Dad's pager.
</P>
<P>
   Fix French toast. Substitute baking soda for powered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up Dad or big brother super early to say the car has two
flat tires.
</P>
<P>
   Chew up black licorice and spit it out, gagging all your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, put a few cubes of ice on Mom's pillow or
in her slippers.
</P>

CHERYL CROW IN TOP FORM AS SINGER-SONGWRITER 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 Includes one color slide of singer-songwriter Cheryl Crow. (Credit:
Courtesy of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHERYL CROW
</P>
<P>
   Age: 37.
</P>
<P>
   Home base: Born in Missouri, moved to Los Angeles in 1986,
currently living on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Way popular _ and way attractive _ singer with a
slew of singles, hit albums and Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: If Sheryl Crow weren't a pop star, chances are
she'd still be playing music. She has, after all, been tinkering
with music since she was 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by her musically inclined parents, Crow was writing
songs at 13 and playing in bands throughout high school. In 1984,
she graduated from the University of Missouri, majoring in music
composition.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she moved to Los Angeles, where she waited
tables and recorded commercial jingles. Through the recording
studio where she worked, Crow heard that Michael Jackson was
looking for backup singers. She auditioned. She got the gig. That
started everything.
</P>
<P>
   She started writing songs for artists such as Eric Clapton and
Celine Dion; soon, she wrote her own album, her debut ``Tuesday
Night Music Club.'' Featuring the single, ``All I Wanna Do,'' the
record sold 7.2 million copies and won her a trio of Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Between tours, she made the follow-up album, ``Sheryl Crow,''
which has sold 4.8 million copies since it came out in '96. It won
Grammys for Best Female Rock Vocal and Best Rock Album.
</P>
<P>
   Her third disc, last year's ``The Globe Sessions,'' has also
sold well and garnered her a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her first two discs, ``The Globe Sessions'' was recorded
in New York, in a sorta seedy meatpacking district. Crow says she
dug the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved working there,'' she told The New York Times. ``It
just was a cool, cool vibe. If you ever got really hung up in the
frustration of trying to get something accomplished in the studio,
you could walk out and just be amongst some bizarre energy. It
clears your head and gives you some perspective when you walk out
in such a strange, frenetic, unpredictable atmosphere.''

ADVICE ABOUT ATHLETE FAVORITISM; PROMISCUOUS FLIRTING 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I'm in high school, and I know a lot of
athletes. And I know teachers do not discipline them like other
students. I have one teacher who helps the athletes with special
tutoring, and his papers always seem to be graded differently from
the papers of the rest of us. I think they want to make sure with
the no-pass-no play rule that the athletes still maintain their
grades high enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to act like they do, I would fail or be punished. I
don't know what to do. The teacher will get mad at me if I say
anything. I really don't know who to tell. I think this is unfair
to students. No pass, no play.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR No pass, no play: You make a good point. No preferential
treatment is appropriate for the school or home setting. A double
standard applied to athletes is not fair to you and other students.
Try to talk to the teacher or vice principal or someone at the
school you can trust. Discuss what you have seen and explain why
you think athletes receive less discipline and exceptions on
grades.
</P>
<P>
   You can discuss this with your parents and have them talk with
school administration. Even if certain teachers are handing out
grades to athletes, eventually another teacher will not, and the
student will fail.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: My friend is very promiscuous. She goes around
asking guys if they want to get lucky. She leads them on. She will
flirt with every guy. She will also make dates with several guys,
go out with one and then not bother canceling the dates with the
others. The guys get real mad. I think if she keeps this up, she's
going to get hurt. Worried.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Worried: Your friend is headed for major trouble. You can
talk with her and let her know that she should treat guys in the
same way she wants to be treated. No one wants to be led on, then
dropped. The guys will spread the news, and she won't be able to
find a good guy who will treat her with respect. Let her know that
you think highly of her and that she should respect herself enough
to change her ways. Let your friend know that she, like everyone
else, deserves that.

   Capri Craze
</P>
<P>
   Those short pants ruling the racks in stores are the hottest
look for spring. Known as capri pants, clam diggers, pedal pushers
or cropped pants, they are a great warm-weather alternative to
shorts. Passing the school dress code should be no prob. Capris
look great with just about any style top _ oversize or skimpy.

   ``The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, and Joe Mantegna.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Five down-on-their-luck Los Angeles guys hope to change
their lives by pooling their money to buy a magical white suit. The
men arrange to wear the suit for one night each (but decide to wear
it for one hour each in one evening), and the outfit helps make
each of their dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   Why go see it?: This film, released only on video, is a
heartwarming tale of friendship, hope and sharing. It mixes comedy
with serious thought and makes you think while you laugh. If you
love movies about giving, friendship and magic, along with
slapstick comedy, then check out ``The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit.''
The screenplay was written by Ray Bradbury.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for rating: It was rated PG, but I couldn't figure out
why. There was no inappropriate language or subject matter, and the
violence was only a little slapstick fighting. The only thing that
might be a cause for the rating was one scene in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 rating: 9.
</P>
<P>
   Also available:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action film about a 15-foot-tall gorilla whose life is
threatened by poachers. A zoologist and a woman who raised the
gorilla work together to rescue him and bring him to a California
animal preserve.
</P>

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Procrastination is a horrible
thing. Although initially it seems wonderful, you always regret it
in the end. When you are given a project, begin to work on it
immediately. If you choose to delay, you will become very
frustrated and stressed. Get to work!
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): The time has come for you to take up
a new hobby. Do something that you have wanted to do for a very
long time. If you find yourself a little wary of the experience, do
a bit of research. Finding out the facts will calm your nerves, and
you will be set to take the plunge into this new activity.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): You will receive a money bonus in the
next few days. Be a wise spender, but the key word is ``spend.''
Every once in a while, you need to splurge and treat yourself to
something special. It is a chance for you to bask in the pleasures
produced by your hard work. Happy shopping!
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): This week, you will find yourself
the bearer of bad news. Sometimes when you have something that is
difficult to say, it is easier to say it quickly. If you choose to
sugarcoat it, the message may become too vague and/or the person
you are talking to might be insulted by your indirectness.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): Things are running smoothly in your
life. Your circle of friends is getting along better than ever.
Your family life is going great. Enjoy the serenity that surrounds
you this week. Keep in mind that some people work their whole lives
for what you have.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You need to do a little
soul-searching. Lately you have been down in the dumps and only you
know why. Figure it out. It is affecting everyone you encounter.
Your friends and family love you and would help, except you've put
up a barrier that is difficult to break through. Let someone in.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Too many things are going too well
for you and they will continue to roll that way this week. Don't
get spoiled by all the attention. Learn to let others share the
spotlight. Things will begin to slow down next week.
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): This week holds a rough start but a
smooth finish. By Wednesday, you might need to take a break and
relieve some stress. After that's out of the way, the week will be
great. Some people say that time flies when you are having fun, but
this week, time will slow down and let you enjoy yourself.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): You may feel a little neglected
this week. However, it is probably just in your head and you are it
out of proportion. You are still loved by all and you still have
your cutie. Keep from getting into deep thoughts about this because
you will end up driving yourself up the wall. When you catch
yourself daydreaming, open a book or turn on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): The more that you think that
things are way too hectic and busy, the less you get finished. Do
not waste your precious time worrying. That never does anyone any
good. Get home from school and start your work right off the bat.
That way, you might get a little relaxation before you conk out.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): There is a lot of truth in the
phrase, ``There is no I in Team.'' It may be hard for you to allow
someone else do the job without your help, but they will never
learn if you do not stop trying to be the universal player. Teams
grow together and that is hard to do when somebody is stealing the
spotlight. Use what you have to teach others.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): This week, you will have time to
yourself. It is up to you how you spend it. You could twiddle your
thumbs, or you could use it to find what you have been looking for
in the past couple of weeks. Sit and think, then get something
accomplished. This time will not come around too often, so take
advantage of it.

THE WELL-ORCHESTRATED RISE OF THE TOURING SYNTHESIZER

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If you are lucky enough to get tickets to
``Rent,'' the largely sold-out touring production playing Bass
Performance Hall this week, you'll probably see something the New
York audience didn't get: an extra musician.
</P>
<P>
   The production of ``Rent'' seen in Fort Worth uses a
rock-inspired orchestra of six, an unusually small ensemble for a
Broadway show, but one more than the original show used. An extra
part was written to provide work for the additional musician, who
was added to the tour to cover spots in case of illness.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to touring shows, ``Rent'' is an anomaly: When
you attend a touring Broadway production in Fort Worth, you're
often hearing only a fraction of the orchestra that played in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's production of ``Phantom of the Opera'' at Bass
Performance Hall was far more typical. An orchestra of 30 to 35
members played the show on Broadway; 20 played Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly over the past three decades, almost as unnoticeably as
the paint on the wall that fades imperceptibly day by day, the
orchestra for touring Broadway shows has turned, in many cases,
into a half-orchestra plus electronic synthesizer. Listeners with
sensitive ears who attended ``Phantom'' at Bass Hall might well
have been perplexed by the long stretches of obviously synthesized,
electronically produced sound in places where they heard a
traditional acoustic string sound on the cast recording or on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Critics lament the decline of the musical on Broadway, where
presenting a flashy spectacle, or reviving old shows from earlier
days, has eclipsed the traditional process of creating and
presenting shows carried by drama and music.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience just keeps pouring in. ``The Lion King'' _ a
knock-off of an animated movie _ and ``Phantom of the Opera'' _ a
feeble frame for special effects from a composer whose best work
was behind him in his early 20s _ have become tourist attractions
in New York, right along with the Statue of Liberty and the Empire
State Building.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike those venerable structures, the hit Broadway show
can become a traveling tourist attraction. You'll pay up to $75 for
a good ticket on Broadway; you'll pay just as much in places such
as Fort Worth to see the touring company. But you won't hear as
many live performers.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the synthesizer, a modest, almost unnoticeable
little keyboard down in the pit where the strings used to sit. When
originally introduced to the Broadway pit in the early 1970s, the
synthesizer helped to create the new gospel and rock sounds _ as in
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' _ that revitalized the Broadway scene in
those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write for the synthesizer, and you can write for it
well,'' says Joseph Stecko, music director and conductor for Fort
Worth's Casa Manana theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the synthesizer also introduced two degrading elements.
Instead of finding that perfect instrumental effect, today's
arranger may succumb to the temptation to hit close enough with the
synthesizer, and never apply the discipline that creates truly
memorable music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I'd play real keyboard sounds on the
keyboard,'' says composer-musician Robert Stecko, Joseph Stecko's
New York-based son, who has played numerous Broadway and touring
shows. ``Nowadays, you play strings, oboes, cymbals, violins and
harps on the keyboard.'' (In a current production at Dallas
Children's Theater, the synthesizer also convincingly replicates
gastronomical distress, to much audience laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   For Broadway touring companies, and in smaller theaters around
America, the synthesizer has become a substitute for live players:
one musician seated at the electronic keyboard can fill in for a
whole section of string players.
</P>
<P>
   Although this has occurred since the early 1970s, it just
doesn't sound as good: The reliably perfect intonation doesn't
begin to make up for the loss of a group of human beings making
music.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Church, music director for ``The Lion King,'' contends that
the substitution of a synthesizer for a few live musicians doesn't
make that much difference. In New York, 24 musicians play in the
pit for ``The Lion King;'' on the road, the orchestra is reduced to
17.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just an artistic issue. It's a labor issue as well.
Local musicians in Fort Worth picketed when a touring production of
``Fiddler on the Roof'' at Will Rogers Auditorium performed with
only eight live musicians, none of them local. In the original
score, 26 were called for.
</P>
<P>
   Local musicians' union President Ray Hair vehemently supports
the idea of using local musicians to make up a full Broadway
orchestra for touring shows. Although the pit at Casa Manana holds
only 18 musicians, and thus requires that Broadway orchestra parts
often be reduced, the larger pit at Bass Performance Hall can
easily hold a full Broadway contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have the opportunity to present Broadway shows with
original orchestrations,'' Hair says.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, major professional productions of Broadway
musicals come before the audience in three ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some Broadway touring shows, such as the recent presentations of
``Les Miserables'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' are presented,
usually at Will Rogers Auditorium, by a New York-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-based theater company Casa Manana presents major
touring productions, such as last summer's ``Phantom of the Opera''
and the upcoming ``Rent'' at Bass Hall. Casa Manana also creates
its own productions, sometimes at Bass Hall (as was the case with
the recent ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum)'' and
sometimes at its own famous domed theater-in-the-round (as with the
upcoming production of ``Annie).''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Casa played it safe, with an orchestra of 14 for ``A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' in Bass Hall _ even
though the pit in the new facility easily would have accommodated
the original full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still finding out what it costs to put on a show in Bass
Hall,'' says Casa Manana executive producer Denton Yockey. ``If I
had known how successful `Forum' was going to be, we might have
used a larger orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Summer Musicals, meanwhile, proves that it can be done.
That company presents mostly Broadway touring companies at Fair
Park Music Hall and at the Majestic Theatre. But it also annually
produces one or two shows locally, and it has a policy of matching
the original Broadway score _ part of a greater philosophy of
reproducing in Dallas what audiences see on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to duplicate the original as closely as possible,''
says Dallas Summer Musicals president and managing director Michael
Jenkins. ``And we try to use as many local musicians as possible.
It's not always cost-effective, but we're more interested in
presenting a quality product than in profit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with an annual budget of $19 million, Dallas Summer
Musicals earns more than it spends every year. And although we
can't make Broadway orchestrators and arrangers entirely abandon
the synthesizer, we have the opportunity to insist that the
orchestra for Broadway shows in Bass Performance Hall can be as
good and as large as those on Broadway.

 &HT;    Terrorism: It's getting less disciplined, more dangerous
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULLOWHEE, N.C. _ Stopping terrorists is becoming more
challenging because more acts are being carried out by loosely
organized groups or loners, the FBI's chief of counterterrorism
told a public safety conference at Western Carolina University on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been drastic changes in the makeup of terrorist
organizations in the last decade,'' said Neil Gallagher, assistant
director of the FBI's National Security Division. ``No longer are
groups made up of individuals from the same small town or one
religious sect.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is harder for agents to monitor and infiltrate
terrorist operations, Gallagher told the gathering of some 400
public safety officers from across the South.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gallagher did not mention Eric Robert Rudolph, the
North Carolina man who is accused of a wave of bomb attacks in
Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala., Rudolph was a topic of conversation
among participants. Many of them have helped in the yearlong search
for the fugitive in the mountains about 30 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in western North Carolina, you know we've been looking
for Eric Rudolph, and you also know we haven't found him,'' said
David Martinez, who directs the FBI's domestic terrorism efforts in
North Carolina. ``Eventually he will come out, unless he's already
been lunch for some bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is accused of a string of homemade nail-bomb attacks
that targeted Centennial Olympic Park in 1996; a suburban Atlanta
abortion clinic and an Atlanta gay nightclub in 1997; and a
Birmingham abortion clinic in January of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of special concern to those attending the conference was the
fact that two of those attacks included secondary devices set to go
off once rescue, fire and law officers arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not the folk hero he's made out to be,'' said Robert
Clifford, an FBI agent who has worked on the Rudolph case. ``He's a
murderer, ruthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Malter, a bomb expert with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, said the Atlanta bombings marked the first
time in 35 years that an American terrorist act had included bombs
to specifically kill public safety officers once they arrived on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a terrorist attack government officers? To show that
the government has lack of control,'' added the FBI's Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those attacks, public safety agencies around the
country have changed their response strategies for terrorist
attacks. During the conference, a video produced by the Georgia
Emergency Management Agency warned about lessons learned from the
Atlanta bombs. The video suggested that authorities evacuate all
but essential personnel from an area no less than 1,000 feet from
the attack site. It also recommended that emergency medical teams
remove victims from the area before beginning treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed was the attempted bombing of an Asheville, N.C.,
abortion clinic last month as a sign that no American town is
immune from terrorists. Authorities say Rudolph is not a suspect.
The bomb misfired and did little damage, but investigators said it
would have destroyed a sizable portion of the building had it
detonated fully.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's top foreign policy
officials gathered in the Oval Office on Monday morning after
monitoring a wrenching weekend in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces had accelerated their campaign of ethnic murder
and expulsions in Kosovo. An American F-117 stealth fighter had
gone down just west of Belgrade. And NATO war planners had decided
to expand their list of targets to include Serbian military and
police units, who were conducting an offensive against Kosovo
civilians that was unexpected in its speed and savagery.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton surveyed the dispirited faces of his senior
advisers _ including the secretaries of state and defense, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of central
intelligence _ and decided they needed a pep talk, according to an
official who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guys, let's not lose sight of why we did this,' ''
the official said. `` `Let's not forget what prompted us to do this
and who is responsible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that only four days into a long-planned
bombardment campaign against the forces of Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, Clinton needed to buck up the senior
officials who advised him to pursue the military option.
</P>
<P>
   And to do so, the president had to conceal doubts of his own
about the course he had chosen, according to advisers. While
Clinton is confident he was justified in ordering the air and
missile attacks, one adviser said, the decision has gnawed at him
and cost him sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have repeatedly said that no one should
be surprised by the campaign of terror visited on Kosovo by
Milosevic's troops in the days following the start of allied
bombing a week ago. Clinton was warned that Milosevic was intent on
ruthlessly driving ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. But the
President and his advisers seem taken aback by the sheer ferocity
of Milosevic's onslaught and the scale of the humanitarian disaster
it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can know something intellectually, but when you see it,
live it, no matter how much you know it's coming, the gruesomeness
of the behavior is different from an intellectual exercise,'' one
adviser said. ``It's one thing to say we expected this, but living
it is not the same as thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As reports of atrocities and heartbreaking pictures of columns
of refugees pour in from the Balkans, Clinton and the White House
have endeavored to present a picture of confidence. Directly after
the Monday foreign policy meeting, for example, Clinton drove to
suburban Virginia for a round of golf, a display of nonchalance
that recalled, at least to some critics, President Bush's golf
outings and speedboat rides during the 1990 buildup to the war in
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has kept a more or less normal schedule this week,
handling routine ceremonial duties and keeping an engagement to
speak at an electronics industry dinner on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to avoid the appearance of being seized by
crisis, officials in Washington, who themselves have dribbled out
scraps of information about the war in vague daily briefings, have
allowed the briefers at NATO headquarters to be the leading voices
on the conflict. This is part of a deliberate strategy to portray
Kosovo as chiefly a European, not an American concern, according to
Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a NATO operation,'' Lockhart said. ``I think we have
consciously tried to have the allies be the main spokespeople for
this. And this was a decision not just by the United States, but by
all 19 members of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   By making NATO the voice of the operation, the United States,
which is the dominant force in the alliance, may manage to bear
less of the blame if it goes sour _ and less of the credit if it
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   While striving to maintain a businesslike demeanor in public, in
private the president is preoccupied with the Balkan crisis, aides
said. ``There's a heaviness to this decision that affects him,''
one adviser said. ``No matter how long you've been at this job, you
never get used to these tough calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the first thing Clinton deals with in the morning and
the last matter on his mind at night as he tries to sleep, this
adviser said. He has also been plagued by a cold and seasonal
allergies, lending to his haggard appearance in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is afflicted with more than insomnia and sinus
pain. The Balkans have troubled him since his first days in office.
He was determined not to repeat the hesitation and indecision that
marked his and NATO's handling of the Bosnia crisis from 1992 to
1995. And in fact the West acted more quickly when Milosevic moved
on Kosovo than they did when he undertook his offensive in Bosnia
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is evident improvisation in the
administration's and NATO's decisionmaking on Kosovo. Milosevic did
not capitulate after the first few days of bombing, as the allies
had hoped, so NATO decided to raise the stakes last weekend to
target his forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   When two days of that effort failed to deter him, the allies
quickly moved on to ``phase 3,'' adding government ministries in
downtown Belgrade and other command-and-control facilities to the
target list.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative picture is of a war being planned on the fly,
with hurried escalation following each new provocation.
</P>
<P>
   A senior national security official said that in fact the allies
were ``learning by doing how you conduct a NATO operation, both at
a political and a military level.''
</P>
<P>
   How, then, do NATO and the United States plan to pursue the war
in Yugoslavia if phases 1, 2, and 3 fail to persuade Milosevic to
withdraw his forces? What is phase 4?
</P>
<P>
   Said one exasperated senior official, ``There is no phase 4.''

cousin of marijuana grown around the world for its fiber, seed and
oil. But long identified with marijuana both by law enforcement and
the counterculture, it is banned in the United States as part of
the war on drugs. As farmers from Hawaii to North Dakota to Vermont
lobby state legislatures to study hemp's potential and make it
legal, they are opposed by federal officials unwilling to relax

   MOSCOW _ Russia announced Wednesday that it is sending a
military reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the
conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the State Department
as unhelpful as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Defense Minister Igor D.
Sergeyev confirmed that Russia had notified Turkey of plans to
dispatch seven vessels from its Black Sea Fleet through the
Bosporus in two flotillas. But just now, he said, Moscow has
decided to send one electronic intelligence-gathering vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must insure the security of Russia,'' he said, ``and for
this reason we must have more concrete information about the
situation in the area. We must analyze such information and draw
the necessary conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The six other ships are being prepared, he said, and a decision
on their deployment will be made ``when the defense ministry
decides that this is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian decision to send ships to the Mediterranean drew a
rebuke from the State Department, where a spokesman said that such
a deployment would not be a ``helpful gesture'' because it could
give the wrong impression to Yugoslavia about Russia's intentions
and because the ships' presence would only ``complicate an already
complicated situation'' off the Yugoslav coast.
</P>
<P>
   Top Russian officials, including President Boris Yeltsin, have
repeatedly said Russia will stay clear of the military conflict in
Yugoslavia, even as it continues to condemn the NATO bombings as an
act of unwarranted aggression. At the news conference Wednesday,
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov reiterated this policy, but added
that the naval deployment was ``politically fully justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians announced their decision on the day Prime Minister
Yevgeny M. Primakov returned to Moscow empty handed from a
diplomatic mission that included stops in Belgrade and Bonn. Ivanov
said Wednesday that Russia would continue its attempts to broker a
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed Primakov's failure to get a discussion going between
Yugoslavia and the allies on NATO intransigence, in particular on
its insistence that the bombing will not stop until Yugoslavia
first agrees to a withdrawal of its troops from Kosovo. President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia told Primakov that he would not
curb his forces' activities in Kosovo until the air strikes halt, a
stand that the allies rejected out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would this mean in practice?'' Ivanov asked of NATO. ``In
practice this would mean that Yugoslavia would have to renounce its
sovereignty over that region, hand it over to the so-called Kosovo
Liberation Army, which gets all the necessary support form the
United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fulfilled the task that we set ourselves: to get from the
Yugoslav leadership a clear signal in favor of a political
settlement,'' he said, noting that Belgrade had promised to start
withdrawing troop from Kosovo and to guarantee the rights of
Albanians if the bombing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western diplomats, the Russian delegation was
informed before it left for Belgrade what NATO's conditions for a
cease-fire would be. It is still unclear whether Primakov left on
his mission with the hope that Milosevic would agree to those
conditions, or whether he knew that it would fail, thus casting
NATO in the role of an unrelenting warmonger.
</P>
<P>
   Using the harsh Cold War oratory that has characterized all his
statements in recent days, Ivanov again accused NATO of unleashing
a ``humanitarian catastrophe'' in Kosovo, and of using the news
media to ``brainwash'' the public by blaming the mounting refugee
crisis on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his assertions that the refugees fleeing Kosovo were
scared away from their homes by NATO bombs, despite eyewitness
accounts that the Serbian police and paramilitary have driven
Kosovo Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constant bombing raids are being made against Kosovo,'' he
said. ``Even the center of Pristina is being struck. Populated
areas are being hit. A war is going on. In any war there are
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving Wednesday in Macedonia and Albania from
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, reported an intense effort by
Serbian and Yugoslav forces to drive the Albanian residents out of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev also repeated earlier claims that the allied bombing
raids had caused more than 1,000 civilian casualties, with 28
Yugoslav service personnel killed and 90 wounded.

PRIME MINISTERS RETURN AS TALKS ON DISARMING IRA   CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, Northern Ireland _ For the third consecutive
night, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland pressed Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders Wednesday
night to compromise in the bitter dispute over the disarmament of
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is blocking the advance of the peace effort in this
British province.
</P>
<P>
   The two men left Ulster Wednesday morning after two days of
negotiations, took part in parliamentary debates in London and in
Dublin and returned Wednesday night to Hillsborough Castle, 15
miles south of Belfast, the residence of the Northern Ireland
secretary, Mo Mowlam, to try to reach a settlement by Friday, the
deadline set by Ms. Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can make it,'' Blair said before leaving Wednesday
morning, promising to return if he felt a compromise could be
reached Wednesday night. He returned in a helicopter about 8:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates, a group of Protestants aligned with the Rev.
Ian Paisley, who opposes the peace agreement, yelled ``Traitor!''
and ``No surrender!'' at official cars.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of the disarmament dispute would pave the way for
the transfer of home rule powers by Britain to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly. The transfer is part of the peace agreement
approved in Belfast last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives more political power to the Catholic
minority in Ulster and more influence in northern affairs to the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to settle the disarmament problem could lead to
increased sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting problem is that the transfer of home rule powers
may not start until the new Northern Ireland Assembly, led by a
Protestant first minister, David Trimble, forms a cabinet. Sinn
Fein, the IRA political wing, is to receive two of the cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble says he will not form a cabinet with Sinn Fein until
the IRA makes a ``credible beginning'' to disarming its arsenal,
estimated at 100 tons of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 20 months, which is
regularly cited by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, as proof that
the group supports the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the IRA issued a statement that was immediately and
predictably described as negative by Protestant Unionists and as
positive by Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, part of an annual proclamation marking the
anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising of Republicans against the
British colonial power, said: ``The IRA guns are silent. Over the
past five years, we have called and maintained two prolonged
cessations of military operations to enhance the democratic process
and underline our definitive commitment to its success. If the
political will exists, the peace process contains the potential to
resolve the conflict and deliver a durable peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestants, including Trimble, said the statement was
politically useless because it did not contain an unequivocal
promise to start disarming in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   But other politicians, including Sinn Fein officials, noted that
the guerrilla group had dropped its explicit vow last August not to
disarm. The IRA also emphasized that the agreement does not require
disarmament before May 2000.

GROUP CALLS FOR NATO TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since NATO began attacking
Yugoslavia by air, support for the option of sending ground troops
into Kosovo is gaining momentum here _ just as US and allied
officials hint it may be ``too late'' to consider such action.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an influential group of former diplomats and
top-level government officials publicly called for the ``urgent
planning for deployment of NATO ground troops to Kosovo.'' And US
Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, echoed the sentiment in
an column in The Washington Post entitled, ``Victory: The Only Exit
Strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements came as dismay, frustration, and even
pessimism mounted in the capital over the allies' ability to bring
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic back to the negotiating table,
or to halt the campaign to uproot ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a war, and we need to recognize it's a war and allow
our military to do what is necessary to prevail in that conflict,''
said Frank Carlucci, former defense secretary and national security
adviser to President Ronald Reagan. ``If it means troops on the
ground, then so be it, even recognizing that this is an
extraordinarily difficult place to fight a land war and that it
would take time to get troops in.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci spoke a National Press Club briefing, as a member of
the Balkan Action Council, a nonpartisan group of influential
former policy makers, writers and others pushing for a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Abramowitz, a former US ambassador and assistant
secretary of Defense under President Carter, said the flaw with the
NATO strategy is that it has failed to protect the people of
Kosovo. Without a change in direction, he said, as many as a
million Kosovar Albanians could end up refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz also said it was ``unacceptable'' to allow Kosovo to
be ethnically cleansed. Ethnic Albanians are ``going to have to go
home, and to go home may very well require the use of armed forces
on the ground.'' So it is crucial, said council members, for
President Clinton to prepare the American public for the
possibility that allied ground forces will be needed, at the very
least to ensure a safe return for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Hagel said in his column that the allies must not
settle for half-measures. ``We must be prepared to do what is
necessary to achieve our objectives and ensure victory, including
the option of ground troops,'' Hagel wrote. ``The most likely path
to peace is in convincing Milosevic of our intention to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has made much of maintaining the ``credible threat'' of
force. But for a military action to be credible, council members
said, it must include a well-planned alternative that goes beyond
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a point made repeatedly by Senator John McCain, an
Arizona Republican and presidential hopeful who, while falling
short of advocating ground intervention, has been the lead critic
of the administration's decision to avoid such force.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Beaten back and running short of weapons, the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army that spearheaded the armed effort for
Kosovo independence is on the verge of collapse, a guerrilla leader
says.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the guerrilla group is resupplied, or is helped by NATO
ground troops, Serb forces will drive them off, said Azem Syla, one
of the KLA's founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is not properly equipped with arms,'' and its supply
lines have virtually been cut off, said Syla, sitting in a barren
Albanian Army barracks near the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logical consequence, if we don't have arms, is that we
will be defeated by Serbs and killed by Serbs,'' said Syla, who
goes by the nickname ``Daja'' and who was part of the rebel
delegation at the failed peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Western alliance either to rearm the rebel
forces or send in ground troops, while at the same time conducting
its NATO air assault ``more seriously.'' Syla said that there had
been a convoy of 50 Serb tanks in western Kosovo earlier this week,
but that NATO had not bombed it. His claim could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Syla said the rebel force is running out of money for guns and
is finding it difficult to get whatever weapons it can procure over
the mined and heavily guarded border.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the rebel group, which held off Serb forces for
more than a year, had begged for a NATO air assault. But since the
airstrikes began last Wednesday, the situation for the KLA and the
ethnic Albanian populace it backs has become more desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Kosovo refugees have crossed into Albania
at the border near Kukes in the past four days alone. Many
thousands more have flooded across the Montenegro border, while
others have made the trek to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The battered rebel forces have withdrawn to six centers, and are
in a ``more threatened'' position in the two centers near the
Albanian border, Syla said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the KLA has completely pulled out of Pristina, Kosovo's
capital. In that city, Albanian sources say two neighborhoods,
including the hillside area where the US Information Agency and
other international organizations had their offices, have been
largely demolished by Serb shelling.
</P>
<P>
   In Albanian border towns, men in uniforms decorated with the
black, red, and yellow ``UCK'' emblem _ the Albanian acronym for
the rebel army _ wander the streets or sit idly in coffee bars. A
few troops were ferrying truckloads of ethnic Albanian refugees _
the human evidence that the rebels have failed to stop Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign against them.
</P>
<P>
   One rebel official in Kukes asked young men to sign up for duty
back in Kosovo, but none of the weary refugees was showing
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO eventually forces the Serbs to stand down, the
rebel army's future is in doubt. A peace proposal developed by the
Contact Group of six nations requires its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But Syla said the rebel army would never completely disband.
``They can defeat the KLA, but they cannot demolish it,'' he said.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SEEM READY TO TILT MORE TOWARD STATES IN
FEDERALISM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its deep divisions over federal authority
versus state sovereignty on full view Wednesday, the Supreme Court
appeared on the verge of tilting even further in the direction of
the states than it had gone in a series of recent 5-4 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard arguments on whether state employees can go to
state court to sue for federally guaranteed overtime pay, a
seemingly narrow question whose deep implications for basic
federal-state arrangements never appeared far from the justices'
minds. This was the first of four arguments in important federalism
cases that the court had agreed to hear in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The case Wednesday was an outgrowth of a 1996 Supreme Court
decision that closed federal courts to private suits of this type
against state governments. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine
interpreted that and other recent decisions as announcing a broad
principle of state sovereignty that closed the state courthouse
doors as well, although Congress explicitly authorized suits under
the Fair Labor Standards Act to be brought in state court.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine court's decision was incompatible with the
Constitution's supremacy clause, which makes the Constitution and
federal law the supreme law of the land, Solicitor General Seth P.
Waxman told the court Wednesday. Otherwise, he said, the
legislative authority the Constitution conferred on Congress might
as well have been ``written in disappearing ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Waxman, who brought the government into the case on the
side of 65 Maine parole officers and juvenile-justice caseworkers,
said the Maine court had misapplied the concept of sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to federal claims, the sovereign is not the
state, it is the nation,'' he told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling comment of the intense and spirited
hour came from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who was clearly
unpersuaded by either Waxman's argument or by the argument of the
state workers' lawyer, Laurence S. Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conceive of the Constitution being ratified,'' Kennedy
said, ``if it were perceived that states could be sued in their own
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark was significant because of the five justices who have
taken the states' side in the recent federalism decisions, Kennedy
has been widely seen, on the basis of his record, as the one most
likely to take a different approach in the current round of cases.
</P>
<P>
   But neither he nor the other four _ Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas _ gave any sign of having concluded that the court
might have gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
   When Gold, representing the state employees, said that an
elevation of state over federal sovereignty in the application of
federal law would be a ``wholly extraordinary notion,'' Scalia
said: ``You say it's an extraordinary notion, but the whole system
of dual sovereignty and dual citizenship was an extraordinary
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinary,'' Scalia added emphatically. The exchange
was a reminder of Scalia's emphasis on state sovereignty in his
majority opinion two years ago, when by a 5-to-4 vote the court
struck down a provision of the Brady gun control law as an
unconstitutional incursion on the states.

 WASHINGTON: the states. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter J. Brann, Maine's state solicitor, referred to that
decision Wednesday in his argument in support of the state's
immunity. The court had made clear that the federal government was
one of ``limited and enumerated powers,'' Brann said, adding, ``One
of those powers is not to abrogate a state's immunity in its own
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Brann offered a sweeping argument, asserting that state immunity
barred not only private plaintiffs, but also the federal
government, from suing a state in state court. In answer to the
justices' questions, he also said states could not be sued for
violating someone's patent or copyright. The patent question is at
issue in a case the justices will hear next month.
</P>
<P>
   The state lawyer also made frequent reference to what he
described as the states' terms for agreeing to enter the union,
telling the justices, ``We can't violate the original bargain.''
Brann described the bargain as an acceptance of federal lawmaking
authority within a framework of state sovereign immunity from suit.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, a vigorous dissenter from the court's
recent federalism decisions, sparred extensively with Brann. ``You
did give up the right to control the law that would be enforced in
your own courts,'' Souter said. He told Brann that Maine's position
lacked coherence and ignored the principle of federal supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The argument in this case, Alden vs. Maine, No. 98-436,
proceeded on several levels simultaneously. On the surface, it was
about how to interpret the court's most directly relevant recent
precedent, Seminole Tribe vs. Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That 1996 decision held that the federal courts lacked
jurisdiction to hear suits against state governments by private
plaintiffs asserting rights under laws that Congress had passed
under its authority to regulate interstate commerce. The question
now is what that decision meant for the states' immunity in their
own courts.
</P>
<P>
   On a deeper level, the argument was a continuation of the
court's ongoing struggle over an even more basic issue, the federal
government's substantive authority over the states. Between 1968
and 1985, the court reversed itself twice on the question of
whether Congress had the constitutional power to bind the states to
pay their own employees according to federal wages and hour
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The final ruling in that series, in 1985, was a 5-to-4 decision
that the Fair Labor Standards Act did apply to the states. While
there is little doubt that most of the current justices are unhappy
with that decision, the court has turned down opportunities to
reconsider it; a third reversal in barely 30 years may strike some
members of the court as institutionally unseemly. Widening the
boundaries of state immunity from suit under the law, however,
offers a more oblique route to the same end.

CHINESE PRIME MINISTER PLANS MIT ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji will give what is
being billed as a major address at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on April 14 as part of his widely anticipated US visit,
MIT said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While his other stops on the tour will be watched for what he
says about human rights, trade issues, and US allegations that
Chinese spies stole military secrets, MIT officials said Zhu's
speech at the nation's premier institute of science and technology
will outline his vision of how his country's creations in those
fields will move it toward a freer, more market-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's speech in Kresge Auditorium will be
broadcast around the world by CNN and in China by official
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we tend to think everything of importance tends
to be invented in the United States, and China looks like just a
big market to us,'' said Suzanne Berger, head of the MIT
International Science and Technology Initiative. ``We don't
understand that knowledge today is being created in many different
centers in the world, and China will be a major center. The Chinese
will be our colleagues, and they will also be a center of knowledge
creation. We're going to see big things coming out of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Zhu's US visit in mid-March came amid
tensions over a Chinese spy who the US government said stole
nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico to create miniature warheads for the Chinese. In a public
address before his country's legislature, Zhu said he anticipated
facing an ``anti-China wave'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at MIT came out of a visit by MIT president Charles
M. Vest to China in 1995, when Zhu was deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be extremely interesting as an economist, full
of ideas of moving the Chinese toward a more open, more
market-based economy,'' Vest said. ``We know China will have an
increasingly important world role in the creation of new
scientific, technological, and industrial activities. What we
understand he intends to address is science technology and
education in a global society, which would obviously be a very good
fit for the venue.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, through the program Berger directs, MIT has several
projects working with China on the development of technology,
particularly in education and the environment. For the past several
years, it has sent 30 students to China for the summer to connect
Chinese high schools to the World Wide Web, and other students to
work in Chinese labs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a blunt-speaking technocrat, Zhu is trained as an
electrical engineer, and has also been president of the Chinese
central bank.

NEW HAMPSHIRE MISSES SCHOOL TAX DEADLINE SET BY COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ After 15 months of divisive debate over how to
fund public schools, New Hampshire's citizen legislature failed to
agree on a solution in time to meet Thursday's state supreme court
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1997, the court ruled that the state's system of
funding education through local property taxes was
unconstitutional, and that, come April 1, it would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen have
been searching frantically for a solution, only to see plan after
plan collide with a stark reality: this is a state where taxes have
always been considered political poison. Just this week, the House
defeated a plan it had already approved in an earlier form that
would have included the state's first personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Granite State's attention has turned to the Democratic
Senate, where legislative leaders Wednesday were trying to build a
consensus around Shaheen's latest bill, a mix of a property tax, an
entertainment tax, and an expansion of gambling. But that bill
still faced hurdles within the Senate, which is set to vote
Thursday, as well as in the Republican-controlled House, where
opposition to gambling runs strong.
</P>
<P>
   And, everywhere, the grinding deadlock has left nerves frayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the constitutional rights of our kids and our
taxpayers are being trounced by spineless politicians in Concord,''
declared Thomas Connair, the lawyer and one-time school board
member in the mill town of Claremont who launched the winning case
that brought the court's sweeping decision. Since education is a
state responsibility, the constitution requires all property owners
to be taxed at the same rate to pay for it, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with bond rating services threatening to lower New
Hampshire's credit rating, every day of delay adds to the woes
facing the state and its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As each day passes the realization that you are getting closer
to the brink is happening,'' said John Cepaitis, an assistant
superintendent of Nashua's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the impass lies in part with the state's unique
political culture, and the ``pledge'' that lies at it's core. Since
1973, when then Gov. Meldrim Thomson Jr. and conservative Union
Leader newspaper publisher William Loeb crafted the vow to veto any
broad base tax, no governor has been elected without taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Shaheen took that pledge in both her campaigns. She has
since bent her vows and indicated that she will countenance a
statewide property or sales tax but has vowed to veto any income
tax. An income tax bill passed the House and then the Senate but
failed on its return to the House this week because of Shaheen's
veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have scattered Billie Loeb's ashes in Concord,''
said one dejected legislator after a House vote that doomed the
income tax.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no lack of ideas for how to raise money.
Proposals have ranged from increased taxes on liquor and
cigarettes, a capital gains tax and a tax on services like those
provided by lawyers or hairdressers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Senate takes up a new version of Shaheen's own
solution, one that calls for raising $825 million largely through
the legalization of video gambling at the state's racetracks and
grand hotels, increased business taxes, a statewide property tax
and a new 8 percent tax on tickets sold by theaters, ski resorts,
racetracks and other for-profit entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Should that plan pass it will go to the House. But Rep. Neal
Kurk, chairman of the House Finance Comittee issued a warning
Wednesday: ``Any Senate proposal with gambling in it will be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Without added gambling revenues, though, the state would face
three unpalatable options: increases in business taxes on the order
of $200 million to make up for gambling; a hefty statewide property
tax of at least $9 per thousand valuation, a first ever tax on
sales and services.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over not only how to raise the money but also how
much to raise. If the total is not high enough, it may not appease
the coalition of property poor towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think $825 million does not do it,'' Connair said of the
Shaheen plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some found cause for celebration. Activists gathered Wednesday
in Portsmouth to celebrate the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were throwing tea in the harbor and we are throwing local
school property tax bills into the harbor'' said Gordon Allen, a
former legislator and member of Citizens for Fair Education
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules of the new era remain almost as murky as they were
when the deadline was first imposed almost a year and a half ago.
Indeed, said Allen, those who wouuld like to ignore the court's
ruling entirely have been emboldened because April 1 will come and
go with the school buses still rolling. A group of more than two
dozen conservative House members are backing a law telling the
court to stay out of the schools. It is an effort supported in
principle by House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are among those who would like to see it said that the
court is wrong...that the court ought not to insert itself into the
center of the issue,'' said Rep. Warren Henderson, the House
Majority Whip.
</P>
<P>
   It will take not a law but a constitutional amendment to get the
courts out of the schools, however, Henderson said. The first
opportunity for voters to enact one comes in November, 2000. By
then the schools will have closed.

 &HT;    Web gives candidates' fund raising interactive edge
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In addition to a big win on election day, the
Georgia campaign of Gov. Roy Barnes engineered a lesser-known feat
in 1998: It produced a really cool Web site.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye-catching design and host of interactive features,
the site attracted loads of praise from the Internet political
junkies who actually study such things.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes site was also cutting edge for another reason.
Barnes' campaign was one of only about 20 nationwide that allowed
visitors to make online contributions with their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of the site may have been a winner, the
fund-raising aspect was largely a bust _ netting the campaign only
about $5,000 of some $11.7 million raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us look modern and allowed us to make a few digs at
our opponents,'' said campaign manager Bobby Kahn. ``But for fund
raising, it was not that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Elizabeth Dole, who boasts $50,000 in online
pledges the first two weeks after her Web site debuted on March 10.
Or George W. Bush, whose Web site is already wired for online
contributions. Or Lamar Alexander, one of the first politicians to
begin experimenting with online donations back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With fund raising a top priority in the crowded 2000
presidential campaign, most major candidates for president are
urging potential donors to contribute online to their campaigns.
Only Bush offers credit card contributions, the most direct method
of online giving.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the pack is poised to join in when the Federal
Election Commission rules on whether credit card donations are
eligible for federal matching funds of up to $250 per contribution.
The FEC is considering changing the long-standing prohibition at
the request of former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democratic
contender, and Internet giant America Online.
</P>
<P>
   An official at a leading manufacturer of online contribution
software, Phil Noble of PoliticsOnLine, predicts that 15 percent to
20 percent of all campaigns in 2000 will be raising money
electronically. He says presidential nominees have the potential to
raise several million dollars each online.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in e-commerce is fueling some of the rush to
online fund raising. Politicians and their handlers are
trend-watchers, and few have failed to take note of the billions
transacted on the Internet during the last holiday season alone.
</P>
<P>
   Competition, the name of the game in politics, is another
reason. No candidate wants to be perceived as behind the curve, or
at a disadvantage to his or her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the frenzy is also due to the fact that the Internet is,
well, the Internet _ the hot new frontier of the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's de rigueur in this cycle,'' says Eric Loeb, technology
chief with Net.Capitol, a political Internet consulting group.
``You need to get your tin cup out there early.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the new political fund-raising tool point to the
phenomenal success of Amazon.com and other online merchants who
have lured buyers to their sites to make purchases big and small.
</P>
<P>
   But buying a book online is different from sending money to a
political candidate, and that may help explain why expectations
about Internet fund raising haven't matched results.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person buys something online, you get the purchase a
few days later,'' says Brian Jones, the Web site coordinator for
Alexander, the former U.S. education secretary who is seeking the
GOP presidential nomination. ``When you contribute to a politician
online, what do you actually get? That's part of the mystery . . .
How do you make people feel like they are getting something for
their money?''
</P>
<P>
   Another limiting factor, inherent to all e-commerce, is that
many people do not feel comfortable sending out credit card
information over the Internet, even though most such transactions
are performed over encrypted, secure transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns themselves have also been less than aggressive in
marketing their Web sites, says Don Goff of the University of
Maryland, who studied Internet fund-raising in the 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can find the sites even if they are interested,'' says
Goff.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the presidential contenders this year appear to have
gotten that message and are aggressively promoting their sites as a
way to round up both volunteers and money. Forbes actually
announced his candidacy online, and Dole allowed the public to
catch an online simulcast of her announcement that an exploratory
group was being formed.
</P>
<P>
   But online contributing is also not without risks to the
candidate. Just ask Harlan Barnes, the Georgia governor's eldest
son and the Webmaster responsible for the governor's site.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Barnes says that every credit card contribution was
followed up with a telephone call before the transaction was
processed, to make sure the people contributing were who they said
they were.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes says he lived in fear that the campaign would get some
bogus contributions that would then somehow make their way into a
30-second attack ad against his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be the one to bring my dad down,'' Barnes
says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the inevitable technological snafus. For the
first several days that Alexander's Web site was up and running
this year, Web surfers who typed in the campaign's address,
lamaralexander.org, were instead connected to a nautical supplies
dealer in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, online contributing holds the potential to lure small
donors back into the political process, which continues to put a
premium on those donors who give the maximum allowable
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really encourages the right kind of contributions,'' says
Larry Makinson, director of the non-partisan Center for Responsive
Politics. ``You post your positions on your site. People evaluate
you and you send along a check. That should be the American way.''

 &HT;    Census expected to miss 5 million people as debate over tally
method continues
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Census Bureau begins its mammoth task of
counting the population a year from today, the best Americans can
expect from a nose-by-nose tally is not very good at all.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau expects to miss 5.1 million people of an estimated
population of 270 million. To put that number in perspective, it is
roughly equal to the population of Maryland and it is worse than
the results of the 1990 census, widely viewed as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the 1990 count, the 2000 census will miss a higher
proportion of Hispanics, African-Americans and other minorities
than whites.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has a proposal for finding most of those people, but
it is at the root of a years-long political controversy that is
threatening to derail, or at least delay, an undertaking that has
been compared in its complexity to putting a man on the Moon or
waging war.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this ongoing fight, Democrats are billing the census
as the next big test of civil rights. They argue that Republicans
prefer that minority groups remain disproportionately undercounted
because those groups tend to support Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real and great civil rights issue,'' said Commerce
Undersecretary Robert J. Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of mutual distrust, Republicans say they want
to count everyone just as much as the Democrats do.
</P>
<P>
   But they are leery of the Census Bureau's plan to make an
estimate of the population, no matter how scientific the method,
because they suspect the White House will attempt to manipulate
census numbers to benefit Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes they won't use it for political gain,'' said
Rich Galen, executive director of the Republican political
organization GOPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Census information is used to allocate the 435 seats in the
House of Representatives among the states, draw congressional and
other electoral districts within states and determine each state's
share of more than $180 billion in annual federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   The bickering between Democrats and Republicans is so bad that
Chief Justice William Rehnquist has issued a rare appeal to
Congress to keep funding for the federal judiciary out of the
dispute over the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judicial branch should not, and does not, have any role in
this debate, as the resolution of this issue very properly rests
with the political branches of government,'' Rehnquist wrote senior
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have complained bitterly about the Clinton
administration's failure to present a budget for the census over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had estimated that the census would cost $5
billion, but that was before a Jan. 25 Supreme Court ruling that
barred the bureau from using statistical sampling, a method of
scientific estimation, for purposes of apportioning congressional
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is adamant about using sampling for
redistricting and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But that means the Census Bureau actually will produce two
population numbers for every state _ one for divvying up
congressional seats, due Dec. 31, 2000, and another for everything
else, due April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the 1990 census look like a Sunday school
picnic,'' said Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee that controls funding for the census.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt told Rogers that the
later number will likely be more accurate, particularly with
respect to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are headed for a showdown, probably around the
middle of June, when funding runs out for the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the parties resolve the dispute over money, the
squabbling is certain to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Another wave of lawsuits awaits this controversial undertaking,
with the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation first in line.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of the public interest law firm, is
confident that the courts will find that sampling may not be used
for redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision came in a lawsuit filed by Glavin's
firm. The court specifically addressed only apportionment, a point
the administration has cited in going forward with plans for
sampling for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But Glavin said that earlier court decisions have used
apportionment and redistricting interchangably. Constitutional
requirements that the votes of American citizens count equally also
will lead courts to outlaw the use of estimates for redistricting,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he fears that if his firm files suit before Congress
provides funding for the census, a judge would rule the suit
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Glavin's position is ultimatley endorsed by the courts,
Shapiro, the Commerce official, sees no end in sight to the legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be litigating this for the next 10 years,'' he said.

CHINESE PRIME MINISTER PLANS MIT ADDRESS

<P>
   BOSTON -- Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji will give what is
being billed as a major address at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on April 14 as part of his widely anticipated US visit,
MIT said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While his other stops on the tour will be watched for what he
says about human rights, trade issues, and US allegations that
Chinese spies stole military secrets, MIT officials said Zhu's
speech at the nation's premier institute of science and technology
will outline his vision of how his country's creations in those
fields will move it toward a freer, more market-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's speech in Kresge Auditorium will be
broadcast around the world by CNN and in China by official
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we tend to think everything of importance tends
to be invented in the United States, and China looks like just a
big market to us,'' said Suzanne Berger, head of the MIT
International Science and Technology Initiative. ``We don't
understand that knowledge today is being created in many different
centers in the world, and China will be a major center. The Chinese
will be our colleagues, and they will also be a center of knowledge
creation. We're going to see big things coming out of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Zhu's US visit in mid-March came amid
tensions over a Chinese spy who the US government said stole
nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico to create miniature warheads for the Chinese. In a public
address before his country's legislature, Zhu said he anticipated
facing an ``anti-China wave'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at MIT came out of a visit by MIT president Charles
M. Vest to China in 1995, when Zhu was deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be extremely interesting as an economist, full
of ideas of moving the Chinese toward a more open, more
market-based economy,'' Vest said. ``We know China will have an
increasingly important world role in the creation of new
scientific, technological, and industrial activities. What we
understand he intends to address is science technology and
education in a global society, which would obviously be a very good
fit for the venue.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, through the program Berger directs, MIT has several
projects working with China on the development of technology,
particularly in education and the environment. For the past several
years, it has sent 30 students to China for the summer to connect
Chinese high schools to the World Wide Web, and other students to
work in Chinese labs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a blunt-speaking technocrat, Zhu is trained as an
electrical engineer, and has also been president of the Chinese
central bank.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's first major port privatization took place
in Veracruz, on the Gulf Coast. Mexico's construction giant ICA,
with no port experience, teamed up with the Philippine-based
stevedoring company International Container Services, to win a
50-year concession in 1995. The port vastly improved productivity
and service.
 &HT;    But a booming business is now causing chaos. Cargo volume _
growing an average of 20 percent per yearis beginning to outpace
the improvements, catching Veracruz port officials by surprise.
Rail privatization may make things even more hectic. This year, a
second privatized railroad begins offering service from Veracruz to
Mexico City via Puebla, where Volkswagen has its North American
manufacturing plant.
 &HT;    If port problems in Veracruz seem troubling, most of the rest of
Mexico's major ports are in far worse shape, mainly because only
six of the nation's 76 ports have been privatized.
 &HT;    Although it's hardly reached a state of crisis, blame for the
port problems rest with the Mexican government. Last year,
officials at Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transport
(SCT) promised that five concessions would be granted by the end of
the year. It never happened. More recently, Pedro Pablo Zepeda
Bermudez, who heads the SCT's Ports and Merchant Marine division,
said publicly that the agency was considering packaging 12 ports
for privatization, similar to the way Mexico's airports are slated
for privatization. Translation: more delays.
 &HT;    Ironically, with cargo volume rising, how new concessions are
granted may not be anywhere near as important as when the process
gets up and running. Consider: Between 1994 and 1997, cargo volume
grew an average of 8.4 percent per year. In 1998, an estimated 230
million tons of cargo were handled by the ports, says the SCT.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, even the few privatized ports struggle to handle the
boost in demand. On the Pacific Coast, Manzanillo is expecting a
big boost in cargo now that a new private railroad operator has
widened the tracks to accommodate ``double-stack trains'' on the
185-mile route to Guadalajara. Transportacion Maritima Mexicana
(TMM) and its partner Stevedoring Services of America, which won
the concession to operate the port, are busy ordering new cranes to
double capacity. While slumping Asian markets have eased pressure
on the port, construction in and around the port has already
started to fuel complaints about congestion.
 &HT;    Traffic may get worse. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (SWP), a
Canadian agribusiness giant with more than US$4 billion in annual
sales, is building a $27-million grain terminal with Mexican
partner, Conquistadora La Junta, in Manzanillo. Saskatchewan's CEO
Don Loewen is hoping that the new facility captures cargo traffic
from the ``golden triangle'' of business between Guadalajara,
Mexico City and Monterrey.
 &HT;    Even with the fears that perhaps things are getting a bit too
crazy, Peter Brink, the general manager of Operadora Portuaria de
Manzanillo, which operates the private container terminal joint
venture between TMM and Stevedoring, prefers to look at the bright
side. ``I think it's great for the port of Manzanillo,'' he says.
 &HT;    Back on the Gulf Coast, the concession for Altamira, built less
than 20 years ago as an industrial port to compensate for the aging
Tampico, went to Remaconst, a Mexican company. In January 1998,
Stevedore Cooper/T. Smith from Mobile, Alabama, began operation of
a new facility as the port expanded storage capacity to 100,000
cubic meters. But, in this case, lack of a rail link has hurt the
port's ability to service key chemical companies. With a new
railroad slated to arrive soon, port authorities hope to solve the
situation.
 &HT;    There is hope that the current situation could push Mexican
officials to get the concession process rolling again. Further
developments may remain mired amongst concerns about unsteady
global markets, Mexico's austerity plan and the prolonged
legislative battle over the budget.

<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. _ Dennis Carlson sold his first wheat, grown on a
field borrowed from his parents, in 1975, when he was 14 years old.
He earned $4.51 a bushel and resolved to follow his father,
grandfather and great-grandfather into farming.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 24 years later, spring wheat is selling for $2.91 a
bushel, and Carlson worries whether he can afford to plant next
month. ``We're going to get a low price,'' he said. ``And if we get
a bumper crop, it's going to get lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered by sinking commodity prices and rising costs, Carlson
and other wheat farmers are looking across the Canadian border at a
crop they say could help save them _ if only it were legal. That
crop is hemp, a non-intoxicating look-alike cousin of marijuana
grown around the world for its fiber, seed and oil. But long
identified with marijuana both by law enforcement and the
counterculture, it is banned in the United States as part of the
war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As farmers from Hawaii to North Dakota to Vermont lobby state
legislatures to study hemp's potential and make it legal, they are
opposed by federal officials unwilling to relax drug laws even
symbolically, whether by endorsing marijuana's medical use, or
approving a once-common crop, hemp.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the White House's Office of National Drug
Control Policy asserted that making hemp legal would send the wrong
message, ``especially to our youth at a time when adolescent drug
use is rising.'' But in late March its director, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, indicated in an interview that his opposition was
softening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people believe that hemp fiber can be sold in the
marketplace for a profit, and aren't actually trying to normalize
the growing of marijuana around America, to the extent you want to
grow hemp fiber we'd be glad to work with you,'' McCaffrey said.
But as a profitable crop, he said, ``I think it's going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But in North Dakota, where the Republican-controlled Legislature
appears likely to enact laws promoting hemp, Carlson said: ``We're
all desperate. We're trying to find something that will change our
outlook, and hemp is one of many crops.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not help that hemp remains identified with the
counterculture, its products _ from oils to clothing _ often sold
in shops that sell rolling papers, pipes and other drug
paraphernalia, its cause cheered on by marijuana advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our worst enemies,'' said Gale Glenn, a tobacco
grower in Winchester, Ky. ``If marijuana didn't exist, hemp would
be growing here on hundreds of thousands of acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to revive hemp passed in Hawaii this month and has
been introduced in legislatures in North Dakota, Montana,
Minnesota, Virginia, Vermont and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Controlled Substances Act says the government does
not intend to prevent states from legislating in this area. But
even with state approval, hemp growers would need permits from the
Drug Enforcement Administration, which so far has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's widespread bipartisan support for this becoming a crop
in North Dakota,'' state Sen. Joel Heitkamp said. ``The problem is
at the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Monson, a farmer and school superintendent who
sponsored the North Dakota legislation, said, ``I think 99 percent
of the people in my district, when you show them the bottom line,
they're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After Canada made hemp legal a year ago, about 5,000 acres were
planted with hemp, said Geof Kime, president of Hempline, a hemp
growing and processing company in Delaware, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Monson recalled watching his neighbor across the border in
Manitoba grow 23 acres of hemp that netted about $250 an acre.
``When he came out with all those profits, we were really upset,''
Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   The harvested hemp can be imported into the United States for
processing, ``but we can't grow it ourselves,'' said Jeffrey Gain,
who promotes the revival of hemp as a director of the North
American Industrial Hemp Council.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp flourished as a cash crop through most of American history.
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp on their
plantations. The Declaration of Independence was drafted on
hemp-fiber paper. Hemp supplied early Americans with rope, sails,
clothing and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1937, Congress enacted a ban on marijuana that came to
encompass hemp. During World War II, after imports of Manila hemp
from the Philippines were cut off, the government distributed seeds
for farmers to grow in a ``Hemp For Victory'' drive, but once the
war ended, hemp was banned again. By then, synthetic fibers like
nylon were taking its place.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists describe hemp as a renewable, biodegradable
resource that can be used in paper, fabrics, building material and
even automobile moldings. Farmers say it is a crop that needs few
pesticides, shades out weeds, resists erosion _ and can make money.
``This is not a panacea,'' Mrs. Glenn said, ``but it's one of the
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mahlberg, a cell biologist at Indiana University, has a
license from the DEA to grow experimental marijuana and hemp. He
described them as varieties of cannabis sativa, a species whose
cell structure he has studied for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had hemp and marijuana here and set it on the table,
could you tell the difference?'' he said. ``The answer is no, not
in young ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``When you're growing it in the field and it's
planted, you can.'' Each, he said, could easily be identified from
the air.

REVOLUTION STRIKER SAVARESE HAS FOOT X-RAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution lost another key player, at least
temporarily, Wednesday. Striker Giovanni Savarese was taken to
Newton-Wellesley Hospital for X-rays on his right ankle after being
taken down by a sliding, two-footed tackle in a practice game
against the New Hampshire Phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese was felled in the third minute, and the match at Babson
College, in Wellesley, was suspended by Revolution coach Walter
Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid he will miss Saturday's game in Kansas City, but I
hope not,'' Zenga said. ``I want to have a friendly game every
week, but losing one player is enough for me to say a match is
finished. I hope this will not be repeated in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution seemed most displeased with the Phantoms'
comportment after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese and Johnny Torres were approaching the New Hampshire
goal when Phantom defender Willie Schweitzer took down Savarese on
the edge of the penalty area. Savarese screamed as he fell and
Revolution trainer Mike Fritz arrived for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell it was going to get out of hand,'' Revolution
forward Joe-Max Moore said. ``It was a two-footed tackle over the
ball and there is no need for that. You can end someone's career
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may think a game like this is an opportunity to show what
they can do. I'm sure some of their players would love an
opportunity to play in the MLS, and they might try to catch
Walter's eye. But there is no need to overdo it. When Gio was on
the ground, they were saying, `Tell your trainer to get him off the
field,' so they could keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams are scheduled to be rematched next Wednesday. The
Revolution faced the Rhode Island Stingrays last week, and
assistant general manager Joe Cummings said the midweek matches
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this is the last bad thing that happens to us,'' Zenga
said. ``Gio is important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution lost Imad Baba (groin surgery) during preseason
training in Italy and John Harkes (right knee ligament) while
preparing for the opening match against Miami. Edwin Gorter
(suspension) is scheduled to return for the April 10 home opener
against D.C. United. And Kris Kelderman suffered a slight knee
injury and practiced only briefly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Savarese recovers, the Revolution might retain the
defensive strategy that nearly produced a victory at Miami. They
led from the 22-second mark, when Savarese set a Major League
Soccer record for fastest goal after the opening kickoff, until
Tyrone Marshall tied the score in the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Though the team needs to develop the capacity to impose its
defensive will on the opposition, there will be a need for more
midfield possession and more offensive production. The Revolution
have been constructed to emphasize substance over style, but they
simply are not equipped for a perpetual battle of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second game should be better,'' Moore said. ``We need to
string some things together better.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore appeared in his first opener after injuries prevented him
from starting the season in 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense was excellent and that was nice to
see,'' Moore said. ``It was better than giving up five or six
goals, like Walter said. But when we get our full team healthy we
are going to be a good team, and that will happen at some point in
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season and there is time for everything to click.
After the next game we should have a better idea of what to
expect.''

 BISMARCK, N.D.: the air. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hemp is densely planted and grown as tall as 15 feet to develop
the stalks and kill off leaves. By contrast, marijuana plants are
short, bushy and spaced three to four feet apart to encourage the
leaves and flowers that deliver the psychoactive ingredient delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol, popularly called THC. Hemp is also harvested
before it flowers, and marijuana afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Both varieties have THC: Industrial hemp has less than 1 percent
THC by weight, rendering it ineffectual as a drug, while marijuana
contains 5 percent THC or more by weight. Canada and some European
countries require cultivated hemp to have a THC content of 0.3
percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're working for now is to produce a zero-percent THC,''
Mahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, neglected hemp has degenerated into a feral
remnant called ditch weed, with low THC content. ``There's a
standing joke in our corner of the state that no self-respecting
marijuana smoker would touch the stuff,'' said state Sen. Russell
Thane of North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Thane said National Guardsmen and law-enforcement officials
spend weekends uprooting ditch weed. ``It's probably a poor
utilization of time,'' he said. ``You don't have anybody coming
from around the United States to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the state auditor's office determined that 78
percent of the marijuana reported eradicated in the state, and 99
percent destroyed nationwide with federal funds, in 1996 was ditch
weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eradication is somewhat misdirected because they're
destroying remnants of the old hemp,'' Mahlberg said. ``Some of the
hemp they're destroying is close to zero THC.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials argue that marijuana could be hidden
in hemp fields. But hemp would actually be a weapon against
marijuana, Mahlberg said, because cross-pollinating with hemp would
dilute marijuana's potency.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, marijuana pollen could also affect hemp. But hemp
planted in quantity _ Canada requires at least 10 acres _ would
overwhelm marijuana. Andy Graves, a farmer who heads the Kentucky
Hemp Growers Cooperative, a group trying to make hemp legal again,
said marijuana growers would find hemp farmers ``their worst
nightmare, because our pollens will cross.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by Graves' group
challenging the government's ban on hemp, because Kentucky state
law forbids it too. But with their tobacco quotas slashed 28.8
percent this year, some farmers are giving hemp another look.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of our income is down the drain because of the
quota,'' Dorothy Robertson, a farmer in Bethel, Ky., said.
``Farmers have their backs against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco earns more money, but diversifying into hemp makes sense
to farmers because it could be processed locally, creating more
work. Tribby Vice, a tobacco and dairy farmer in Fleming County,
Ky., said hemp would provide healthy bedding for his 80 cows and
would make a good rotational crop. ``The equipment we have for
tobacco we can take and use for hemp,'' he said. ``We don't have to
go out and buy new equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers said they could live with the kind of controls that
other countries impose. Canada requires that every hemp farmer have
a license and police background check, use seed certified to
produce 0.3 percent THC, report the precise location of his crop
and open it for random inspection, Kime said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, Carlson said, ``If there's been any group of
people who've been against drugs, it's the farmers. And if hemp
becomes legal, we'll make sure that marijuana won't get in there.''

RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC WOES MAY AID U.S. EMISSIONS GOALS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and other industrial countries
may find it easier and cheaper than expected to comply with a
proposed treaty to fight global warming, thanks largely to reduced
fuel consumption in Russia, the government's energy forecasting
agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the agreement on global warming allows international
trading of pollution credits as a way to control emissions of
heat-trapping greenhouse gases like those that come from burning
fossil fuels, more of the cuts that the treaty seeks may come from
the former Soviet Union and less from the United States, the Energy
Information Administration said in its annual long-range forecast.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that the United States, the world's leading
source of greenhouse gases, could meet the treaty's targets without
completely reversing its recent increases in emissions, which have
grown along with energy use as the domestic economy blossomed. But
substantial reductions in emissions would still be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, negotiated in Kyoto in 1997 and signed last year
by the Clinton administration, has not been ratified by the Senate,
where it faces significant opposition from lawmakers who say it
would be too costly and would cause disruptive cuts in energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol calls for the United States to cut its
emissions of greenhouse gases within 10 to 15 years to a level 7
percent below its emissions in 1990. Emissions in 1997 were 10
percent above the 1990 level and the energy agency has forecast
that by 2010 they will be 33 percent above the 1990 level unless
measures are imposed to reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the United States and some other countries continue
to burn more fossil fuels and to emit more carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas, Russia and its neighbors are burning and emitting
less than previously forecast, the agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, countries that give off more greenhouse gases
than the treaty allows may buy surplus reductions from countries
that give off less than their targets. Estimates of eventual cost
of these credits vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   The energy agency said that the continuing depression in Russia
and other former Soviet states is holding down energy use and will
probably produce a huge bubble of emissions credits by the time the
treaty is supposed to come into force, between 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The expected emissions of carbon dioxide in Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union in the year 2010 are likely to be 13
percent lower than predicted last year, the new forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   These countries will have at least 374 million metric tons worth
of carbon credits available to sell to other countries, it said.
Last year, the agency had forecast that these countries would have
only 196 million metric tons of carbon credits. (Under the treaty,
emissions of all greenhouse gases are tallied in units of carbon,
one of the elements released when fossil fuels are burned.)
</P>
<P>
   For countries like the United States whose emissions are growing
far beyond the limits set by the treaty, the change is significant.
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet the targets of the Kyoto Protocol,
industrialized countries would need to eliminate about 822 million
metric tons of carbon from their anticipated emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industrialized nations that have agreed to carbon
emissions caps can purchase these credits, this level of trading
alone would allow their carbon emission levels to rise by an
average of 7 percent over 1990 levels, and still meet the
protocol's average emissions target of 7 percent below 1990
levels,'' the energy agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the agency said, carbon emissions are expected to be
39 percent greater in 2010 than they were in 1990. While that is 4
percent less than the agency predicted last year, it suggests that
the world as a whole is doing far less than needed to head off the
risks of global warming.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ La primera privatizacion de un puerto
mexicano importante fue la de Veracruz. ICA, el gigante mexicano de
la construccion, sin experiencia alguna en materia de puertos, se
unio con la empresa filipina International Container Services, y
ganaron una concesion a 50 anos en 1995. El resultado fue un
aumento serio de la productividad y los servicios.
 &HT;    Pero eso ha llevado a una especie de caos: El volumen de carga
(que crece a un promedio del 20 por ciento anual) comienza a
superar la capacidad y la privatizacion de los ferrocarriles ha
hecho la situacion aun mas caotica. Este ano un segundo ferrocarril
privatizado ha comenzado a ofrecer servicio entre Veracruz y la
Ciudad de Mexico, a traves de Puebla, donde Volkswagen tiene una
planta de manufactura.
 &HT;    Y si los problemas del puerto de Veracruz parecen serios, la
mayoria del resto de los puertos mexicanos esta mucho peor,
simplemente por que solo seis de los 76 puertos del pais han sido
privatizados.
 &HT;    Aunque la situacion no es critica, la culpa recae sobre el
gobierno de Mexico. En 1998 la Secretaria de Comunicaciones y
Transporte prometio que para finales de ese ano se otorgarian cinco
concesiones. Pero no fue asi. Mas recientemente, Pedro Pablo Zepeda
Bermudez, director de la division de Puertos y Marina Mercante de
la Secretaria, dijo en publico que la entidad estudiaba la
posibilidad de privatizar 12 puertos en conjunto, lo que se ha
traducido en mas demoras.
 &HT;    Ironicamente, dado el aumento del volumen de carga,
probablemente lo importante no sea como se otorguen las nuevas
concesiones sino cuando se inicia en realidad el proceso.
Considerese que entre 1994 y 1997 el volumen de carga crecio un
promedio del 8,4 por ciento anual. En 1998, los puertos mexicanos
manejaron unos 230 millones de toneladas de carga, segun la
Secretaria.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, incluso los pocos puertos privatizados batallan
por hacer frente al aumento del trafico. En la costa del Pacifico,
Manzanillo espera un fuerte aumento del volumen de carga ahora que
un nuevo operador privado de ferrocarriles ha ensanchado la via
para acomodar trenes mas anchos en la via a Guadalajara, de casi
300 kilometros. Por su parte, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana
(TMM) y su socio Stevedoring Services of America, que ganaron la
concesion de operacion del puerto, han tenido que comprar mas gruas
para duplicar la capacidad. Aunque la retraccion de los mercados
asiaticos ha aliviado un tanto la presion sobre el puerto de
Manzanillo, las labores de construccion en el puerto y sus
alrededores ya han comenzado a generar protestas sobre la
congestion.
 &HT;    Y no hay senales de que el trafico se alivie. Saskatchewan Wheat
Pool (SWP), un gigante de la agricultura con mas de US$4.000
millones anuales en ventas, construye en Manzanillo una terminal de
granos de US$27 millones con su socio mexicano Conquistadora. Don
Loewen, presidente ejecutivo de SWP, espera que la nueva
instalacion logre adjudicarse parte de la actividad de carga
proveniente del llamado triangulo de oro, que forman Guadalajara,
la Ciudad de Mexico y Monterrey.
 &HT;    A pesar de los temores de que quizas la situacion empeore, Peter
Brink, gerente general de Operadora Portuaria de Manzanillo, que
opera la terminal de contenedores de TMM y Stevedoring, prefiere
mirar solo el lado bueno de las cosas. ``Creo que [lo que sucede
sera de gran beneficio para el puerto de Manzanillo,'' dice.
 &HT;    De regreso a la costa del Golfo de Mexico, la concesion de
Altamira, construida hace menos de 20 anos en calidad de puerto
industrial para compensar las desventajas de Tampico, fue a parar a
manos de Remaconst, una empresa mexicana. En enero de 1997,
Stevedore Cooper/T. Smith, de Mobile, Alabama, comenzo a operar una
nueva instalacion cuando el puerto ampliaba su capacidad de
almacenaje a 100.000 metros cubicos. Pero la falta de servicio
ferrocarrilero ha impedido que el puerto preste buenos servicios a
importantes empresas del sector quimico. Las autoridades esperan
resolver la situacion.
 &HT;    Ademas, hay esperanzas de que la situacion obligue al gobierno a
reiniciar el otorgamiento de concesiones. Aunque el desarrollo a
corto plazo pudiera sufrir ante la inestabilidad de los mercados
mundiales, al plan de austeridad de Mexico y a la prolongada
batalla legislativa sobre el presupuesto.

 &HT;    Positive opinions of Milosevic take drastic turn
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ To some of the people who came in contact with
him in 1995, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic deserved some
credit for coming to Dayton and negotiating the Dayton Peace Accord
that ended the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb attack on the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo
has caused opinions about Milosevic to undergo an abrupt change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure have changed my mind,'' said Dieter Krug, who hosted
Milosevic and the rest of the negotiators at a dinner in 1995 at
his restaurant, l'Auberge, in Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions speak for themselves,'' said Krug. ``This shooting
and killing of innocent women and children is very bad. I hope they
come to their senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was more visible around Dayton during the talks than
either Croatian President Franjo Tudjman or Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic. The Serbian leader dined in local restaurants, hung
out at Packy's Sports Bar at the Hope Hotel at Wright Patterson Air
Force Base and shopped for shoes at the Fairfield Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Waszczak did not actually meet Milosevic but observed him
from close range.
</P>
<P>
   Then a student at Greenon High School, Waszczak, with John Kim,
won an essay contest and a trip to Paris for the signing of the
accord in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a peacemaker then,'' said Waszczak, from
Pennsylvania where she is now in college. ``Now from what I see on
television he seems very stubborn, very hard-headed. It seems like
he wanted a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Elinor Sluzas owned the Amber Rose, which
delivered Eastern European food to Wright- Pat during the talks.
Sluzas is of Lithuanian ancestry and talks to many people with
Eastern European backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to others talk, I've seen opinions change
dramatically,'' Sluzas said. ``They see a man overwhelmed by power.
When any country is fighting a holy war, nobody wins.''

   VUKOVAR, Croatia _ This ruined city beside the Danube is as good
a place as any to meditate on the years of misery and
score-settling that may lie ahead when the Serbian campaign in
Kosovo ends.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight and a half years ago, in the first great atrocity
of his assorted Yugoslav wars, forces commanded by Slobodan
Milosevic destroyed Vukovar in order to ``liberate'' it for Serbs.
First his forces shelled and bombed this town of 50,000 into rubble
over the course of three months. When Croatian residents finally
surrendered, hundreds of exhausted fighters, many of them badly
wounded and crowded into a hospital, were taken outside of town,
shot and buried in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as in Kosovo now, the Serbian offensive was dressed up in
nationalist oratory. After conquering this city in the fall of
1991, Serbian generals bused in the world's press, showed off
scores of mutilated bodies, served lunch in a hotel perforated with
artillery shells and blamed the ghastly mess on the Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask you to see the fate of Vukovar as the
reincarnation of fascism,'' a Yugoslav Army colonel explained at
the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   This style of savage ethnic war and stone-age public relations
later shifted to Bosnia and is now apparently under way in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mass graves are still being dug up here. Vacant lots and
farmland are still seeded with land mines. Inside the city, trees
and shrubbery are growing up through the ruins of thousands of
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment approaches 90 percent. Nearly every young person
with a marketable skill has fled Vukovar, once a prosperous,
architecturally significant and ethnically mixed city where
marriage between Serbs and Croats was common.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who live here, squeezed by ethnic hostility and
economic hardship, are now fleeing Vukovar in droves. Efforts by
European nations to halt the Serbs' exodus and preside over ethnic
reintegration of the town are, for the most part, failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have war, and then you cannot re-establish the
conditions for a normal society,'' said Nikolai Ratsiborinsky, a
Russian who is deputy director of the Vukovar office for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He said about
47,000 Serbs have moved away from the Vukovar area since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's victory in Vukovar was as temporary as it was
destructive. In this way, it fits into his decade-old pattern of
starting off strong in ethnic war but quickly losing all conquered
territories. Yet, by the measure that he seems to care most about,
Vukovar-style losses have been valuable. They allowed him to fire
up his propaganda machine in Belgrade, inflame nationalist
sentiment inside Serbia and keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo, which for the past week has pitted Milosevic
against the military might of the Western world, seems to fit this
pattern of conflicts that are hugely destructive and militarily
untenable but politically useful.
</P>
<P>
   As headlines and television cameras chase new ethnic violence,
the long-term human costs of his win-by-losing wars are easy to
overlook. But Vukovar, perhaps more than any single city in what
used to be Yugoslavia, testifies to the suffering, penury and
ethnic resentment that seem certain to percolate for years in the
lives of those who do not die in Milosevic's wars.
</P>
<P>
   This city was returned in January 1998 to the control of
Croatia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
supervises a police force here that is split almost evenly between
Serbian and Croatian officers. It has managed to stop ethnic
killing. The Croatian government and the European Union are busy
rebuilding houses, erecting street lights and stringing lines for
electricity and phones.
</P>
<P>
   But the sorting out of political control, the tentative
beginnings of reconstruction and the departure of wild-eyed young
men with automatic weapons have not come close to making Vukovar
livable.
</P>
<P>
   The city is ugly beyond imagining, with rotting mattresses and
rain-blackened lampshades and soggy piles of clothing still resting
in 8-year-old heaps inside shell-shattered houses that line nearly
every street. Everywhere one turns there are brick walls perforated
by artillery shells that cut holes the size of small cars. It is
difficult to find a surface that is not pockmarked with the spray
of shrapnel from mortars and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The only institutions that function _ hospitals, churches,
hotels, markets _ are ones that have been rebuilt, almost always
with money from the Croatian government or countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats alike, agreed in
interviews that it is difficult to find a good reason for living in
this graveyard of a city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever can leave leaves, because the economy is horrible,''
said Nikola, 21, a Serb who would not give his last name. ``Serbs
also leave because they are afraid. I am planning to go to Canada
as soon as I can find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Vukovar was one of the most ethnically
integrated cities in Croatia: about one-third Croat, one-third Serb
and the rest a mix of other ethnic groups. Intermarriage was
particularly widespread.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative harmony that prevailed here since World War II
was upset in the late 1980s by a flare-up of Croatian nationalism.
Just as ethnic Albanians in Kosovo pressed the Serbian minority in
that province of Serbia in the 1980s, so did Croats here frighten
and anger the Serbian minority here in what was then a republic in
the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases Milosevic used that fear to whip up nationalist
anger inside Serbia and solidify his political power. His forces
then responded to what was going on _ in Vukovar just as in Kosovo
_ in a manner vastly out of proportion to the threat against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Vukovar, though, was not simply a matter of Serbian
aggression. Like nearly everything in the Yugoslav wars, it was
more complicated, more devious than that. President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia chose not to defend the city, apparently calculating
that the destruction of such a photogenic community would win
international sympathy for his country.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the battle of Vukovar ended in the late fall of
1991, about 80,000 Croats had been forced to flee. They did not
start to return in any numbers until last year, after agreements
that saw Serbian forces surrender control of Vukovar first to U.N.
peacekeepers, then to the Croatian government under supervision
from European governments. The State Department said on Tuesday
that a similar transfer of power to ethnic Albanians is likely to
occur in Kosovo when the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Vukovar, however, is that Milosevic's style of war
makes it exceedingly difficult to rebuild healthy multiethnic
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reintegration of hearts and minds has not happened,'' said
Ratsiborinsky, the monitoring official. ``Serbs here look to
Belgrade for leadership.''

 VUKOVAR, Croatia: for leadership.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He said, too, that the Croatian government has found it
politically impossible to devote much money to rebuilding the
damaged houses of Serbs. Nearly all of that money, indeed much of
the reconstruction in Vukovar, has benefited Croats, not Serbs. The
European Union and individual European nations have tried to alter
that formula and, in return, are accused by Croatian leaders of
being pro-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite considerable investment by the Croatian government,
Vukovar and its surrounding villages have not become especially
attractive to Croats. Of the 80,000 who fled the area, Western
diplomats estimate, only about 15,000 or so have returned. Those
who do return are mostly older people without children.
</P>
<P>
   Stana Dakonca, 30, a married physical therapist with two young
children, is an exception. A Croat, she came back to Vukovar last
year after nearly seven years of living as a refugee in a hotel on
the Adriatic. She returned, she said, because the government
promised her and her husband jobs and promised to help rebuild her
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed after coming back to this place,'' Mrs.
Dakonca said. ``The state promised many things. But I cannot find a
job. My husband works for an electrical company that has not paid
his salary for six months. The state said it would help with fixing
the house, but it hasn't given us any money yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for reintegrating with her Serbian neighbors, Mrs. Dakonca
called that a dream of the West. ``Croats and Serbs have virtually
no contact, as far as I can see,'' she said. ``We avoid each other,
especially now that NATO is attacking Serbia. No normal life will
ever return here, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring officials and representatives of the European
countries that are spending millions to rebuild Vukovar say such
pessimism will fade if the economy improves before all the Serbs
move out.
</P>
<P>
   But, ominously, these officials are much more pessimistic about
post-war prospects for a multiethnic future in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumbered Serbs nine-to-one before the exodus of
refugees began last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a mixed society before the war and that is not the
case in Kosovo,'' Ratsiborinsky said. ``Serbs will not be able to
stay in Kosovo after the war. It will be much worse than here.''

FOUR N.Y. OFFICERS INDICTED IN SHOOTING OF AFRICAN IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton stepped to the microphone
outside the Bronx County Couthouse and bellowed: ``The police in
there have just been charged with murder in the second degree,''
and the crowd of hundreds whooped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time ever that a New York City police officer
has been indicted for murder, according to prosecutors and police
spokesmen, though a few have faced manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one
for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white
officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in
the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of
his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, and
Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000
for each officer, which was expected to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Police commissioner Howard Safir suspended the officers from the
force immediately after announcement of the indictment, which was
returned by a grand jury last week but officially unsealed just
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next could intensify, rather than quell, the racial
tensions that have been simmering in the two months since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictment coincided with the start of jury
selection in the trial of the five officers in Brooklyn who were
indicted in last year's torture and sodomy, inside a stationhouse
bathroom, of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The Louima trial, too, is bound to be perceived _ and treated _
as a showcase of the dark underbelly of the N.Y.P.D. Potential
jurors have been instructed to fill out a 42-page questionnaire,
asking 128 questions, such as ``Do you think there is a prospect of
social unrest following a verdict in this case?'' and ``Have you
ever been exposed to persons who show, or who have shown, racial,
sexual, religious, or ethnic prejudice?'' and ``How would you rate
the job the New York City Police Department is doing in dealing
with crime?''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case has spawned three official investigations _ by
the US Justice Department, federal prosecutors, and the New York
state attorney general _ into a possible pattern of racial
discrimination in the department's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some police are shouting back. A few hundred off-duty
officers rallied outside the Bronx courthouse Wednesday, as well,
some shouting, ``No justice, no police'' _ a threatening play on
Sharpton's chant, ``No justice, no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, though, the atmosphere was solemn. The
four officers, wearing suits, sat stonefaced. Among the spectators,
on one side of the aisle were Diallo's parents, who had flown in
from Guinea for the occasion, along with friens and relatives. On
the other side were friends of the officers. There were no
outbursts. Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who is representing
Diallo's parents, announced he will sue the city for civil damages,
saying, ``We will be relentless in our pursuit of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting has set off the largest protests the city
has seen in years _ and cast a serious blemish on the pride of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's five years as mayor. Crime has
dramatically declined, with murders down by over 70 percent, to the
lowest point since the early 1960s. But many people are now
wondering if the social cost _ white officers behaving too
aggressively and intrusively in minority neighborhoods _ might be
too high.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15 days leading up to Wednesday's indictment, 1,203 people
_ including prominent officials, lawyers and other professionals of
all races and religions _ were arrested in Sharpton-led
civil-disobedience protests outside police department headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Those protests are now over, but Sharpton promised Wednesday,
``We will keep on marching, we will keep the pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides Wednesday offered previews of the cases
they will argue when the trial starts April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson noted New York law does
not require him to prove premeditation on the part of the four
officers. Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with
intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved
indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in
conduct which created a grave risk of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers called their clients ``political
prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy,
not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to
believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired. One lawyer
said his client, Richard Murphy, did not fire until he saw McMellon
fall. McMellon had slipped on the sidewalk, but Murphy thought, his
lawyer said, that he had been shot.

COMMENTARY: FINDING WHAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The conflict between police and large segments of the
community in New York City is worsening, not easing. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir have made the
unsettling and potentially very divisive suggestion that a recent
slight increase in homicides may somehow be linked to the protests
against police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hundreds of angry cops, nearly all of them white,
chanted ``no justice, no police'' as they marched in the Bronx in
support of the four officers who shot Amadou Diallo. The marchers
contended that the killing of Diallo was a tragedy but not a crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, protesters carrying signs that said ``Arrest
Giuliani'' marched outside the courthouse in the Bronx where the
officers who killed Diallo were arraigned on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   And in Brooklyn this week the trial of the officers accused of
brutalizing Abner Louima got under way in federal District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The din of dangerously escalating hostilities has nearly drowned
out some very sensible comments and suggestions being made by U.S.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who describes himself as a ``friend
of law enforcement and of the minority community.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech he delivered on the Senate floor last week, Schumer
said it was wrong to judge all cops by the bad behavior of a few
and that ``there are men, women and children, black and white,
alive today because of the work of the New York City Police
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added, ``But what we all must realize is that the
momentous drop in crime and the model behavior of many officers
does not undo the plain truth that black men and women in New York
City who have never broken the law and who should have absolutely
no reason to fear law enforcement are all too often hassled and
made to feel like lawbreakers.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week the senator said he wanted to come up
with some ``doable things'' that would prevent catastrophes like
the attack on Louima and the killing of Diallo, while contributing
to the successful fight against crime and insuring that law-abiding
New Yorkers are treated with respect by police.
</P>
<P>
   He had several suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   He said police officers who are a clear threat to the public
should be quickly weeded out. ``It was well known among the police
that Justin Volpe (one of the officers accused of attacking Louima)
was a bad, bad seed with multiple complaints against him,'' Schumer
said. But nothing was done about Volpe until his encounter with
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said another ``obvious'' step that should be taken is
the recruitment of many more police officers from ethnic minority
groups. ``When mostly white cops patrol high-density, minority
neighborhoods, resentment is bound to follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator noted that he and the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood of
the East Brooklyn Congregations have established a program to
recruit and train police officer candidates who will agree to serve
in precincts in their local neighborhoods for at least five years.
Similar efforts should be undertaken, he said, including an
expansion of the city's police cadet corps, which has been
neglected by the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also recommended that New York take a close look at
a program that has had great success in Boston. The crime rate in
Boston has plunged as dramatically as it has in New York, but
because of a cooperative program worked out between the Police
Department and a group of activist ministers, tensions between
police and the city's ethnic minorities have not escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston model will work in New York,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another program worth looking at, he said, is the one developed
by the military to deal with the racial hostilities that erupted in
the ranks during the Vietnam era. A number of police departments,
working with the military, have adopted variations of that very
successful program, Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Constructive steps need to be taken now to end the divisiveness
that is threatening to inflict long-term harm on New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can bring these communities together,'' Schumer said. ``I
want to find what works and then get people to do it.''

RAYTHEON E-MAIL QUEST RAISES ONLINE SECURITY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. has broadened its probe of on-line messages by
employees over the World Wide Web, creating an early test of how
far Internet service providers will go to protect the anonymity of
their users.
</P>
<P>
   A Massachusetts judge recently granted motions requested by
Raytheon demanding information from America Online, Microsoft
Corp., Earthlink Network Inc., and several other service companies
about customers Raytheon suspects posted private company
information on a Web site operated by Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon alleges the employees' actions caused more than $25,000
in damages and has vowed to take steps to discipline the workers _
if it can identify them. However, the posts were made mostly under
pseudonyms such as ``Raytheonveteran'' and ``Jimbo255.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of their real names, the Lexington, Mass. defense
contractor has sued 21 users it calls ``John Does'' in a case now
pending in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court while the company
attempts to discover their true identity.
</P>
<P>
   But while Yahoo has complied with Raytheon's demand for
discovery, according to people familiar with the matter, other
service providers have different policies designed to give stronger
protections to people who chat on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, for example, notified customers who were subject to
Raytheon's demand for information and gave them up to 14 days to
seek to block the motion. ``It's only fair,'' said Rich D'Amato, a
spokesman for the Dulles, Va., company. A spokesman for Earthlink,
based in Southern California, also said the company wouldn't
automatically comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis,'' said
the spokesman. ``People have certain rights that have to be
respected and balanced'' against Raytheon's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments show how Raytheon's actions have led it into an
uncharted area of on-line law, Internet specialists say. While the
company says it is only trying to staunch leaks, lawyers say that
its actions conflict with public expectations that companies will
respect their anonymity on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People consistently expect to enjoy more anoymity than in fact
they do when the rubber meets the road,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a
Harvard Law School Internet specialist. ``Those Raytheon employees
are probably thinking now they might shop around'' for service that
provides more anonymity than Yahoo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time they went into the Yahoo chat board, it probably
wasn't on their mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel this sense of invincibility because they're
posting anonymously, and they shouldn't,'' said Charles L.
Solomont, a partner at the Boston law firm of Bingham Dana who is
pursuing a simliar case involving anonymous chat about a Canadian
videoconferencing company.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's case centers on postings to a financial message board
maintained by Yahoo Inc., the California-based company best known
for its search engine used to locate sites on the Web. The message
board, billed as a discussion forum about Raytheon's stock, has
also become a center of much heated discussion about management
issues and the policies of the company's various employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Raytheon alleges that various employees posted
messages disclosing private company matters such as manpower,
profits, and bid proposals, in violation of company policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of these breaches of duty and other violations of
law by the defendants, Raytheon has suffered injury, including harm
to its business reputation,'' Raytheon's complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one person identified on the chat board only as
``Rtn RIF'' wrote on Oct. 21, 1998, that investors should ``NOT
look for RTN to hit 4Q estimates of $1.08,'' becuase of certain
accounting adjustments. In another posting, on Sept 3, 1998, a
person identified as ``Snobawl98'' wrote that ``Our stock is in for
a further slide to 35!! Due to info I have privy to about some our
booking problems I sold at 57! Thank goodness!''
</P>
<P>
   But other messages cited by Raytheon seem more innocuous. ``We
sure aren't doing that great with the current FAA contracts,'' one
poster wrote, referring to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Raytheon's new chief executive ``is going to drive the stock under
50.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing such messages, many critics both within Raytheon and
outside the company say the company's intent in taking legal action
was to silence dissent on its message boards. James George, a
private investigator in Haverhill, Mass. who often monitors Yahoo's
financial chat groups on behalf of law firms, said he suspects the
lack of protections by Internet service providers make it easy for
Raytheon to silence its employees without having to prove their
words actually caused damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have a lot of (angry) people, and they don't
see any downside if they can just keep them quiet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in Wednesday's Boston Herald, a Raytheon
vice president has resigned after Raytheon identified him as the
source of some of the postings. The executive and his lawyer didn't
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon declined to discuss the matter or how it identified the
executive. Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for Yahoo Inc., denied the
Herald's report that Yahoo said it would comply with Raytheon's
demand for information.
</P>
<P>
   However, people familiar with the matter indicated that Yahoo
did provide data to Raytheon. Participants on Yahoo chat boards are
required to create an on-screen identity, and to provide Yahoo with
limited personal information _ just an e-mail address will do.
Since that e-mail address is not always included on public postings
on the chat boards, Raytheon sought and obtained those addresses
from Yahoo, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The demands for further information were filed by Raytheon's
attorneys on March 5, about a month after Raytheon's initial case,
and were granted by a judge shortly thereafter. In an affidavit,
Raytheon lawyer Jeffrey C. Morgan of the law firm of Hale and Dorr
described ``discovery taken against Yahoo'' as the basis of the
need for further information from other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt declined to discuss Raytheon's demands to Yahoo or the
company's reponse. She said she wasn't familiar with Yahoo's
policies as to whether the company would notify users when it
received such demands, or whether it would give them a chance to
block the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   On the company's Web site, Yahoo states that it does not make
personal information ``available to third parties without your
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at a different point in the document, Yahoo mentions
that it might turn over such information in response to what it
terms ``special cases.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four New York City police officers were arraigned on
charges of second-degree murder and suspended from the police force
Wednesday in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, marking a new
stage in a case that has riveted, and riven, the city for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With security so heavy that the Bronx County building was shut
down, and with hundreds of demonstrators on both sides of the case
massing and chanting outside, the officers uttered their first
public statements about Diallo's death. Asked how they pled,
Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth
Boss each emphatically replied, ``Not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment judge, John P. Collins of State Supreme Court,
rejected a request by the Bronx district attorney to remand the
officers, and set bail at $100,000 each. After the officers posted
it, they emerged from the courthouse and were greeted with cries of
``Murderers'' from demonstrators and chants of ``We Support You''
from fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Each officer faces two counts of second-degree murder. They
fired a total of 41 bullets at Diallo, hitting him with 19 of the
shots, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment building at
1157 Wheeler Ave. in the Soundview section of the Bronx early on
the morning of Feb. 4. One count charges that the officers intended
to kill Diallo, while the other charges that they exhibited a
depraved indifference to human life. Each count is punishable by a
maximum of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The officers also face one charge of reckless endangerment in
the first degree, based on the charge that the large number of
shots endangered people inside Diallo's building. That charge is
punishable by a maximum of six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, broke an eight-week
silence on the case, first handling the arraignment himself, then
conducting a news conference. It was only the second time in his 10
years as district attorney that he had appeared personally at an
arraignment, the other case being the arson fire at the Happy Land
Social Club, which killed 87 people in 1990.

<P>
   In an electronic assault on NATO's presence in cyberspace,
computer users in Serbia managed to temporarily disable the
alliance's site on the World Wide Web last weekend and cause
intermittent outages over the last few days, NATO officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Magis, NATO's web master, said computer hackers bombarded
the site in what is known as a ``ping attack,'' which twists a
protocol that Internet computers use to query one another into a
weapon that overloads a server with more queries than it can handle
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, anyone trying to retrieve information from the NATO
site was blocked from doing so all day Saturday, and parts of
Monday and Tuesday. To guard against such attacks, NATO officials
said they have added an additional server and a filter to block out
all ``ping'' queries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ping attack, the site has been flooded with
thousands of e-mail messages a day, some of which were designed to
overload the alliance's computer, and some of which contained files
with viruses. But the attachments containing viruses were not
opened and did not enter the computer system, Magis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had a crisis like this,'' he
said. He emphasized, however, that the attackers did not manage to
break into the system and damage anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts said the attack, which was relatively
unsophisticated, is one form of ``information warfare'' which will
be increasingly common as governments and the public rely on
computer networks for news and communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode highlights the ease of entry for this kind of
warfare,'' said John Arquilla, a professor of information warfare
at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. ``You just need a modem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of such attacks is that it is difficult to trace
their point of origin. NATO officials said their investigation led
to a server in Serbia, but they did not know whether it was being
used by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO site, which includes press releases and transcripts of
speeches by NATO officials in several languages, serves as a public
relations tool for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since NATO began air assaults on Yugoslavia, the
number of pages requested by Internet users has jumped to 90,000 a
day from an average of 30,000 previously, Magis said. The most
popular items are the video footage of NATO airstrikes taken from
the fighter planes.

   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ On the surface, it's easy to see the
sweeping change Roy B. Shilling Jr. has brought to Southwestern
University in the 18 years since he took the helm of the
liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 major buildings on campus today, 23 were built or
renovated during Shilling's presidency. Trees have been planted.
Facilities updated. Sidewalks moved.
</P>
<P>
   But the deeper changes brought by Shilling, who has announced
that he will step down as president as of June 2000, may be more
lasting _ the school's transformation from a small local college to
one recognized nationally for leadership and academic achievement.
The school has increased the size of its permanent endowment
tenfold, tripled the number of student applicants and been named
among the best regional liberal-arts colleges in the nation _ all
during Shilling's tenure. ``I used to sit and think, 'Roy, you're
doing too much,''' said Isabel Brown Wilson, a trustee of the Brown
Foundation in Houston, which has contributed about a third of the
college's $337 million endowment in the past two decades. ``He was
the kind of man who never stopped working. He energized everyone
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shilling told the university board Friday of his decision, which
was made public Wednesday. By then, Shilling was more eager to talk
about the celebrities he saw in the stands at the Final Four
basketball tournament last weekend than his accomplishments. No, it
wasn't a difficult decision to retire: It's time to pass the baton
to the next leader. And even in retirement, Shilling, 67, plans to
share his expertise as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling first came to Southwestern, the state's oldest
chartered institution of higher learning, in 1968. He served
briefly as executive vice president before taking the job as
president of Hendrix College in Conway, Ark. He returned to
Southwestern as president in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that this university had the greatest potential of any
institution in the country,'' Shilling said. ``I thought by working
with trustees and faculty we might be able to achieve that
potential. I hope we have exercised our stewardship well. We've
come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shilling set into motion the school's master planning process,
which has guided growth and development decade by decade, purposely
limiting enrollment to about 1,200 students and focusing on the
quality of education.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after he joined Southwestern, U.S. News and World
Report named the university among the best regional liberal-arts
colleges in the nation. In 1994, it was reclassified into the
national liberal-arts category, a more selective group. That same
year, Southwestern landed a $6.7 million building grant from the
F.W. Olin Foundation, awarded on the basis of academic excellence
and national emergence.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Die, president of Hendrix College and chairman of the
Associated Colleges of the South, a group of 15 liberal arts
colleges that includes Southwestern, called Shilling ``a president
of presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a visionary, a strategist and an implementer,'' Die said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Shilling lowered the student-professor ratio to
less than 12 to one and still raised faculty salaries. He forged a
partnership with the local school district to promote literacy and
combat dropout rates. And last fall, 55 percent of entering
students ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school class.
``He's really turned the school _ which was a good regional school
_ into a national powerhouse,'' said Southwestern spokesman Eric
Van Danen.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Shilling has kept his finger on the pulse of the
campus, paying attention to everything from staffing to curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, he recruited biology professor Vicente D.
Villa from New Mexico State University. Villa had interviewed at
Southwestern, but turned down a job offer. Shilling called him
back, told him not to rush into a decision and ultimately flew to
El Paso to visit with him at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is that type of person,'' said Villa, named the 1993 U.S.
Professor of the Year. ``I was really impressed by his words of
encouragement. He's an outstanding person who deals with detail but
at the same time has the larger picture in focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Shilling, who earned more than $221,000 in salary and benefits
in 1996-97, will devote his time next fall to fund raising and
institutional visibility. He will take a sabbatical for the spring
2000 semester. ``I want to continue to be the number one friend and
supporter of Southwestern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Board Chairman Red McCombs of San Antonio, owner of
the Minnesota Vikings football team and a multimillion-dollar
contributor to Southwestern, will miss Shilling's leadership. ``As
hard as it is to recognize that Roy is moving on, I'm reminded of
the old saying `There's never a horse that couldn't be rode and
never a cowboy that couldn't be throwed.' We will, I think, be able
to get a very farsighted successor to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William B. Jones will serve as executive vice president of
Southwestern, working as the university's chief operating officer
during the 1999-2000 academic year. Jones, who joined Southwestern
in 1965 as a history professor, has served 11 years as provost and
administrative vice president. ``He received a school which had a
great deal of potential,'' Jones said of Shilling. ``What he did
was realize that potential ... He put us on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Trustee Jim Walzel will lead the search for a replacement, whom
officials hope to name by July 2000.

 &HT;    Texas extends clemency deadline to 21 days
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas parole board Wednesday gave itself
more time to consider condemned prisoners' requests for mercy, but
defense lawyers warned that the move could backfire by denying some
convicts a hearing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action stemmed from complaints about how it conducts
most of its business in private and rarely grants clemency to
condemned prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour public hearing, the Board of Pardons and Paroles'
policy committee voted unanimously to require death-row prisoners
to file their clemency petitions no later than 21 days before their
scheduled execution. The deadline had been five days.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez said the additional time
is needed for the board to properly review and vote upon requests
for clemency, which includes reprieves and commutations of death
sentences to life in prison. ``We have been pressed and pressed and
pressed. We are trying to give the board additional time to
consider these important matters,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Feb. 5 meeting, the policy board had proposed a deadline 25
days before execution. Opponents of that had proposed 10- or 14-day
deadlines. The board settled on 21, however, after listening to
public comments on Wednesday that 25 days was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us more time, and I think it will give
(convicts) enough time to file what they need to file,'' said Board
Member Rissie Owens, who proposed the 21-day compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several attorneys who represent death-row convicts
warned that extending the deadline could cause problems. In some
cases, they said, executions are set only 30 days in advance and
the clemency deadline will have passed before they or their
attorneys learn of the execution date.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Radostitz, an Austin defense lawyer, said courts that set
execution dates ``sometimes will notify the trial lawyer who hasn't
been involved in 15 years,'' instead of a convict's appeals lawyer
who will file the clemency petition. Austin defense lawyer Maurie
Levin said she has had clients read about their execution date in
the newspaper before they got official notice in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents said the new deadline poses a problem because
court appeals likely will still be pending at 21 days, making it
impossible for the parole board to tell whether due process has
been afforded _ one of the key elements board members have said
they use in reviewing clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense bar is now faced with fighting two battles at one
time,'' Levin said. ``It will make the process more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the parole board makes only a recommendation to the
governor on clemency, its suggestion can mean life or death to a
condemned convict. Under Texas law, the governor can grant clemency
only if the board recommends it. A governor can grant a single
30-day reprieve, however, without the board's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Wednesday's decision will take effect May 11,
meaning the first convicts who will have to comply with the 21-day
filing deadline will be three scheduled for execution in June _
including Joseph Stanley Faulder, a Canadian whose court challenge
of Texas' clemency system late last year helped prompt the change
in rules.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, the board has come under fire for the
way it decides clemency issues behind closed doors and for the
refusal by its members to give reasons publicly for their
decisions.

THREE US SOLDIERS NEAR YUGOSLAVIAN BORDER MISSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Kosovo-Identity)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Three American soldiers on a ground mission
near here Wednesday reported gunfire, then disappeared, sparking a
massive search by NATO forces and local police near the Yugoslav
border, defense officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The news came at the end of a day when thousands of refugees
streaming across the border from Kosovo Wednesday said they had
been stripped of all identification by Serb police, confirming NATO
reports of a campaign of ``identity elimination,'' described as
part of a broader plan to erase all evidence that ethnic Albanians
ever inhabited the province.
</P>
<P>
   The US soldiers here were driving a military vehicle on a
routine reconnaissance mission in the Kumanovo area of Macedonia,
approximately two miles from Yugoslavia. They were driving on a
civilian road at the time, NATO Lieutenant Colonel Michael Kimmerer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were surrounded. Then no more was heard from
the patrol,'' another US defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearances came amid a newly-intensified NATO air
campaign, which appeared to hit at least one key target in
Belgrade. However, Yugoslav troops were reportedly continuing their
efforts in Kosovo with zeal, blowing up entire city and town halls
to incinerate piles of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, leaders of the Kosovar Liberation Army, the
rebel separatist group seeking independence, said the group is on
the verge of collapse. A founding member, Azem Syla, said KLA
troops are in desperate need of either weapons or NATO ground troop
support.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, Russian leaders also prompted new concerns, announcing
plans to dispatch a warship to the Mediterranean. White House
officials, unhappy with the decision, said they would nonetheless
trust Russian President Boris Yeltsin's promise to stay out of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he did not, however, trust Milosevic
enough to grant a cease-fire on Easter Sunday, despite pleas from
Pope John Paul II to do so. Clinton also explained his opposition
to sending in US ground troops in a CBS interview, saying what
bothered him was ``the prospect of never being able to get them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was news of the ``identity elimination'' inside Kosovo
that eclipsed most other developments of the day, as refugees told
repeated tales of having their paperwork taken away by Serb
officers who then taunted them and told them they would never be
allowed to come home. Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, who met with
top NATO officials in Brussels Wednesday, called it ``Orwellian in
scope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on a massive scale,'' Dodd said in a telephone call.
``Community after community, they are destroying these records,
taking documents from people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the campaign was
proof Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic intended to ``rewrite
history'' by erasing the ethnic Albanians, who once made up 90
percent of the region's original population of 1.9 million. An
estimated 570,000 refugees have been forced out of their homes
during the current conflict, in which both Milosevic and Kosovar
leaders have claimed the province as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Skopje, the Macedonian capital, Major Jan Joosten, a NATO
spokesman, said the Serbian strategy appeared aimed at rendering
the refugees ``nationless,'' so they could not re-enter Kosovo even
if there were a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Another purpose of the campaign is believed to be to drive waves
of refugees into Macedonia to destabilize the tiny nation, which
left the Yugoslav Federation in 1991 and in doing so infuriated
Milosevic, Joosten said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, refugees waited in packs at the Macedonian border
some 15 miles north of Skopje, wearily standing in lines that
stretched back several miles. Many said Serb police and troops had
looted their cars, snatching pieces of identification such as
passports and birth certificates as they tormented the refugees
with warnings they could never return.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near the border checkpoint, Jo Hegenauer, chief of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kosovo, also
confirmed that field workers were being told of the eradication
campaign by many refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking the IDs from men, especially,'' Hegenauer said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denounced the atrocities once
again, echoing President Bill Clinton's suggestion a day earlier
that if the killings continued, Milosevic might be confronted with
international support for Kosovo independence. Lockhart said the
province ``would become so radicalized that that might prove
impossible to keep as is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community's support for keeping Kosovo as
part of Serbia would be eroded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also responded to the latest news of Russia. According
to the State Department, Russian officials informed officials in
Turkey that they would soon move seven units of the Russian
military's Black Sea Fleet into the Mediterranean in response to
the NATO airstrikes. That action was unwelcome to the White House,
where it was seen as sending ``some mixed messages'' about the
``purpose of this and the intent on the depolyment,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, referring to a speech by Yeltsin the night
before: ``We take seriously the Russian government's statement that
they have no intention of getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military also presented a new challenge, as
Milosevic ousted General Radosav Martinovic, the head of the Second
Yugoslav Army, and replaced him with a close Serb ally. The Second
Yugoslav Army is stationed in the neighboring province of
Montenegro, which is still part of the Yugoslav federation but has
in recent days distanced itself from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the conflict might spread, US and NATO officials have
kept close watch on Montenegro, and Wednesday offered to avoid
bombing targets there if Montenegran officials continued not to
side with the Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military officials also sent a positive message about their
own campaign. After Tuesday night's airstrikes, officials said
early reports indicated a number of key targets had been hit,
including the headquarters for Yugoslav special forces in Belgrade
_ a command station for a paramilitary group accused of widespread
massacres in Kosovo. Some Serb tanks appeared also to have been
hit, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving almost daily to a broader set of targets,'' he
said. ``We will as rapidly as we can choke them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet questions remained about whether NATO strikes, which so far
seem only to have strengthened Serbian resolve, could make an
impact before the ethnic Albanian population disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   What had become of men of fighting age was especially unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, made by KLA leader Hashim Thaci on
German television, Serb forces had rounded up young ethnic Albanian
men inside a soccer stadium in the capital, Pristina, effectively
transforming it into a concentration camp. According to another
account, Kosovo rebels were stopping ethnic Albanian men ages 18 to
50 as they tried to flee Serb troops, sending them back into the
countryside to fight alongside the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Neither report could be independently confirmed, and some
refugees from Pristina crossing into Macedonia Wednesday denied the
story of the soccer stadium, saying it was just a rumor.
</P>
<P>
   An independent radio report in Belgrade saying that eight people
were killed in the airstrikes also could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But two Kosovo Albanian leaders reported to have been summarily
executed by Serbs over the weekend are alive, US diplomatic and
Kosovo Albanian sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fehmi Agani, a veteran politician who played a key role in the
Rambouillet peace talks, and Baton Haxhiu, the Koha Ditore
newspaper editor-in-chief who voiced the aspirations of his people,
had not been executed as reported by NATO Monday, the sources told
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. We believe they are alive,'' a U.S. source said.
</P>
<P>
   A western diplomat in Skopje also said he had no evidence of
Serb concentration camps. If they were set up, the diplomat said,
American satellites and spy planes could detect them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Senator Dodd, after a private meeting Wednesday with
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, put the atrocities in the
category of the worst crimes against humanity in history. He said
that ``any question about whether Slobodan Milosevic is engaged in
genocidal behavior has now been answered completely.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utah Jazz has added a new word to its
basketball vocabulary.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right alongside such staple terminology as pick-and-roll, blind
screens and Stockton to Malone, the Jazz has added another word:
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the much-anticipated clash between the Rockets and Jazz,
a rematch of last year's Western Conference playoff opener, has
been dulled somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the collision course everyone had been expecting, the
teams, who meet for the first time this season tonight at the Delta
Center, are now like two ships passing in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are the Starship Enterprise, having streaked to wins
in nine straight games and 12 of 13. Utah? Images of the Titanic
come to mind, since the Jazz has dropped four of its last six
games, including an embarrassing 26-point loss to the Los Angeles
Clippers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through some tough times right now,'' said Utah
forward Karl Malone. ``But we're a team that has always bounced
back and worked through the tough times. We have them every year,
and this is tough times now for everybody because it's no fun
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Utah, where the Jazz has won 60-plus
regular-season games and advanced to the NBA Finals the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers figured this season would include Utah's third
straight trip to the Finals, and the Jazz did nothing to ease those
expectations when it won 19 of its first 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   But
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say the Jazz has hit hard times the same way the
you-know-what hit that iceberg. And it has had the same effect.
Things are so bad that in ESPN.com's weekly NBA power rankings,
Utah is ranked 30th, even though there are only 29 teams in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   The guys at ESPN.com slipped in NCAA champ Connecticut at No.
21, a good-natured jab at the Jazz and its struggles of late.
</P>
<P>
   These are strange days indeed here in Utah. Of the Jazz's four
recent losses, three have come in overtime, including Tuesday's
104-101 setback at Sacramento. And its two wins in that span have
been difficult, to say the least. The Jazz had to rally to beat
Vancouver 85-80 and needed a last-second 3-pointer from Bryon
Russell to bounce Miami 84-81 at home March 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to turn it around,'' said point guard John Stockton.
``We need to play great basketball from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   But things may not shake out that way for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to most teams _ like the Rockets, for example _ the
Jazz has had a fairly cushy schedule to this point. But April kicks
off a brutal stretch for Utah, which will face the Rockets three
times and the Lakers twice and will play 16 games in 23 days,
including two sets of three games in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Utah is mere percentage points ahead of the
Rockets in the Midwest Division standings, an amazing turnaround
from early March. Back then, the Rockets were a disappointing 10-8
after suffering a humiliating 40-point loss at Portland. At the
same time, the Jazz was 14-4 and had just started a six-game
winning streak that would put it at a league-best 19-4 on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the Jazz has hit the wall. And the wall
seems to be hitting back.
</P>
<P>
   The team that had been leading the league in field-goal shooting
suddenly can't find the basket. In the five games prior to
Tuesday's loss at Sacramento, the Jazz shot just 39.7 percent
(142-of-375).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's execution,'' Stockton said. ``It's the type of shots
we're having to settle for because we're not doing the little
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that poor shooting more evident than in the line
next to Malone's name. Before hitting eight of 12 shots against the
Kings, Malone had made just 43 of his previous 123 shots, or 34.9
percent. This from a guy who is a career 53 percent shooter. The
streak was punctuated by his pitiful 1-for-7, seven-point effort
against the Clippers, during which the Mailman was ejected for
delivering elbows, not field goals, ending his streak of
double-figure scoring at 575 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Jazz coach Jerry Sloan refused to single out Malone for his
poor shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's struggling,'' Sloan said. ``We're trying to work
our way through it. Every team goes through stretches like this. I
just hope we can get it worked out and have a strong finish. If we
can do that, we'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any practice, there isn't much of a chance to work on
our shooting _ at least the kind of shooting we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Jazz managed to break out of its shooting slump,
it found another way to lose. Utah connected on 51 percent of its
shots against the Kings but wound up committing a season-high 26
turnovers, including three by Stockton down the stretch in
regulation and in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been turning the ball over more than we ever have,''
said Sloan, noting the Jazz has averaged 22 turnovers in its last
four losses. ``(Tuesday) night we shot the ball better, but we
didn't get rid of those turnovers. We couldn't make a pass into the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Kings) fronted us inside, and we threw the ball all
over the place. We hit the backboard with it; we hit the rim with
it, everywhere. If we had made a few of those passes, we would have
had layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the Jazz struggle with such fundamental aspects of the
game is odd and remains inexplicable to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things aren't going well, you don't get the breaks,''
said guard Jeff Hornacek with a shrug. ``Things just seem to go
wrong, and that's the way it's going for us now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called a slump.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as things are going for the Jazz, Stockton said there
is no way his team is going to add yet another word to its
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   He swears the Jazz is not about to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst thing you can do,'' Stockton said. ``There
have been other times we haven't played well. We have lost to teams
with horrible records before, and it's not good. It needs to be
addressed. But panicking would only make it worse.''

   The Globe agreed last week to drop its federal lawsuit against
the Enquirer over a story about Frank Gifford's tryst with a Palm
Beach woman named Suzen Johnson. The Boca Raton-based tabloid also
dropped its suit against Johnson, who lured the sportscaster to a
New York hotel room where the Globe was waiting with audio
equipment and cameras to record the story.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said it had the exclusive rights to Johnson's story
after the 1997 affair. But earlier this year, Johnson told the
Enquirer, a tabloid in Lantana, that she was paid $250,000 by the
Globe to ``help set up'' Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, which denied setting up Gifford and said it paid
Johnson only $125,000 for her story, sued in response.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Johnson nor the Enquirer paid anything in exchange for
dismissal of the suit, though the agreement says Johnson is once
again bound by the confidentiality deal that started the dispute in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ludicrous, unwarranted action and that's basically
what discovery proved,'' said David Perel, executive editor of the
Enquirer. ``We're not looking at them with any animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 48, has also agreed to drop her countersuit against the
Globe, in which she said she was badgered into signing the contract
giving the weekly the exclusive rights to her story indefinitely.
She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn statement filed in federal court, Johnson said Globe
reporters smuggled her to hideaways in Florida and Mexico in the
weeks after her affair with Gifford. She said she was not allowed
to consult her husband or her own lawyer about the contract, and a
Globe reporter even slept in her bed to keep an eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to cry and told the Globe's lawyer and the reporter
I wanted to go home and I did not want to sign the contract,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other details about Johnson's dealing with the tabloids have
emerged since the lawsuit was filed in January.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, nearly two months before her encounter with
Gifford, Johnson signed a ``source agreement'' with the Globe for
$50,000 in exchange for the story of her relationship with the
sportscaster. But $25,000 of that was contingent upon Johnson being
photographed with Gifford ``in a romantic encounter,'' court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Globe could not be reached for comment
Wednesday, but they have insisted in the past that they did not pay
Johnson to have sex with Gifford. They also said Johnson misled
them about the nature of her relationship with Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also dropped its claims against Johnson's agent, David
Hans Schmidt, who was said to be negotiating a book and video deal
for Johnson _ projects that apparently would be barred under the
dismissal agreement. Schmidt, who no longer represents Johnson,
declined to comment on the case.

RED SOX BLAST SPRAGUE TAKEDOWN OF FRYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Sensitive to the condition of Jeff Frye's
surgically repaired knees, the Red Sox, from manager Jimy Williams
to pitcher Pedro Martinez to Frye himself &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; were unanimous in
condemning a takedown slide by Ed Sprague of the Pirates, who later
protested his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Frye had just taken a flip from shortstop Donnie Sadler on a
second-inning groundball by Al Martin when Sprague, on base after
Martinez hit him in the back with a pitch, slid through the bag and
beyond, knocking Frye off his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Frye was not hurt on the play, but Williams rushed from the
dugout to register his protest while Sprague exchanged words with
Martinez, who 11 days earlier had hit Martin, causing both benches
to empty briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't slide before the bag, at least not on my replay,''
Williams said. ``I don't mind guys playing hard. I don't like guys
playing dirty. They can hurt somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that, period. I don't want our players doing it.
If our guys did it, it would be the wrong way to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Martinez was hit by a pitch by Pirates
starter Francisco Cordova, but he went straight to first base and
said afterward that he didn't believe the pitch was intentional. He
was less forgiving of Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think as a human being,'' Martinez said. ``That was
really dirty. That was not nice. That wasn't professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who missed last season after undergoing knee surgery and
is four days away from playing in his first regular-season game
since September, 1997, sat in the visitors' clubhouse here and
ripped Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked he'd stoop to that level,'' said Frye, claiming
that it should have been obvious to Sprague that he had stepped off
the bag and had no intention of attempting to turn a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to be a tough guy and respond to a pitcher
hitting him with a pitch, he should go after the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had two knees operated on. If he's going to slide into me
when I'm not looking and say that's hardball, that's chicken
(expletive). That's just BS, that's all you can say. There's a
difference between playing hard and playing dirty, and guys who
play dirty will get theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye said he had stepped away from the base, toward left field,
after receiving Sadler's throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tear up my knee again my career is over,'' said Frye, who
has had surgery on both knees. ``I'm sure he doesn't (care) about
that. I firmly agree with going in hard and sliding in hard to
break up two. That's the way I do it. But there's a certain line
that you don't cross. . . . I just lost respect for somebody,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who played all nine innings and took some extra hitting
afterward, reacted strongly when told the Sox were offended by the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they were so upset about the slide,'' Sprague
said. ``It was a legitimate slide. I slid right through the bag. I
understand Jeff is coming off a knee operation, that's probably why
he's so upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't go out of my way to get him, and I didn't go
after him because Pedro hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague said he was in no position to assume that Frye wouldn't
attempt to turn the double play. ``I was already into my slide by
then,'' he said. ``Go talk to Wendell Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, the Pirates' third baseman, talked to Sox third-base
coach Kim after the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to tell Jeff that I wasn't trying to hurt him,''
Sprague said. ``If you try to ease up, that's the way you get hurt.
I always try to go hard, no matter what. That's the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth meeting this spring between the Sox and
Pirates.

BMW SHARES FALL ON WORRIES OVER ROVER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Investors hammered shares of the Bavarian
car maker BMW &UR;  &LR; Wednesday, after the company's top executives gave
analysts a vague and unconvincing description of their strategy for
repairing Rover, the troubled British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   BMW shares dropped more than 4 percent, to 606 euros ($565.58)
from 633 euros ($590.78). The decline marked a shaky start for
BMW's new chairman, Joachim Milberg, who had just made his first
formal presentation to investment analysts since the ouster last
month of his predecessor, Bernd Pischetsrieder.
</P>
<P>
   It also signaled the depth of unease about the problems at
Rover, which lost nearly $1 billion last year. The gloom appeared
likely to persist even though the British government announced late
Wednesday that it would contribute an unspecified amount of money
to help modernize Rover's main factory in the town of Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Though BMW and the British government had been haggling over the
amount of financial support needed to keep the factory alive, most
analysts had assumed that the two sides would reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger worries are about BMW's apparent commitment to have
Rover keep building mid-priced cars, which have been the main
source of Rover's problems, and how BMW would reduce Rover's costs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Milberg's attempt to show his sense of purpose, analysts
complained that the company was vague and even evasive about his
plans to cut costs and refocus the strategy. Deutsche Bank &UR;  &LR; reduced
its rating on BMW stock from ``neutral'' to ``underperform,'' while
others said they had simply been disappointed by the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was short of quantitative detail, and the
company's answers on a number of points were evasive,'' said
Suzanne Oliver, automobile analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``It didn't really offer any explanation of how Rover will get back
to profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the stock's drop was a case of no news is bad
news. BMW had already disclosed its basic results, which included
Rover's loss of nearly $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   And company executives had also already created a widespread
impression of vagueness at a news conference on Tuesday to discuss
the company's results in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Though BMW's flagship brand enjoyed a strong growth in sales and
profits last year, sales at Rover plunged. Rover's main problems
have been with its disastrous mid-priced cars that compete with
vehicles like Volkswagen's Golf. Those problems led to a bruising
battle over strategy among top executives and to the ouster of
Pischetsrieder and the resignation of another top board member,
Wolfgang Reitgzle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday they had been hoping for concrete
financial details on BMW's goals for cost-cutting and refocusing.
Klaus-Juergen Melzner, Deutsche Bank's automobile analyst,
complained that BMW had been almost contradictory about its plans
to reposition Rover's midpriced cars, the R200 and R400.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he said, BMW said the cars would be priced at
``premium'' levels; on the other, the company said it wanted to
produce as many as 500,000 vehicles _ seemingly an attempt at
cracking the lower-priced mass market.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank also complained that BMW had made fairly small
provisions for restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver, at Credit Suisse First Boston, said she still ranked
BMW shares as an ``unenthusiastic hold.'' But she was dismayed by
the lack of specifics and by hints that BMW's profit might slip in
1999 for the second consecutive year. Dragged down by Rover, BMW's
profit sank 28 percent in 1998 to 925 million marks, or about $514
million.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was much of a surprise. BMW executives repeatedly
cautioned in recent weeks that Rover would not return to
profitability as quickly as they had hoped. They had all but
written off their original goal of turning a profit at Rover in
2000 and said they would be happy to achieve one in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it much of a surprise that BMW's plans remain vague.
Though company executives say they have abandoned the old strategy
of treating Rover like an independent company, they have not set
new targets for cutting costs. &QL;

 &HT;    EDs: 1ST UPDATE; Changes throughout.
 &HT;    Yahoo! expected to acquire Broadcast.com
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo!, the Internet's No. 1 portal service, is
expected to announce plans today to buy Broadcast.com, a
Dallas-based provider of multimedia video and audio sports, news
and music events, for about $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation of a deal. The acquisition would
further expand Yahoo!'s considerable range, which includes free
e-mail, news and stock information, magazines, and even credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! said only that it has an 8:30 a.m. conference call with
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means that Yahoo will pay about $130 a share for
Broadcast.com's 44 million shares outstanding, Dow Jones News
Service said.
</P>
<P>
   The price is more than the $120 a share that Yahoo had initially
offered, indicating its desire to avoid rival bids from other
interested companies such as America Online Inc. and others,
unidentified sources told Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Yahoo! and other major Internet
companies are trying to make their Web sites more attractive by
adding products such as live audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to lure users and keep existing users sticking
around their sites longer.
</P>
<P>
   The length of a visit is one way Web measurement firms determine
a site's popularity. Web companies can then sell more advertising
at higher prices and rent spots on their sites to sell goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com's technology could be used to attract more users
and small businesses to Yahoo! using streaming media, or combined
audio and video broadcasts. The acquisition could also signal
Yahoo's desire to acquire content for the world of high-speed
broadband access. Broadcast.com's offerings are difficult to view
even on high-speed T1 workplace connections. That will improve as
users move to faster cable modems and high-speed telephone
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com stock has surged about 40 percent since Business
Week reported Yahoo! might be interested in buying Broadcast.com.
Yahoo! shares fell $3.93 3/4 to $168.37 1/2 on Wednesday and
Broadcast.com rose $4.81 1/4 to $118.18 3/4. Trading of both stocks
was later halted. Bloomberg News contributed to this article.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO opened its expanded bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia on Wednesday, and alliance officials said they
were planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President
Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up bombing of a broader range of sites as the second
week of air strikes begins is intended to give the alliance a more
effective tool to press Milosevic to halt the Serbian onslaught in
Kosovo, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO plans to bomb throughout Yugoslavia, with some exceptions,
and the alliance's military commanders were quick to use their
expanded authority Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that allied bombers had
struck the headquarters of the Special Unit Corps, the Yugoslav
equivalent of the American Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was the closest to downtown Belgrade that has
been struck to date,'' Bacon said. He also reported that several
tanks had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   In unusually blunt language, the German general who is chairman
of the alliance's military committee outlined the goal of the
stepped-up attacks, which may take aim at command posts and
government buildings, including those in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly intend to loosen his grip on power and break his
will to continue and, as weather permits, to chip off his assets in
Kosovo.'' Gen. Klaus Naumann said of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start to chip away at the institutions that keep him in
power, he may think it over,'' the general said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Yugoslavia has had the opposite effect so far.
Serbs, including some who oppose Milosevic, have united behind
their leader, who has cast himself as a heroic David against a
bullying Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's change in tactics stems from its continuing inability to
halt the Serbian advances in Kosovo. Up to now, NATO has
concentrated on bombing air defense sites and on striking the
Serbian forces that are pressing the attack on ethnic Albanians in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   With bombing there hampered by bad weather, alliance officials
were searching for other ways to compel Milosevic to call off his
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the action moves closer to Belgrade and other
population centers, the more we will rattle the rather exuberant
nationalist opinion,'' a Western official insisted.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials also hope that Yugoslavia's deteriorating
economy, coupled with reluctance within the country's army to stand
by as its bases and equipment are destroyed, will add to the
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said NATO planes had reported hitting several tanks and
other armored vehicles in Kosovo, although he said there had been
no confirmation by reconnaissance planes. He said there were about
400 tanks in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anybody would expect to hit them all at
once,'' he said. ``But we are, as we have said many times,
systematically attacking these forces, and we will continue to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said NATO had struck ``a major ammunition manufacturing
plant'' in the town of Cacak, 60 miles south of Belgrade. Reporters
there were shown what local officials called an appliance factory
that was damaged in a NATO strike.
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of refugees into neighboring countries growing,
NATO officials said there were reports of Serbian tank and
artillery units shelling fleeing columns of Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   France said it would send 10 fighter planes to try to protect
the refugees on their way to Albania and Macedonia, while other
countries pledged logistical and financial support for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Russia announced that it was sending some of its aging Black Sea
warships into the Mediterranean to ``monitor'' the Balkan crisis, a
gesture that U.S. officials said they did not consider a military
threat but feared might lend moral support to the Milosevic
government.
</P>
<P>
   The ships include an intelligence vessel that could provide some
information to Belgrade on NATO military operations in the Adriatic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that NATO's classified order setting
the terms of the air strikes called for a campaign to ``break the
will'' of Serbia's leadership if Belgrade did not back away from
attacks against ethnic Albanians. The officials said they were
planning a brutal test of Milosevic's resolve that could go on for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said he hoped that the
campaign could be concluded before the alliance's summit meeting,
which is to begin on April 23. Other officials were not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders gave their military commanders the broader
authority to attack targets in Yugoslavia at a meeting here that
ended early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the target list came after a closed-door debate
among the NATO allies. The United States proposed that the alliance
open a new, more offensive stage of operations that would enable
allied warplanes to attack military and industrial sites throughout
Yugoslavia and government ministries in downtown Belgrade. In NATO,
that stage was referred to as Phase 3.
</P>
<P>
   But allies like Italy and Greece have been uneasy over the
bombing campaign, and a compromise was worked out giving the
alliance a broader range of targets, but not as much flexibility as
the United States had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always in NATO decisions, there was a compromise,'' a
senior NATO official said. ``What we got will give the executing
commanders sufficient leeway to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Using its new targeting authority, NATO will be allowed to
broaden its strikes to include command-and-control centers
throughout the country and government headquarters in the Yugoslav
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``No facility, no unit which is currently being used to plan,
conceive, direct or carry out operations is going to be a
sanctuary,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders used their new authority just a few hours after
the alliance approved it. And a NATO official said the alliance
appeared to have deflected pressure from Greek and Italian
diplomats, as well as the Vatican, for a pause in the bombing for
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   But the air operations will fall short of the Phase 3 plan that
the United States had wanted to carry out. Some of Yugoslavia's
military-industrial complex and infrastructure north of the 44th
parallel will remain off-limits for now.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will not attack Yugoslavia's television
broadcasting system without further discussions among NATO members,
a Western official added.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential palace used by Milosevic also cannot be
attacked, according to the guidelines. NATO officials said that as
the palace of the former king of Yugoslavia, it is considered to be
a historic and cultural site. Also, it has a Rembrandt on its first
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we win the hearts and minds of the people of
Yugoslavia if we destroyed the palace?'' a NATO official said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even though military experts are debating the use of ground
forces, NATO officials said there were no current plans to send
them as a invasion force to take over Kosovo or for the less
ambitious mission of protecting enclaves of refugees within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The fight in Kosovo has emerged as one of the clearest tests of
air power. Some Air Force officials have long argued that
laser-guided bombs and cruise missiles would enable technologically
superior powers to win a victory through air power.
</P>
<P>
   Pinpoint strikes against command centers, communications links
and internal security forces, these officials have insisted, could
destroy the levers of power that the enemy leadership needs to
control its society. At the same time, punishing raids would
generate unrest within its military.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was put to the test during the Gulf War of 1991 when
the United States used F-117 stealth fighters and cruise missiles
to take their attack to downtown Baghdad. But Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was still in power after six weeks of air strike and
continues to be eight years later.

`PINK PANTHER' BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SELLERS, BLAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 2 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You may have forgotten, but before he became
Oscar's lovable Furby, Roberto Benigni tried to fill the shoes of
the British comic actor Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards' ``Son of
the Pink Panther'' (1993). But playing the illegitimate offspring
of Inspector Clouseau (Sellers) left even the usually irrepressible
Benigni flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   The film's failure can be put down to it simply being a bad
idea. As hard as he tried, Benigni was too often over the top, with
the gags being more goofy slapstick than rising out of Clouseau's
particular bumbling dim-wittedness.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Sellers were the two men most responsible for the
success of ``The Pink Panther'' series, but the pair reportedly had
an uneasy relationship at best, and a rivalry developed over who
should get the most credit for the films' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' continuation of the series with ``Son'' was seen by
some as an attempt _ a failed one _ to show that he was the comic
genius behind the films. The film illustrates that the two of them
probably needed each other more than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven ``Panther'' films altogether, including ``Son''
and ``The Trail of the Pink Panther,'' which was essentially a
hodgepodge of outtakes strung together as a film. It was released
in 1983, three years after Sellers' death from a heart attack at
the age of 54. Now four of the best of the series _ ``The Pink
Panther'' (1963), ``A Shot in Dark'' (1965) ``The Pink Panther
Strikes Again'' (1976) and the last real collaboration of Sellers
and Edwards, ``The Revenge of the Pink Panther'' (1978) _ are out
on DVD (MGM Home Entertainment; $24.95 each).
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years later (30 in some cases), the ``Panther''
movies hold up _ hilariously. Of course, neither Sellers or Edwards
probably realized what they had on their hands when they started
making ``The Pink Panther,'' which was a comedy-caper movie
starring David Niven, Robert Wagner, Cappucine and Claudia
Cardinale. The inept Clouseau character was meant to supply most of
the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Niven played a sophisticated jewel thief (Sir Charles Lytton),
who the poor inspector is on the trail of but never close to
catching. The Pink Panther? Well, that's actually a priceless gem
that Lytton is out to steal. But the real stealing in this picture
was done by Sellers, who stole the show with his impeccable comic
despite having less screen time than other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   In the next film, ``A Shot in the Dark,'' Inspector Clouseau and
Sellers' comic genius were brought to the forefront. Edwards, who
produced and directed the film, also co-wrote the screenplay with a
comedy writer who would later come up with some head-spinning
ideas, William Peter Blatty, author of ``The Exorcist.'' The film
is filled with one sight gag after another (Clouseau at a nudist
camp is priceless). It also introduced the character of Chief
Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), the inspector's nervous
superior. Dreyfus would find himself frustrated by Clouseau in
subsequent films.
</P>
<P>
   When Sellers returned to play Clouseau more than 10 years later,
his numerous disguises were often the highlights of his films. This
was a trademark of the actor, who played three roles in Stanley
Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove,'' including the title role and the
president of the United States. In ``Revenge'' alone he plays the
vertically challenge Toulouse-Lautrec, a rickshaw driver and a
Swedish herring fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sellers often wasted his talents on turkeys like ``The
Blockhouse'' (1974), where he played six roles, or ``The Great
McGonagall'' (1974), where he played Queen Victoria. Remember
either film? No, probably better for your brain cells. Bad choices
were often the case in Sellers' later career.
</P>
<P>
   He had made his mark in the '50s on the legendary BBC radio
series ``The Goon Show,'' and then starred in a number of terrific
comedies such as ``I'm All Right Jack'' and ``The Mouse That
Roared.'' Besides ``Strangelove,'' in the '60s and early '70s he
was known for those swinging comedies like ``What's New Pussycat?''
``After the Fox,'' ``Casino Royale'' and ``I Love you Alice B.
Toklas.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the success of ``Pink Panther'' series, most of
Sellers' '70s films are forgettable with one notable exception _
the satirical ``Being There'' (1979), for which he received a best
actor Oscar nomination. &UR;

CLINTON SAYS IMPEACHMENT WAS NO `SHAME' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that he did not
regard his impeachment as something to be ashamed of, saying that
it was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not regard this impeachment vote as some great badge of
shame,'' he told Dan Rather of CBS News. ``I do not. Because, I do
not believe it was warranted, and I don't think it was right. I
just don't have bad feelings about it, but neither do I have
feelings of anger and bitterness against those who did what they
did, whether they believed it or whether it was political or
whatever, I just think it's past us and we need to put it behind us
and we need to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``All of us owe it to our families and our personal
lives, all of us need to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview broadcast Wednesday evening on ``60 Minutes
II,'' Clinton said he never had any intention of resigning in the
year-long investigation into his extramarital affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky. The House voted on Dec. 19 to impeach him and the Senate
acquitted him on Feb. 12, after a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he gave no thought to resigning, Clinton said: ``I
wouldn't do that to the Constitution. I wouldn't do that to the
presidency. I wouldn't do that to the history of this country. I
would never have legitimized what I believe is horribly wrong with
what has occurred here over the last four or five years.''

YUGOSLAV ATHLETES' THOUGHTS NOT ON GAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ In this Andalusian city, basketball star Sasha
Djordjevic played a game Sunday with a black band around his arm
and a rectangular piece of cloth covering his name on the back of
his jersey. In Madrid, soccer star Predrag Mijatovic marched
outside the U.S. Embassy, wrapped in a Yugoslav flag.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Mijatovic's World Cup teammate Dragan Stojkovic lifted
up his jersey after each goal scored by his Nagoya teammates to
show a T-shirt that read, ``NATO Stop Strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a week for gestures of symbolism and commiseration
from Yugoslav athletes who earn their livings in various sports and
time zones. It has also been a week for strong words as the NATO
air strikes against their country continue.
</P>
<P>
   Mijatovic, one of the most prominent players on the reigning
European club soccer champion, Real Madrid, said of NATO forces
that ``they are playing at war, just as if they were pushing the
buttons of a Play Station.'' He also chastised American leaders for
a lack of historical perspective, saying that ``when there were
wars in Kosovo during the Ottoman Empire 600 years ago, the U.S.A.
did not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Danilovic, a former member of the National Basketball
Association's Miami Heat who now stars for Kinder Bologna in Italy,
issued a statement distributed by the Yugoslav Basketball
Federation. It read, in part: ``It is very hard to be a Serbian
athlete in the world which is dictated by America, in which history
and tradition do not have the real meaning, but I am extremely
proud to be a Serbian athlete. I appeal to all basketball
federations to help one strong basketball nation who defended
itself during the whole history and never wanted to have anything
that did not belong to it. Now, Americans and Albanians want
something that does not belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav athletes have grown accustomed to geopolitics having a
negative impact on their sporting careers. After Croatia and
Slovenia declared independence in 1991 and the conflict in
Bosnia-Herzegovina began, athletes from what was left of Yugoslavia
were excluded from major international competitions for nearly four
years because sports federations chose to respect sanctions imposed
by the United Nations against their country.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav soccer team, one of the world's best, had to leave
the 1992 European championships in Sweden before they began, and
then missed the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States and the
1996 European championships in Britain. The Yugoslav men's
basketball team, which included the NBA stalwart Vlade Divac, was
forced to miss the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, and the
1994 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   But after sanctions were provisionally lifted by the United
Nations in October 1994, the Yugoslav teams and athletes were
quickly reintegrated into the sports community, and at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Divac, Danilovic, Djordjevic and their
teammates lost to the United States in a competitive gold-medal
game in men's basketball. The Yugoslavs then won the world title
last year, the same year that the men's soccer team reached the
second round of the World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Yugoslav soccer players, basketball players and team
handball players earn their livings in Western Europe, including
Mijatovic, who comes from the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and
who has helped orchestrate a strike by Yugoslav players who are
under contract with clubs in NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not wear the jersey of Real Madrid knowing that my
parents are sleeping in a garage,'' said Mijatovic, who said he
does not intend to play until the bombing stops.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Yugoslav soccer federation, the idea did not
come from the government, as had been reported, but from Mijatovic,
Stojkovic and former AC Milan star Dejan Savicevic, now with the
Belgrade club Red Star.
</P>
<P>
   But several Yugoslav players, including Sasa Ilic, a goaltender
with Charlton in England's top division, said they would still make
themselves available for their clubs' coming games. In a statement
released Wednesday, the Australian-born Ilic explained that though
he supported his fellow Yugoslavs' decision not to play, he
believes he ``will make a greater contribution by remaining in the
public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   When NATO announced that bombing would begin, Mijatovic and
other national team members were in Yugoslavia to prepare for a
match against Croatia, part of the qualifying process for the 2000
European championships. That game was soon canceled, along with
most commercial flights out of the country, and many of the
players, including Mijatovic, had to cross into neighboring Hungary
by car to return to their foreign clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Lukic, a Yugoslav striker with FC Metz in the French
first division, was preparing to make the journey in reverse. On
Monday, he was given indefinite leave by his club to return to
Yugoslavia. ``When I'm in Serbia, I'll do the same thing as all my
compatriots; I will put myself at the service of my government and
do what they ask,'' Lukic told the French sports daily L'Equipe.
``Serbia is not the aggressor; it is the victim, and it never has
been and never will be occupied. Nobody will change our borders
against our will.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After his return to Madrid, Mijatovic took part in a protest in
front of the U.S. Embassy with several other prominent Yugoslav
players based in Spain. Other Yugoslav soccer players participated
in protests outside the American consulate in Barcelona and the
American Embassy in Lisbon, and Wednesday Yugoslavs who play for
Portuguese first-division clubs sent a letter to the Portuguese
president Jorge Sampaio asking for an end to the country's
participation in the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Predrag Radosavljevic, a Yugoslavia-born
midfielder with Kansas City in Major League Soccer who is known as
Preki and who is now an American citizen, said, ``The situation is
affecting me a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Preki, who is a Serb and whose parents and sister still live in
Belgrade, said: ``Serbia will never give up that part of the
country. Historically, that's always been ours, so why should we
give it up? We're basically allowing terrorists to take part of the
country away. Can you imagine if Miami wanted to be part of Cuba?
What would the U.S. government do?''

COMMENTARY: WHEN IN A WAR, WIN THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's military objective was clear: to ``degrade''
Yugoslavia's ability to drive the ethnic Albanians out of its
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some degradation. After a week of Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic
``cleanskrieg,'' a third of the unwanted population has been driven
out, many civilians murdered, the Kosovo Liberation Army decimated.
Slow-moving NATO's bluff was called and fast-moving Yugoslavia is
winning the war.
</P>
<P>
   Why? One reason is that Clinton's poll-following and wholly
unnecessary promise of no use of ground troops emboldened the
Yugoslav dictator. Another is that our cautiously phased air
campaign concentrated on Yugoslav air defenses, thereby protecting
our pilots, rather than combining that with an attack on Serbian
field forces as they swiftly carried out their savage sweep.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of seven days of defeat, NATO will now punish
Yugoslavia by bombing government buildings in Belgrade. That may
salve our pride, but an equivalent discomfort _ an evacuation of
the Pentagon _ would not stop America's ability to wage war.
Pinpoint bombing of Belgrade headquarters will only solidify
Serbian patriotic support for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   We will also take more risks flying lower over Kosovo. That may
take out 400 tanks and heavy artillery pieces now shelling towns,
but will not stop the panicked exodus driven by men with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the West on a classic Vietnam spot: Yugoslavia, the
subpower, is fighting to win, while NATO, the superpower, is
painfully escalating as it yearns to settle. To end brutal internal
aggression against innocents, we have to break that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   On the military front, beyond tactical air attacks on the
``cleanskrieg,'' NATO bombers should darken Belgrade. The removal
of electricity would disrupt military communications and remind
triumphant Yugoslav leaders of the greater human hardship being
inflicted by their orders on Kosovars. Then we should target
industrial plants around Belgrade and Nis, and sink all Yugoslav
naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Ground troops? The prospect of body bags is anathema to Bill
Clinton despite his bluster about genocide. Without his willingness
to ask Congress to put our troops where his mouth is, Europeans and
even Turks will not take on the nation that bloodily battled Hitler
and stood off Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done is to mass a NATO ground force near Albania and
Macedonia borders, protecting and training a KLA guerrilla force.
The very presence of five armored divisions nearby, prepared for
action under air supremacy, would radically change the local power
equation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pain can be inflicted by the seizure of Yugoslav assets
around the world to subsidize the upkeep of refugees. Psychological
war can be waged by shortwave, leaflet and even the Internet, to
Yugoslavs now getting only Milosevic propaganda. Just as fissures
will develop within the NATO alliance, political splits in the
initial Serbian solidarity should be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, forget the Russians. To them, keeping
Kosovo under Serbian rule means keeping Chechnya under Russian
rule. Primakov's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said this week that
NATO officials, not Yugoslav killers, should be tried as war
criminals for their ``undisguised genocide.'' The long-term Russian
interest is to diminish NATO; Primakov cannot be its intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   Our former political goal of an autonomous Kosovo under Serbian
sovereignty has been overtaken by atrocity. Take the mushy offer we
made at Rambouillet off the table. The allies should now stand for
a separated Kosovo and be willing to consider a partition plan that
lets Serbia keep revered historic sites but joins most of the area
long populated by Albanians to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   After his victorious first week, Milosevic will not hear of it.
He sees what has not happened to Saddam Hussein's Iraq and
logically assumes nothing serious will happen to his Yugoslavia. We
have not yet reached the end of the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But after sustained strategic and tactical bombing; after an
economic blockade and asset seizure that squeezes his political
supporters; after the buildup of troops on his borders that
protects the seekers of vengeance, and might just roll tanks
forward to establish fortified havens for innocents _ after all
that, as crowds now cheering in Belgrade start to grumble about
shortages and isolation, the conqueror of unarmed Kosovo might be
more inclined to trade a little land for peace with Europe.

COURT UPHOLDS IRS PENALTY FOR CHURCH'S ANTI-CLINTON AD IN 1992 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal court has upheld a decision by the Internal Revenue
Service to revoke an upstate New York church's tax-exempt status
for taking out newspaper advertisements before the 1992
presidential election that strongly suggested Christians not vote
for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, handed down on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., affirmed an IRS decision in 1995 to revoke the
tax exemption of the Church at Pierce Creek in Conklin, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS concluded that the nondenominational church violated a
federal ban on partisan political activity by tax-exempt
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling reinforces a boundary restricting what
religious organizations may do during political campaigns. The case
had been closely watched by some religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling seems unlikely to discourage public activity by
religious groups around issues like opposition to abortion or war,
because the case was highly unusual, with a church having publicly
opposed a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was first reported Wednesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page ads the church purchased appeared in USA Today and
The Washington Times on Oct. 30, 1992, four days before the
election, with boldface type stating, ``Christian Beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads accused Clinton, as Governor of Arkansas, of having
supported ``abortion on demand,'' the ``homosexual life style'' and
the distribution of condoms to teenagers by public schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the ads appeared, Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State, based in Washington, complained to the IRS. The
group's executive director, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, said Wednesday
that the ruling clarified a distinction for churches. ``There had
not been a clear statement from the federal courts about the bright
line separating moral statements from direct political advocacy,''
Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said his organization has also filed complaints with the
IRS in 16 other cases in which it believed a church-state boundary
had been breached, among them Vice President Al Gore's appearance
at a political fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Los
Angeles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, a conservative religious legal organization, which had
sued the IRS on the church's behalf, said he would appeal the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the ruling drew an ``artificial distinction''
between a minister's remarks from the pulpit and a church's
statements in a publication. ``Those are both forms of protected
speech,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman declined to comment. In 1996, the IRS said that
under the federal tax code, charities, educational institutions and
religious organizations were ``prohibited by the terms of their
exemption from participating or intervening, directly or
indirectly, in any political campaign on behalf of, or in
opposition to, any candidate for public office.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, written by Judge Paul L. Friedman, rejected
arguments by the church that the IRS had revoked the tax exemption
because of the church's religious views and had inhibited its right
to free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the circumstances presented here _ where a tax-exempt
church bought an advertisement that stated its opposition to a
particular candidate for public office, attributed the
advertisement to the church and solicited tax-deductible
contributions for the advertisement _ the IRS was justified in
revoking the tax-exempt status,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Little, who was pastor of the church when the
ads were purchased, said he was disappointed by the ruling.
Although the church remains in existence as a legal entity, Little
and his congregation, which numbers about 400, have moved to a
building in Binghamton and are now known as the Landmark Church.
</P>
<P>
   Among its members is Randall Terry, the abortion opponent who
founded Operation Rescue, which conducted anti-abortion street
protests in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Little said he saw little distinction between a church losing
its tax-exempt status for having addressed ``moral issues in
writing'' and IRS agents slipping into church pews to take notes on
a sermon, ``and going home and saying, `He said non-tax-exempt
words.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of the press and freedom of speech, they're more than
cousins, they're brother and sister,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, a
conservative organization, said the ruling would not have a wider
impact on churches that have been involved politically.

 &HT;    TV's comedy headhunters are following their noses to Texas
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pop quiz: What city hosts the third-largest
comedy festival in North America?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered Austin, you're better informed than most locals
regarding the Big Stinkin' International Improv and Sketch Comedy
Festival, which, in its fourth year, is living up to its hyperbolic
name.
</P>
<P>
   For reputation, the Big Stink does not compete with the closely
watched Montreal and Aspen comedy festivals, but it is gaining
respect, especially among television executives, who hunt on the
humor circuit for future stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this festival is an absolute must-go,'' said Cory
Stern, executive producer for Fox Family Channel. ``I get access to
completely unknown talent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It jumped to our attention this year,'' said Daysun Perkins,
coordinator of casting for the ABC Network. ``Improv is really
picking up around the country. Here I will be looking for anyone
who stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the fest, which showcases 60 improvisation and sketch
troupes, is the television talent pipeline. Comedy Central and Time
Warner Cable are heavily involved as sponsors, but Fox, NBC, ABC,
MTV, HBO and Walt Disney Company also are sending representatives.
Honchos from Def Comedy Jam, U.S. Comedy Arts Festival and
``Saturday Night Live'' will cast their nets widely among the many
showcase performances. Industry watchers in attendance include
Entertainment Tonight, Variety, Access Hollywood, Hollywood
Reporter and In Style.
</P>
<P>
   The big switch this year is the juried invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invited fewer groups this year to improve the quality,''
said Big Stink managing director Fiona Cherbok, who reviewed scores
of videotapes. ``I mean, you have to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case in the past, when barely qualified
troupes _ that seemed to have formed hours before the festival _
were showcased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed in the quality of the acts, since it
was nonadjudicated up until this point,'' said Gary Mann, producer
of HBO's U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. Mann, nevertheless, is
returning this year and is a big fan of the Austin sketch troupes
Monk's Night Out and Only 90 Percent Effective. ``It takes a while
for a festival to gear up. There was a certain amount of dreck
early on because it was essentially an open call.''
</P>
<P>
   The fest began with 20 participants in 1996, through the
pioneering efforts of Monk's Night Out, Austin's second most
successful sketch comedy troupe (after Esther's Follies). It
quickly grew under the ownership of Ed Carter, a former Monk who
saw the potential of a larger format.
</P>
<P>
   While talent scouts attend the Montreal festival during
television's development season and Aspen during the casting
season, smaller fandangos in New York, San Antonio and elsewhere
primarily provide off-season platforms for stand-up comics. The
Austin fest (and a new event in Chicago) concentrate on comedians
performing in groups for sketch comedy (scripted short programs)
and improv (formatted scenes that are improvised on the run).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new kid on the block,'' said Mike August, television
agent for the William Morris Agency. ``But it has a niche to fill.
It's the only festival dedicated to the art of sketch comedy. And
it is very grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the talent in Austin improves, so will the buzz,'' said
Mann, who discovered several comics for his Aspen fest here.
</P>
<P>
   Some producers will come to the Austin fest with a laser-like
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I am looking for a young, hip woman (16-23) to host
a block of afterschool programs,'' said Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many of the troupes are extensions of student or
``garage'' efforts, the Big Stink sounds a lot like the first years
of South by Southwest Music Festival. Groups with sassy names like
Houseful of Honkeys, Hits Like a Girl, Oui Be Negroes and Well Hung
Jury will participate in workshops and seminars, but also will
perform in several hundred performance slots Tuesday through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For many locals, the draw will be the minor celebrities, such as
Rick Najera (``In Living Color''), Dean Haglund (``The X Files'')
and Beth Littleford (``The Daily Show''). Practically the entire
casts of Fox's ``Mad TV'' and ABC's wildfire improv show, ``Whose
Line Is It Anyway,'' will be on hand for the galas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a lot to convince people to come to Austin,''
Cherbok said. ``Having a festival here is just like throwing one
big barbecue.

92 PERCENT OF FEDERAL COMPUTERS READY FOR 2000, WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Wednesday that 92 percent of
the federal government's essential computer systems were now free
of year 2000 problems, but predicted that Americans would have
difficulty reaching some foreign countries by telephone or
airplane, because some computers overseas would not be fixed by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the administration's self-imposed deadline for
finishing the renovation and repair of federal computers so they
will operate properly next year.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, the White House official supervising computer
preparations for 2000, said that 13 major federal departments and
agencies had met the deadline. But, he said, 11 agencies, including
the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human
Services, which supervises Medicare and Medicaid, missed President
Clinton's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, cited these examples
of systems that were supposed to be fixed by Wednesday, but were
not yet ready:
</P>
<P>
   _ Computers used to plan missions for the F-117A Stealth fighter
and the F-15E fighter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Command and control networks for the Ballistic Missile Early
Warning System, a critical part of the United States' air defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   _ A computer system that pays out $165 billion a year in federal
grants for the school lunch program, highway construction and
health care. This ``payment management system'' disburses money for
10 federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, the chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said the government had been making steady progress in
renovating its computers. Only 40 percent of the computer systems
were deemed ready last May.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem arises from the fact that many early
computer programmers used a two-digit format to express the year.
In such programs, 2000 could be interpreted as 1900 or not
recognized as a valid date. If the problem is not corrected,
experts say, computers could produce inaccurate data or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said federal agencies had redefined the problem by
shortening the list of computer systems critical to their
operations. The number of such systems is now 6,123, down from
7,300 a year ago. In effect, the government revised its priorities
and decided that some computers were not so critical after all.
</P>
<P>
   By the administration's account, 12 percent of the 2,038
critical computer systems at the Defense Department have not yet
been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in Congress and at its independent watchdog agency, the
General Accounting Office, say the administration has sometimes
overstated its progress on year 2000 problems. But Koskinen said
the federal government was far ahead of state and local
governments, private industry and foreign countries in preparing
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly going to be countries that will have basic
infrastructure failings and problems,'' Koskinen said. ``There are
going to be some countries that you may not be able to reach by
phone. There are going to be some countries that are at risk that
their power grids are not going to hold, and they're going to be
without power for some time. There are going to be some countries
that you will not be able to fly to.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans should probably buy refundable tickets for airline
flights to developing nations, because some flights may be canceled
early next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said the executive office of the president, which
includes the White House, the National Security Council and the
U.S. trade representative, was lagging far behind most federal
agencies in fixing its computers, in part because it did not get
all the money it sought from Congress last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House agencies have 65 to 70 critical computer systems,
Koskinen said, but only 25 percent met Wednesday's deadline to be
ready for 2000. The White House hopes to have 50 percent of its
computers ready by June and 75 percent by August, with the
remainder fixed by October, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., who held the first congressional
hearing on year 2000 problems in 1996, said he was distressed that
even a few federal agencies had missed the president's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the federal systems not yet ready for 2000 are those
that operate the air traffic control system and pay medical bills
for the nation's elderly and poor,'' Horn said. ``It's a
significant concern that these agencies are still fixing computer
systems when they need to conduct extensive testing to insure that
the government's core business functions work from beginning to
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Rayner, the chief information officer of New Jersey, has
said that ``testing is 60 to 70 percent of the job of getting ready
for the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare relies on private insurance companies and other
contractors to review and pay Medicare claims. Kevin Thurm, deputy
secretary of health and human services, said the essential
computers run by his department and by Medicare contractors would
be fixed by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said many big businesses had made good progress in
upgrading or replacing computers. But, he said, many small
businesses, local hospitals and smaller cities and counties have
deferred action. In many cases, Koskinen said, their announced
position is: ``We don't think it's a big problem. We'll just wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has one-third of the federal government's
essential computer systems. Koskinen said Pentagon officials had
assured him that their computers would be fixed by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those smart weapons in our arsenal have to be tested'' to
see if the computers and the computer chips will work properly
after Jan. 1, Koskinen said. ``You have to go through every
airplane, every missile, every weapon system to determine what is
at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said the Social Security Administration completed its
computer repairs five months ago and was testing the machines. In
private industry, he said, ``banking is clearly in the best shape
of any industry in the country,'' in part because federal
regulators have required even small banks to fix their computers.

 Column: NetZero Looks Like the Real Deal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently heard about a company called NetZero that
gives free Internet access. I looked at what they're offering, and
on the surface, it looks good. They have numerous local telephone
numbers, unlimited access, etc. The claim is that they do not need
to charge because they make money strictly through advertisers. I'd
appreciate any information you can provide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  NetZero looks like the real deal to me, too. Based in
Southern California, it has quickly grown to be one of the top 10
Internet service providers in the country, with more than 600,000
users. Its popularity isn't surprising when you consider that it
gives away a service for which most ISPs charge about $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that you must put up with a constant barrage
of ads, which NetZero displays in a 1-by-3-inch window on your
desktop the entire time you're online. And that's in addition to
the regular banner ads on Web pages that you visit. NetZero's
advertisers, which include Disney, eBay, Macy's and Nissan, are
able to target their ads by using personal information you provide
when you sign up for the service, and through your dial-in number,
which tells them where you live.
</P>
<P>
   To use NetZero, you must use its software, which delivers the
ads. For browsing and e-mail, you can use either Netscape
Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. You can download the
software, find out if there's a local dial-in number near you and
get connected by going to  &LR; www.netzero.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Prying Eyes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just started a new job and would like to use my lunch
hour to write some personal e-mail to people outside the company.
I'm hesitant, however, because the company's policy is that e-mail
is not private. They say they are monitoring e-mail, but I don't
know what that means, and I don't feel comfortable enough to ask
them. Does my boss have the ability to read my mail?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Your boss probably can read your mail if he or she wants
to. Assuming you're using a conventional system like Outlook or
Exchange, all your messages are stored on a server computer until
they're deleted. (Some companies get rid of e-mail every week;
others keep it for months.) As long as messages are in the system,
they're fair game for anyone with the authority to access them.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I'd ask my supervisor whether it's OK to use the
e-mail system for personal messages. If it is, just follow a few
simple rules and you'll never have to worry:
</P>
<P>
   _Don't write anything in an e-mail message that you couldn't say
out loud in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't discuss company business, especially competitive
strategies. E-mail like that can land you on the witness stand.
Just ask Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   _Never, in writing of any kind, refer to your boss as a horse's
rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck Zipper
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often, when I download something off the Internet, it is in a
zip file configuration. Windows will ask which program I want to
use to view the file. I don't know even know if my computer has
such a program. Please tell me what I have to do to use zip files.
</P>
<P>
   A: You need a zipping-unzipping program, something that doesn't
come with Windows. The best one, IMNSHO (that's Internet for ``in
my not so humble opinion'') is WinZip, a $29 shareware program that
you can download from any shareware site including
 &LR; www.hotfiles.com  &LR; and  &LR; www.shareware.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A program such as WinZip is designed to manage files that are
compressed so that they take up less space (and can be downloaded
faster). Some compressed files end in .zip _ hence the zip
designation. Zip files can be a single file or many files zipped
together, as is often the case with programs that you download.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium Power
</P>
<P>
   Q: My good friend Jerry saved up for two years to get a computer
and got an HP 366-MHz Celeron system. He only has an eighth-grade
education and is very visually impaired, but he loves his computer.
He likes to play video games, but a lot of the games he wants say
the minimum system requirement is a Pentium II, and he figures that
because he doesn't have a Pentium II, he wouldn't be able to use
the games. Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've got good news for Jerry. The Celeron  &LR; is  &LR; a Pentium II,
just a little slower version of it. The 366-MHz chip in his machine
should be plenty fast enough to play any video game out there.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The attack of the Melissa virus this week really brought home the
dangers that can lurk in e-mail attachments. ``Don't ever open an
unsolicited attachment'' is the '90s version of the old adage about
not accepting rides from strangers. To protect your PC, consider
getting software such as Norton's AntiVirus or McAfee's VirusScan.
These programs, which you can get for under $30 with rebates, can
sniff out and eliminate most viruses. And the makers quickly post
online updates to handle new viruses that appear on the scene, like
Melissa. Free trial versions are available at  &LR; www.norton.com  &LR; and
 &LR; www.mcafee.com. &LR;

 Visa Says Use Of Its Products Rose 16% in '98
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Visa USA said yesterday that customer use of its card products
jumped 16 percent last year as consumers and businesses
increasingly reached for plastic instead of cash or checks.
</P>
<P>
   Led by fast-growing use of debit cards and corporate cards,
total spending in the United States under the Visa brand reached
$610.3 billion in 1998. Visa, based in Foster City, predicted that
it will cross the $1 trillion threshold by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Visa said it accounted for 10.5 percent of total consumer
payments last year, compared with 6.2 percent in 1994 and 9.6
percent in 1997. The association measures its market share in terms
of all consumer payments for goods and services, not just credit
and debit card payments.
</P>
<P>
   That growth came by grabbing a higher share of payments
traditionally made with cash or checks, such as those for national
parks fees, utility bills and fast-food restaurant meals, Visa USA
chief executive Carl Pascarella said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash and checks are the real competitors,'' Pascarella
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Visa handily dominates the credit and debit card market. It said
it upped its share 0.6 percentage point to 52.8 percent in 1998,
about twice that of No.2 MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of Visa credit and debit cards in circulation
in this country rose 7.9 percent to 322.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's gains came despite a brewing crisis that surfaced as an
increasingly powerful group of big banks that dominate the
organization demanded sweeping changes. The association is owned by
member banks that actually issue Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
   Members such as BankAmerica are pressuring Visa to scale back
its massive marketing program, which they think interferes with
their efforts to promote their own brand names. Visa has been
forced to make concessions, such as considering a plan to let
issuers move the Visa logo from the front to the back of credit and
debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, recently
quit Visa's board because of disagreements over the association's
marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's growth ``is particularly impressive in light of the
internal and external challenges they are facing,'' said Jim
Greene, a credit card specialist with Andersen Consulting in San
Francisco. Visa is an Andersen client.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's business cards grew quickly last year, an area
traditionally dominated by American Express. Transactions on those
cards rose 41.7 percent to $31.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains reflect a series of product introductions, such as
business-to-business purchasing cards, and an advertising campaign
that targeted small business, Pascarella said.
</P>
<P>
   Transactions using Visa's debit cards, which make payments by
withdrawing funds from the cardholder's checking account, rose 43
percent last year. Banks have been pushing their use because they
are cheaper to process than checks.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional credit card volume grew 8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Visa didn't release separate figures for online transactions,
but they have been an important area of growth. The association
calculates that it controlled more than half of the estimated $3
billion to $5 billion in Internet payments during the last three
months of 1998.

COURT UPHOLDS IRS PENALTY FOR CHURCH'S ANTI-CLINTON AD IN 1992 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `w' category) 
(rk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal court has upheld a decision by the Internal Revenue
Service to revoke an upstate New York church's tax-exempt status
for taking out newspaper advertisements before the 1992
presidential election that strongly suggested Christians not vote
for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, handed down on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., affirmed an IRS decision in 1995 to revoke the
tax exemption of the Church at Pierce Creek in Conklin, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS concluded that the nondenominational church violated a
federal ban on partisan political activity by tax-exempt
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling reinforces a boundary restricting what
religious organizations may do during political campaigns. The case
had been closely watched by some religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling seems unlikely to discourage public activity by
religious groups around issues like opposition to abortion or war,
because the case was highly unusual, with a church having publicly
opposed a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was first reported Wednesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page ads the church purchased appeared in USA Today and
The Washington Times on Oct. 30, 1992, four days before the
election, with boldface type stating, ``Christian Beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads accused Clinton, as Governor of Arkansas, of having
supported ``abortion on demand,'' the ``homosexual life style'' and
the distribution of condoms to teenagers by public schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the ads appeared, Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State, based in Washington, complained to the IRS. The
group's executive director, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, said Wednesday
that the ruling clarified a distinction for churches. ``There had
not been a clear statement from the federal courts about the bright
line separating moral statements from direct political advocacy,''
Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said his organization has also filed complaints with the
IRS in 16 other cases in which it believed a church-state boundary
had been breached, among them Vice President Al Gore's appearance
at a political fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Los
Angeles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, a conservative religious legal organization, which had
sued the IRS on the church's behalf, said he would appeal the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the ruling drew an ``artificial distinction''
between a minister's remarks from the pulpit and a church's
statements in a publication. ``Those are both forms of protected
speech,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman declined to comment. In 1996, the IRS said that
under the federal tax code, charities, educational institutions and
religious organizations were ``prohibited by the terms of their
exemption from participating or intervening, directly or
indirectly, in any political campaign on behalf of, or in
opposition to, any candidate for public office.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, written by Judge Paul L. Friedman, rejected
arguments by the church that the IRS had revoked the tax exemption
because of the church's religious views and had inhibited its right
to free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the circumstances presented here _ where a tax-exempt
church bought an advertisement that stated its opposition to a
particular candidate for public office, attributed the
advertisement to the church and solicited tax-deductible
contributions for the advertisement _ the IRS was justified in
revoking the tax-exempt status,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Little, who was pastor of the church when the
ads were purchased, said he was disappointed by the ruling.
Although the church remains in existence as a legal entity, Little
and his congregation, which numbers about 400, have moved to a
building in Binghamton and are now known as the Landmark Church.
</P>
<P>
   Among its members is Randall Terry, the abortion opponent who
founded Operation Rescue, which conducted anti-abortion street
protests in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Little said he saw little distinction between a church losing
its tax-exempt status for having addressed ``moral issues in
writing'' and IRS agents slipping into church pews to take notes on
a sermon, ``and going home and saying, `He said non-tax-exempt
words.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of the press and freedom of speech, they're more than
cousins, they're brother and sister,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, a
conservative organization, said the ruling would not have a wider
impact on churches that have been involved politically.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Long before the Astros arrived in Florida this
year, manager Larry Dierker warned everyone not to expect a repeat
of 1998, when his team won a franchise-record 102 games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quite frankly, the odds are against it. In 1998, the Astros
coasted through the season without significant injuries to key
players, and several players produced career years. What are the
chances of that happening again?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not very good.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou, who some believe was the Astros' most valuable
player in 1998, never made it to spring training, thanks to a freak
accident on a treadmill. The addition of Ken Caminiti was supposed
to help pick up some of the slack caused by Alou's potentially
season-ending knee injury, but illnesses put Caminiti behind
schedule this spring, and he might start the season on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it's safe to assume the Astros' offense, which
produced a club-record 874 runs last season, might lose some of its
potency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the pitching. The Astros were a good team
before they acquired Randy Johnson at the trading deadline last
season, but they became a great team after that. Johnson won 10 of
his 11 starts down the stretch but bolted for Arizona as a free
agent during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement in the rotation, Chris Holt, has just eight
career victories and hasn't pitched in a regular-season big-league
game since the end of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their apparent drop-off, the Astros still appear to
be the best team in the National League Central, and they will
enter the season favored to win the division for the third
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question will be asked: Is the team that will take
the field against the Cubs on opening day as good as the team that
ended the 1998 season with a Division Series loss to the Padres?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``Who knows what's
going to happen this year, but we knew we had a great team last
season. You don't win 102 games without being a great team. That
was the best team I've ever played on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this year's team will turn out to be
that good, too. But I think we'll have to play into the season
before that can be determined. We're missing some guys, but we're
still a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference between the 1999 Astros and last
year's version is depth. Because the Astros were so stacked in
1998, Carl Everett, Richard Hidalgo and Tony Eusebio couldn't get
regular playing time. This year, they'll each be in the opening-day
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-down bench leaves the Astros more vulnerable to
injury. For instance, if another outfielder goes down, the
major-league replacements are Glen Barker and Alex Diaz. Both serve
a valuable role on the team, but neither is considered an every-day
player. Does the name Lance Berkman ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that our overall talent is
lesser,'' reliever Doug Henry said. ``I'm not saying we're bad or
anything like that. But when you take away a Randy Johnson or a
Moises Alou, it's almost impossible to replace those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is the depth. We had good players to fill
those gaps, but because of that, our depth is nowhere near where it
was. That just means that guys, myself included, are going to have
step up. Because of what we did last year, there are going to be
more expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker realizes those expectations might exist from the
outside, but when he gathered his team together at the beginning of
the spring, he reminded them that the competition was this year's
schedule, not last year's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is not the standard as far as I'm concerned,''
Dierker said. ``That was a special season. But our goal isn't to
win 100 games. It's to get to the playoffs one way or another. A
lot of things have to go right in order to have the kind of season
we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not typical to avoid injuries the way we did and to hit,
pitch and field like that. We're probably not as good as we were
last year, but we're pretty close. I believe teams that are
destined to win championships get better as the season goes on, and
that's what we're hoping to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can do that, how they looked at the end of spring
training will hardly matter.

FOUNDER OF ZAMBIA DECLARED STATELESS IN HIGH COURT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Kenneth D. Kaunda, the father of
modern Zambia and the country's president for 27 years, was
declared a stateless person by the country's High Court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on a case brought by high-ranking members of the present
governing party, the court ruled that Kaunda is not a Zambian
citizen under the Constitution because his parents were from the
former British Nyasaland, now called Malawi.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda renounced his Malawian citizenship years ago, when he was
president, so he is now effectively stateless.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zambian law, that renders him liable to arrest and the
seizure of his passport while he seeks a country that will offer
him refuge. Malawi has already refused him entry, according to a
legal expert in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda has been feuding for years with the current president,
Frederick J.T. Chiluba, who replaced him after elections in 1991.
Kaunda has criticized Chiluba's government as inept and corrupt and
has announced plans to run for the presidency next year. Chiluba
has repeatedly had Kaunda and top members of his party arrested,
usually on treason charges that were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, each man's party started trying to prove the
other was not a citizen. Questions about Chiluba's paternity and
the possibility that he had assumed the identity of a schoolmate
were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, a court declared him a Zambian citizen
because he had lived in the country for 10 years, and Kaunda's
party is demanding to know why the same ruling was not extended to
him, Kaunda's son, Wezi, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Kaunda said the ruling was ``all part and parcel''
of the ruling party's campaign to get rid of his father. ``We're
going to fight it,'' he said.

McCARRON, BAFFERT REACH SETTLEMENT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ The dispute over Santa Anita Derby jockey assignments
was settled Wednesday with Gary Stevens scheduled to ride General
Challenge in Saturday's $750,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, who had been promised that mount by Bob Baffert,
apparently will drop his breach-of-contract complaint against the
trainer and ride High Wire Act for John Shirreffs.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate McCarron, Baffert said he'd put the jockey on
marginal Kentucky Derby prospect Straight Man and other good horses
in the future. Without that settlement, the case would have been
decided by the Santa Anita board of stewards.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions had run high Tuesday morning when a public argument on
the subject between Baffert and McCarron agent Scotty McClellan
ended with Baffert shoving McClellan, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas-trained Charismatic was added to the list of
3-year-olds expected to be entered today for the Santa Anita Derby.
No jockey was named.
</P>
<P>
   Other riding assignments: Prime Timber, David Flores; Desert
Hero, Corey Nakatani; Honest Lady, Kent Desormeaux, and Capsized,
Alex Solis. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ France announced Wednesday that it would send 10
airplanes to the borders of Kosovo to protect refugee convoys from
Serbian forces, and Italy plans to send police officers to Albania
to bring order to refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The French aerial cover could protect refugees from attacks like
the one described Wednesday by a NATO officer in Brussels, who said
refugees were fired on by Serbian artillery and tanks in the
Paragusa Valley, a stronghold of the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army. According to the separatist guerrillas, 50,000 Albanians in
the valley are under attack by Serbian and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight 40,000 new refugees were forced across Kosovo's
borders into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, according to the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees, bringing the total of people
displaced in the last 10 days to 140,000. Insisting they not be
quoted by name, officials in the Clinton administration and relief
organizations now fear that the total could reach one million
before the air war is over. Before the Serbian push against the
Kosovar Albanians, they accounted for about 1.8 million of the
province's population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The administration Wednesday pledged $50 million to aid the
refugees, including $25 million from the Defense Department to
provide a mobile air traffic control operation, to repair or build
roads, airstrips and ports and to supply food and tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Defense Department stands ready to provide whatever
assistance we can,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon, who
said that the refugees ``are fleeing a murder machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NATO countries also offered millions of dollars in
aid Wednesday for food, shelter and medical supplies and
governments sent assessment teams to Macedonia and Albania. Germany
and Britain began an airlift to the region Wednesday, with four
German military planes carrying medical supplies and a British
military transport plane filled with blankets and tents arriving in
Skopje, Macedonia, and Tirana, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up makeshift camps for huge numbers of refugees along
the Kosovo border raises serious political and military questions
as well as humanitarian problems.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro (a republic in the Yugoslav
federation with Serbia) are politically and economically fragile
and ill equipped to care for these newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Already Albania has accused Yugoslavia of shelling across its
borders, which could force the refugees further inland. Kosovar
Albanian leaders hope to keep the refugees grouped near the border
so they can return to their homes once the war is over, a goal of
the Europeans as well. Moreover, if the shells hit Italian police
officers, that could spark demands for retaliation by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian effort was outlined by Alessandro Di Franco,
counselor for press information at the Italian Embassy. ``We are
preparing a major massive humanitarian effort,'' he said. ``The
Albanian government has asked us for tents, food, shelters and for
our police forces to bring order to the camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcements from Italy and France, and pledges of
$40 million of aid from Germany, were measures of the fear in all
of Europe that the refugee crisis is becoming a nightmare, and that
a failure to keep open the possibility of the return of the
refugees to Kosovo could force Europe to absorb them as new
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Although the relief organizations, along with the United States
and other NATO nations, had put aside food stocks several weeks
ago, they were not prepared for this vast flight, according to
administration officials, foreign diplomats and aid officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already reached our worst case scenario projection of
150,000,'' said Karen Abuzayd, Washington director for the U.N.
High Commission for Refugees. ``Our projections now are for over
half a million refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Franco described the Italian effort in detail. The program,
valued at $10 million, was approved Wednesday by the Italian
Cabinet. After consultations with the United States, Italy agreed
to provide security for the refugee camps immediately, using the 80
Italian officers already aiding the Albanian government; this group
is to be supplemented by a larger contingent from Italy, though the
size was not announced. At Durres, an Albanian port city, the
Italians will build a camp for 25,000 refugees and use the Italian
soldiers and sailors already stationed in Albania for security.
</P>
<P>
   If Albania asks for troop support in the camps along the Kosovo
border, Italy is prepared to ask NATO for approval, according to Di
Franco.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Serbs have apparently speeded up their
forced expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just exploded today, and refugees have just been pouring
over the borders,'' Ms. Abuzayd said. ``The Serbs are running
trains from Pristina carrying 3,000 Albanians on a 12-car train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate we had food in our warehouses in anticipation
of a refugee crisis,'' she said. ``Now it is a question of
organizing the offers and getting the supplies quickly where they
are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other help offered Wednesday, France and Britain each
pledged $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   All of the relief agencies have been thrown out of Kosovo and
most have left Belgrade, where they had stored three-fourths of
their supplies. No international agencies remain to provide help or
protection to the 260,000 Albanians displaced from their homes
during the war, according to the U.N. agency. The buildings of most
foreign agencies in Kosovo were looted and some were burned down by
the Serbs as soon as the relief workers fled, Ms. Abuzayd said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and the NATO allies have pledged that
the refugees can return to Kosovo when the shooting stops, some
critics of the administration wonder if that will be possible
without sending in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term, we have to decide whether we really are
going to bring them back to Kosovo,'' said Morton Abramowitz, the
former ambassador to Turkey who oversaw the 1991 return of Kurdish
refugees to northern Iraq under the protection of the American
military. ``And that's not going to happen unless we're prepared to
put in force. If we haven't committed troops so far, I don't think
it will be possible when it's time to bring the refugees home.''

close to the talks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies met Wednesday and approved the
deal, which had been rumored for some time, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com shareholders are expected to receive 0.77 share of
Yahoo for each of their shares, which values the deal at about $130
a share, analysts said. On Wednesday, shares of Broadcast.com rose
$4.8125, to $118.1875. In after-hours trading, the company's shares
rose an additional $6.8125, to $125.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for both companies did not return calls for
comment Wednesday. But an analysts' meeting to discuss the
acquisition is scheduled for Thursday morning. Mark Cuban, the
chairman and president of Broadcast.com, and Todd R. Wagner, the
chief executive, are expected to remain at the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Broadcast.com, which sends audio and video over the
Internet, jumped by $31 two weeks ago after Business Week reported
that it was in talks with Yahoo. Shares of Yahoo fell $3.9375
Wednesday, to $168.375.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is another move by Yahoo to take advantage of its $34
billion stock market value by using its shares to pay for
acquisitions. In January, Yahoo agreed to exchange stock, now worth
$3.7 billion, for Geocities, a service on which three million
people publish Internet home pages.
</P>
<P>
   While $5.6 billion is an astounding price for a company as small
as Broadcast.com, analysts said that Yahoo was almost compelled to
make such expensive purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo won't be able to sustain its extraordinary valuation
unless they make acquisitions like Geocities and Broadcast.com that
help them capture more of their users' time,'' said Keith Benjamin,
an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``If they don't buy,
their market value will lose $5 billion over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com runs a vast site with all sorts of audio and video
programming that can be seen or heard over the Internet. But with
the current level of technology, the sound has much more static
than a radio station and the pictures are small and flicker like a
dim candle.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the company's revenue come from corporations,
which hire it to operate conference calls and investor meetings
over the Internet. The remainder of its revenue, and the vast bulk
of its traffic, comes from advertising and product sales on
programs that range from foreign news broadcasts to high school
sports. The company lost $16.4 million last year on sales of $22.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's acquisitions have been meant to broaden its audience so
that it could maintain its position as the second most popular
collection of services in cyberspace after America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, once simply a directory of other Web sites, has
refashioned itself as a broad portal, or gateway, to a wide range
of services from stock quotes to electronic mail and now to
television and radio programming.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com was visited by 8.9 million Internet users in
February, according to Media Metrix, an audience measurement firm.
Yahoo and Geocities reached 36.9 million users. But nearly all of
the Broadcast.com users already visit Yahoo's sites, so the
combination only gives Yahoo one million new users, not enough to
overtake America Online, which recently bought Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to sheer reach, the deal has the potential to help
Yahoo move from the current state of the Internet _ which mainly
involves sending static pages of information over relatively slow
modems _ to the expected world of broadband services, in which
audio and video programming can be delivered over cable television
systems or much faster modems that use telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the shift to broadband services, Excite, one
of Yahoo's chief rivals, agreed to be bought by the At Home Corp.,
the leading provider of broadband programming through cable
systems. Similarly Lycos, another Internet portal, is combining
with the Home Shopping network and other assets owned by USA
Networks in a complex deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for the most heavily trafficked site on the Web
to acquire the largest provider of streaming audio and video on the
Web'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``With
the advent of broadband, Internet sites will come to closely
resemble broadcast networks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this merger activity is being fueled by the unprecedented
rise in Internet stock prices. Investors are bidding up the stocks
of companies _ no matter how young, unprofitable or implausible _
to prices that defy even the most optimistic valuations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on its second day of trading yesterday after its
initial offering, Priceline.com, an Internet service that sells
discount airline tickets, rose in value to $11.7 billion, more than
any airline in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, Ziff Davis sold 14 percent of its online
subsidiary ZDNet. By the end of the day, ZDNet's stock market value
was $2.6 billion, more than the $2.2 billion value of the parent.
The only justification for this would be that Ziff Davis' print
publications _ including PC Magazine, one of the most profitable
publications in the world _ in fact have a negative value.
</P>
<P>
   With values like these, Internet companies simply cannot be
bought by established companies where stocks are valued on profits,
not promise.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Broadcast.com is out of reach for such logical buyers as
CBS or Disney. But it is an easy bite for Yahoo, which can simply
exchange its highly valued stock for that of Broadcast.com. &QL;

INDEX CHARTS RISING COST OF LUXURY ITEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- People with money to burn are spending more of
their cash on the finer things in life, according to the 15th
annual Moet &AMP; Chandon Luxury Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a dozen items deemed essential for ``the ideal
lifestyle in New York'' -- items like a round-trip ticket from New
York to Paris on a Concorde jet, Petrossian Russian beluga caviar
and Dom Perignon champagne -- rose by 3.9 percent last year,
according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
   That means prices for the finer things rose faster than the
government's Consumer Price Index, which charts the cost of goods
that average folks buy. The CPI increased 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the fourth or fifth year of continued,
very strong demand for luxury goods,'' said Stuart Foster, senior
brand manager in charge of U.S. marketing for French champagne
maker Moet &AMP; Chandon. ``If luxury goods can take these kind of
price increases and still (grow), it's very evident that the demand
is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of an Air France Concorde trip to Paris saw the
sharpest increase -- 12.4 percent from $9,704 in 1997 to $10,912
last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end, the cost of a Jaeger-LeCoultre Men's
Reverso Duo 18-carat pink gold watch with bracelet fell 1 percent,
or $990, to $19,800, according to the index.
</P>
<P>
   Though the index is keyed to a New York lifestyle, the same
trend holds true for Beverly Hills and other upscale parts of the
country, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Giss, a partner with the trade retail services group at
the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP in Los Angeles, said
upscale retailers are doing better than mainline retailers in the
area because they're perceived as offering a better quality
product, and thus a good value.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, the discounters are also doing well because they
offer cheaper products.
</P>
<P>
   ``So people are defining value in terms of price and in terms of
quality,'' Giss said.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER CO-CHAIRMEN DENY DEFECTIONS ARE PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler &UR;  &LR; AG responded angrily
Wednesday to recent media reports of managerial troubles after last
year's merger, insisting that the recent defection of a half-dozen
former Chrysler executives did not pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen E. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's co-chairman, said that
whenever companies merged, some executives ended up competing for
similar jobs and the losers left. But DaimlerChrysler has plenty of
executives and can hire more if it needs them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would need somebody from Ford or General Motors, we
would buy them, but we don't need their know-how,'' Schrempp said.
``We have 430,000 employees and about nine have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's other co-chairman, said that
he believed the former Chrysler executives would not divulge any
company secrets to competitors. ``I wouldn't expect our strategy
and confidential matters to be brought into those companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. merged last November in what
was presented at the time as a merger of equals. But it has become
clear that the deal represented a German takeover of the American
automaker, and Germans now fill 9 of the 11 jobs immediately below
the two chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp and Eaton spoke with reporters attending the New York
International Auto Show, using a telephone conference call from
DaimlerChrysler's main headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, after
releasing further details on DaimlerChrysler's financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives very rarely change companies, so any top-level
departures tend to draw attention. Chrysler itself had been
Detroit's biggest beneficiary from hiring executives from rival
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler fought its way back from the brink of collapse in the
early 1980s mainly by introducing the first minivan, for instance,
which was actually developed at the Ford Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. by Harold K.
Sperlich, who moved to Chrysler and took his ideas with him after
Ford decided not to build the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ford is hiring some of Chrysler's best executives. Ford has
already recruited Chrysler's senior vice presidents for vehicle
engineering and minivans, and is widely expected to hire more
former Chrysler executives. Chrysler's executive vice president for
manufacturing has taken early retirement, while the General
Motors &UR;  &LR; Corp. has hired Chrysler's vice president for
communications.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eaton also said Wednesday that he hoped Standard &AMP; Poor's would
reconsider its decision not to include DaimlerChrysler in its index
of 500 large American companies. DaimlerChrysler has a higher
percentage of its sales and revenues from the United States than
some of the largest companies in the S&AMP; P 500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poors had decided last autumn that DaimlerChrysler no
longer qualified as an American company.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of minutes after emphasizing DaimlerChrysler's ties
to the United States, Eaton said that DaimlerChrysler, unlike the
former Chrysler, would not be issuing a proxy statement this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer required to do so because it is not an American
company. As a result, DaimlerChrysler will no longer be disclosing
the compensation of its top executives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler also disclosed Wednesday that its revenues had
risen 6 percent in the first two months of 1999 compared with the
same period in 1998. DaimlerChrysler had already announced on Feb.
25 that its net income rose 29 percent last year. &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The top civilian and military leaders of
NATO settled on a strategy of bombing alone against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic despite several military assessments
and intelligence warnings, and even a clue from a Yugoslav general,
that bombs without ground forces could not stop Serb forces from
launching a purge in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The finger-pointing over missed signals and suggestions of
mismanagement began to surface here and in Washington as the second
week of the bombing campaign began with no sign that Milosevic was
buckling, and no idea how it would end.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners, for example, said they warned the
administration publicly and privately that Milosevic was likely to
strike out viciously against the Kosovo Albanians as soon as a
possibility of military actions was raised, and that he would use
the period of negotiations in France to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Pentagon, in this building, we were not surprised by
what Milosevic has done,'' the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon,
said today. ``I think there is historical amnesia here if anyone
says they are surprised by this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the months of planning for a crisis over Kosovo,
a ranking officer in Brussels said Wednesday that the allies chose
bombing because none of them was willing to take the risk of
sending in the 100,000 to 200,000 troops they thought it would take
to keep the Serbs from having their way with the 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reiterated his aversion to using ground troops
today in an interview on CBS's ``60 Minutes II'' program. ``The
thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a
hostile situation, into Kosovo and into the Balkans, is the
prospect of never being able to get them out,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   That determination left NATO with only the option of using its
air forces. ``We said from the outset that we couldn't prevent
atrocities and crimes against humanity with just an air campaign,''
the officer in Brussels said. ``But knowing that we had to keep an
alliance of 19 nations together, we knew that if we asked for
ground troops we would be asking the impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of ground forces persisted despite growing signs
of Milosevic's real intentions, including a remarkable signal from
a Yugoslav general last October, that senior military officials in
Brussels now admit they missed. Had such signs been heeded, some
officials now argue, politicians might have overcome their aversion
to the use of troops.
</P>
<P>
   The clue the allies missed, a high NATO officer said, came in a
tense pre-dawn conversation in Belgrade early last Oct. 25 between
Gen. Momcilo Perisic, then chief of the Yugoslav armed forces, and
two NATO generals who had come to demand fulfillment of promises to
withdraw army and police units from Kosovo that Milosevic had made
to U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO officers, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, the alliance's
senior military officer, and Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, the supreme allied commander, were sitting with Perisic in
the Presidential Palace, one officer said, when the Yugoslav
officer suddenly sent a police escort out of the room and turned up
the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he thought the army was the only democratic
institution left in Yugoslavia, and that he knew that conflict with
NATO would inflict terrible damage to it,'' the military officer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic seemed to be trying, this officer said, to make it clear
that preserving the army from the destruction, the threat the two
western generals had made if Milosevic did not relent, was more
important to him than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Naumann left Belgrade with the commitments they had
come for, but a month later, Perisic was removed from office, and
soon after that, Milosevic began totally disregarding his pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think now that Perisic was removed because he didn't agree
to the plan,'' the officer said. That meant, he said, that the
Yugoslav authorities were developing the drastic solution to the
Kosovo problem at the same time as they were making their false
promises to Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic's dismissal came after the replacement of the head of
the Yugoslav Air Force, Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, on Oct. 30, as
well as the dismissal of the head of the internal security service,
Javica Stanisic, on Oct. 27. Some NATO officers now believe that
this was part of a broad change in Serbia's strategic leadership in
preparation for the offensive now under way in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And political authorities in Washington and in Europe also
disregarded or downplayed other warnings of what the Serbs were up
to.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration and congressional officials in Washington,
for example, cited a American military intelligence assessment
completed shortly before the allied air campaign that concluded
Milosevic intended to ethnically cleanse 1.8 million Albanians
within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington dismissed the plan as foolish Serbian
bravado and confidently boasted that tough Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters, plus a few days of allied bombing, would be enough to
show Milosevic that he was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of planning on sending in ground forces, President
Clinton and other leaders spent months threatening Serbia with
bombing while sending diplomats to try to negotiate a peace
settlement they were almost sure Milosevic would accept.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton was devoting much of his energy to fighting
impeachment charges in Congress. Milosevic, for his part, used the
months to prepare a vast expulsion of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic soon demonstrated that he had no intention of carrying
out his commitments, but the allies did not begin to reactivate the
bombing threats they had used to extract those promises from him
until the beginning of the year. By then, violence by both Kosovo
Liberation Army Albanian irregulars and Serbian forces had made a
mockery of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of scores of unarmed Albanian civilians in the
village of Racak early in January increased pressure in allied
capitals for diplomatic action, backed by the threat of force, to
stop such outrages by Serbian military and police units in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the allies had done throughout the mounting crisis, they
followed the lead of the six-nation ``contact group'' of countries
_ the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia _
that were trying to find a political settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That, some allied military officers now believe, was a mistake,
since Russia was consistently opposed to bombing or any other NATO
action against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations by the Europeans about letting the alliance act
without an explicit mandate from the United Nations Security
Council, a mandate Russia seemed certain to veto there, built in
further delay. But on Jan. 29, backed by NATO, the Contact Group
demanded that the Serbs and the Albanians come to Rambouillet
Castle in France on Feb. 6 to negotiate a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30, the allies gave NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
authority to tell Gen. Clark to bomb targets on Yugoslav territory
if it took bombing to get the Serbs to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   It took the allies _ 16 of them then, before Poland, Hungary,
and the Czech Republic came in earlier this month _ most of the day
to get to that point. Still, they hemmed in Solana's freedom to
decide to launch the bombers, conditioning the move on a concurring
assessment by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the biggest mistake we made was agreeing to be
taken hostage by the Contact Group,'' one allied officer said. ``It
hurt solidarity within the alliance, and some of the non-Contact
Group countries reacted to it like a Spanish bull to a red flag.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the peace talks started in Rambouillet, NATO officials said,
allied intelligence began picking up disturbing signs that Serb
army forces were moving into position into and within 50 miles to
the north of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these troop movements, they said, were masked as
``winter exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought they were preparing for some kind of a
military solution in the spring,'' he said. ``We anticipated that
he would try to wipe out the Kosovo Liberation Army and not be very
nice to the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presumption, officers said, was that the Serbs would
concentrate on KLA strongholds, and not go after civilians en
masse.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a peace agreement, to be enforced by a 28,000-member
NATO force, including 4,000 U.S. troops, administration officials
in Washington said there were varying assumptions about what action
Yugoslavia would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fighting escalates in the spring, as we expect, it will be
bloodier than last year's,'' the director of Central Intelligence,
George Tenet, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade will seek to crush the KLA once and for all, while
the insurgents will have the capability to inflict heavier
casualties on Serb forces,'' he said. ``Both sides likely will step
up attacks on civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier fighting also will result in another humanitarian
crisis, possibly greater in scale than last year's, which created
250,000 refugees and internally displaced persons along with
hundreds of destroyed buildings and homes,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Though using ground troops was not an option, administration
officials said, neither was standing by and allowing the fighting
to resume.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Last fall, NATO conducted a confidential assessment that
determined it would take 100,000 to 200,000 allied troops to invade
and secure Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were adamantly opposed to
sending ground troops in Kosovo without a clearly defined mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cohen was dead set against it,'' said one former senior
Defense Department official. ``It wasn't kind of thing we could
quickly get in, win it and get out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, State Department and White House officials said,
Congress, which only reluctantly backed air strikes, would oppose
NATO ground troops. And none of the allies were willing to send
ground troops on a combat mission to Kosovo unless the United
States went with them.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the administration had mustered the political will to
mount a 200,000-member force, it would have taken months to move
that many troops into place. Pentagon officials also warned that
such a deployment would likely only provoke Milosevic to attack
before it was completed.
</P>
<P>
   So the administration and NATO decided to use air power alone,
for all its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff and NATO generals recognized that
bombing alone had never successfully driven out a dug-in land army.
</P>
<P>
   But some senior officials in the administration believed
Milosevic would fold under withering air strikes
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic came to the bargaining table after NATO bombing and a
Croatian army offensive that put Bosnian Serb forces on the run for
the first time in the war there. But in Kosovo, only the ragtag
army faced Serb forces on the ground, the forces of the heavily
armed Yugoslav National Army.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rambouillet talks broke off on Feb. 23 to give both
sides time to reconsider, the Serb buildup continued. It was still
underway, along with attacks on civilians, when the talks resumed
in Paris on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Gen. Clark was saying publicly that close to
30,000 Serb troops had been sent into the province, more than
double the number Milosevic had pledged to keep to in October.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton administration officials were also
watching with growing anxiety the buildup of some 40,000 Yugoslav
armored troops on the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies remained confident that if the bombing was
intense enough, it would ``break the will of the leadership'' in
Belgrade, as the operational order for ``Operation Allied Force''
now puts it, to continue to defy the will of the international
community in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But after March 18, when the Albanian delegation signed a draft
agreement providing autonomy and NATO peacekeepers for the
province, Serb operations began on a scale the alliance had not
anticipated, according to allied officers here and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's negotiators refused to sign the agreement in Paris.
As 1,500 unarmed civilian observers of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe pulled out March 20 in
anticipation of NATO strikes, more than 40,000 Serb soldiers and
paramilitary police were already beginning to clear vast swatches
of countryside and entire towns of their ethnic Albanian
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we presumably underestimated was the velocity and
ferocity of the campaign to shift the ethnic balance of Kosovo,'' a
senior officer said here.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the military have a fool-proof air campaign against a
Serb offensive that dispersed its armor, to hide from NATO
fighter-bombers, confident that allied troops would not punch into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time NATO began bombing on March 24, NATO officials say,
it was too late to do much to counter the Serb plans beyond
fine-tuning the plans the alliance had already made for a less
catastrophic scenario.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late now, Solana said Tuesday, to draw up plans for
intervention with ground troops to force the Serbs to stop their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies can do, officers and civilian officials alike
say, is ratchet up the bombing and continue it long enough, at a
destructive enough level, to make the original assumption still
valid.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the officials still insist that the bombing can
``break the will'' of Milosevic and his new military and police
commanders. But now they say it could take weeks instead of days,
as they originally hoped.

<P>
   In a nation that the Supreme Court believes has achieved
color-blindness, the murder indictments issued Tuesday against four
white police officers in New York tell a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   Race bias has been treated as a theoretical issue by the
justices, but it is a daily, street-level torment for millions of
Americans. At its worst, it is perpetrated not only by neighbors
but by government agents, especially those trained and armed to
protect the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   The bare facts of the New York case are well known. On Feb. 4,
four plainclothes officers in search of a rapist encountered Amadou
Diallo, 22, in front of his Bronx home. Sensing, they said later,
that Diallo might be reaching for a weapon, the cops blew him away.
Forty-one shots were fired; 19 hit their target. Diallo, a West
African immigrant, had no gun.
</P>
<P>
   Gross police overreaction is certainly involved here, and some
may see no need to stress the racial element. Such a killing would
warrant a murder indictment even if no prejudice were involved.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine that this slaughter would have taken
place if Diallo had been white or the police had been of different
races. And it is impossible to imagine that the response of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir would have
been so callous and slow. Belatedly, Safir is talking about
assigning more minority officers to the Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of continuing race bias in America are evident in
stacks of statistics relating to education, income, health, and
nearly every aspect of life.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic and worrisome examples are those in which
racist actions are carried out by law enforcement personnel _ the
very people designated to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case is extreme, but it is not alone. Anyone who
thinks it is is truly blind.

   MALIBU, Calif. _ Former Pepperdine teammates Jim Harrick Jr. and
Marty Wilson both said Wednesday they have applied for the vacant
men's head basketball position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a family feud,'' Wilson quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, an assistant at UC Santa Barbara, played at Pepperdine
from 1984-89. Harrick, an assistant at Rhode Island under his
father, played from 1983-87. The two former Waves join
well-respected Pepperdine assistant Randy Bennett and UCLA
assistants Michael Holton and Jim Saia as confirmed applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are eight or nine names in the hat and I hope
to be one of the four or five (to interview),'' Harrick said from
his office. ``I'm very familiar with the Pepperdine infrastructure
and its surrounding area.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's father, Jim, was named the head coach at Georgia on
Wednesday, but that university's nepotism rules make it impossible
for Harrick to bring his son along.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Harrick, 34, has never been a head coach. In
addition to Rhode Island, he has been an assistant at San Diego
State, Valparaiso and Marshall. While at San Diego State, Harrick
was an assistant under Tony Fuller, a former head coach at
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've kept it in the Jim Harrick family tree for so long,''
Harrick said, referring to the fact that former Harrick Sr.
assistants Tom Asbury and Lorenzo Romar have been head coaches in
Malibu. ``That tree has been pretty good to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who became the interim head coach at Pepperdine midway
through the 1995-96 season when Fuller resigned, also was an
assistant at the University of San Diego for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very interested,'' said Wilson, 32. ``I know quite a few
people (at Pepperdine).''
</P>
<P>
   UC Santa Barbara head coach Bob Williams, meanwhile, said he
isn't interested in leaving UCSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy (here),'' said Williams, who guided the Gauchos
to a 15-13 record last season, including 12-4 in the Big West,
after winning the Division II national championship at UC Davis.
``I love the young players and I love the recruits.''

<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ Kosovo could be a template for the century
to come.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis there, which has produced a stern test for NATO and a
catastrophe for the ethnic Albanians who form the province's
overwhelming majority, bears little resemblance to the Cold War
that shaped the last half of this century. It is not about
ideology. It does not directly involve the vital political or
economic interests of the great powers. It carries with it no
threat of nuclear annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it presents precisely the kind of problem that the Western
democracies, for all their wealth and military might, find it most
difficult to cope with. And it is likely to be repeated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike World War II, or even Korea or Vietnam, crises like this
take place in a twilight zone, full of uncertainty, where rules are
formulated (and broken) as the participants choose. It is hard to
measure who is winning, sometimes harder to know who has won.
</P>
<P>
   One catalyst for the Kosovo ``war,'' if that is the correct
term, is the mounting belief in much of Europe and North America
that human rights matter more than national sovereignty _ that no
leaders, whether democratically chosen or self-appointed, have the
right to slaughter their citizens. Another is modern television.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing in Kosovo, a clear sign that the West puts a
higher priority on human rights than on sovereignty, began a week
ago. On that same day, England's highest court ruled that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean president, could be extradited
to Spain, even though under Chilean law he is exempt from
prosecution for the offenses alleged, which occurred in his own
country.
</P>
<P>
   Both events dramatized the weakening of sovereignty, a
development that disturbs both China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If slaughter and television come together, as they did in
Kosovo, ``right-minded'' people in Europe and America demand that
their own governments do something about it. (If television is
absent, as it largely was from the genocide in Rwanda, the demand
is much less insistent, however great the loss of innocent life may
prove to be.)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is often in no position to act. Such is the
case this time, with Moscow and Beijing ready to cast vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   So the burden falls upon the Western democracies, which usually
means the United States, acting in concert with NATO, as in Kosovo,
through an ad hoc alliance, as in the Persian Gulf War, or
sometimes alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ardor for human rights, even when fanned by violence
and misery on the television screen, stops well short of heedless
passion. Few American or French or Belgian families are willing to
risk the lives of large numbers of their sons and daughters in
ground combat; because of the Vietnam quagmire, which still
registers powerfully on the American political consciousness, the
reluctance to commit ground troops is especially marked in the
United States, particularly when the underlying strategic goals are
ill-defined.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to this paradox, so far at least, is air power: bombs
and cruise missiles, launched from as far away and as high an
altitude as possible to minimize the chances of a pilot's being
captured. For television can cut two ways: pictures of human
calamity can arouse the Western world to act, but pictures of
Western soldiers or airmen dying or suffering humiliation, as in
Somalia, can quickly discourage action.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, air power may not prove adequate. In the case of
Kosovo, it has given the Serbs time to intensify their campaign
against the ethnic Albanians. Like the air strikes against
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, these may have caused a
stiffening rather than a weakening of resolve. And even if the
bombs eventually cripple the military forces of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, it may be too late; most of the ``ethnic
cleansing'' may already have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility for additional action is sending arms to the
Kosovo Liberation Army. Another is to try to foment a military coup
against Milosevic. Still another is to begin laying a political
predicate for sending in NATO ground troops. Clearly, some of the
NATO allies would resist such a move, and President Clinton has
said he has no intention of committing Americans in an offensive
role.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton has compared Milosevic to Hitler, just as President
George Bush compared Saddam to Hitler. Either Clinton's words were
hyperbole, or his present means are inconsistent with the problem
at hand. It took Bush a long time, but he sold the American people
and several key allies on the idea that sweeping Saddam from Kuwait
was worth the loss of many Western lives.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to do so in part because he was able to convince
people that Saddam's aggressiveness constituted a strategic threat
to Western oil supplies. But NATO's strategic goal this time is
unclear. Clinton has spoken of degrading the Serbians' ability to
wage war against the Kosovo Albanians. President Jacques Chirac of
France said on Tuesday that Europe could no longer tolerate either
Milosevic or his regime.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a diplomatic deal remains dim as long as NATO
insists, as it did after the attempted Russian mediation this week,
that its troops be allowed to monitor any peace in Kosovo _ an idea
that profoundly offends the Serbs. More likely is an indecisive,
lingering conflict, not unlike the one in Iraq, with the dictator
still in power and the West repeatedly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said a Balkan diplomat who knows Milosevic
and talks with him often. ``The man pays attention, and he has
watched Saddam Hussein gain strength as the bombs have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The two situations are different, of course. Saddam is not
currently engaged in ethnic cleansing, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo and Iraq closely resemble each other in one crucial
respect: neither problem seems susceptible to a short, sharp
solution. Wars like the one in the Falkland Islands look like a
thing of the past.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In its final sprint to the 10,000 mark, a peak once
scarcely imagined, the Dow Jones industrial average showed that
stock market investors intensified what had already seemed an
inexhaustible preference for the biggest and best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all the big names _ the big caps,'' said Alfred
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, in
reviewing the first three months of 1999 Wednesday as managers
finished dressing their portfolios for client inspection. ``We're
in a very selective market, so the deal is, you've got to buy the
big-name stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action, however, was not entirely a matter of
professionals adding recent winners and shedding losers, since the
market suffered a late sinking spell that pushed the Dow 127.1
points lower to pare its gain for the quarter to 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, also dominated by large companies,
lost a proportionally similar amount to finish the quarter ahead by
4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since the final quarter of 1996 that the
Dow beat the S&AMP;P, and it did so despite a 35 percent skid by Philip
Morris Co. Much of that slide came this week after an Oregon jury
ordered the company to pay $81 million in damages to the family of
a Marlboro smoker who died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Standard &AMP; Poor's indexes of medium-sized and small
companies slumped 7 percent and 9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have the large-capitalization, global growth
companies leading the market and still have the narrowness that
prevailed last year,'' said Timothy O'Grady, senior portfolio
manager for First Capital Group in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Software, computer and many other high-technology companies also
sparkled, with Microsoft rising 29 percent, to finish at $89.625,
where its total value surpassed $450 billion, 25 percent more than
the No. 2 General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market, which is heavily weighted with technology,
spurted 12 percent over the winter, with CMGI, which develops and
operates Internet and direct marketing companies, soaring 244
percent, to finish at $183.0625. Amazon.com, the Internet
bookseller, jumped 61 percent, to $172.1875, to surpass the price
of Yahoo, the leading Internet search directory, at $168.375, up 42
percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the high-technology winners were brokerage houses,
airlines and various retailers, beneficiaries of continued avid
consumer spending that itself is partly fueled by rising stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup posted the biggest gain among Dow stocks _ although it
was not the biggest contributor to the average's 605-point gain _
as it climbed 29 percent, to $63.875, more than double its low of
last October when foreign economic turmoil was its most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette paced a
giant run-up in brokerage firm stocks, which were badly battered
last year. Each of them rebounded 70 percent during the latest
quarter. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter climbed 41 percent, Lehman
Brothers and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. by about one-third, and Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co. by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, aided by low fuel prices, as well as free-spending
travelers, were led by Delta and Southwest, each up 33 percent, and
UAL, which rose 30 percent. AMR, which experienced a 10-day sickout
by its pilots, and US Airways, however, edged lower.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailers, Consolidated Stores, up 50 percent, and Dollar
General, up 44 percent, posted some of the biggest gains. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., the No. 1 retailer, gained 13 percent to push its
market capitalization _ what it would theoretically cost to buy
every share _ above the $200 billion level.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were mixed, with American Home Products 16 percent
higher, Pfizer up 11 percent and Merck up 9 percent. Abbott,
Bristol-Myers and Eli Lilly all lost between 4 and 5 percent, while
Warner-Lambert, maker of the controversial diabetes drug, Rezulin,
lost 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities weakened as interest rates crept higher, with the S&AMP;P
utility index falling 10 percent. Nonetheless, there was little
sign of faster inflation, and precious metals turned in another
poor performance, with the Philadelphia gold and silver index
slipping 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the Dow after millenary milestones has advanced
in the following quarter on two of every three occasions, and has
also done better than other market indexes. Its biggest rise was
12.5 percent after the average hit 6,000 in late 1996, according to
LIM Research.com. The biggest loss was 1.2 percent in the quarter
following the Dow's July 1997 surge to 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The research company also noted that the Russell 2000
underperformed the general market in the quarter following seven of
the last eight 1,000-point milestones.

MICROSOFT TRIAL COULD DRAG INTO 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge in the Microsoft antitrust
trial Wednesday tentatively set May 10 as the date for the trial to
resume and laid out a longer timetable for additional testimony,
oral arguments and written submissions, virtually ensuring that the
trial will not end much before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from the fast-track trial originally
anticipated. When the Justice Department filed the landmark
antitrust suit last May, government lawyers and the judge, Thomas
Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, said that because the
issues were urgent, the trial would proceed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to devote the month of September to this
trial,'' the judge said then. He was talking about September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial did not get started until the end of October, and
first stage, cross-examination of each side's witnesses, took more
than four months _ far longer than anyone had expected. Microsoft
generally spent four or five days cross-examining each of the
government's 12 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted trial ensures that the government will fail to
achieve its pre-eminent goal in filing the suit last May 19 _ to
stop the bundling of a Web browser with Microsoft's new operating
system, Windows 98, which had not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last spring, responding to Microsoft's request that the
start of the trial be postponed until January 1999, Jackson said:
``By the time you propose to be ready, 16 to 18 million horses will
already be out of the barn, and that's too late.'' The ``horses''
to which he referred were copies of Windows 98, which went on sale
last June.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of this year, Windows 98 will be near the end of
its life span; the next version, Windows 2000, is scheduled to be
released early next year. Already, tens of millions of personal
computers have Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer,
installed by default.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts say now that if Microsoft loses, the
government will ask for remedies that would set broader rules for
the future rather than attempting to mediate current behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry moves too fast,'' a senior government official
involved in the case said Wednesday. ``Just look at what has
happened already during the course of this trial. This argues for
broader remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trial was under way, America Online agreed to buy
Microsoft's major competitor in the browser market, the Netscape
Communications Corp., and began cooperating with Sun Microsystems
on new Web browsers and related technology.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from those three companies testified against
Microsoft at the trial, and Microsoft argued that the new alliances
evinced strong competition in the industry, making the antitrust
suit unnecessary _ a point of view the government disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And last summer, a federal appeals court ruled in Microsoft's
favor in a related, earlier case, saying the company had the right
to bundle its browser with Windows if the combination benefitted
consumers. After that, the focus of the government's case seemed to
shift to emphasize issues like Microsoft's contracts with computer
makers and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   It remains possible that the two sides will settle the case in
the next few weeks, eliminating any need for further trial
proceedings. They held two hours of talks at the Justice Department
Tuesday evening and plan to meet again _ though officials decline
to say where or when. Tuesday evening's session was described as
cordial but inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   During the scheduling hearing in court Wednesday, neither
Jackson nor the litigants made any mention of the talks. Outside
the courtroom afterward, representatives of Microsoft, the Justice
Department and the 19 states that joined in the suit stood before
reporters to say that none of them would discuss the settlement
talks while they were under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are going to be productive settlement discussions,
they must not take place publicly,'' said David Boies, the
government's lead trial lawyer, who took part in Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and Microsoft executives all seemed to be
viewing the talks seriously Wednesday. Last week, Justice
Department lawyers were dismissive of Microsoft's approach for
settlement discussions, calling it nothing more than a public
relations maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The May 10 date for resumption of the trial is tentative because
Jackson is hearing another trial now and said he was not sure when
it would end. When the Microsoft trial does resume, each side will
present three rebuttal witnesses, and each witness is expected to
spend about one week on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   After that, in roughly 30-day intervals, the litigants each file
findings of fact. They both offer oral arguments. After an expected
summer vacation, the judge will issue his own findings of fact.
After that, the litigants file conclusions of law. Finally, late
this year _ or possibly early next year _ the judge will issue his
ruling.

<P>
   PARIS _ The international war crimes tribunal disclosed
Wednesday that it had warned Yugoslav officials they would be held
accountable for violence against civilians in Kosovo and announced
that it had indicted the notorious Serbian militia leader known as
Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan, whose real name is Zeljko Raznjatovic, was secretly
indicted on Sept. 30, 1997, in connection with war crimes during
the fighting after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Officials at the
tribunal in the Hague said they had decided to publicize it now
because of reports that he and his men were terrorizing civilians
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A warrant for his arrest was sent to the Yugoslav government
Wednesday, but it is expected that it will be ignored because the
government does not accept the authority of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The government also rejected the letters sent to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and 12 senior officials, warning them
that they would be held accountable for their actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Louise Arbour, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, said the
letter had been faxed to the Yugoslav government on March 26, but
on Monday, the Yugoslav Embassy in the Hague refused to accept the
originals of the letters. Therefore, Arbour said she was forced to
publicize the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my intention to investigate all serious violations of
international humanitarian law that merit prosecution in the
international forum, particularly those involving attacks on the
civilian population,'' Arbour wrote. Her letter also criticized the
Yugoslav government for refusing tribunal investigators access to
Kosovo. The investigators have been amassing evidence of atrocities
against civilians in Kosovo since last summer, but the team, which
has limited means, depends in part on intelligence provided by
Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials who are usually discreet in public, have
expressed frustration in private that they are not getting enough
information.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour showed some of that frustration Wednesday, as she told
reporters: ``In recent days, the U.S., the U.K. and NATO have
indicated publicly that they have evidence of the commission of
crimes within our jurisdiction, including information about the
perpetrators, and that they will share this information with my
office. I expect to be provided with this information on a
continuous basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Arkan did not come altogether as a surprise.
He was known to be under investigation, but tribunal officials
hoped to make it easier to arrest him by keeping it secret. The
prosecutor's office Wednesday refused to reveal the charges against
Arkan or publish the indictment. ``Publishing the indictment and
the charges could compromise the witnesses,'' a tribunal official
said. ``A man like him, with his capacity for violence, might
eliminate witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The war record of Arkan is well-documented. A man wanted in
connection with bank robberies and other crimes in six European
countries before the war, he created a paramilitary group, known as
the Tigers, in late 1991. His armed gang worked closely with
Serbian secret police and military, at first in Croatia and later
in Bosnia. The group has been accused of some of the most vicious
and rapid ``ethnic cleansing'' of 1992 as they went into towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have said the Tigers went on rampages of killing,
looting and raping until they had achieved what they wanted,
forcing non-Serbs to flee their homes. One of the most bloody
operations Arkan was accused of being involved in was in Bijeljina
in eastern Bosnia, where non-Serbs were violently forced out in
1992. It also has been alleged that Arkan and his Tigers killed
hundreds of Muslim men they had locked up in a sports center in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Arkan denied that he was
a war criminal and rejected accusations that he had killed innocent
people. He said the indictment was unsealed ``because of the
political situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, American and British officials have said that
Arkan had been seen in Kosovo and that he and paramilitary
followers were involved in the Serbian brutality against ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan said in the interview that his men were not involved in
Kosovo but that he would be willing to defend his country against
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan has appeared on television in Belgrade to deny that he had
recruited volunteers to act in Kosovo. But in an interview with
Reuters Television he warned of ``a new Vietnam in the heart of
Europe'' if NATO brought ground troops into its conflict with
Belgrade.

WAITING FOR THE ENCORE
</HEADLINE>

By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram

<P>
   What can baseball do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   It has endured a nefarious World Series fix, unpopular strikes,
sanctioned bigotry, world wars, multi-million dollar free agents,
and innately myopic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an imperative part of the American culture before
football had a forward pass and basketball had even made it out of
the YMCAs.
</P>
<P>
   It has given us legendary names that have become a standard part
of the nation's vernacular like Ruth and Gehrig and Cobb and
DiMaggio and Robinson and Mantle and Mays and Koufax and Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, baseball, that quintessential American pastime, that gentle,
slow-moving endeavor that preoccupies our sporting thoughts from
March through October, that graceful skit that can so abruptly
erupt into a riveting drama that can leave you thrilled with
ecstasy or steeped in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   It is now set to commence its final season of the 20th century,
and one can't help but idly wonder what the sport can do for an
encore after its storied act last year when it ruled the summer
with unprecedented heroics dispensed by its array of noble
performers.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, considering what unfolded throughout that epic summer of
1998 when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were obliterating Babe Ruth
and Roger Maris, when the New York Yankees wound up the year with
125 victories, when the sport reached popularity levels and
established attendance records unrivaled in its history, you wonder
if our sacred national pastime is destined for a slightly less
glamorous odyssey on its way to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It is the intrinsic allure of baseball that one never knows for
sure what will happen on the ball fields even off them, for that
matter and the fickleness and unpredictability of the game itself
are what make it so difficult to handicap.
</P>
<P>
   If one, say, were to predict a year ago at this time that Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa would combine for 136 home runs and keep an
entire country transfixed throughout the season by their astounding
batting accomplishments, the person would have come under the same
severe ridicule had he been so outlandishly brash as to predict
that the Dodgers soon would be getting rid of their great hitting
catcher, Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the shock of the citizenry that resides in Southern
California, the Dodgers did just that in the first major move
consummated by Rupert Murdoch's new Fox management team.
</P>
<P>
   The decision still inspires a sour taste among most Dodger
patrons the notoriously moody and brittle Gary Sheffield is all the
team now has to show for Piazza's departure but the Dodgers did in
the off-season take a far more aggressive posture than it had under
its previous caretaker, Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike O'Malley, a timid soul who kept his general manager, Fred
Claire, under a tight financial leash, Murdoch gave his general
manager, Kevin Malone, a blank check to strengthen the team.
</P>
<P>
   Malone did just that when he handed that seven-year, $105
million contract over to one of baseball's most renowned pitchers,
Kevin Brown, in a stunning transaction that was roundly condemned
around baseball especially by the small-market teams as a classic
example of the inequity that now afflicts the game.
</P>
<P>
   What else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its existence this century, baseball, for the most
part, has been dominated by its wealthiest franchises, going back
to when the New York Yankees began their lengthy reign by being
able to purchase Babe Ruth from a financially-struggling Boston Red
Sox team.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Atlanta Braves have been perennial World Series
contenders throughout the 1990s they've appeared in the Fall
Classic four times because of the stellar genius of their manager,
Bobby Cox, who's actually a shameless bumbler, or the deep pockets
of their billionaire owner, Ted Turner?
</P>
<P>
   It's now quite apparent that Murdoch, a long-time bitter rival
of Turner on the international cable television scene, is obsessed
with overtaking Turner's Braves in the National League, giving
Kevin Malone the freedom to wheel and deal in high stakes signings
that the ousted Claire never was given by O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt with the presence of Brown and a new manager
with a proven record of success, Davey Johnson, that the Dodgers
will be a more formidable outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they will be making their first World Series
appearance since 1988, as Malone so loudly predicts, is still quite
doubtful in light of the question marks surrounding the people who
will be at third base, shortstop and behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows what will happen? After all, it's baseball, and Mo
Vaughn, scandalously overweight from an off-season of a lot of
important chowing down after the Anaheim Angels gifted him with
more than $80 million, might suddenly break out in a rash of home
runs after a spring in which his bat has remained ominously silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels still do not have enough quality pitchers to make the
Yankees, or even Cleveland Indians, wince, but they do have an
exceptional manager in Terry Collins and they do have just enough
hitters to compete seriously again with another stout-hitting,
erratic-pitching club, the Texas Rangers, for the A.L. West
Division title.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure baseball will have its usual gaggle of
surprises, and one of the biggest could be that the young St. Louis
Cardinal phenomenon, J.D. Drew, might turn out to be a better
hitter I didn't say slugger than Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt McGwire will threaten his home run record of 70 I'm not
sure anyone ever will and I doubt Sosa will approach the 66 he
deposited last season, or realize his dream of leading the Chicago
Cubs into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I also doubt the Yankees will again win 114 regular season
games, and I know the San Diego Padres, stripped of most of the
personnel that was vital to their National League pennant-winning
success last season, won't appear again in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling here is that, come next October, form, which seldom
prevails in baseball, will this time and a sequel to the 1996 World
Series between the Yankees and Braves will be staged.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Yankees begin the season with their manager, Joe
Torre, on the sidelines recovering from prostrate surgery and their
stellar left-handed pitcher, Andy Pettitte, on the disabled list,
but they have added the most overwhelming pitcher in baseball,
Roger Clemens, to a talented mix that includes Derek Jeter, Paul
O'Neill, Bernie Williams, David Cone, Chili Davis, Orlando
Hernandez, Tino Martinez, Mariano Rivera, Scott Brosius, Chuck
Knoblauch and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Braves begin the season without Andres Galarraga, who
was diagnosed with cancer in February, but they have added an
exceptional second baseball, Bret Boone, and hard-hitting outfield,
Brian Jordan, to go with Chipper Jones, Javier Lopez, Andruw Jones
and Ryan Klesko. And no one not even the Yankees has a trio of
starting pitchers better than Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John
Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Braves still have Bobby Cox commanding their troops,
but the team still seems to have too many weapons for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The only certainties in baseball are the uncertainties.

   NEW YORK _ A band of demonstrators in New York on Wednesday
protested the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and U.S. forces, some
wrapping themselves in Serbian flags, some pinning a black target
to their chests as a symbol of solidarity with the people of
Belgrade, nearly all questioning the version of events reported in
the American news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is Serbia,'' they chanted, as they marched from Grand
Central Terminal to the office of The New York Times on 43rd Street
between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some held signs that described NATO as the ``New Albanian
Terroristic Organization.'' Others urged the United States to
devote its resources to schools, not bombs. Teen-age boys and
girls, in red and white Serbian soccer jerseys, pumped their fists
and chanted, ``Serbia!'' as though cheering for a favorite team.
One woman held up a sign that read, ``Kosovo Albanians Seek
Independence in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   If their anger was directed at NATO and U.S. officials, it was
also vented against The New York Times, which has published
editorials in support of the NATO offensive against the forces of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times has become an organ for the bombing,'' said Brian
Becker, co-director of the International Action Center, which
organized the demonstration. ``The editorial position has been
pro-war, and the news coverage has been unbalanced, in keeping with
those who support the KLA and the NATO bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is the Kosovo Liberation Army, a separatist Albanian
guerrilla group in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking what they called the American news media
``anti-Serbian rhetoric,'' the protesters argued that atrocities
against Serbs had received scant attention over the years. Becker
described the guerrillas as a mercenary group financed by
foreigners, akin to the contras in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The police estimated the numbers of protesters at 1,000. The
organizers said there was five times that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Among the demonstrators were Serbian immigrants like Milica
Savic, 27, of Queens, who questioned news reports that Serbian
forces had burned the houses of Kosovo Albanians after having
forced them out in droves. ``That is not true,'' she insisted.
``Who burned those homes? Did you see some Serbians burn those
homes?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her stood a retired Greek immigrant from Astoria, a black
wool military cap on his head and a sea-blue Greek flag in his
hands. He is not much of a protester, he said, but he demonstrated
Wednesday because he recalled his countrymen's shared history with
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what they believe,'' said the man, Emilios Dimitris,
65. ``We have fought the Ottomans together. We have fought the
Nazis together. How do I feel if the Turks take part of my country,
and the Americans support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him stood a young woman with a fashion magazine in her
hand. ``My parents are in Belgrade,'' said the woman, Liliana
Novakovic, 28, suddenly in tears. ``They are very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the bombings began, Ms. Novakovic said, she and many peers
in Belgrade _ college educated, English speaking and even
identifying with America _ had little respect for Milosevic, whom
she called despotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton had left us alone, they would have overthrown
Milosevic,'' said Ms. Novakovic, who left Belgrade eight years ago
for Jersey City. ``This sort of united them. It's sort of like
fighting with your parents. If there is a great danger, you kind of
unite.''

 &HT;    THREE U.S. SOLDIERS MISSING IN MACEDONIA AFTER REPORTED CLASH
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON U.S. combat troops backed by Blackhawk helicopters
were conducting a massive search Wednesday night after three
American soldiers went missing in a firefight along Macedonia's
mountainous border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by British and other NATO search and rescue forces, more
than 80 American troops on the ground and in Blackhawk helicopters
were combing the area late Wednesday, Pentagon officials said,
hours after the missing soldiers' last radio contact with U.S.
forces in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy amid fears that the three might have been
abducted. Pentagon officials said the men were ambushed, but they
did not know by whom. Serb military and paramilitary forces have
been operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans came under small arms fire shortly after
2:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. EST) as they were on what the
Pentagon called ``a routine reconnaissance patrol'' in a Humvee
army vehicle near the town of Kumanovo. The town straddles a major
road leading from the Macedonian capital of Skopje into the
embattled Serb province of Kosovo, site of extensive Serb military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the ambush took place shortly after the three
troops split off from several other Humvees on maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans radioed to a nearby unit that they had come under
fire and were surrounded, the Pentagon said, and then the group
lost radio contact. Joining in the search Wednesday night were
British troops and helicopters, other NATO forces, and Macedonian
police, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops are attached to the First Infantry Division
based in Wurzburg, Germany. The soldiers have been stationed in
Macedonia and attached to a NATO mission there that would make up
the vanguard of a proposed peacekeeping force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has stepped up its patrols along the Macedonia-Kosovo
border since the alliance launched air strikes March 24 against
Serb forces attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the Pentagon said that NATO commander Gen.
Wesley Clark has asked to add 75 carrier-based warplanes to the
allied forces attacking Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The request came as Russia planned to send a fleet of spy ships
off the Balkan coast, sparking a sharp U.S. warning.
</P>
<P>
   While the two developments were not specifically linked, both
pointed to the rising stakes in a week-old air campaign U.S. and
allied officials said is escalating almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth day of attacks struck more deeply than ever into
Yugoslavia and across the province of Kosovo, as NATO's political
arm formally agreed to target military and government facilities in
downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO struck Serb special forces headquarters near the capital
and hit tanks and troops inside Kosovo. At the same time, Serb
forces continued to shell civilians, burn villages and terrorize
entire communities, extending a rampage aimed at expelling ethnic
Albanians from the tiny Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   With supersonic B-1 heavy bombers set to join in the raids on
Thursday, NATO officials insisted that the air strikes were
beginning to bite into the bone of Serb offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Harried from the skies for three straight days, at least one
Serb battle group had been forced to withdraw from attacks in
Kosovo, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving, I'd say almost daily, to a broader set of
targets,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``We'll attack
all the facilities needed to support, fuel and feed the forces, and
we will, as rapidly as possible, choke them off.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serbs continued to force thousands of ethnic Albanians out of
Kosovo, President Clinton ordered $50 million in emergency aid as
part of a broader NATO effort to get desperately needed tents, food
and medicine to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to give a speech on the Kosovo crisis on
Thursday at the Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia, adjacent to the
home port of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier. He's
expected to speak while standing alongside an F-14 Tomcat and F/A18
Hornet, the Navy's top warplanes which are the tip of the spear of
the Roosevelt's firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt is steaming across the Atlantic and due to arrive
in the Mediterranean Sea by this weekend en route to a scheduled
deployment in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the supreme commander of allied forces in Europe, has
asked the Pentagon to task the carrier equipped with 75 Tomcats,
Hornets and other warplanes to the NATO mission, Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said no decision had been made on that
request, or on Clark's request for Apache combat helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt would add extensive firepower to the NATO mission.
It travels with a protective carrier battle group made up of four
warships and an attack submarine, all capable of firing long-range
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots from the ship have flown combat air patrols over the
Balkans before, in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In echoes of the Cold War, Russia announced plans to dispatch a
group of seven Navy ships, including a high-tech spy vessel, to the
waters off the Balkan coast in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp rebuke, the Clinton administration voiced concern
that the move might lend relief to Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia. He warned Moscow to hold to its public vow
not to inject the ships into the NATO conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deployments of these ships, we don't see as a particularly
helpful gesture,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
``We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large deployment
might send to Belgrade and other countries in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Navy's long Cold War experience of having carrier
battle groups tailed by Russian spy ships had taught U.S. sailors
and airmen how to protect their communications and operations from
eavesdropping by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the most powerful ally of its Slavic brethren in Serbia,
has opposed the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The allied military campaign continued apace on Wednesday, with
NATO reporting that the city of Orahovac, in southwestern Kosovo,
was being emptied of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Still unaccounted for as of Wednesday were thousands of ethnic
Albanians reportedly forced by Serbs to march into concentrated
areas near the provincial capital of Pristina and several
surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Serbs were following up forced expulsions by
wiping out public records of the lives of ethnic Albanians driven
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Property deeds, marriage licenses, birth certificates,
financial and other records, public records, are being
systematically destroyed,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told
reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``This is a kind of
Orwellian scenario of attempting to deprive a people and a culture
of the sense of past and the sense of community on which it
depends.''

BUSH RAISES $6 MILLION PLUS IN LESS THAN A MONTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In less than 30 days and without holding a
single organized fund-raiser, Gov. George W. Bush has pulled in
more than $6 million for his likely presidential campaign,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-popping figure puts Bush well ahead of other GOP
hopefuls and brings him in line with the $7 million haul that
Democratic Vice President Al Gore is reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been outpacing Republican rivals and even Gore in
national polls, said he is honored by the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure that behind the polls and the phone
calls, that there was some substance,'' Bush said. ``I think this
is the first indication that there is true support.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticized recently for vague statements on issues ranging from
abortion to Kosovo, Bush said his financial support indicates that
people are comfortable with his stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of people would write a check like that
unless they knew where my heart is, what my intentions are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The money has been rolling in even though Bush has not appeared
at any fund-raisers or, as he put it, gone ``dialing for dollars.''
He did say he made a few phone calls to thank supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although raising more than $200,000 a day is impressive, it is
not clear whether Bush can reach the goal of forgoing federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, to be made in the fall, would cost the campaign
about $15 million in federal funding but it would allow Bush to
ignore state-by-state spending limits and thus direct his resources
where they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Bush would have to raise about $50 million to give
up federal campaign funding. In 1996, President Clinton raised
about $30 million for his primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-quarter money is the easy money,'' said University
of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. ``Am I impressed by
the $6 million? Sure. Show me the second quarter and I'll be more
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter for Bush included 27 days. He formed his
exploratory committee March 4, and the time period for the
financial disclosure report ended Wednesday. The final total, which
aides say could rise, will be reported to the Federal Elections
Commission on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates typically let the news out before the deadline,
and Wednesday was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised at least $7 million in the first quarter,'' a
Gore 2000 spokesman said. The aide said that the funds have come
from more than 40,000 donors since Feb. 1, and that 77 percent of
the contributions have been from supporters who gave $200 or less.
Gore is planning a series of major fund-raisers this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican field, ex-Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is
expected to report between $700,000 and $800,000, and former Vice
President Dan Quayle will report raising about $2 million, aides
said. Among other GOP hopefuls, Arizona Sen. John McCain, Ohio Rep.
John Kasich and conservative activist Gary Bauer are reporting
about $1 million each in donations.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, Bush's closest GOP competitor, declined to join
the numbers game immediately. ``We are not going to officially
release any figures today,'' a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter reports cover the period through June, and
Bush said he would be ``very pleased'' if he could raise the same
amount as this quarter, for a total of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced his fund-raising figures on the same day he held
a ``Conference on Youth,'' which focused on strategies to combat
drug, alcohol and tobacco use, teen-age pregnancy and sexually
transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said abstinence is the best strategy to combat the last
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must know that abstinence isn't just saying no to
sex, abstinence is saying yes to a happier and healthier life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those speaking at the conference was former drug czar
William Bennett, author of the bestseller ``The Book of Virtues,''
who said Bush has ``caught the imagination of the American people
to an astounding degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before reporters with Bush later, Bennett addressed
the issue of Bush's ``young and irresponsible'' early years by
saying that mistakes people make when they are young do not taint
them in voters' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish say, you know, the merry-hearted boys make the best
of all men,'' Bennett said. ``Young and male, some of us in
college, some of us in high school, did things we weren't
particularly proud about later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people understand fallibility,'' he added. ``They
understand weakness. They understand youth.''

PATRIOTS MAY SEEK HIGHER DRAFT-PICK STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots made offers to the Oakland
Raiders and Chicago Bears a year ago to move up in the draft and
take either Charles Woodson or Curtis Enis. But when the price got
too steep the Patriots backed off and kept their two No. 1 picks.
</P>
<P>
   Sources indicate that the Patriots, who again have two No. 1
picks (20 and 28), will again make a bid to move up for a chance to
draft either Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of Texas or
Miami's Edgerrin James, the top-rated running backs in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Patriots settled for Robert Edwards, the
third-rated back in the draft, but he wound up being the
second-best rookie back in the league (behind Jacksonville's Fred
Taylor).
</P>
<P>
   Enis was a holdout, then was injured, and his full potential was
never fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots certainly like Mississippi State running back James
Johnson and Louisiana State's Kevin Faulk, but Patriots personnel
realize that Williams would give their running game instant
credibility, even if it means expending so many draft picks (they
have five in the first three rounds) that they can't draft the
offensive lineman _ or two _ they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that Williams may be sliding in the draft or
that his hands are too small and will be fumble-prone, he is the
prize. New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka has recently backed off
of a report that he had offered his entire draft for Williams, but
if quarterbacks are drafted by the first three teams, Indianapolis
would be next in line.
</P>
<P>
   While the Colts have an All-Pro in Marshall Faulk, there have
been reports they would be willing to deal him to take Williams.
Faulk wants to renegotiate his contract to be in line with Curtis
Martin, but Williams would likely cost more.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern that Williams's agents, the Master P
group, might be asking for the moon. That may be the only reason
Williams would drop in the draft. The Colts, too, have more
pressing needs, mainly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Patriots wouldn't have enough to move up to get
Williams, but they could be a player.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston College's Damien Woody, the top-rated center in the
draft, was a visitor at Foxboro Stadium Wednesday. He was given a
physical at Massachusetts General Hospital and then visited with
the Patriots' brass. Woody seems to be moving up the first-round
charts, and there's no guarantee he'll be around when the Patriots
pick. If he is, he may be the choice . . . Scott Zolak hasn't
signed with the Miami Dolphins, but he was in Boca Raton, Fla.,
looking for houses Wednesday. Zolak's agent, Ralph Cindrich, said
he has not spoken recently with the Dolphins . . . Vincent Brisby
will join the team's workout program next week. Troy Brown remains
in West Virginia working on his own. Brown, a loyal participant in
the past, hasn't been pleased with his contract negotiations.

VOTERS STRONGLY BACK ANTISMOKING USE FOR TOBACCO FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- By a more than two to one margin, Massachusetts voters
want at least 25 percent of the $7.6 billion in its tobacco
settlement funds to go toward expanding the state's antismoking
campaign _ a policy Governor Paul Cellucci has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll taken for the American Cancer Society reveals
that 66 percent support a plan for using 25 percent of the funds
for tobacco control, while 30 percent agree with Cellucci's plan to
apply the funds to nonsmoking public health projects.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer society official said Wednesday the poll, taken of 401
voters in early March, proves Cellucci is going against a public
sentiment that strongly supports the state's public health efforts
to curb smoking and wants the programs expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have a keen understanding of the fact that one of the
state's primary reasons for suing the tobacco industry in the first
place was to reduce smoking among kids,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal,
past president of the American Cancer Society. The poll was taken
by Kiley &AMP; Associates of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society, which led the coalition that engineered a
voterapproved cigarette tax hike in 1992 to create the state's
tobacco control program, has called for at least 25 percent of the
national settlement money to be used to expand the project.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci in January proposed creating a special health-care
trust fund that would provide money for children, senior citizens,
and AIDS victims, but offered no money for tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
   With former Attorney General Scott Harshbarger taking the lead,
the attorneys general reached a $206 billion national settlement
with the tobacco industry in November. The agreement, which
distributes the funds over 25 years, specifically calls for using
some of the funds for tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's announcement in January sparked a sharp reaction from
antismoking activists, who have lauded the Massachusetts Department
of Public Health's $30 million a year tobacco control efforts as a
national model. Another $30 million or so is used by the Department
of Education for antismoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposal to spend $500,000 of the settlement money to
evaluate the tobacco control program particularly added to their
concerns. The activists say millions of dollars have been spent to
evaluate the program, and they say those studies have found it
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other state wants to replicate the success of our
tobacco control program,'' said Lori Fresina, director of
government affairs for the American Cancer Society. ``It has become
one of our most popular domestic exports in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the governor brushed aside the poll results,
saying his plan responds to the majority of voters' sentiment
because the national settlement also provides a mechanism for
additional funding for antismoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there's about $28 billion dollars that is part of
the national settlement that is for antitobacco efforts and that
that money will also come back to the states,'' Cellucci said
Wednesday when asked about the poll. ``I think that will provide a
significant increase in our tobacco control efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said that if those funds are not available, he
will consider revising his plan to add settlement money to the
tobacco control program.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco control lawyers who have analyzed the national
settlement said Wednesday that Cellucci's decision to use none of
the money for antismoking projects flies in the face of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document makes it abundantly clear that the money is to do
two things _ to improve public health and to implement
tobacco-related public health measures,'' said Graham Kelder, an
attorney with Northeastern University School of Law's Tobacco
Control Resources Center. ``The AGs clearly intended that part of
the money is to go to tobacco control.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelder said the agreement does create a foundation to which the
industry would contribute $25 million a year for 10 years. The
foundation would provide funding to the 50 states for antismoking
advertising and educational programs.

 &HT;    Stability's a relief for Seanez
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been a surreal spring training for Braves
reliever Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time in a 14-year career, including
stops with eight organizations, that Seanez can feel secure and
work on something other than proving himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Seanez felt that way was in 1995, when he
started the season with the Dodgers. At every other stop, Seanez
started the season wondering where he would end up and if he would
play. Often, it has been the minors or disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But he has found sweet security in the Braves bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good feeling, especially with my wife and two
girls,'' said Seanez, who took some time off this winter after
playing winter ball six of the previous seven years. ``It makes it
so much easier on them.''
</P>
<P>
   After being called up from AAA Richmond on May 30, Seanez became
a fixture in the bullpen. He stayed healthy and proved to be a
valuable setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez had a career-high 50 strikeouts in 36 innings pitched and
was 4-1 with a 2.75 ERA. He went on the disabled list in September
with a muscle tear in his forearm, but was able to return in time
for the postseason, where he pitched a scoreless inning in the
Division Series against Houston and appeared in four games in the
NLCS, allowing two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to remember things I was doing last year and
enjoying myself at the same time, not dwelling on things too much,
not getting too obsessive about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up five earned runs in one outing against the Indians
this spring, but has been dominant in all other appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The key for Seanez is staying off the disabled list, where he
has been six times in his career with arm, back and groin injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call timeout and signal for the trainer,'' Seanez said.
``I'm sure managers were like, `What now? Let's see what happened
this time to this guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's learned not to play if he feels a groin twinge in
the bullpen, and he's learned how to take better care of himself.
He doesn't expect to throw the 100 mph fastball, the one that kept
teams interested despite all his health problems, but his fastball
was clocked at 98 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could be back in the major leagues if I could stay
healthy,'' Seanez said. ``That was pretty much it. Just knowing my
arm is still good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are the third team Seanez has signed with as a
six-year free agent. He's also been traded three times, the last of
which came as a player-to-be-named from the Mets to the Royals in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't make me feel too good,'' Seanez said. ``But it
seems like things turned out good. Some guys get here with a lot of
talent; other guys do the little things. Me? I guess I'm kind of in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez, 30, offers his support to the younger players in the
Braves clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let them know they're not the only ones who've been through
it,'' Seanez said. ``I understand completely how they feel. Usually
stuff works out for guys. It just does.

 &HT;    Glory turned to ignominy with UCLA
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His resume fairly runs the game's gamut. Head coaching
stops at Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island? Been there and there
and there. Won a national championship, fired amid scandal 18
months later and resurrected after a year's exile? Done that and
that and that. And now Jim Harrick has come south, if not quite
full circle.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after loading up the car in his native West
Virginia and driving cross-country to chase his basketball dreams
in California, Harrick has found a new home in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the glory, and then ignominy, of UCLA to a
fresh start at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That which does not destroy you makes you stronger,'' Harrick
said. For all the success he's enjoyed _ 404 wins, 14 NCAA
Tournaments in 19 seasons, a near-miracle at Rhode Island and his
crowning glory, the 1995 NCAA title _ Georgia's new basketball
coach is also known for his controversial firing in November 1996.
It came 20 months after Harrick accomplished what none of John
Wooden's first five successors at UCLA could: He won the national
championship, with a stunning 89-78 upset of defending champ
Arkansas that was orchestrated largely by an Atlanta guard named
Cameron Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Wooden era is over,'' Dollar declared then. ``The Harrick
era has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harrick era ended abruptly, shockingly, two weeks before the
1996-97 season began. The coach admitted to lying to UCLA
officials, who were investigating a recruiting dinner, to protect
two Bruins _ Dollar and Charles O'Bannon _ who were at the dinner.
To read the school's internal report, and especially to hear UCLA
athletics director Peter Dalis, you'd have thought Harrick was the
lizard of Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   There were three recruits but five UCLA players at the dinner at
Monty's, a Westwood restaurant. According to NCAA rules, there can
be only as many players as recruits at such dinners, each player in
effect serving as one recruit's host. The school's internal report
said Harrick had lied to school officials eight times during their
investigation, that he'd falsified an expense report and that
Dollar and O'Bannon weren't entitled to a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick was ``shocked'' when, after eight consecutive 20-win
seasons and the '95 NCAA title, he was fired by Dalis and UCLA
chancellor Charles Young. He refused to resign and said the penalty
``far outweighed the crime, by mountains and miles.'' Harrick said
UCLA could have suspended him for a game or fined him or put him on
probation. Instead, he was gone and out of coaching for a year,
during which he was briefly hospitalized because of stress. UCLA
was placed on minor probation by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``I'm the better for it,'' Harrick said Wednesday. ``I've
grown from that. I'm a better coach for being there, a better
person, a better human being. As you look around the country, those
things happen at a lot of places. I hate to say it, but I guess
it's probably part of the business right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like UCLA. It's a great school, a great institution. Maybe
some of the people in it aren't so great, but the school is a very
fine place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While he had phenomenal success at UCLA, he also had some
difficult times,'' said Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley,
who hired Harrick. ``I did do due diligence on that. I did visit
with the NCAA. There were some mistakes made. There'd be some
question whether those mistakes were justifiable enough to take as
strong an action as was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've discussed (those mistakes) with coach Harrick. He knows
that compliance is A-No. 1 here and that we're going to go the
extra mile to make sure that we're operating within the rules and
regulations of the NCAA. After being assured that's what his
intentions are and that his experience, though hurtful, was a
growing and healing experience, I was convinced he is serious and
felt very good about recommending that Coach Harrick be our
basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dooley knows this: ``We have the best qualified man for the
job.

 &HT;    Georgia hires proven winner
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley summarized
in one brief statement why he hired Jim Harrick as the Bulldogs'
new basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that, wants to do it again,'' Dooley said
Wednesday. ``That's what I liked about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia hired the 60-year-old Harrick, who won a national
championship at UCLA in 1995 but was fired the next year for his
involvement in an illegal recruiting dinner, as its 19th head
coach, succeeding Ron Jirsa, who was fired March 11 after just two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning our commitment was to hire a proven
head coach,'' Dooley said. ``I think it's obvious we far surpassed
our expectations in that regard. ... It's not often a school has a
chance to hire a coach who has won a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick has led three Division I-A programs to 14 NCAA
Tournament appearances in 19 years as a head coach. He comes to
Georgia after leading Rhode Island to the NCAA Tournament in both
of his seasons with the Rams. Including stints at UCLA (191-63) and
Pepperdine (167-97), Harrick is 403-182 (.688).
</P>
<P>
   Harrick, who was making about $350,000 a year at Rhode Island,
agreed in principle to a four-year contract that will pay him
$550,000 a year, plus a $100,000-a-year annuity that will mature in
four years. Dooley said he hopes to have the deal completed in
three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've followed Georgia basketball for many, many years,'' said
Harrick, who was in Athens for the first time. ``I'm very close
friends with (former Bulldogs coaches) Hugh Durham and Tubby Smith,
and I've seen what can be done here and the potential it has. I'm
here because of the great conference we play in and the high-level
basketball that is achieved in this league. ... To me it was almost
a no-brainer to come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harrick originally balked at Georgia's overtures
because of the state's anti-nepotism policy. He said Dooley and UGA
President Michael Adams told him from the beginning that Harrick's
son, Jim Harrick Jr., an assistant on his staff at Rhode Island,
would not be permitted to join him on his Georgia staff. At the
time, Harrick said, ``That would be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it was Harrick's son who cleared the way for his
father to come to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my son and he said, `Dad, you can't not take that
job,''' Harrick said. ``That hurt more than anything, leaving him
behind, and that's the reason we delayed it that long, making my
mind up.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said Dooley offered him the job Sunday night in St.
Petersburg, Fla., where they were attending the Final Four. Harrick
did not give Dooley the final word until ``about 11 o'clock''
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ about whether Harrick was the Bulldogs' first
choice. Delaware coach Mike Brey said Tuesday night that Dooley had
offered him the Georgia job Sunday and he turned it down that day.
Dooley refused to confirm or deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired the best-qualified guy for the position, period,''
Dooley snapped after repeatedly fielding the question.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley also bristled at reports that Harrick's hiring was the
handiwork of Adams, who has known Harrick since the two were at
Pepperdine in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to say that our president was involved in the
process from the last interviews on,'' Dooley said. ``I'm also
pleased to say that he let me, as I expected he would, make the
decision to hire a basketball coach. All the recommendations I made
to Dr. Adams, he endorsed 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his goals at Georgia, Harrick spoke with the same
confidence Smith did when he accepted the job almost exactly four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have the goal of winning another national
championship,'' he said. ``I don't think there's any doubt it can
be done here. That's one of the reasons I came.

 &HT;    Players looking forward to Harrick's arrival, but Jones absent
from scene
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Among the horde of media, players and fans at
Wednesday's news conference announcing Jim Harrick as Georgia's new
basketball coach was one very noticeable absentee _ Bulldogs star
forward Jumaine Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-7 sophomore, announced in February that he plans
to enter the NBA Draft in June. While his teammates seemed to
welcome Harrick, the former Rhode Island and UCLA coach, Jones was
nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of Harrick's first duties as Georgia's coach was
sending two student managers scurrying to find Jones, who wasn't in
his McWhorter Hall dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumaine is a great person, but he is going to make his own
decision on (whether or not to return),'' freshman guard D.A. Layne
said. ``I haven't talked to him about that, but we'd like to have
him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus McDuffie, who coached Jones at Mitchell-Baker High, said
Wednesday that his former player is eager to meet Harrick, but
McDuffie added that Jones still is seriously considering the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA people have told me that he'd be one of the first guys
taken,'' McDuffie said, ``but I've never told him to enter the
draft. He needs to make his own decision. The ideal situation would
be for him to go back to Georgia and for them to compete for an SEC
title. But with the players they've got, I don't think that's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick was expected to meet Georgia's returning players
Wednesday afternoon, and he said he would telephone the incoming
freshmen signed last fall. Harrick also said that he would compile
a list of four or five recruits to visit before April 7, the start
of the spring signing period.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick, 60, led teams at UCLA and Rhode Island to the NCAA
Tournament 10 years in a row, and the Bruins won the national title
under him in 1995. That is welcome news to Georgia's players, who
missed the tournament the last two seasons under departed coach Ron
Jirsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing is he is a winner, and he can take us to the
next level,'' Layne said. ``He won at UCLA. . . . I am confident he
will be here for a long time. We need to get to the Sweet 16 and
eventually a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' center Robb Dryden said. ``Everybody
knows coach Harrick. When I heard the news, I was like, `He's
coming here?' That should do volumes for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Adrian Jones, who missed last season after breaking
his foot, said he is looking forward to the change. He did not
learn of Harrick's hiring until Georgia officials telephoned him at
9 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things he can teach us,'' Jones said. ``I mean,
we'll be playing for a coach who has won a national championship,
and not many players ever get a chance to say that. I'm glad this
is over with, and I'm happy he's here. He will bring us back to a
level we all expect.

 &HT;    Tech's defense gets new look
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Georgia Tech, which finished 10-2 a year ago and
shared the ACC title with Florida State, is going to contend for
loftier honors this season, the main concern will be shoring up its
defense as the Yellow Jackets open spring drills this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in as many seasons, Tech will have new a
defensive coordinator. Ted Roof, a former All-ACC linebacker for
the Jackets, was promoted from linebackers coach after Randy Edsall
left after just one season to become head coach at Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Roof also will have an entirely new staff of assistants in Dave
Sollazzo, interior line; Paul Ferraro, secondary; and Danny
Crossman, ends and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Their task is daunting. The Yellow Jackets must replace five
starters _ including leading tackler DeLaunta Cameron at linebacker
and big-play defensive backs Jason Bostic and Jerry Caldwell _ from
a unit that allowed 22 points and almost 400 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with Ted Roof as coordinator,'' coach
George O'Leary said. ``I think we've brought in a fantastic staff
from an experience standpoint on defense. There are guys on that
staff that have coordinated (at other schools).''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who coordinated top-ranked defenses at Tech 1988-91,
said Roof, 35, brings a wealth of ACC knowledge to his new post, as
well as the proper attack-oriented mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to continue to be a pressure team, `` O'Leary said,
``continue to basically mix up man and zone (pass coverages) and
always looking for better ways to get things done, which I was
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good teacher ... good with new coaches ... gets the
most potential out of his players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure definitely is on the defense,'' says Travares
Tillman, an All-America candidate at free safety. ``We're going to
have to show more aggressiveness, everybody hustling to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, junior defensive end Felipe Claybrooks
recorded 10 sacks last season, and linebacker Chris Edwards had 53
tackles over the final four games. Junior linebacker Matt Miller
will miss spring practice with an injured knee but is expected to
be fully recovered by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other areas of emphasis:
</P>
<P>
   Offense: All-ACC quarterback Joe Hamilton (2,166 yards passing,
17 TDs) and split end Dez White (46 receptions, 973 yards, 9 TDs)
return. Gone, however, are versatile running back Charlie Rogers
and All-America center Craig Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run the ball more aggressively,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Burns is back at tailback after a splendid freshman year in
which he led the team in rushing with 474 yards, averaging 4.8
yards per carry. Senior Noah King, who started five games at guard
last season, will move to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to leave this spring with a second quarterback,''
O'Leary said, adding that sophomore George Godsey has the early
edge over redshirt freshman Jermaine Crenshaw and Brian Camp, the
Ohio prep player of the year who graduated from high school last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking game: During the spring, the kickers will be
inexperienced. Kai Cornwell made his only attempt as a backup last
season, and punters Hal Higgins and Dan Dyke are walk-ons. However,
Tech signed two kickers, Luke Manget and Phillip Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Depth: O'Leary will look to solidify the Jackets' overall depth,
while also paying close attention to the team's competitive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' O'Leary said, ``is to leave the spring with a
two-deep that is pretty sound, and if not, know where our freshmen
can help us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second is basically, have we grown offensively and
defensively? We want to run the ball more aggressively; we want to
stop the run on defense. So, we're going to get a pretty good
measure of where we are. The key is that everybody stays healthy.
That's a great spring.

 &HT;    `Shark' feeling green around the gills
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Norman withdrew Wednesday morning from the
BellSouth Classic, which begins play todayat the TPC at Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's wife, Laura, called PGA Tour official George Boutell
and said her husband could not play because of a virus. She said
Norman, who designed Sugarloaf in Duluth, was at home in Hobe
Sound, Fla., with a fever and did not feel he could shake the
illness in a day. Chris Smith replaces Norman in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who finished fifth in 1997, the tournament's inaugural
year at Sugarloaf, missed the cut last week at The Players
Championship. He missed the 1998 BellSouth while recuperating from
shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kaplan, the tournament's executive director, said an annual
appearance by Norman at the BellSouth was not part of the contract,
when Sugarloaf was chosen to replace Atlanta Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to believe that it's not a legitimate
reason,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's Great White Shark Enterprises had a party planned for
clients for tonight.

 &HT;    Tough Sugarloaf ends with whimper, pros say
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the original blueprints, the 18th at Sugarloaf was
supposed to go left of the lake as a long par 4.
</P>
<P>
   But after some changes to Greg Norman's original Sugarloaf
Country Club plans by the PGA Tour's Tournament Players Club
division, the hole was fashioned into what ideally would be a
dynamic, risk-reward, go-for-it, two-shot par 5.
</P>
<P>
   But that was on paper. More often than not, the 576-yard, par-5
finishing hole at the site of today's BellSouth Classic is an
uneventful layup, three-shot finishing hole. Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible hole,'' said Mark Calcavecchia, who won the
BellSouth in 1995 when it was held at Atlanta Country Club. ``With
the tees back, it's basically a wedge or 9-iron par 3. The first
two shots don't even count, because everybody's going to just plop
it in the fairway and just plop it down there and have 130 (yards)
in, anyway. It's basically just a one-shot hole.''
</P>
<P>
   That's in stark contrast to its predecessor, the 18th at Atlanta
Country Club, one of the finest, risk-reward par 5s in golf. There
is no way to compare the two. The 18th at ACC was slightly uphill,
then flattened out gracefully and turned left and was bordered by a
lake. A carefully hooked drive up the right side of the fairway
could scoot far enough to leave a long- or middle-iron shot to the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic moments were common. In 1994, John Daly hit a massive
drive, an 8-iron to the left bunker and got up and down for a
winning birdie. Brian Henninger had applied the pressure moments
earlier with an eagle to climb within a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to last year at Sugarloaf, when Jay Don Blake,
trailing Tiger Woods by one shot, decided to lay up because of
concerns about swirling winds.
</P>
<P>
   In its third year of scrutiny at the BellSouth Classic, the 18th
at Sugarloaf continues to be more panned than praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' 1996 winner Paul Stankowski said. ``It's
pathetic as a last hole. ... I think they should start over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best hole on the course,'' Smyrna's Stewart Cink
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the kinder assessments comes from Nick Price, one of
Norman's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad hole,'' Price said. ``But it doesn't fit the
rest of the course. It seems to me that you've got so many famous
holes on that golf course, and then all of a sudden you've got that
one, and it doesn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Norman, who reworked the hole to fit what the PGA Tour
wanted _ a grandstand, theater-type finish after the original,
par-4 18th was scrapped _ isn't completely happy with it. Unless
the tees are moved up, allowing something less than a fairway wood
or 2-iron from the highly elevated fairway to the water-guarded
green, Norman admits, the hole doesn't quite do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layup is too easy,'' Norman said. ``That's the only thing
I don't like about it. You just bump it down there with a 7-iron or
8-iron. I'd like to see it where the tee is moved up, and it
becomes a hole where everybody's got a chance of getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman knows the pros don't like the hole, but he acknowledges
that some things are out of his control. There are no plans to
rework No. 18, but tournament officials are expected to use the
shorter tees during this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be a long par 4, and we were going to come
back to that green as the 19th hole,'' Norman said, referring to
the type of unofficial ``betting'' hole found on European courses.
``Then, all of a sudden, the TPC (took over), and the value of
those residential lots went through the roof, and we had to
eliminate that one hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Logistics aside, the 18th is gorgeous. The tee shot is hit
between the trees at the top of a hill, then the fairway bends
sharply downhill, narrowly turning past the water to the green.
Bleacher seats are on the left side of the fairway, in position to
see shots soaring overhead. At the green, the stands are uniquely
positioned in the water. But then come hundreds of 110-yard wedge
shots that don't provide the glamour of the risk-taking long shot
over water.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the 18th green would be better with a backboard-type
shaping, to encourage second-shot gambles. As it is, the only
bailout is the back bunker, which still leaves a fairly dicey third
shot. On the second shot, many players think that the distance and
orientation are difficult from the high elevation, creating a weird
feeling of open space. Downhill lies are common and not conducive
to launching a screaming 2-iron or 4-wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short hitters can't get down that slope,'' Stankowski
said. ``I don't have a problem with the longer hitters having an
advantage _ that's that the way the game is _ but if you flatten
(the landing area) a little more, you'd make it available. The hole
is only hard if you're going for the green. ... Why not have a
3-iron or a 3-wood into that green instead of a lob wedge?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the first year the BellSouth used Sugarloaf, the tee at
the 18th remained back for all four rounds, allowing only about 10
percent of the field to go for the green. Tim Herron was one of the
few players to go for the green in two on all four days. The course
was baked in 1997 and played hard and fast, allowing drives at the
18th to scoot down the slope for extra yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the course played wet and slow because of heavy
spring rains, the tee was moved ahead about 40 yards for two rounds
to allow players to take a gamble. From the back tee, it was
impossible except for a handful of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost forced you to lay up, because it was wet,'' Billy
Andrade said. ``It's a hole where you want to be able to get there,
but it's a dicey second shot. That back bunker's no bargain,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go for it if I can, but not very often do I get a chance to
go for it,'' said Cink, who practices frequently at Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia said he prefers the hole when the tees are down.
But if he has the shot ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've got a 2-iron to the green, I'm going to hit it,'' he
said. ``I ain't layin' up with 210 to the front and 230 to the
hole. I don't care where I am.

   NEW YORK _ A band of demonstrators in New York on Wednesday
protested the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and U.S. forces, some
wrapping themselves in Serbian flags, some pinning a black target
to their chests as a symbol of solidarity with the people of
Belgrade, nearly all questioning the version of events reported in
the American news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is Serbia,'' they chanted, as they marched from Grand
Central Terminal to the office of The New York Times on 43rd Street
between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some held signs that described NATO as the ``New Albanian
Terroristic Organization.'' Others urged the United States to
devote its resources to schools, not bombs. Teen-age boys and
girls, in red and white Serbian soccer jerseys, pumped their fists
and chanted, ``Serbia!'' as though cheering for a favorite team.
One woman held up a sign that read, ``Kosovo Albanians Seek
Independence in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   If their anger was directed at NATO and U.S. officials, it was
also vented against The New York Times, which has published
editorials in support of the NATO offensive against the forces of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times has become an organ for the bombing,'' said Brian
Becker, co-director of the International Action Center, which
organized the demonstration. ``The editorial position has been
pro-war, and the news coverage has been unbalanced, in keeping with
those who support the KLA and the NATO bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is the Kosovo Liberation Army, a separatist Albanian
guerrilla group in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking what they called the American news media
``anti-Serbian rhetoric,'' the protesters argued that atrocities
against Serbs had received scant attention over the years. Becker
described the guerrillas as a mercenary group financed by
foreigners, akin to the contras in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The police estimated the numbers of protesters at 1,000. The
organizers said there was five times that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Among the demonstrators were Serbian immigrants like Milica
Savic, 27, of Queens, who questioned news reports that Serbian
forces had burned the houses of Kosovo Albanians after having
forced them out in droves. ``That is not true,'' she insisted.
``Who burned those homes? Did you see some Serbians burn those
homes?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her stood a retired Greek immigrant from Astoria, a black
wool military cap on his head and a sea-blue Greek flag in his
hands. He is not much of a protester, he said, but he demonstrated
Wednesday because he recalled his countrymen's shared history with
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what they believe,'' said the man, Emilios Dimitris,
65. ``We have fought the Ottomans together. We have fought the
Nazis together. How do I feel if the Turks take part of my country,
and the Americans support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him stood a young woman with a fashion magazine in her
hand. ``My parents are in Belgrade,'' said the woman, Liliana
Novakovic, 28, suddenly in tears. ``They are very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the bombings began, Ms. Novakovic said, she and many peers
in Belgrade _ college educated, English speaking and even
identifying with America _ had little respect for Milosevic, whom
she called despotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton had left us alone, they would have overthrown
Milosevic,'' said Ms. Novakovic, who left Belgrade eight years ago
for Jersey City. ``This sort of united them. It's sort of like
fighting with your parents. If there is a great danger, you kind of
unite.''

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. underwrote more securities than
any other Wall Street firm in the first quarter of 1999, while
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. was the leader in mergers and acquisitions,
according to rankings announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter took first place in stock
transactions, bolstered in part by arranging three big stock
offerings by Delphi, Equant and Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly rankings of securities firms, known as league
tables, are closely watched within the industry as an indicator of
which banks and brokerages houses are strongest, information that
is seen as swaying the decisions of companies that use Wall Street
investment banking services.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the tables did not contain many surprises in the two
dozen areas of the businesses they track, including municipal
bonds, initial public stock offerings and merger-and-acquisition
deals. Merrill Lynch, Morgan, Goldman, Citigroup's Salomon Smith
Barney, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston generally
rank at the top, as they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street firms earn a big chunk of their overall profits
advising companies on mergers and acquisitions, and that business
is one of the most heavily contested.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Goldman holds a commanding lead over its main
rivals in advising on deals completed, with a 43 percent market
share worldwide by value of the deals. First Boston placed second
with 28 percent market share and Merrill Lynch ranked a close
third.
</P>
<P>
   In total underwriting of both debt and equity, Merrill is the
perennial leader of all Wall Street firms, and the first quarter of
this year was no different. Salomon Smith Barney placed second, and
Morgan Stanley was third. The one exception was Goldman, which
ranked second in the category a year ago but slipped to sixth for
the period this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of prowess is underwriting fees earned, which do
not always correlate to the volume of deals completed. Merrill
battled Morgan for the honors, with Merrill earning $345 million in
fees and Morgan reporting $326 million. Credit Suisse First Boston
beat out Salomon Smith Barney for third place, earning $236
million, just $2 million more than Salomon. Goldman fell to fifth
with $197 million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Total fees actually slipped from the first quarter of last year,
to $2.46 billion from $3.14 billion, a 20 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issuers are shopping their deals around for the best prices,
which puts pressure on fees,'' said Richard Peterson of Securities
Data. ``Some of the firms cut prices to bring in more business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debt business, Merrill maintained its long-standing
position as America's biggest bond underwriter, increasing its
market share from 14 percent a year ago to almost 16 percent so far
this year. Salomon, as usual, was second in the category. First
Boston jumped a few spots to No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley took first place in equity and equity-related
volume this quarter, followed by Merrill and Goldman. In 1998,
Merrill held the top slot, followed by Morgan and Equitable's
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In the lucrative business of
underwriting first-time stock offerings, however, Merrill snatched
first place from Morgan, with Goldman placing third.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering market, which is often an indicator
of the overall health of the U.S. stock market because it shows
investors' appetite for risk, was surprisingly weak given the
continued strong performance of market indicators, industry experts
said. There were fewer than 100 offerings in the period, the lowest
number for a quarter since the stock market slump of 1991. The

 &HT;    Federal report assails Everglades restoration effort
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Gridlock and cost overruns threaten to
undermine the federal government's $1.2 billion Everglades
restoration effort, congressional investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report by the U.S. General Accounting Office could
come at an awkward moment _ in three months, federal engineers plan
to hand Congress a new Everglades proposal costing $7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators say the government lacks a clearly organized
Everglades strategy, making it hard to predict costs or gauge
whether the efforts are working. They also say that somebody needs
the power to solve disputes among federal and state agencies, which
have stalled parts of the restoration for as long as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The unreleased draft _ which The Palm Beach Post obtained
Wednesday _ echoes some critics' complaints that projects in the
southern Everglades have become mired in disagreements between the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paralyzed by process,'' said Terry Rice, a Miccosukee
Indian tribe consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the report fell short of a blistering attack and
shouldn't sour Congress on Everglades spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a smoking gun here,'' said Charles Lee of the
Florida Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   One restoration leader acknowledged that disagreements sometimes
drag on, but he said the system is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with real things, things that matter to people,
things that in previous times would have been left unresolved,''
said Terrence ``Rock'' Salt, executive director of the federally
created South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The task force lets federal, state, local and tribal leaders
work together on Everglades policy, but it lacks the power to order
solutions. Salt said he doubts that the panel could ever wield that
kind of authority, especially over the state.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional budget leaders ordered the study last fall after
becoming irked at the Florida Legislature, which was trying to
increase payments to landowners in Everglades condemnation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the federal government has spent more than $1.2
billion on the Everglades since 1993, with three-quarters coming
from the corps and the Interior Department. The investigators said
some agencies couldn't completely account for their Everglades
spending, which includes money from many sources that not everyone
tracks the same way.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three American infantrymen patrolling Macedonia's
border with the Yugoslav province of Kosovo were missing Wednesday
after reporting by radio that they had been surrounded and were
under fire, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers might have been captured, presumably by Serbian
forces or paramilitary units, officials said, but they cautioned
that they had no direct evidence to support their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers are part of the United States 1st Infantry
Division, which has had about 350 members in Macedonia for years, a
remnant of a United Nations force that is being withdrawn now that
thousands of NATO troops are guarding the border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said last night that the
three soldiers, whose names were not released, came under fire
about 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET). They had split off in their Humvee
from the rest of the patrol along a road near Kumanovo, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came under small-arms fire,'' Bacon said. ``They reported
over the radio that they were surrounded. No more was heard from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that American and other NATO forces, along with
Macedonian police, immediately launched a search on the ground and
deployed a helicopter and a plane equipped with infrared
heat-detecting sensors, but the team could not be located. The
search was still continuing twelve hours after the incident, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon refused to say whether the search parties would cross the
border into Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about the search, because I just don't know,'' he
said. ``I assume we are searching aggressively, but remember,
Kosovo is part of Yugoslavia, and it is heavily armed along the
border right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was not the first time that there has been scattered
shooting along the tense border since the NATO bombing of Serbia
began, this was the most serious incident to date, threatening to
spill the crisis into one of Yugoslavia's neighboring states and
tempting Allied forces to drive across the border.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilot of an F-117 Stealth fighter plane went down in
Serbian controlled territory last weekend, NATO sent in rescue
helicopters. But that pilot's location was far from where his plane
landed, unknown to the enemy, and disclosed to his rescuers by a
special electronic beacon. Infantrymen do not routinely carry such
devices, especially when they are not expecting to be engaged in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman said that the three soldiers, all
enlisted men, were on a patrol in a Humvee, which are heavily
armored and often well-armed all-purpose infantry vehicles. They
were traveling in a group with a small number of other vehicles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   They were in uniform and were not wearing the blue helmets of
U.N. peacekeepers but their standard military gear, a military
official said.
</P>
<P>
   During the patrol, the vehicles separated from one another as
part of a training exercise, he said. It was then that the
occupants of one vehicle reported to the others that they were
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the three tried to get away, the other vehicles raced back
to find them, but could not, Bacon said. He did not know whether
the soldiers ever returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the soldiers reported to a U.S. task force known
as Able Sentry, which is part of the U.N. force in Macedonia, and
the task force launched a Blackhawk helicopter to search.
Meanwhile, NATO units that are part of the Allied Rapid Reaction
Corps, a 7,500-man group run by the British in preparation for an
eventual peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, put their own helicopters
into the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty to 90 American ground troops deployed to the area from
Task Force Able Sentry, joined by a number of allied ground troops
and several helicopters,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather in the area was ``lousy,'' he said, restricting
visibility for the search parties.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have ``substantial armored forces along the
border,'' he said..
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has maintained a small peacekeeping force in
Macedonia since the former Yugoslav republic declared its
independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, amid growing fears that fighting in the Balkans would
spread, the U.N. Security Council renewed the force's mission and
increased the troop strength to more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has contributed about 350 soldiers since the
peacekeeping mission, and American officials have said they have no
plans to send more. Bacon said the American unit was scheduled to
leave the country soon.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The British government said Wednesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had formed a ``close
relationship'' with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and that they
had stepped up their military cooperation in the face of a common
threat from American air strikes. American officials, however, were
skeptical about the degree of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the British defense staff,
said at news conference in London that the Milosevic government
``is now a key military ally for Iraq'' and that a Yugoslav
delegation toured Iraqi air defense sites last month _ ``no doubt
to learn tactics on how to down allied aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some of the tactics put into practice already
over Serbia,'' he told reporters. ``We are aware from a variety of
sources that over the last six months this relationship has grown
in depth and breadth, as both Milosevic and Saddam have come under
increasing pressure from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there had recently been a ``continuous two-way flow of
military and defense industry delegations'' between Yugoslavia and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials confirmed news reports this
week that a delegation of Yugoslav defense specialists visited Iraq
in February, presumably to discuss air-defense tactics against
American warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that Yugoslav forces may have adopted tactics
recommended by the Iraqis in dealing with the threat of American
air strikes, including the movement of anti-aircraft weapons into
populated areas less likely to be attacked by NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   But they said Wednesday that American intelligence agencies had
little evidence to suggest that the cooperation between the
Yugoslav and Iraqi armed forces was as sweeping as the British
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports of contact between the Serbs and the Iraqis on air
defense are true,'' said an intelligence official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But I would not take from that the
implication that there is an active and ongoing advisory or
resupply effort. I just don't think we can substantiate that at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Iraq would be condemned by other Muslim nations in
the Arab world if it assisted Yugoslavia in the persecution of the
ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, which is mostly Muslim. The
Iraqi government Wednesday condemned the assault on Yugoslavia as
``cowardly NATO aggression that is a flagrant violation of the
United Nations charter and of international law,'' Iraq's official
news agency, INA, reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon has said publicly that recent military
contacts between Yugoslavia and Iraq were no surprise, given that
Milosevic and Hussein find themselves confronted by a common
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two countries, both subject to attack by forces
within NATO,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said earlier this
week. ``They both have primarily Soviet-built or purchased
air-defense systems, and they are both subject to international
embargoes. So they obviously might look for ways to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the Yugoslavs believe that the Iraqis have
learned a thing or two over the last seven years in dealing with
Western aircraft,'' he continued. ``What they've learned is that
they haven't been able to deal with them very successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia and Iraq have a history of military cooperation that
predates the Kosovo crisis by many years. In the 1980s, Yugoslavia
sold Soviet-made air-defense equipment to Iraq and helped Baghdad
in the construction of airfields, underground command centers and
other infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials said that Iraq, which has been
the target of an international arms embargo since the 1991 Gulf
War, would be eager to obtain spare parts from Yugoslavia,
especially for its air-defense network, while Yugoslavia would seek
detailed information from Iraq about its knowledge of American
combat tactics.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson said Wednesday that
``what links these two countries together appears to be a
determination in the face of domestic and economic difficulty to
continue to build a war machine and, secondly, a callous disregard
for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for equally tough language, Guthrie, the British
defense chief, said that ``all of this adds up to a close
relationship between Saddam and Milosevic or, as somebody said to
me, a marriage of convenience based on the suffering of their
peoples.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man in a hurry, Sir John Browne is, by all appearances,
remarkably composed.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, the chief executive of BP Amoco PLC, is a soft-spoken
and charming man who rarely appears ruffled. He is fond of ballet
and pre-Columbian art and often listens to Puccini operas at BP
Amoco's Edwardian headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   For an oil executive, he is unusually sensitive to environmental
concerns and has even had dinner with the leaders of Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sir John, 50, is also known for a relentless drive as he
pushes BP Amoco to take on the behemoths in the industry, Mobil,
Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
   In turning around British Petroleum and acquiring Amoco, he has
cut tens of thousands of jobs and shaped an organization where
there is almost no layer of middle management and constant pressure
to do better.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three months after the Amoco acquisition, he is poised
to pursue another rapid overhaul as the company nears a $28 billion
acquisition of the Atlantic Richfield Co. ARCO's board was
considering the offer late Wednesday, an executive close to the
board said, adding that there was a good chance that it would be
accepted. BP Amoco's board has approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco declined to comment on the status of the deal, and Sir
John declined requests for an interview. Still, based on his past
speeches and interviews and on conversations with other industry
executives, it is clear that Sir John's strategy is to transform BP
Amoco into a company that is at much at home in Silicon Valley as
in the Oil Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hands-on oil man who has mastered what was going in
Silicon Valley,'' said a manager at BP Amoco who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``He adopted American ways and the American work
ethic. He's not someone who came up through the English system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new BP Amoco being constructed looks like no other
oil company. In contrast to the elaborate, centralized structure of
most oil companies, BP Amoco is managed by a about a dozen
executives. They ride herd over more than 140 units, some of which
are still in the process of being set up.
</P>
<P>
   The units are intended to be small enough that managers and
their staffs get to know each other and what is expected of them.
And each unit's performance is reviewed quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a genius for devising motivational structures to get
people to do what he wants them to do,'' said Fergus McLeod, an
analyst with BT Alex. Brown in London.
</P>
<P>
   It was while pursuing a master's degree in business at Stanford
University in the 1970s that Sir John got to know Andrew S. Grove,
one of the founders of the Intel Corp., the world's dominant chip
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, BP Amoco executives say, made the young BP executive
aware of the vast changes coming in information technology and its
implications for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chief executive of British Petroleum in 1995, Sir
John has pushed to knit together the far-flung operations of BP
Amoco by means of thousands of personal computers into what he
describes as a ``virtual team network.'' The system allows widely
scattered employees to work together closely and provides them with
up-to-date information on other units.
</P>
<P>
   He has also encouraged employees to set up home pages on the
World Wide Web, where they describe the skills they have to offer
and share information about technical details such as ways to
better use lubricants for drilling. The goal is to give managers
and employees immediate access to skills and experience that they
can apply to their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an emphasis on information technology, BP Amoco
has sought to emulate the entrepreneurial ethos of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit manager has a performance contract in which financial
and other goals are spelled out and which are closely monitored by
the top executives, who will intervene if problems come up.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Yale School of Management in September, Sir
John, noting that British Petroleum's pending merger with Amoco
would make it one of the 10 largest industrial companies in the
world, said that organization in small units was the key to making
a global company work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned over time that people like to work in relatively
small units, where they can equate effort and results,'' he said.
``Where they can see what they're achieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the units has ``operational freedom,'' he said. ``They
are running their own businesses.''

 UNDATED: own businesses.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But his unflinching cost-cutting has left some executives
bewildered and bitter at methods that leave little room for the
compromise. So far, the reorganization at the newly acquired Amoco
has borne mixed results. Sir John has signaled that he is impatient
with speed of integrating Amoco and has stepped up the pace of job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John is described by executives and analysts as being
obsessed with accountability. Many managers have felt his steady
gaze and deep knowledge of the oil business when he wants know why
a unit is not meeting his standards or is doing so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong, they can quickly find out before the
end of each quarter,'' McLeod said. ``If something goes right,
there is a structure where it can be shared with everybody very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, the son of an English executive of British Petroleum
and a Romanian mother, spent part of his childhood in Iran, where
he had an intimate look at the oil industry. After leaving
Cambridge University in 1966 with degree in physics, he joined
British Petroleum.

   The company sent him to Alaska as part of the team in Anchorage
that helped bring the vast fields in Prudhoe Bay into production.
He spent most his early career in the the United States, serving as
executive vice president and chief financial officer of the
Standard Oil Co. in Cleveland, in which British Petroleum had
acquired a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   At the American company, Sir John reined in big spending on
exploration and cut the staff. He returned to London in 1989 to
revamp British Petroleum's exploration arm.
</P>
<P>
   He scaled back exploration to 10 countries from 30 and cut the
work force by half. His strategy was to focus on a few big fields
and then try to cut the cost of extracting the oil.
</P>
<P>
   His success as head of the exploration arm helped British
Petroleum recover from a huge debt burden and underperforming
businesses like refining.
</P>
<P>
   When he became chief executive, he surprised many in the
industry by forming a joint venture with Mobil to improve refining
and marketing in Europe. He again stunned the industry in August,
with the announcement of the Amoco bid.
</P>
<P>
   For his work in helping turn around British Petroleum, he was
knighted last year by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that we are too focused on immediate results,'' Sir
John said recently. ``I say to you there are 40 quarters between me
and retirement and everyone of them matters.''

 &HT;    Bush boasts $6 million in funds for pending campaign
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a demonstration of political muscle-flexing
and fiscal fitness, Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday said he
collected more than $6 million for his budding presidential
campaign in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The figure was $3 million higher than one that hit the grapevine
last weekend. It is $2 million more than one incorrectly reported
Wednesday by the New York Times and carried by the Austin
American-Statesman. And it is about $4 million more than the amount
raised by any of his GOP rivals, including some who have been
working toward the 2000 campaign for several years. Only Democratic
Vice President Al Gore raised more _ $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there is more cash in the pipeline _ ``our accountants
are still counting'' _ and he hopes to double the bottom line by
the end of June. By comparison, Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP nominee,
raised $13.5 million in the first six months of 1995. Bush is
trying to approach that figure in four months.
</P>
<P>
   After months in which polls and pundits provided the only
measure of the presidential field, Wednesday's announcements
provided another yardstick for the candidates' viability and
relative strength heading into caucuses and primaries that won't
begin for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed with a lot of friends in life who seem to want to
encourage me to take the next step,'' said Bush, who officially is
still exploring a presidential bid. Asked if the fund-raising
success ``inches'' him toward running, Bush said, ``It more than
inches. It feets and yards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to make sure that behind the polls and the phone
calls that there was some substance,'' he said. ``And I think this
is the first indication that there is true support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush resisted talk that donors, who by federal law are limited
to giving $1,000, were signing on with a candidate who is still
developing positions on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they would write a check like that unless they
knew where my heart is, what my intentions are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The money announced Wednesday came at the end of a three-month
reporting period that will be the subject of disclosure filings
with the Federal Election Commission by April 15. Bush, whose fund
raising began in March, released no list of donors or
state-by-state totals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Bush friend Donald Evans, national finance chairman for
the presidential campaign, said the money poured in in response to
a fund-raising letter and a web of ``friend-to-friend'' efforts
based on the massive Bush family political network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is people across the country responding to the
governor's positive vision for America going into the 21st
century,'' Evans said. ``We did it one by one, lots of phone calls,
lots of friends calling friends.''
</P>
<P>
   While speculation about fund-raising totals had been rumbling
for days, the Bush total was a closely held secret. Eager to make a
big splash Wednesday, Bush aides declined to talk numbers before
then, even privately. ``You're going to be surprised,'' one aide
said Tuesday. The Bush campaign said Evans was misquoted as saying
Tuesday the total was more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he made two brief fund-raising calls to Michigan and
Florida. He plans to hit the fund-raising trail after the
legislative session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's goal is to raise enough money _ in excess of $45
million _ to be able to pass on federal matching funds that come
with spending limits that can hamper a campaign. Steve Forbes, who
largely funds his campaigns out of his own deep pockets, is the
only major contender who has announced he will not take the federal
money. Spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said Forbes has not raised
a significant amount of money since formally announcing his
candidacy this month.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schmidt, campaign manager for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, was impressed, but not discouraged, by the Bush numbers.
Schmidt referred to two other Texas Republicans who were early
fund-raising stalwarts: Phil Gramm and John Connally.
</P>
<P>
   The current Texas senator and the late Texas governor have
become poster boys for presidential campaign sizzle and fizzle.
Both raised big money early, then cratered _ Connally in 1980 and
Gramm in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, fund-raising prowess does not
necessarily translate to victories in a presidential primary
process,'' said Schmidt, whose boss raised between $700,000 and
$800,000 in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Gramm was the candidate making early
fund-raising headlines. In February 1995, at a Dallas Convention
Center dinner, Gramm set a one-meal record by collecting $4.1
million for his presidential race. He wound up spending $28 million
on a campaign that crashed with a fifth-place finish in the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be an interesting lesson to try to avoid what
happened to Phil,'' Bush said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gramm came armed with a political Rolodex to die for.
Gramm had a computerized database of names, jobs, interests of
164,454 people he had met in the preceding four years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Connally, the top fund-raiser in 1979, spent $12
million and earned one delegate at the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing the fund-raising total, Bush on
Wednesday again road-tested a stump speech sure to become part of
his White House campaign. He brought his ``responsibility era''
message to the conference of the Governor's Conference on Right
Choices for Youth, telling the audience that the greatest risk for
young people is ``their moral and spiritual lives will not
improve'' in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by William Bennett, former education
secretary in the Reagan administration and national drug czar in
the Bush administration. Bennett, who has yet to endorse a
presidential candidate, said Bush ``has now caught the imagination
of the American people to an astounding degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bennett, who dedicates himself to moral and values
issues, was asked if Bush's self-titled ``young and irresponsible''
years could be a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish say the merry-hearted boys make the best of all men.
Even I, believe it or not, was a merry-hearted boy at one time.
Young and male, some of us in college, some of us in high school,
did things that we weren't proud of later. Speaking for myself, I
don't think that's what's of concern to the American people. I
think the concern of the American people is whether they have
somebody who has integrity,'' he said.

 NEW YORK: in 1990. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the sometimes contentious arraignment, and in comments
afterwards, the lawyers accused Johnson of playing to the political
winds. Worth called his client a ``political prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson implicitly criticized the officers for failing to
present their version of events during a three-week inquiry by a
Bronx grand jury, calling it ``one of the oddities'' of the case.
Because the officers had not offered any justification for the
shooting, he said, the court should treat them ``like any other
individuals who rolled up to a building and fired 41 shots'' at
someone.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion prompted outrage from the officers' lawyers.
``Certainly police offciers, being proposed defendants, have the
same rights as anybody else and do not have to testify to the grand
jury,'' Carroll's attorney, Marvyn M. Kornberg, said.
</P>
<P>
   With the indictments unsealed, more details about the case began
to emerge Wednesday. Worth said that the officers continued
shooting because Diallo continued to stand upright as the 19
bullets ripped into his body. `` Diallo did not fall at any point
during the incident and that's why the number of shots that were
fired were fired,'' Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallo family's lawyers attacked that assertion as
``absurd,'' saying that it was contradicted by an autopsy done by
their own pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, the coroner for
Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. That report suggests that Diallo
was knocked down and likely paralyzed by some of the earliest
bullets that hit him, said one of the lawyers, Peter Neufeld. Two
of the first shots fired perforated Diallo's spine, and ``he was
brought down to the ground immediately,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Examiner's office has refused to discuss its
official autopsy, although it has released copies of the report to
several involved parties. People who have reviewed the report said
it states that one of the bullets struck Diallo squarely in the
chest, rupturing his aorta and perforating his spine. A second
bullet also perforated and partially severed his spine.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not give a sequence for the shots fired, draw
conclusions about what position Diallo was in when the shots were
fired, or express any opinion about whether the shots paralyzed
him, according to the people who have seen it. But, they said, the
report does note that great volumes of blood were found in Diallo's
chest cavity, ostensibly from the chest wounds. Experts said that
can be evidence that the shots that struck his torso were fired
early in the sequence when the body's blood pressure was still
high.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, who have not seen either of the autopsy
reports, strongly disputed the conclusions of the Diallo family
lawyers. ``How does anyone tell it's one of the earlier shots?''
Worth asked. ``When I was a prosecutor I never heard of a Medical
Examiner who could say with any certainty the sequence of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   At the officer's arraingment Wednesday, the courtroom was
bifurcated by race and allegiance. On one side sat the Diallos,
their relatives and their supporters, including the Rev. Al
Sharpton, all of whom were black or Hispanic. On the other sat
representatives of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and
friends and relatives of the officers. With a few exceptions, all
of them were white. Among those present to register their support
for the defendants was Inspector Bruce H. Smolka, the commanding
officer of the Street Crime Unit, the elite police squad where the
four officers were assigned and that critics say has unfairly
targeted members of minority groups in its mission to search
suspects for guns.
</P>
<P>
   After the officers entered their pleas, Justice Collins oversaw
the selection of the judge who will handle the case through its
conclusion, and, if the officers waive their right to a jury trial,
decide their fate. Patricia Anne Williams, an acting Supreme Court
justice, was chosen when her name was picked at random from a wheel
containing the names of 12 judges.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers'
lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide, and of
possible conflicts between the scenarios that the prosecution and
defense will present. All of the lawyers referred to their clients'
``reasonable belief'' that they were in imminent danger. Under the
penal code provision for justifiable homicide, the officers will
have to prove not only that they thought they or their fellow
officers were in imminent danger, but that it was ``reasonable'' to
believe so. Stephen Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss, who fired five
shots, and James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, who fired four,
both said that their clients heard gunfire and saw McMellon on the
ground, leading them to assume that Officer McMellon had been shot.
``He had a sick feeling inside his being that he would be shot and
he reacted,'' Culleton said of Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly agitated Johnson leapt to his feet at the end, saying
that Murphy ``did not see Amadou Diallo fire a weapon, he did not
see Amadou Diallo have a weapon, because Amadou Diallo did not have
a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for McMellon and Carroll did not deal with the facts
during the arraignment, but afterwards, Kornberg said that McMellon
had fallen after firing about three shots. Kornberg said his
client, Carroll, that he had seen a ``black object'' _ which later
turned out to be Diallo's wallet _ coming out of the victim's back
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client saw him reaching into his back pocket, saw this
black object come out and my client yelled `Gun!''' Kornberg said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the court proceedings, the officers briefly thanked their
supporters, and proclaimed their innocence. Eyes welling, brows
knitted, Murphy said, ``I did nothing wrong and this trial will
show that I did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said, ``This is a dark day for the New York City
Police Department when four young, eager aggressive police officers
who have done nothing but serve their city well are indicted for
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallos, who met with Johnson for half an hour before
the arraignment, and their supporters expressed satisfaction with
the indictments, and said they hoped that justice would be done. At
the arraignment's end, Mrs. Diallo's eyes were full of tears.

ADVERTISING: IBM TAKES STAND FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY ON WEB

<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying it hoped to ward off government regulation and increase
consumer confidence in electronic commerce, IBM Corp., the
second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, said Wednesday that it
would pull its ads from Web sites that lacked clear privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to 350 Web sites it advertises with in the
United States and Canada, IBM said that as of June 1 it would
advertise only on sites that posted such policies.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, thought to be the first by a U.S. company,
comes as the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and the European
Union are closely monitoring the effectiveness of efforts by online
businesses to police themselves on the issue of buying and selling
personal data they gather.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its own recent survey had found that only 30 percent of
the 800 sites worldwide from which it buys ads had privacy policies
posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little to our surprise, frankly, that so many sites
didn't have privacy policies,'' said Abby Kohnstamm, IBM's senior
vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohnstamm and Chris Caine, vice president for governmental
programs, cited three factors behind the decision announced
Wednesday: IBM's own history of protecting consumer privacy,
research showing that consumer concerns about privacy are
inhibiting the growth of electronic commerce, and the need for the
industry to prove that it can regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market-led policies need market leaders,'' Caine said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the trade commission chairman, who last year
told Internet companies to make fundamental improvements in
protecting consumer privacy or face tough new regulations, said he
was encouraged by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good move,'' Pitofsky said. ``I'm not sure
whether it will catch on or not, but I think it is important that a
company with the stature and prestige of IBM take the first step.
Time will tell if others see it in their best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Even privacy advocates who view industry self-regulation as
ineffective and unenforceable called the IBM move a positive step
in pushing companies to tell consumers what type of personal
information they collect and how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exquisitely timed,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters Corp., which promotes consumer protection online. ``I
don't think it's going to have an enormous effect,'' he added, but
``I still feel I have to applaud IBM because their heart is in the
right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett, saying that IBM had a good history of protecting
privacy, also pointed out that the company had avoided negative
publicity like that recently faced by Microsoft Corp. and Intel
Corp. for embedding in their products identifying numbers that
could allow marketers and others to track computer users' movements
through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies are members of the Online Privacy Alliance,
which was formed last year to push companies to address privacy
concerns after a survey by the FTC found only 14 percent of Web
sites had clear privacy policies posted.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the No. 1 advertiser on the Internet, applauded the
move by IBM and said it would watch its effects closely. ``Because
privacy is very important to us, we are always considering all ways
in which we can encourage privacy protections,'' said Tom Pilla, a
Microsoft spokesman. ``We don't have any immediate plans to follow
suit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although IBM will not dictate standards for what privacy
policies on Web sites should be, it does refer Web publishers to
the Online Privacy Alliance, which has a list of recommended
practices that are based on principles recommended by the FTC last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the issue has reached a critical point as the
FTC nears a decision on whether a report to Congress due this
spring will recommend the passage of new laws to protect online
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   A group of business interests, in conjunction with the FTC and
Georgetown University, recently completed a follow-up to the FTC
survey last year of online privacy practices. The results of that
study, which have not been released, are expected to be a
determining factor in the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky told Congress last year that he would push for
regulation if significant improvement was not found. He said
Wednesday that progress was being made, but he acknowledged, ``I
just don't know how much, and I hear radically different versions
from differing groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that the report to Congress would look at
more than just the numbers. ``You want to know what kind of
policy'' Web sites ``are putting up there,'' he said. Some key
points, he said, are whether the policies are clear and whether
they explain that consumers have a choice in how the information
they supply is used.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, IBM cited the new survey in the letter that its online
advertising agency, Ogilvy One Worldwide, a New York unit of WPP
Group PLC, sent out Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this presents a very timely opportunity for
the private sector to continue to take the initiative in posting
and following privacy policies,'' the letter said in reference to
the survey. ``While the appropriate privacy statement will vary
from site to site, we strongly encourage Web site owners to employ
industry-best privacy practices.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it spent about $45 million on online advertising last
year, or 7 percent of its worldwide media budget. That is expected
to increase to $60 million, or 10 percent of its budget, this year.

 IBM Gets Tough About Web Site Privacy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In a move that could both burnish IBM's image and help stave off
government regulation of the Internet, International Business
Machines yesterday said it will stop running ads on Web sites that
fail to post privacy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the action was designed simply to build consumer
confidence in Web commerce by supporting sites that let surfers
know how their personal information will be used, and particularly
whether it will be sold to other businesses. Surveys show that
privacy concerns are the top reason consumers hesitate to make
purchases over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest computer-maker and also the biggest
e-commerce consulting firm, IBM has a tremendous interest in
promoting the Web as a sales medium. As the country's
second-largest Web advertiser (after Microsoft), the company wields
heavy digital clout. IBM will spend $600 million on advertising
this year _ about one-10th of it on the Web _ with a large chunk of
the money earmarked to boost its image as a leader in
``e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   But IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., has other reasons for the hard-nosed
new stance, which it outlined in electronic letters sent yesterday
to the 350 U.S. and Canadian sites that carry IBM ads.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, members of the U.S. Congress submitted some 84 bills
to regulate how Web sites treat personal information about
visitors. Online publishers have been put on notice that the
Federal Trade Commission will step in if industry self-policing on
user privacy proves inadequate; the FTC is currently auditing sites
and will report on its findings later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been an advocate and continue to be for self-regulation
of the Net,'' said IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky. ``We decided late
last year that an appropriate approach might be to try to leverage
the size of our advertising investment in a positive way and
require sites to have a privacy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy was developed jointly by IBM's government affairs
office in Washington and its advertising team, Bukovinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was generally hailed as positive by others in the
industry who want consumers to consider the Web a safe place to
conduct transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think what IBM has done shows some important leadership in
an area that's absolutely essential for the industry,'' said Rich
LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, a coalition
of advertisers that supports industry self-regulation and counts
IBM among its members.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last year, the FTC found that only 14 percent of
commercial sites informed surfers of their policies on collecting
and selling online data.
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said yesterday that the FTC doesn't
have a specific goal for how many sites should have such a posted
policy this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he called IBM's move ``a very fine thing. I hope others will
recognize that IBM is taking a step in the right direction and ...
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Congress has been quick to act on Internet concerns in the
past. Within a matter of months last year, a bill on marketing to
children over the Web was recommended by the FTC, passed by
Congress and signed into law, Pitofsky noted.
</P>
<P>
   LeFurgy said his organization is pushing for 80 percent
compliance with Online Privacy Association guidelines in six
months. The guidelines, which are about individually identifiable
data, state that sites should have a privacy policy that is easy to
understand and available before any personal data is collected, and
that surfers should be able to opt out of any use for the data,
particularly if it is being sold to a third party. He declined to
disclose current levels of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the political ramifications of IBM's new policy, the
company also stands to gain from a public relations aspect. IBM
hopes the ad stance will bolster its reputation as a trusted
industry leader. ``It's a conscious effort to reinforce what we
believe already is a leadership position in e-business,'' said
Bukovinsky.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen on June 1 when IBM's new policy goes into
effect? Bukovinsky said he expects that IBM won't need to withdraw
ads from many sites because most sites will comply. Currently,
about 30 percent of the sites in the United States and Canada are
in compliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM advertises on another 430 sites outside of the United States
and Canada and will gradually begin imposing the new policy there,
Bukovinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have altruistic motives and clear business motives as well,
and we're in a position to leverage our advertising weight,'' said
Bukovinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a Web
privacy advocate, said consumers can get into the act by refusing
to buy from sites that don't post their privacy policies _ and
letting the sites know with a quick e-mail message that they've
lost a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way sites will have a real market reason to (adopt) a
privacy policy that lets consumers make an informed choice. If they
don't do it, Congress will legislate it,'' said McCandlish.

WITH HORNETS IN A JAM, STERN SUMMONS JORDAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael. The mere mention of the name conjures up a kaleidoscope
of images and a lifetime of memories. Having conquered the
basketball universe, where does the next challenge lie for the
world's most prominent athlete?
</P>
<P>
   The back nine? Corporate America? Owner of a National Basketball
Association franchise? Or will Michael Jordan come out of
retirement at age 36?
</P>
<P>
   While returning to the NBA may not be a priority for Jordan _
the league prohibits owners from being players _ the possibility of
obtaining a controlling interest of a franchise is on Jordan's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had preliminary discussions with Commissioner David
Stern and the Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn about buying 50
percent of the team. Apparently realizing Jordan cannot save the
league on the floor anymore, Stern has enlisted Jordan to help
resuscitate a troubled franchise in his home state of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Shinn, according to league and team officials, are the
driving forces behind Jordan's involvement. The commissioner would
not only delight in becoming the first commissioner to help award a
former player a significant portion of a franchise, but Stern could
also reduce the impact of Shinn's tarnished reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The owner has been named in a civil suit by a woman alleging
sexual misconduct. The district attorney in York County, S.C.,
where the alleged misconduct took place, did not file criminal
charges based on the original evidence. But based on new evidence,
there is interest in reopening the case.
</P>
<P>
   Only two former recent players have been part owners of teams,
Earvin (Magic) Johnson, a vice president with the Los Angeles
Lakers, and Isiah Thomas, the former general manager of the Toronto
Raptors and a current NBC analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like with Magic, Bird or myself, I think Jordan should
always have a connection to the NBA,'' Thomas said Wednesday. ``It
just makes sense, business-wise, and in other ways. For Jordan to
have no connection to the league would be a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that Stern and the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik,
``are both genuinely interested in seeing minorities own or be a
part of franchise, whether it's Jordan or J.R. Reid. I don't think
that's a league mandate, but that's how I think they think as
individuals. I don't think all of the 29 owners think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Williams, the former president of the players association
and a 17-year veteran, has expressed interest in ownership with
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Michael talking about 50 percent, that's pretty much a
monumental position,'' Williams said. ``What Michael could do is
grow the team and grow the revenues. He could be the driving force
behind a new arena. He can use his status to encourage and help the
growth of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington, N.C., and starred at the
University of North Carolina, said staying involved in the NBA
would be a ``fulfilling personal and business challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Jordan pronounced himself ``99.9 percent''
retired. Jordan issued a statement Monday confirming his interest
in owning half the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage,'' Jordan said, ``the discussions are very
preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is on vacation in the Bahamas, but is expected to renew
talks when he returns, a team official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've publicly criticized the NBA for their lack of minority
owners,'' Williams said. ``Most minority owners own maybe 1 percent
and 2 percent. It's much needed in a predominantly black league.
Whether it be me, Michael or Dr. J. I don't understand why they
can't have an ownership stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson bought 5 percent of the team from the Lakers' owner,
Jerry Buss, after his retirement in 1991. He sold the shares back
to Buss after ill-fated comeback attempts and eventually reacquired
the 5 percent, which he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas owned as much 9 percent of the Raptors and sat on the
team's board of directors until two years ago. But disagreements
with the former majority owner, Allan Slaight, over financial
matters relating to the building of a new arena forced him to
resign and have the team buy out his portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great fit in many ways, but I would caution Jordan to
be careful who you're partners with,'' Thomas said, referring to
Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a report by Fox Sports that Jordan would return to
the NBA with the Hornets, David Falk, Jordan's agent, said
Wednesday, ``There's absolutely no truth to it.''

SERB FORCES APPARENTLY CAPTURE THREE U.S. SOLDIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Story has been updated) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three U.S. Army soldiers apparently were abducted
Wednesday by Serb forces in Macedonia as they patrolled near the
Yugoslav border, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO ground and helicopter search was under way amid the rough
terrain, according to alliance and Department of Defense spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came as the second week of NATO airstrikes began
against Yugoslavia with an allied vow to leave no safe place for
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to plan or execute his
campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still determined to push forward on our sustained air
campaign, and the operation will continue,'' David Leavy, spokesman
for the National Security Council, said after the three soldiers
were reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Samuel Berger informed President
Clinton of the apparent abduction, the most harrowing incident of
the Balkan engagement to be made public since a U.S. F-117A stealth
fighter went down Saturday in Yugoslavia. The pilot ejected, was
rescued and then taken back to a NATO base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The loss came as NATO and the Clinton administration was coming
under pressure to consider using ground forces to counter
Milosevic's violent campaign against Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expanded Wednesday on his reluctance to take the step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into
a hostile situation, into the Balkans and Kosovo, is the prospect
of never being able to get them out,'' Clinton said in a CBS
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent abduction occurred in the Kumanova district of
northwestern Macedonia, immediately south of the international
border with Yugoslavia, which is the line between Macedonia and the
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, from the 1st Infantry Division, were part of a
peacekeeping mission that the United Nations dispatched to
Macedonia at the time of the ethnic fighting in Bosnia and which
had become part of a residual NATO force numbering 1,200, with
about 350 from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The missing soldiers were on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday,
a Pentagon spokesman said. They were traveling in a Hum-Vee vehicle
when they reported being surrounded while taking small-arms fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more was heard from the patrol,'' said a NATO statement
issued at alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they have possibly been abducted,'' said Col.
Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman. ``There's a
search-and-rescue effort on.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon source said that the incident took place about 2:30
p.m. (6:30 a.m. CST). It was reported by NATO and the Pentagon
about 11 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Before the soldiers were reported missing, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said the lengthening list of bombing targets was
intended to tighten ``NATO's noose on Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh night of the aerial bombardment NATO missiles
slammed into the headquarters of a Serbian special forces unit in
Belgrade _ apparently the closest strike to the capital's center so
far, Bacon said. Coming days could see direct air assault on such
key installations as the Yugoslav Interior Ministry, home of
Milosevic's police force, allied sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Improving weather over the Balkans offered NATO the hope of more
sustained bombing by day and night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe,
confirmed that NATO political leaders had given him ``expanded
authority'' and said he would be looking at ``a larger array of
possible targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark refused to detail which sites had been newly opened to
NATO military planners, but said, ``We're going to take every
action that's available within our means and capabilities to bring
home the tragedy of his policy to President Milosevic and his
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that almost no target in Yugoslavia is off limits,
alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said: ``It's clear that no facility,
no unit, which is currently being used to plan, conceive, direct or
carry out the Yugoslav campaign against the Kosovars, is going to
be a sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going away,'' British Defense Secretary George
Robertson told the House of Commons late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the mission will
not be defined by the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no firm timetable for this,'' Lockhart said. ``This is
going to move forward and either President Milosevic is going to
change his calculation or we are going to continually and
systematically hit his military and deprive him of the ability to
impose his will,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance air commander David Wilby said that the alliance's
``week of hard work'' had taken its toll on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he is running short of fuel,'' Wilby said at NATO
headquarters. ``We are now starting to hit him very hard on the
ground. We've hit him in his command and control facilities. You
will start to see the resolve starting to crack very quickly. I
believe we've accomplished one hell of a lot in this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby also said Milosevic's air power ``is almost nonexistent
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees continued to flood out of Kosovo, although Shea said
the flow ``slowed somewhat'' because Yugoslav border guards
sporadically closed the border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton authorized $50 million from an emergency
account and the Department of Defense to aid Kosovar refugees who
have moved into Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said half of the money would be given to the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees and the remainder would finance
direct food and shelter assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent a
seven-member disaster assistance team to Albania, which has been
flooded with refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said most refugees
leaving Kosovo are women and children, ``and we are gravely
concerned by the whereabouts and fate of the missing men.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least two Kosovar Albanian leaders reported to have been
executed by Serbs are alive, U.S. diplomats said. NATO had reported
the killing of Fehmi Agani, a delegate to recent peace talks in
France, and Baton Haxhiu, a newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo ``are in a truly
precarious position.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Bacon said there was no feasible way to
attempt to aid ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to do it would be through airdrops and I think it
is not a very hospitable area through which to fly airdrops at this
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said reports were increasing about Kosovars being stripped
of records, what the spokesman has called ``identity elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav forces, so we are learning, are destroying the
archives of the Kosovar people,'' Shea said. ``Property deeds,
marriage licenses, birth certificates, financial and other records,
public records are being systematically destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after a Russian mission to Belgrade failed to produce a
breakthrough in the international standoff, NATO leaders were faced
with a Kremlin plan to send a group of ships in the Mediterranean
Sea soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large
deployment might send to Belgrade and other countries in the
region,`` State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that although the Russian foreign ministry ``has made
it quite clear that Russia does not intend to become entangled in
the conflict in the Balkans ... the deployments of these ships we
don't see as a particularly helpful gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the Clinton administration ``is concerned the
development will encourage Milosevic to hold out. And that concern
has been communicated to the Russians.''

 Column: Cnet Reporter Wins First Amendment Victory in
Microsoft  Dispute 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Cnet reporter Dan Goodin earned some respect for the online press
last week, winning a First Amendment victory in a dispute with
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted Goodin to name his sources after he broke a
story last fall about Sun Microsystems' lawsuit against the
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   But now a federal magistrate has quashed Microsoft's subpoena,
and the company doesn't seem likely to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Goodin, 34, who previously worked at the San Francisco legal
newspaper the Recorder, had somehow gotten his hands on Microsoft
memos that had been placed under seal in the case. The suit accused
Microsoft of trying to pollute and co-opt Sun's Java programming
language.
</P>
<P>
   His story, ``Microsoft's Holy War Against Java,'' ran on Cnet's
 &LR; www.news.com &LR;  on September 23. It quoted an internal Microsoft
e-mail in which Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said Sun's Java
``scares the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   On October 6, ``at 7:30 a.m., as I was eating my Raisin Bran,
there was a knock at my door,'' Goodin recalls. ``It was a process
server and he handed me a subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted its documents back, and it wanted to find out
who violated the court order sealing the documents. In other words:
It wanted Goodin's sources.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of request that usually sends journalists
packing for a stint behind bars as they defend their sources' right
to remain anonymous. And while no one relishes any time in the
clink, it is the sort of principled stand that can earn a
relatively young news organization like Cnet a mountain of free
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   While Goodin said his lawyers told him a stay behind bars was
highly unlikely, Goodin noted that ``the unique marketing
opportunities that Microsoft afforded us by subpoenaing me has not
been lost on me or my editors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goodin was spared from doing time in the slammer last week
when U.S. District Court Magistrate Patricia Trumbull of San Jose
ruled that Goodin could have obtained the documents from any number
of sources without necessarily violating the court's seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents at issue were distributed to numerous
individuals within Microsoft,'' Trumbull wrote. She noted that some
of the same documents were provided to the U.S. Department of
Justice for its antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, she said, she couldn't force Goodin to squeal on his
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet spokeswoman Karen Wood said Cnet's victory boosts the
fledgling online news industry. ``Online news organizations are to
be taken seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said the company was not singling
out Cnet but merely saw it as a ``clear case that the seal was
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Smillie, director of the News Research Group, a New York
organization that studies media and the Internet, said ``most
likely, Microsoft was sending a message'' to employees and business
partners that if they leak its confidential documents, they will be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hasn't decided whether it will appeal the decision,
but Pilla said, ``We obviously respect the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   And there wouldn't be much point if Microsoft did appeal: The
documents in question are now unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW MEDIA MOGULS: &LR;  Two titans of technology, the gray-bearded
eminence George Lucas and the pink-cheeked entrepreneur Halsey
Minor, are competing for leases on a prime chunk of Presidio
property.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the former Letterman Hospital site, 23 acres of
grassy bay views in the country's largest urban national park.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, &UR;  &LR; 54, the pioneering filmmaker, wants to move 1,500 of his
employees scattered throughout Marin County into a new campus that
would serve as a center for digital filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, 34, the impresario who founded Cnet only five years ago,
wants to consolidate his offices _ now clustered in various
buildings below Telegraph Hill _ as part of the Shorenstein Group's
broader commercial proposal for the Presidio site.
</P>
<P>
   Two other groups are finalists for the land, but Cnet and
Lucasfilm hope the glamour of the digital future will give them an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   The two competitors put together vastly different videotapes to
impress the Presidio Trust members.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lucasfilm video, violins played as aerial shots lingered
lovingly on the buildings, vineyards and streams at Lucas's
splendid Skywalker Ranch, in bucolic West Marin. Film clips showed
scenes from ``Star Wars'' and glimpses of Oscar statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet's video, on the other hand, reflected the fast-pace of the
Internet, with quick cuts, pulsing music and short sound bites from
Cnet employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio Trust Board of Directors will pick a finalist in
May _ right around the time the new ``Star Wars'' movie comes out.
Good luck, Halsey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WELL, WELL, WELL:  &LR; A pair of geezers in their respected fields,
the 111-year-old Press Club of San Francisco and the WELL, which at
14 years is about the same age as the Press Club in Internet years,
combined forces last week to discuss a question with
up-to-the-minute relevance: ``How is the Internet changing
journalism?''
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Elizabeth Weise, a technology writer for USA Today,
noted that the Web has created a need for ``a tremendous number of
reporters, and not all are from as rigorous a background as I'm
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rosenberg, senior editor of the online magazine Salon,
noted that readers keep Web journalists honest by catching their
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who used to work at the Examiner, said online readers
are far more likely than readers of print publications to dash off
an e-mail ridiculing a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better get it right,'' he said, ``because people are
going to know.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE THERE'S WILL: &LR;  A company doesn't usually bring members of
its board of directors on dog-and-pony shows to demonstrate its
product.
</P>
<P>
   But since Replay Networks added William R. Hearst III to its
board last week, the company knew it had a marquee name that might
appeal to journalists jaded by the same old product pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, 49, the former publisher of the San Francisco Examiner,
is now a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm of
Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst accompanied Replay marketeers on a press tour last week,
demonstrating the company's device _ a newfangled video cassette
recorder _ and touting Kleiner Perkins' new $8 million investment
in Replay.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst sits on several other boards, including Internet firms
Preview Travel, AtHome Corp. and SpringStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Do these high-tech endeavors mean Hearst has forsaken his
print-media roots?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a believer that one technology pushes another out of
business,'' he said. ``If that's true, the invention of television
should have pushed radio out of business.''

MISSTEPS OF YOUTH WON'T HAUNT BUSH CANDIDACY, BENNETT SAYS 

</HEADLINE>

and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former U.S. Education Secretary and drug czar
William Bennett said Wednesday that missteps Gov. George W. Bush
may have made during his ``irresponsible youth'' should not haunt
Bush as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish have a saying: The merry-hearted boys make the best
men,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young and male, some of us in college, some of us in high
school, did things we're not particularly happy about or proud of
later, including myself,'' Bennett said. ``That doesn't concern the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that in the aftermath of the White House scandals,
voters want a mature president ``whose words and actions they can
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Bush were the key speakers to a conference of 700
people on how to teach young people family values, clean living,
moral ethics and abstinence from sex until marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the conference that he wants to ``teach young people
(that) the rewards of abstinence far outweigh the risks of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases make
this an important lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must know that abstinence is not just saying no
to sex, but saying yes to a happier and healthier life,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he first met Bush in 1989, shortly after Bush's
father had become president and named Bennett the head of the
Office of Drug Control Policy. Bennett said George W. Bush
introduced himself and noted Bennett's drug-fighting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Kick butt.' I think that was the first public
articulation of what has become known as compassionate
conservatism,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett told the conference that President Clinton has set a bad
moral example for the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got children here. Somebody said earlier in the first
presentation, children don't think oral sex is sex. Duh. Who's
telling them that?'' Bennett asked. ``There have got to be some
lines you just cannot cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Conference on Right Choices for Youth, which drew
professionals who work with young people, cost $75,000 to $80,000,
said Dr. Joe S. McIlhaney of Austin, president of The Medical
Institute for Sexual Health, a private organization based in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   McIlhaney, a well-known leader in the movement for abstinence
until marriage, helped the governor's office, the Texas Education
Agency and the Department of Health in organizing the event.
</P>
<P>
   The program was financed by five foundations, Texas Instruments
Inc., Houston physician John P. McGovern and the Governor's
Business Council, which is a private organization of business
leaders across the state.
</P>
<P>
   An oft-repeated theme was that children stray into early sex,
alcohol, tobacco and drug use, gangs and violence when their
parents and other adults send conflicting signals to them about
such behaviors.

FOR AMERICANS, DAVIS CUP MISSION IS TWOFOLD 
FED CUP MOVE SUITS KING 
IMG DISMISSES SUIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not panicking yet, but the 1999 U.S. Davis Cup squad,
which faces the British team of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in the
first round this weekend in Birmingham, England, is playing for
more than pride.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the honor of advancing to the quarterfinal and a
prearranged Davis Cup centenary celebration at the Longwood Cricket
Club in Boston, site of the first Davis Cup competition in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States is defeated by Britain, it faces the threat
of demotion from the World Group that will contend for the cup in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can say they want to play a
relegation-round match instead of a quarterfinal this July in
Boston,'' said Tom Gullikson, now 12-4 and entering his sixth and
stormiest season as Davis Cup captain.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson has praised the camaraderie of the 1999 team _ Todd
Martin, Jim Courier, Jan-Michael Gambill and doubles specialist
Alex O'Brien _ but he admitted Wednesday the dual defection of Pete
Sampras and Andre Agassi, who announced in March that he would
never play Davis Cup again, remains a disheartening liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I was totally happy that those two guys
aren't here on our team,'' Gullikson said.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely criticized last September for his selection of the
sluggish indoor hard court that enabled Italy to upset the United
States in the semifinals in Milwaukee and continues to be
criticized for his apparent inability to convince Sampras and
Agassi that the Davis Cup, particularly in this historic year, is
worth their while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't for lack of trying by me or by Judy Levering,''
Gullikson said, referring to the U.S. Tennis Association's
president. ``In the end, it's up to the players to deliver
themselves to us. Recruiting shouldn't be such a major issue. It's
only in our country that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said he intended to use Martin, who skipped the Lipton
Championships to rest a strained stomach muscle for the Davis Cup,
and Courier, who rode the bench in Milwaukee, as his singles
players.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is 3-1 versus Henman and 4-1 versus Rusedski, while
Courier is 1-0 against Henman and 3-0 against Rusedski, whom he has
not faced since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In doubles, pending any unforeseen injuries, O'Brien will team
with Courier or Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if one of them trips over the podium at the
official diner tonight, I may have to rethink the whole lineup, ``
Gullikson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Cup Move Suits King
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting just got a little easier for Billie Jean King, the
Fed Cup captain, now that the April 17-18 confrontation between the
United States and Croatia has been moved from Zagreb because of
security concerns in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling out Hamburg, Germany, as an alternate site, the
International Tennis Federation announced its approval of the move
to the United States, presumably to a clay court site in Florida or
the Carolinas. But King disclosed Tuesday that regardless of where
the match is played, neither of the Williams sisters will be on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Venus repeated as the Lipton champion on Sunday by ending the
16-match unbeaten streak of her younger sister in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the sisters used schoolwork as an excuse to skip the
Fed Cup, and they also implied that, as Jehovah's Witnesses, they
were precluded from putting their country ahead of their God when
they took to the court.
</P>
<P>
   But their father/coach, Richard, appeared to volunteer them for
duty during one of the news conferences he gave at the Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love America, so if I could play the Fed Cup and represent
America, off, I'm gone,'' said Williams, who, unlike his daughters,
is not a a Jehovah's Witness.
</P>
<P>
   King seemed perplexed by the Florida-based family's stance on
the Fed Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``First the Williamses said yes and then they said no,'' King
said. ``I don't know what's going on there, but it's a little too
late to worry about it now. Your first priority is to get a team
together that really wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   King already had a commitment from the second-ranked Lindsay
Davenport and anticipates that the venue change will enable Monica
Seles to join the team. King was disinclined to ask Seles, an
ethnic Hungarian raised in Serbia who lives in Sarasota, Fla., to
compete in Croatia or in Hamburg, the city where she was stabbed in
midmatch six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica loves Fed Cup, but as soon as I heard Zagreb was the
site, I told her, `You're not going there, no way,''' King said.
``Now that it's in the States, I think I can consider her in the
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, Davenport and Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion
who heads Croatia's team, are all entered in next week's Bausch &AMP;
Lomb Championships at Amelia Island, Fla., one of the prospective
sites, along with Delray Beach, Fla., to serve as the emergency
host of the Fed Cup.
</P>
<P>
   IMG Dismisses Suit
</P>
<P>
   The International Management Group has dropped its
breach-of-contract lawsuit against Jeffrey Schwartz, the lawyer and
former IMG agent. Schwartz angered the company last month when he
resigned his position as vice president of the tennis division and
departed to open a law office in Manhattan with his top client, No.
1-ranked Pete Sampras, in tow.
</P>
<P>
   As part of IMG's agreement with Schwartz, Sampras will remain
with IMG for marketing purposes while continuing to employ Schwartz
as a business manager and legal adviser. The same arrangement goes
for Marcelo Rios, another of Schwartz's main clients during his six
years at IMG.
</P>
<P>
   But IMG has lost Schwartz's top female client, No. 1 ranked
Martina Hingis, to Advantage International, the rival management
company that also signed Anna Kournikova after she dismissed IMG as
their marketing agent.

   BANTEAY CHHMAR, Cambodia _ One of the boldest and most
destructive temple robberies ever carried out in Cambodia might
have gone undiscovered for months or even years if Claude Jacques
had not wandered into an antique shop in Thailand last December.
</P>
<P>
   There Jacques, a French expert on Cambodian antiquities, found
himself face to face with a familiar stone inscription from the
12th-century temple of Banteay Chhmar.
</P>
<P>
   Few other people had ever seen the stone or, in recent years,
the temple itself _ a remote and unrestored jumble of sagging
archways, moss-covered walls, cracked bas reliefs and weather-worn
but still gently smiling stone gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that inscription perfectly well, because I worked on
it,'' said Jacques, who visited the temple in 1965 and 1991. ``I
could not stay calm.'' The four-foot-high stone, with its inscribed
account of ancient battles, was on sale for $8,000. Jacques called
the Thai police, who impounded it.
</P>
<P>
   But his discoveries were only beginning. The stone inscription
turned out to be just a tiny part of the loot from an extended raid
on the temple last November and December that officials say was
organized by Cambodian military officers using power tools and
heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques and other experts are calling it one of the
largest-scale thefts of Cambodian antiquities since the first and
most famous of the robbers, the French writer Andre Malraux, carted
nearly a ton of stones from Angkor Wat in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   And experts fear that it could be part of a new wave of looting
at Cambodia's hundreds of remote and unprotected temples.
</P>
<P>
   As the Khmer Rouge Communist insurgency has collapsed in the
last two years, many hidden sites have suddenly become open to
looters. Much of Cambodia's countryside remains lawless, and
hundreds of temples lie unguarded, unstudied and overgrown with
vegetation. The only witnesses to the raid on Banteay Chhmar were
the villagers who live around the edges of the temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not basic, usual looting,'' said Sebastien Cavalier, a
Cambodia-based representative of UNESCO. ``It's huge-scale
looting.'' He was drenched with sweat in the tropical heat as he
stood amid the temple ruins the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre Malraux took maybe 20 statues,'' he said. ``Here it's
500. It's like a case study for looting, every kind of looting, big
and small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see 12-meter-long walls totally dismantled,'' he said,
a length of nearly 40 feet, ``with stones cut into two pieces. You
can see looting of heads, looting of pediments, looting of bas
reliefs, illicit excavations.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismantled walls alone, Cavalier said, more than 500 square
feet of bas relief was chopped into pieces and trucked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it is unfortunately one of the worst damages in
the history of the looting of Cambodian temples,'' said Jacques,
who is the special adviser on the Angkor temple complex for UNESCO,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques and Cavalier came here in January to inspect the
looting; they already suspected that the damage might be extensive.
Just before their trip, the Thai police intercepted trucks near the
Cambodian border carrying 117 heavy stone pieces of a dismantled
temple wall that the two men later confirmed had come from Banteay
Chhmar.
</P>
<P>
   The temple is just 15 miles from the Thai border in a barren
corner of northwestern Cambodia that is almost inaccessible by
road. To reach it, the researchers traveled by military helicopter,
an hour's flight from Siem Reap _ the home of the temple complex of
Angkor and the heart of Cambodian civilization _ which dates from
the same period as Banteay Chhmar.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw the damage, Jacques, said, ``I was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unable to say anything,'' he recalled. ``It was
horrible. I had never seen such bad damage, and all for nothing,
you know? For money. The small heads they take, they probably have
to destroy 10 to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Uong Von, the director of heritage protection at the Ministry of
Culture, said pneumatic drills had been used to chop statues from
their bases and dismantle tons of stone bas relief.
</P>
<P>
   The drills left regular toothmarks along the edges of walls.
Freshly sliced stone slabs lie here and there, their sharp edges
contrasting with the worn and mossy blocks around them. Statues
stand headless and faceless where looters smashed them. Where the
inscription of an ancient battle once stood, only a jumble of
square stones remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compare it with the looting at Angkor,'' Cavalier
said. ``It's on a totally different scale. At Angkor the head
disappears. At Banteay Chhmar the whole wall disappears. It's as if
you have Notre-Dame de Paris and somebody comes and starts to cut
off all the pediments.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, there is almost no way to combat the
looting.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1,200 temples are scattered around the country,
Cavalier said, but there is no complete inventory to help officials
monitor what needs to be protected and what may have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's treasures have been looted almost constantly since
Malraux's time _ by French and Vietnamese armies, by refugees
fleeing the Khmer Rouge and by the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the Khmer Rouge were driven from their final stronghold at
Anlong Veng last year, officials say, a trove of stolen artifacts
was found. Young Chantha, an official at the Cultural Heritage
Department, said 20 to 30 tons of antiques had been found at the
home of Ta Mok, a Khmer Rouge leader who is now awaiting trial in
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   Though some progress has been made in recent years in returning
artifacts to Cambodia and other nations, experts say the trade in
antiquities continues to flourish. As efforts grow to choke off the
trade in Cambodian art through Thailand, for example, the experts
say a new route has appeared through Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   As with much of the looting in Cambodia, official corruption
appears to have been involved in the thefts at Banteay Chhmar.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian officials say they have identified the military unit
and the officer responsible for the pillage, though it is not clear
whether the looters will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can find this officer in Division 7, I will not protect
him,'' said his superior, Gen. Ko Chhean, sounding a little
doubtful. ``It is up to the law. Maybe he should be put on trial.''

Hundley's elbow and ends with two prongs, each about half-an-inch
long, a few inches above the inside of his elbow, at the bottom of
his bicep.
</P>
<P>
   When Hundley raises his arm, the jagged four-inch scar looks
like a divining rod. But there is nothing divine about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's been looking at that scar for 18 months. The Dodgers,
and the rest of baseball, will look at it for the next six months.
They'll monitor it closely, because much of the team's chances this
season are tied to that elbow. So much of what the Dodgers want to
accomplish hinges on Hundley, including how the batting order
shapes up and how the pitching staff is handled.
</P>
<P>
   The league will watch because catchers don't come back from
reconstructive elbow surgery, mainly because they don't attempt the
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is testing the theory, hoping to set a precedent for
catchers, as Tommy John did for pitchers. But there are risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (catchers) are more likely to throw off balance, so
you're concerned about that,'' said Dodgers team physician Dr.
Frank Jobe. ``I don't think we're worried about Todd. I think he's
going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Mets. Or at least that's what they're saying now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had finished (last) season healthy, had caught a couple
games and was fine,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said.
``Our plan was if we didn't sign Mike (Piazza) we would have gone
with Todd. He would have been our everyday catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets signed Piazza, the former Dodgers icon, to a
$91 million contract, then traded Hundley to the Dodgers. Hundley
said the elbow was fine in December, and everyone else agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements reverberated around Dodgertown this spring,
even when Hundley wasn't catching during the first week of
Grapefruit League games. The Dodgers elected to err on the side of
extreme caution when it came to Hundley's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continued after Hundley whacked the ball in the
batting cage for more than 30 minutes on March 9, aggravating his
forearm muscle and causing inflammation in his elbow. It pushed his
spring catching debut back two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Hundley caught Wednesday against the Houston Astros, it
marked the first time he caught back-to-back games this spring. To
him, it demonstrated his readiness to be in the lineup opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could go four or five days (a week),'' Hundley said.
``Whatever they want to do.'' &QL; 
Pitchers are listening
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are eager for Hundley to be healthy and at the same
time, eager not to rush him. At his best, he offers so much that
general manager Kevin Malone has staked a large portion of his
reputation on acquiring Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Malone traded Charles Johnson, the premier defensive catcher in
the National League, for Hundley, a guy whose value can't be
measured by mere numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Players gravitate to Hundley. They believe him, and in him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has caught four games this spring. Twice he caught Kevin
Brown, once Ismael Valdes and once Darren Dreifort. None before
last Tuesday, but that didn't matter. They still listened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley caught bullpen sessions with each of the Dodgers
starters, and after receiving a handful of pitches he was ready and
able to talk about release points and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   In Valdes' last outing, he gave up a 430-foot, two-run homer to
Atlanta's Chipper Jones in the first inning. Before the ball
landed, Hundley was making his way to the mound. Valdes pitched
62/3 scoreless innings after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and said, `Throw inside. Let's go,' '' Valdes
said. ``He communicated. He's a great catcher. He gives you a good
location to throw the ball. He's a good communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets closer John Franco gave Hundley the ultimate catching
compliment, saying he had complete trust in the pitches Hundley
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes charge on the field and the pitcher responds to
him,'' Franco said. ``He's a stand-up guy. He's not one of those
guys you have to worry about. I knew when Todd called a pitch, I
could throw it and not worry.'' &QL; 
`He's mechanically pure'
</P>
<P>
   There is pressure on Hundley to perform well. After all, he's
replacing one of the greatest, most dynamic, offensive catchers in
Piazza. He is also replacing Johnson, one of the top defensive
catchers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Mike Piazza, and Mike Piazza's not me. I'm not here to
fill his shoes,'' Hundley said. ``I didn't even realize, until
people started to point it out to me, that we were trading teams. I
didn't even think about that. I was thinking of Charles Johnson.
Charles Johnson is a quality catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The blend Hundley brings behind the plate is alluring. He's more
than a shade behind both Johnson and Piazza in their specialties,
but his overall package surpasses both of them easily.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Dodgers officials said Piazza's deficiencies behind
the plate cost the team, on average, three-fourths of a run per
game. And Johnson's offense was weak. He hit .217 and struck out 99
times in 102 games with the Dodgers last season. In a Dodgers
lineup dominated by righties, Hundley's power and switch-hitting
ability is welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this team to be successful, you hope that Todd comes in
and he can hit .260, .270,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``You hope that he can hit 20 home runs, drive in 70 runs and
play 130 games. He does that, that's a successful year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two seasons before the elbow surgery, Hundley hit a
combined .265 with 71 homers, 53 doubles and 198 RBI. In 1996,
Hundley set the major-league record for homers by a catcher with
41.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers need Hundley behind the plate more than they
need his offense. His possible backups _ Angel Pena, Paul Lo Duca
and Rick Wilkins _ are competent but don't possess his leadership
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the surgery, Hundley was throwing out approximately 30
percent of would-be base stealers. Dodgers third-base coach Rick
Dempsey, who managed Hundley last season at Triple-A Norfolk in the
Mets organization, said that number should rise to 40 percent this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came in the game, he was considered more of a
defensive player,'' said Dempsey, a former Dodgers catcher. ``I
think the offense took over for a while, but you can see Todd
putting the concentration back into his defense. He's about as
mechanically pure as you can get. I watched him throw. His release
point is pure. His footwork is good. His set-up is OK. That's
something he's working on all the time. The set-up is getting back
to where it used to be.'' &QL; 
Surgery means changes
</P>
<P>
   There is so much more to Hundley's game than his throwing, but
throwing is the only concern. The elbow is fine. Anyone linked to
the Dodgers will assure you of that.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, goes through the surgery and rehab unchanged.
The injury forced Hundley to alter his baseball personality. In the
two seasons before his injury, he caught 285 games. The Dodgers
would love him to catch 120 this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's called scaling back, and Hundley isn't used to that. Even
if he's banging dirt from his cleats, he does it with purpose and
passion, and he does it with full energy and force.
</P>
<P>
   That comes from his upbringing, from being around baseball for
so long. His father, Randy, was a big-league catcher from 1964 to
1978 with the Giants, Cubs, Twins and Padres. It's an attitude
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said was prevalent when Hundley was
in the minor leagues with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feisty, a tough kid,'' Johnson said. ``A lot like his
father, only a better hitter. His father taught him well. He takes
pride in both aspects of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to throw the ball around the backyard with one of
his four children, he has to make sure he's doing it with proper
mechanics. Some days he'll soak his elbow in a whirlpool before
throwing. Other days the elbow will be massaged.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the protocol is 15 minutes of icing. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be smart, which I'm learning. On the days you feel
great, those are the days to take it easy,'' Hundley, 29, said. ``I
have to make sure this isn't something that bothers me later in
life. I don't want to wake up one day after I'm done playing and
not be able to straighten my arm.'' &QL; 
It's more than numbers
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is everything you want in a catcher _ strong
defensively, tough, smart, a leader. And he can hit.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Malone traded for him. He weighed the risk of
Hundley's elbow not lasting for baseball's marathon season against
Hundley playing 120-or-so games. He liked his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with what he's accomplished in his career, I think his
reputation precedes him as far as people knowing how much he loves
the game,'' Malone said. ``They know about his passion, about his
commitment, his work habits and his dedication. He's all about
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet him you recognize how genuine he is. There are
no facades to him. His personality and his reputation and his work
habits put him in a leadership position. It's more than numbers
with him. That's what I liked.''

COUNTING BLUE MOONS? THINK AGAIN, BECAUSE DEFINITION IS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a banner year for blue moons, with one in
January and another that rose Wednesday night, as March drew to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   But now the astronomy magazine Sky and Telescope has discovered
that the modern definition of a blue moon _ as the second full moon
in a month _ is based upon an error made more than five decades
ago. And the perpetrator was none other than Sky and Telescope
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the twice-in-a-month definition, the magazine says
in the current issue, a blue moon was originally understood to be a
fourth full moon in a season, which normally has three. By that
definition, neither the January nor March moons are blue; in fact,
1999 is blue-moonless.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Olson, an astronomer at Southwest Texas State University
and an author of the current article, said the error came to light
as the magazine's editors were preparing an article for the March
issue on blue moons, which this year had sparked much interest
because of the appearance of two of them. (Most years are lucky to
have one, no matter what the definition.)
</P>
<P>
   In the March article, a Canadian folklorist had traced the
definition to a 1946 Sky and Telescope article, which itself made
reference to the use of the term in a 1937 edition of the Maine
Farmers' Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who is something of an authority on old almanacs, got a
copy of the 1937 edition, and immediately noticed something was
amiss. The blue moon was listed for Aug. 21, 1937. Since the lunar
cycle, from full moon to full moon, is 29{ days, simple arithmetic
showed that this moon could not have been the second in August.
</P>
<P>
   Olson fired off an urgent e-mail to Roger Sinnott, one of the
magazine's associate editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Roger, be very careful what you say in the
article,''' Olson recalled. ``The blue moon in this almanac I'm
sending you is not and cannot be the second moon in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the 1946 article, Hugh Pruett, who lived in
Oregon, did not have the 1937 almanac with him when he wrote the
piece, according to Sinnott. ``He knew enough astronomy to realize
that if there are 13 full moons in a year, one month has to have
two of them,'' Sinnott said.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett wrote in the article that ``this second in a month, so I
interpret it, was called Blue Moon.'' But he obviously did not
realize the date of the blue moon in the almanac, or that 1937 in
fact only had 12 moons.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of the mistake for years, until the writer of a
National Public Radio show on astronomy, having spied the blue moon
tidbit while thumbing through old issues of the magazine, included
it in a program in 1980. It was later picked up by the makers of
the game Trivial Pursuit, who included it as a question in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Sky and Telescope published the March article acknowledging that
the current definition of a blue moon appeared to be wrong. But
determining what the original definition was required a bit more
detective work on the part of Olson, who eventually obtained more
than 40 early editions of the almanac. All told, there were more
than a dozen references to blue moons. ``But not a single one was
the second moon in a month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he noticed that all of the blue moons in the almanacs
occurred within a day or two of the 21st of a month, and that they
only occurred in February, May, August and November. Olson saw a
seasonal pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw those 21st's, I was thinking equinoxes and
solstices,'' he said. And the four months in question, he noticed,
preceded the months that contain either the equinoxes or solstices.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of the Maine almanac, he realized, were going by
what is known as a ``tropical'' year, from winter solstice to
winter solstice. And some of these tropical years do have 13 moons.
But more important, the additional moon was considered to come
within a three-month season, not within one month. And because the
almanac's editors had a convention for naming the normal 12 moons
of the year, including the four that are the last in each season,
the blue moon was considered the third moon of a four-moon season.
By their definition, the next one is in February 2000.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MATURE EWING STILL IS A MIRAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is an impression _ and we all know how
deceiving impressions can be _ but there is a thought that Patrick
Ewing grew up Tuesday night. Some reporters used just that kind of
language in commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't mean that Ewing grew physically. For he stands seven
feet tall. Nor did they mean chronologically, in terms of the
physical as well as the basketball. Patrick Ewing is 36, after all,
and is in his 14th season as a professional basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to his growing up had to do with his perceived
ability to place the good of the team above the purely
self-engrossed. And the best that can be said of this is that Ewing
will be in the lineup Thursday night when the Knicks play yet
another tough team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, who, like Indiana on
Tuesday, are trying not to do the Knicks any favors.
</P>
<P>
   But to me, Ewing was on the verge of seeing the Cleveland game
from elsewhere. Against the Pacers in Madison Square Garden, he
went for a rebound and knocked Jalen Rose of Indiana to the floor.
This is fairly routine in the NBA and it is also fairly routine
that Rose might retaliate in some way.
</P>
<P>
   So he did. As Ewing trotted over and past him, Rose tripped him.
Ewing stumbled; Rose rose, and Ewing got to his feet and went after
Rose, as though to throttle him.
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands watching in the stands and even more viewing
on television, this was old hat. It was obvious that Ewing was
going to fight Rose and then they'd both be thrown out of the game
and be suspended for one or more games. So the fans were screaming,
to their neighbors in the stands or their neighbors on the third
floor, ``Patrick, don't! Patrick, don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done this numerous times, the most hurtful being when a
brawl broke out on the court during a Miami playoff and he left the
bench even though he was reminded at that moment by a teammate that
the rules state he would be suspended if he did so.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are struggling to secure a playoff spot. They can ill
afford to lose any of their valuable players _ Ewing being among
the most valuable _ for one game or more, or even for a part of a
game.
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing came closer to Rose, obviously looking for trouble,
Rose backpedaled with hands and arms in a kind of rope-a-dope
posture, looking for an opening to the bigger Ewing, or an exit.
</P>
<P>
   And then the referee, Dick Bavetta, jumped between them and
received an accidental whack on the nose from the defensive Rose.
And now here came Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, about a foot shorter
than the pugilists on the court, grabbing and yanking at Ewing's
jersey as if it had just been stolen from his shop.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing still apparently wanted a piece of Rose and struggled to
get free, but soon the whole thing was over. Rose was ejected and
Ewing, miraculously, was allowed to continue play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to smack him,'' said Ewing after the game, ``but.
...'' Some have interpreted this as Ewing growing up, that he
backed off. To me, he lost his professional cool and simply
couldn't reach Rose.
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing had truly grown up, he would have shaken the trip off
and then beaten the other team's brains out on the court.
</P>
<P>
   He did return to play superbly in the Knicks' one-point triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ewing had truly grown up, he would follow the way Reggie
Miller and _ this is difficult to write _ Dennis Rodman react to
physical play. They laugh it off and walk away. And then try to
beat the other team's brains out in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Self-absorbed behavior has done in the Knicks on too many
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears it won't end, not with Ewing and not with Latrell
Sprewell, in his own fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While Sprewell has been an exciting and increasingly effective
player with the Knicks, it is obvious that he is not looking to be
team-oriented. After his suspension from basketball for choking his
previous coach, and before the team signed him, the Knicks, with
Van Gundy, had long conversations with Sprewell last summer about
fitting in with the team.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd do whatever it takes to win. Now he is grousing
about being a sixth man. The coach says that NBA players often
complain, but, wisely, he says he won't change what he feels is
best for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams invariably have one player who leads on the
court. Ewing is the leader on the court. Sprewell is developing in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, has demonstrated the selfless vision to earn
the coveted rings. Knick fans, sadly, may just be waiting in vain.

   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ The paradox of a luxury resort in
a working-class county has always been apparent here in
southeastern West Virginia. But now it is fueling a political
fight, pitting the values of rural Christian fundamentalists
against a lifestyle of golf, aroma therapy and finger bowls with
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this century, the Greenbrier is planning to
expand. Almost 90 years ago, the owners built a golf course that
helped turn the stately hotel into one of the nation's best-known
resorts, a favorite of the rich and the famous.
</P>
<P>
   Now, facing financial uncertainty because of a dwindling number
of visitors in the winter, expansion plans are under way again.
This time the owners want to convert a once-secret bomb shelter
built under the hotel for the use of Congress in the event of a
nuclear war into West Virginia's first casino, for the exclusive
use of the Greenbrier's guests.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the casino would generate new jobs and tax
revenue that are desperately needed in West Virginia, one of the
poorest states in the nation. A study for the Greenbrier by West
Virginia University says the casino would pump an additional $34
million into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   But building another golf course at the resort might be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Led by local church leaders who regard gambling as evil, many
residents of Greenbrier County are vowing to defeat a county
referendum that would allow the casino to open, no matter what
economic benefits it might generate.
</P>
<P>
   Even guests at the Greenbrier, who now pay as much as $645 a
night at the peak of the golf season, say they are not sure casino
gambling belongs at a place so genteel that signs posted outside
elevators at night ask for quiet, saying: ``It's sleepy time down
South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in here for the first time I thought I was
stepping back in time, it was so elegant,'' said Becky Belew, a
lawyer from Stuart's Draft, Va. ``If you allow gambling to come in
here, you would somehow diminish that.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino's leading opponents are less concerned with elegance
than decadence. For years, they say, they have cherished the
672-room hotel as a good neighbor and the chief economic engine of
Greenbrier County.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel staff grows to 1,600 during peak seasons, making it,
by far, the largest employer in a three-county area. And jobs pay
well. Even dishwashers can earn $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents fear casino gambling will usher in a new era at
the Greenbrier, which is owned by the CSX Corp., a holding company
primarily engaged in transportation operations and based in
Richmond. Many say they fear that a casino would attract ``the
wrong kind of people'' and fuel addictions to gambling, causing
many to lose far more than they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Greenbrier,'' said the Rev. Patricia Jarvis, a
vocal opponent of the casino who is pastor of the the United
Methodist Church in Lewisburg. ``I am certainly in favor of
anything that strengthens it. But I don't think this is the way.
You look around where gambling is a part of the landscape, and you
see it has ruined the moral texture of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Flynn, pastor of the Trinity United Methodist
Church in nearby Ronceverte, said: ``My intention is not to prevent
people from having a good time. My intention is to prevent a large
out-of-state corporation from setting up shop in my county to prey
upon people who have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Objections by religious leaders are all the more striking in
that only paying, registered guests of the Greenbrier would be
permitted inside the casino. After rebuffing the hotel's lobbying
efforts for five years, state lawmakers this month passed a
narrowly written bill that bars outsiders from entering and
prohibits the management from offering free rooms as a lure to
well-heeled guests the way hotels in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic
City do.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also channels a large portion of the casino's
revenue to the state, 52 percent of the money from slot machines
and 37 percent from gaming tables. Greenbrier County would get 4
percent of the gross revenue, the town of White Sulphur Springs 2
percent and the remaining six towns in the county would share
another 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a pro-business Republican who is facing
re-election next year, is expected to sign the bill soon.
</P>
<P>
   But state lawmakers left final approval to voters in Greenbrier
County as a concession to those who oppose gambling in general and
fought the legislation on the ground that the state has all the
gambling it needs in three horse racing tracks, a dog track and a
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   County officials predict that the referendum will go before
voters next year, giving both sides time to plot strategy in what
could become a bitter and costly fight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already, the fight is under way. Some church leaders have begun
preaching against gambling in their Sunday sermons. At Ms. Jarvis'
church, which opposes even raffles and Bingo, officials have
circulated fliers that quotes the church's Book of Discipline,
which says: ``Gambling is a menace to society, deadly to the best
interests of moral, social, economic and spiritual life, and
destructive of good government. As an act of faith and concern,
Christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to
minister to those victimized by the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flynn said some religious leaders in the county have met
with officials of a political consulting firm in Clarksburg to
discuss fund-raising in an effort to counter what they expect will
be a hard fight from the Greenbrier for passage of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Their instincts are good.
</P>
<P>
   Ted J. Kleisner, president of the resort, said he would try to
persuade county residents who might never see the inside of the
casino that its potential economic benefits to the region outweigh
concerns over gambling. If opened, he said, the casino would
eliminate the off-season layoffs that leave as many as 800 hotel
employees without jobs for three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kleisner also said he was sensitive to the tastes of typical
guests, and promised that the casino would have none of the
garishness of Atlantic City or Las Vegas and that building it in
the former bomb shelter, a distant wing from the main lobby, would
keep it far from children.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its potential status as the only legal casino in West
Virginia, the Greenbrier gambling hall could become the only one
ever built in a bunker to provide protection against nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed under utmost secrecy in the Cold War, from 1958 to
1961, the bunker was designed to accommodate members of the House
and Senate and their staffs for an indefinite period to assure that
the legislative branch of the federal government could function in
case of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bunker was fully maintained through 1992, when its presence
was disclosed in a Washington Post magazine article. As a result,
Congress voted to end its budget, and the bunker was closed in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, parts of the bunker were routinely used for
hotel functions, although guests never knew their real purpose. The
House and Senate chambers, for example, often served convention
groups, and the staff meeting area became the hotel exhibition
hall, which is where the casino would be built.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is unclear how the referendum vote might go. Both
sides say they expect a turnout of about 40 percent of the county's
16,100 registered voters. But rather than break along party lines _
there are now 11,500 registered Democrats and 4,600 Republicans _
many county residents say the deciding factors are more likely to
be moral and economic.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene W. Walker, who owns a furniture store in Rainelle, and
Harold Hinkle, who owns a one-chair barber shop in Rupert, echoed
sentiments expressed by many entrepreneurs in the county. ``I'm all
for it,'' Walker said, predicting that the casino would help put
more people to work.
</P>
<P>
   But others are struggling with the choice. In her small flower
shop in the tiny town of Rupert, Karen Patterson said she was in
favor of more jobs, but did not hesitate to sign a petition
circulated by her church condemning the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as business-wise, it's good,'' she said. ``But as far
as Christian-wise, it's bad.''

   WASHINGTON _ The loss of an American stealth fighter in
Yugoslavia on Saturday did not represent a failure of its
radar-evading technology, experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter-bomber, which went down 30
miles west of Belgrade, probably because of enemy fire, represents
an early version of technology that is becoming increasingly common
in military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, including materials and design features that
cause the craft to absorb rather than reflect radar beams, was not
expected to make planes invisible to radar, but rather to reduce an
enemy's ability to detect them.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of the F-117's loss has yet to be determined,
but senior Pentagon officials, speaking on condition that they not
be identified, said the plane was tracked for a time by Yugoslav
military radar and probably was hit by a Russian-made SA-3
surface-to-air missile.
</P>
<P>
   American military officials have not disclosed the operating
conditions of the plane at the time it was lost, or how long it had
been visible on radar.
</P>
<P>
   But private military experts say that under the right
conditions, stealth aircraft can be detected in a variety of ways,
including with certain radars. Still, they said, the planes have
great advantages over conventional warplanes without such
``low-observability technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said the F-117 was an invisible plane that could
not be shot down,'' said John Pike, a military affairs analyst with
the Federation of American Scientists. ``It would be obviously
incorrect to say this represents a failure of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stealth technology is not like a `cloaking device' from `Star
Trek.' In the real world, it makes an airplane difficult to detect,
but not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   No warplane can be made totally undetectable. But the ability to
make the Nighthawk and future models less obvious to radar and
other sensors is improving in an effort to stay ahead of technology
to detect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a cat-and-mouse game between technologies,'' said
Dr. Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based study
group. ``The U.S. has been ahead in its stealth technology for a
while, but this kind of technical monopoly is unusual and can't
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Stealth features extend to the plane's two jet engines. The air
intakes for the engines are covered with a mesh to keep radar
signals from hitting spinning turbine blades, intensifying the
signals, and engine exhaust exits the plane through slits that mix
it with cold air, reducing the craft's infrared heat signature.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 can show up on radar screens in a number of ways,
experts said, including by making sudden maneuvers at low altitude
that can reflect signals to receivers in the area. Such turns and
maneuvers are more likely over the mountainous terrain of
Yugoslavia than the desert terrain of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Further, experts said, when the plane opens its bomb-bay doors
to drop its 2,000-pound ``smart'' bombs, the doors produce a large
radar ``reflection'' that can disclose the aircraft's location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane is most vulnerable to detection when it drops its
bombs,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs themselves show up on radar screens, allowing an enemy
to track them back to their source.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force recently started coating the Nighthawk's bombs
with a radar-absorbing coating, Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   Krepinevich said the type of enemy radar and its position also
could help in detecting a stealth plane.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 operates more effectively when American forces know
the position of enemy radars so the plane can find its way through
holes in a defense screen, he said, and tightly placed or
unexpected radars operating at certain frequencies can detect the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Newer stealth aircraft like the B-2 bomber and the F-22 fighter
have designs dramatically different from that of the F-117. The new
planes have a more curved and streamlined appearance that
developers say makes them even less detectable.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are incorporating stealth features into many new, more
conventional warplanes, experts said, to lessen the possibility of
detection but not necessarily to avoid it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the advantage of seeing the enemy before he sees
you,'' said Daniel Goure, deputy director of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, ``even if it's only for a
couple of minutes or a few seconds. If stealthiness allows you to
get off the first shot, it's worth the effort.''

RATHER INTERVIEWS CLINTON ON `60 MINUTES II'
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH) 
(rk) 
 By   LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a coup for CBS' &UR;  &LR; fledgling news magazine program ``60 Minutes
II,'' President Clinton gave his first exclusive interview in
nearly 15 months Wednesday to Dan Rather of CBS News, the new
program's senior correspondent, as well as the anchor of the ``CBS
Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton answered questions about the war in Yugoslavia and about
the impeachment scandal, which was just getting under way the last
time he gave a one-on-one interview, to Jim Lehrer of ``The
NewsHour'' on PBS, on Jan. 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rather's interview was part of a new policy of openness toward
the press by the administration, a White House press aide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rather interviewed Clinton for an hour at the White House
Wednesday afternoon, then prepared reports for the ``CBS Evening
News,'' at 6:30 p.m., and two segments for the hourlong,
three-segment program ``60 Minutes II,'' which was broadcast at 9
p.m. last night.
</P>
<P>
   By creating two segments, the program's producers could separate
questions about the war in Yugoslavia and questions about the
Monica Lewinsky matter, a topic that might seem trivial in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very strong stating his case'' about the war, Rather
said by telephone Wednesday after the interview, and ``very
forthcoming'' in answering questions about the impeachment crisis
of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was opposed to sending American ground troops to
Kosovo because of ``the prospect of never being able to get them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the impeachment crisis, he said: ``I do not regard
this impeachment vote as some great badge of shame. I do not.
Because, I do not believe it was warranted, and I don't think it
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not think of resigning: ``I wouldn't do
that to the Constitution,'' Clinton said. ``I wouldn't do that to
the presidency. I wouldn't do that to the history of this country.
I would never have legitimized what I believe is horribly wrong
with what has occurred here over the last four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather is one of four regular correspondents for ``60 Minutes
II,'' which was added to the network's prime-time schedule in
mid-January in the hope that it would attract large audiences, as
the original ``60 Minutes'' does on Sunday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was the program's 10th appearance, and it has
posted solid ratings, averaging a 9.6 (each rating point equaling
994,000 homes) and a 15 share (the percentage of sets in use tuned
to that program).
</P>
<P>
   Although some producers from rival networks downplayed the
exclusive, saying that the president was unlikely to make
revelations about either the war or the impeachment process, others
gave CBS News credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bettag, the executive producer of ABC News' ``Nightline''
program, said: ``We're all competitors and can pooh-pooh it, but
when someone gets the first one-on-one interview with the president
after a very long time, that's a great `get,' and the rest of us
would have loved to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for ABC News and NBC News said that their news
divisions had submitted requests for interviews with Clinton in
recent months. Wednesday, NBC News' Washington bureau was told by a
White House spokesman that it was ``CBS' turn in the rotation,'' an
NBC spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had pressed hard for the interview as a way to help its new
program, ``60 Minutes II.'' Clinton has done similar interviews in
the past, appearing with NBC's Tom Brokaw for the July 1996,
kickoff of MSNBC, the cable channel started by Microsoft and NBC
News, and with NBC's Tim Russert of ``Meet the Press,'' in honor of
that program's 50th anniversary in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS had little time to turn the interview to promotional
advantage. Rather learned only the night before that he had the
interview.

JOHNSON STUDIES BULLPEN OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Manager Davey Johnson said the three
exhibition games the Dodgers play this weekend will go a long way
toward determining the left-handed situation in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to have two lefties in the bullpen, and he
appears ready to choose between veteran Greg Cadaret (0-1, 4.97 ERA
this spring), Pedro Borbon (0-0, 2.00) and rookie Onan Masaoka
(0-0, 0.90).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers play the Angels on Friday at Edison Field, and that
could give one of the lefties an opportunity to face Mo Vaughn and
Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The games Saturday and Sunday against the Yankees at Dodger
Stadium present more chances for situational lefties to prove a
point. The Yankees have lefties Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and
Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some situations that we'll see with the Anaheim club
and the Yankees,'' Johnson said. ``I'll use them in situations and
see where each guy is at. That doesn't mean I'm going to decide who
makes my club on the last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Cadaret's major-league service time, and because he
signed a guaranteed contract, he could reject a minor-league
assignment. That could figure into the Dodgers' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said if Masaoka didn't make
the major- league roster he would begin the season in the bullpen
in Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the work Masaoka has done,'' Johnson said.
``I'm pleased with the work Borbon has done. Cadaret had a tough
time the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has all but eliminated latecomer Jeff Williams from the
mix, at least for now. Williams, a 26-year-old lefty from
Australia, pitched two scoreless innings Tuesday against the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Also working against Williams is his experience. He threw with
the big-league club twice during the spring and appeared in 21
games last season at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued with this Williams kid,'' Johnson said. ``He's a
kid for more down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka honored: Before Wednesday's Grapefruit League finale
against the Houston Astros, the Dodgers gave Masaoka a
commemorative watch as the recipient of the Jim and Dearie Mulvey
Award. It's given to the top rookie during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger Experience: The Dodgers will debut an 8,000-square
foot multimedia museum, complete with artifacts of Dodger and
baseball history, before Saturday's game with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger Experience is located in the right-field corner on
the club level of Dodger Stadium. It will house more than 1,000
artifacts, including the 1981 and 1988 World Series trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalks: Instead of the usual workout when the
Dodgers return to Los Angeles, Johnson said he'll give the team
today off so they can handle personal business. . . . Johnson's
latest lineup tinkering has right fielder Raul Mondesi hitting
cleanup, between Gary Sheffield and Devon White. Johnson scrapped
his experiment to hit Mondesi third earlier in the spring and
Mondesi voiced displeasure about hitting fifth. . . . The city of
Vero Beach, Indian River County and the Keep Our Dodgers committee
said farewell to the Dodgers during a sendoff celebration at the
Vero Beach airport before the team left for L.A.

MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC TO CUT GLOBAL WORK FORCE BY 10 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Mitsubishi Electric Corp., one of Japan's big,
diversified electronics makers, announced a broad overhaul
Wednesday that will reduce its global work force by 14,500, or 10
percent, over the next three years to help increase profit. More
than half the job cuts will be in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was one more hint that the economic recovery
the Japanese government has promised in the fiscal year that begins
Thursday may not come as early as officials hope. There is some
fear that an unprecedented wave of corporate restructuring, which
is increasing unemployment and causing financial insecurity among
consumers, could delay a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate, which hit a postwar high in February, is
not going to reverse as long as companies such as Mitsubishi
Electric keep making efforts to pare their labor forces.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric was only the latest company to announce
cutbacks. Besides its plan to reduce the work force of 146,000
people, it intends to reduce capital investment by 20 percent. The
company's own heavy industrial machinery business has suffered
mightily as other Japanese companies have cut their own spending.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, all of the pain these corporations
are currently willing to suffer could be expected to lead to
productivity gains and better profitability, creating jobs and
high-return investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan is also grappling with deflation, which means that as
fast as corporations are cutting jobs, expenses and investment,
their revenue growth is falling. Corporate revenue fell 7.1 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1998, according to the Finance Ministry; 4
to 5 points of that can be accounted for by a slump in wholesale
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, restructuring is gaining pace, and it sounds
impressive _ until you look at deflation,'' said Andrew Shipley, an
economist with Schroders Japan Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley said companies would have to reduce compensation by 6
percent to 8 percent to make up for the revenue erosion that
deflation is causing. Thus far, however, wages have declined 2
percent year on year, and 1 percent of the work force has lost
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The moves that corporations are making to revamp their
businesses are considered aggressive by Japanese standards.
Mitsubishi Electric, which is expected to report a loss of roughly
90 billion yen, or about $750 million, in the fiscal year that
ended Wednesday, said that by March 2002 it will have eliminated
8,400 jobs in Japan and 6,100 abroad. More than 2,000 of these have
already been cut, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi already has reduced its American operations, closing
a semiconductor factory, abandoning sales of analog television sets
and subcontracting the production of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   It has stopped producing computers and TV sets in Britain and
eliminated its semiconductor assembly and testing in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric also said it would reduce the number of its
consolidated subsidiaries to 140 from 180 by March 2001. The
winnowing process is aimed at unprofitable lines of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have asked the company to jettison its consumer
electronics business, and some would like to see it leave auto
parts manufacturing. The company's money-losing semiconductor
manufacturing business is known for quality technology but cannot
compete with larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Electric said Wednesday that it planned to restore
profitability to its semiconductor operations in two years by
focusing on producing more customized chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company projected annual sales of 4 trillion yen by March
2002, compared with 3.7 trillion yen in the fiscal year that is
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, which is also a big maker of military electronics,
said it hoped to become the world's largest producer of satellites
and satellite equipment, as well as a leading seller of
communications infrastructure technology.

HEALTH PLAN TO RECONSIDER WELLPOINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Officials at a Colorado health plan
said Wednesday they will reconsider a takeover offer by WellPoint
Health Networks, two days after agreeing to sell to a different
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Westergaard, a spokesman for the nonprofit Rocky Mountain
Hospital and Medical Systems, said Wednesday his firm would send a
letter to WellPoint executives asking for more details on the
company's offer to pay between $200 million and $240 million for
the plan. Rocky Mountain markets its products under the Blue
Cross-Blue Shield of Colorado and Nevada name.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000-member plan on Monday announced it signed a
definitive agreement to be bought by Anthem Inc. for approximately
$165 million. That prompted a cry of foul from WellPoint, which
fired off letters to Rocky Mountain's investment bankers and to the
Colorado Attorney General's Office noting that it had offered more
for the plan. The attorney general, in turn, has asked Rocky
Mountain to explain itself.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint spokesman John Cygul said his company was genuinely
startled to learn of the Anthem agreement. ``We'd just like to see
an open auction process,'' Cygul said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Rocky Mountain insists the process by which it
selected Anthem was fair and open. Going in Anthem's favor,
Westergaard said, was that the company had agreed to provide an
immediate cash infusion to boost Rocky Mountain's reserves, which
had fallen low after several quarters of losses. Without such cash,
Rocky Mountain risked losing its Blue Cross-Blue Shield
accreditation, he said, and WellPoint was less willing to
immediately pour money into the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an urgency and our need to get capital now, and that
played into'' the decision, Westergaard said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, WellPoint's initial bid was not necessarily better than
what Anthem offered, he said. As in California, a nonprofit
Colorado health plan that converts to for-profit status must create
a charitable foundation to offset the the tax-exempt status it
previously enjoyed. WellPoint offered to earmark $140 million of
its bid to the foundation, while Anthem offered ``at least $140
million,'' suggesting that more could be offered, Westergaard said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rocky Mountain has signed a definitive agreement with
Anthem, any other acquirer will also have to cover a $6 million
break-up fee written into the agreement. A new firm would also be
required to pay Anthem 50 percent of the difference between
Anthem's bid and the new offer. Those factors, and Rocky Mountain's
apparent satisfaction with Anthem, may make a potential deal too
expensive and problematic for WellPoint, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint earlier this month agreed to buy another Colorado
business, QualMed Plans for Health, from Woodland Hills,
Calif.-based Foundation Health Systems. And a Rocky Mountain deal
would fit nicely into those plans, said Bill McKeever, an analyst
at investment bank Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the big scheme of things, Colorado figures into the
company's future far less than states like California, Georgia and
Texas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say this is a big deal,'' McKeever said.

   Almost desperately, you look for a pattern in the seeming
randomness of Annie Dillard's disturbing new book, ``For the Time
Being,'' which she describes in a note as comprising ``scenes from
a paleontologist's explorations in the deserts of China, the
thinking of the Hasidic Jews of Eastern Europe, a natural history
of sand, individual clouds and their moments in time, human birth
defects, information about our generation, narrative bits from
modern Israel and China, and quizzical encounters with strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   You want meaning if only because many of Ms. Dillard's
descriptions are so upsetting. She begins by describing some
``vivid photographs'' in the standard manual of human birth
defects, ``Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation'':
``If you gave birth to two bird-headed dwarfs, as these children's
mother did _ a boy and a girl _ you could carry them both
everywhere, all their lives, in your arms or in a basket, and they
would never leave you, not even to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   She goes on to describe how in the year 135 the Romans killed
Rabbi Akiva for teaching Torah: ``They killed him by flaying his
skin and stripping his bones with currycombs. He was 85 years old.
A Roman currycomb in those days was an iron scraper; its blunt
teeth combed mud and burrs from horsehair. To flay someone _ an
unusual torture _ the wielder had to bear down. Perhaps the skin
and muscles of an old scholar are comparatively loose.'' She finds
``hilarious'' the approach to numbers expressed by serial killer
Ted Bundy, when he asked what the big deal was about what he had
done: ``I mean, there are so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   What is Ms. Dillard up to here in this book, which seems to be a
throwback to her early prose poem ``Holy the Firm'' (1977), in
which she searches for goodness in a world where her neighbor's
daughter has just had her face burned away in an airplane accident?
(``Holy the Firm'' was preceded by ``Tickets for a Prayer Wheel''
and ``Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,'' and followed by six other works,
among them ``An American Childhood,'' a memoir, and ``The Living,''
a novel.)
</P>
<P>
   As quickly becomes evident in the new book, Ms. Dillard, like
the reader, also longs for meaning. Interspersed with her reports
of catastrophes are anecdotes about the likes of French
paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin; the founder of Hasidism,
Israel ben Eliezer, whom his followers called the Baal Shem Tov or
the Master of the Good Name, and sundry other mystics, visionaries
and religious philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   By degrees a pattern establishes itself in the text:
descriptions of great evil are followed by comments about sand,
which are juxtaposed with mind-numbing statistics, which are
contrasted with comments attempting to explain God's ways.
</P>
<P>
   From this pattern several fundamental questions arise: First,
how can God know and love each member of the earth's population?
Second, how can any of us know and love anyone besides our family
and friends, which, as Ms. Dillard writes, compose ``a group
smaller than almost all sampling errors, smaller than almost all
rounding errors, an invisible group at whose loss the world will
not blink''? Third, how can evil exist in a world created by God?
And finally, who are we anyway and what on earth are we doing here?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Ms. Dillard simply ask these questions and set about
to answer them directly? Because the power of her stories and
imagery heightens our desire for answers. For instance, in
describing the difficulty of feeling compassion, she writes:
``There are 1,198,500,000 people alive now in China. To get a feel
for what this means, simply take yourself _ in all your
singularity, importance, complexity and love _ and multiply by
1,198,500,000. See? Nothing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ted Bundy pointed out, ``There are so many people.'' What can
a single life matter? Why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Holy the Firm,'' Ms. Dillard concluded simply that you have
to have faith. In ``For the Time Being,'' the reasons you should
care are far more complex. Stated baldly they lack the power Ms.
Dillard has lent them in the context of her prose poem, but what
they boil down to is the following: Teilhard said, in Ms. Dillard's
paraphrase, that ``The omnipotence of God makes no sense if it
requires the all-causingness of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dillard adds: ``Seven centuries have passed since Aquinas
wrote that God has power to effect only what is in the nature of
things.'' And if we accept that Darwinian evolution is part of that
nature, then we understand that ``God is no more blinding people
with glaucoma, or testing them with diabetes, or purifying them
with spinal pain, or choreographing the seeding of tumor cells
through lymph, or fiddling with chromosomes, than he is jimmying
floodwaters or pitching tornadoes at towns.''
</P>
<P>
   God reveals Himself through man, Ms. Dillard proposes: ``Even
Meister Eckhart said, `God needs man.' God needs man to disclose
him, complete him, and fulfill him, Teilhard said.'' Further:
``God's being immanent, said Abraham Joshua Heschel, depends on
us.'' And as Brother Carl Porter, an Evangelical Holiness minister
from Georgia, preached: ``God ain't no white-bearded man up in the
sky somewhere. He's a spirit. . . . He ain't got no body. . . . The
only body he's got is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dillard concludes: ``You cannot mend the chromosome, quell
the earthquake, or stanch the flood. You cannot atone for dead
tyrants' murders, and you alone cannot stop living tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Martin Buber saw it _ writing at his best near the turn of
the last century _ the world of ordinary days `affords' us that
precise association with God that redeems both us and our speck of
world. . . . `It is given to men to lift up the fallen and to free
the imprisoned. Not merely to wait, not merely to look on! Man is
able to work for the redemption of the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   By such reasoning, Ms. Dillard scales down her cosmic questions
to matters of individual human conduct. Her answers are not for
eternity but only ``For the Time Being,'' by which she means the
here and now.
</P>
<P>
   In her introductory note, Ms. Dillard writes: ``This is a
nonfiction first-person narrative, but it is not intimate and its
narratives keep breaking. Its form is unusual, its scenes are
remote, its focus wide and its tone austere. Its pleasures are
almost purely mental.'' Yet because of the book's imagery what you
experience is not purely mental but sensuous as well. While it may
not promise the immanence of a benevolent God at the end of this
brutal 20th century, it does offer the pleasure of Ms. Dillard's
poetry, and maybe just a flicker of hope in her finally optimistic
moral vision.

U.S. AND EUROPE AT IMPASSE ON NEW WORLD TRADE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A month before the head of the World Trade Organization
is to leave his post, the search for a successor reached a
stalemate Wednesday over the inability of the 134 members to decide
between the two finalists.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong search, the European Union and the United
States appeared to be deadlocked over the choice between Suphachai
Panichpakdi, the Thai commerce minister, and Michael Moore, a
former prime minister of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Mchumo, the Tanzanian representative, who leads the search
committee, said the difficulties faced by the two candidates ``are
so serious that neither of them can enjoy consensus from the
membership to enable them to be elected as the next director
general.'' He made the statement to a gathering of trade
negotiators Wednesday night, the deadline the organization had
imposed for itself to choose a new director.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the trade organization runs its day-to-day affairs
and helps settle contentious disputes among members. It is unclear
what the group will do if it has not selected a director general by
April 30, when the term of Renato Ruggiero of Italy, the current
chief, expires.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock comes as the United States and the European Union
are fighting over a number of contentious trade disputes,
concerning, most notably, banana imports and resulting American
sanctions, hormone-treated beef and aircraft noise.
</P>
<P>
   Mchumo, describing the trade group's failure to meet its
deadline as ``unfortunate and disappointing,'' also alluded to
complaints that certain nations, including the United States, were
impeding the selection process. ``It is clearly very unhealthy for
this process to drag on because such delay breeds rumors,
suspicions and even puts personal friendships at stake,'' he told
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's caretaker trade commissioner, Sir Leon
Brittan, expressed his grievances in a letter to Mchumo, which was
later faxed to journalists, accusing ``unnamed countries'' of
threatening to veto a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anonymous vetoes are plainly inconsistent with the kind of
transparency within the WTO that we have been seeking,'' Brittan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under its rules, the trade organization chooses a director
general by consensus, which has generally been accepted to mean
there is no vote and no veto allowed. The idea is that every
nation, regardless of size, gets an equal say and the trading
giants cannot tip the balance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the only time the process has been used before _ in
selecting Ruggiero four years ago _ it took nine months and was
plagued with delays, accusations and recriminations. The United
States was accused of delaying the selection of Ruggiero, a former
Italian trade minister, because of concerns that his background and
approach were too bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   European officials have asserted that once again, the Americans
are holding up the selection and have been working behind the
scenes to insure that Moore wins. The United States has never
publicly stated a preference.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the European Union's 15 countries back Suphachai.
However, several countries, including France, appear to have
shifted allegiances back and forth between the two candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rita Hayes, the U.S. delegate to the trade organization, called
Brittan's letter ``very difficult,'' but refused to comment further
on its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moore insisted in a radio interview earlier this week
that the contest for the post did not reflect a split between
industrial and developing nations, interviews with trade diplomats
say that is an element. The United States and other industrial
nations support labor standards that require developing countries
to insure minimum levels for wages and working conditions.
Developing countries generally oppose such standards, arguing that
they would raise the cost of their exports and make them less
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade envoys say the United States does not think its best
interests would be served by Suphachai, 52, who is an economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an academic, he's intellectual,'' said a European trade
official, who insisted on anonymity, adding that the Americans
``don't see having a cozy relationship with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, this official said, ``talks the language labor likes to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans say he can also talk to Congress, which is
suspicious of the WTO,'' the official noted.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's envoy, Munir Akram, said Moore, 50, a former union
activist, ``is more likely to push for labor standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has led an effort by developing countries to insure
that one of their leaders becomes the next director general.
</P>
<P>
   Both Moore and Suphachai visited the trade organization's
headquarters here for last-minute lobbying. Thai officials have won
support not only from Asian and many European nations, but from
Latin American and Caribbean countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates are to meet again next week to try to choose between
the two men. Countries backing Suphachai, envoys said, have
threatened to block Moore if Suphachai's candidacy is derailed.

YOUNG WIZARD IS BEST SELLER AND COPYRIGHT CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a junior wizard, 11-year-old Harry Potter has stirred up
quite a steaming caldron of magic _ one that has brought him fame,
glory and a tiff over international copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   As if on a loopy ride on his Nimbus 2000 broom, Potter has
soared into the popular imagination, with the first volume of his
adventures even outselling adult titles by the likes of Tom Wolfe
in the United States. Written by a first-time author, J.K. Rowling,
and originally published in Britain, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' has reached a level of best-sellerdom never
before achieved by a children's novel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The unrequited desire for stories about the young wizard is so
keen that the books have become the literary equivalent of Furby
stuffed animals. Demand is so high, in fact, that knobby-kneed
Harry Potter and his fellow students from the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry are presenting an Internet challenge to
traditional copyrights regulating trade in the works of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowling's much-awaited sequel, ``Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets,'' has not yet been published in the United
States. But devoted fans are buying British versions that are
available through online bookstores like Amazon.com's British
subsidiary _ a development that is alarming Scholastic Press, the
American publisher that paid for the right to publish the book here
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Longstanding concepts of territorial publishing rights are
increasingly challenged in the expanding world of electronic
commerce in literature. Computer users can ignore global borders as
easily as Harry Potter and his friends use the magical compound
floo powder to transport themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When a book published in London is purchased from a computer
attached to a desk in New York, is the sale taking place in Britain
or the United States? The answers are evolving.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think it could very well lead to a test case,'' said
Christopher Little, Ms. Rowling's literary agent in London, who
protested to Amazon.com- after discovering that copies of the
British version of her second book were steadily leaking to the
United States. Little said his complaints so far had been futile,
and he accused Amazon of ``blatantly disregarding territorial
rights and therefore acting illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the sequel in the United States, where it is still
months away from publication, is such that more than 80 readers
posted effusive reviews on Amazon's U.S. Web site, offering simple
instructions for ordering the foreign version from the company's
British site at a cost of less than 14 pounds, or about $23.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Murdoch, the managing director of Amazon's British
subsidiary in England, said that usually the situation was
reversed: British publishers must contend with American books
seeping into their market through online sales. In such cases, he
said, if a British publisher provides documentation about a British
version, the American version is removed from the database.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch said he did not know whether a similar policy existed
for American publishers and referred questions to Amazon's top
executives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos,
referred questions to Murdoch. Bezos did say though that he
considered purchases of the British version ``no different than if
you go to London on a vacation and pick up a book and take it home
in your suitcase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do anything that challenges the establishment, you're
going to annoy some people,'' Bezos added.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this messy global debate about territorial
rights is the author, Joanne Rowling, a 33-year-old former French
teacher who has been described so often as a Cinderella who went
from the dole to the best-seller list that she jokes that the words
``penniless and divorced single mother'' should be tattooed on her
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Harry Potter came to her while she was on a train
to London in 1990. ``It was the most incredible feeling,'' said Ms.
Rowling, who plans to write a total of seven volumes about the
world of Harry Potter. ``I was halfway through a novel for adults
at the time, and out of nowhere, it just fell from above. Harry
came fully formed. Really, it was weird. Basically, the idea was
for a boy to make weird stuff happen all his life and never know
why.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wrote much of the first manuscript in an Edinburgh
cafe called Nicholson's, which allowed her to scribble away at a
table for the price of a cup of coffee while her infant daughter
napped beside her. Ms. Rowling, who is divorced, said she spent
nearly nine months on public assistance in 1993 before finding a
job as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's fantasy world ``seemed like my private internal
world in which I could escape, and it remained quite inviolate,''
Ms. Rowling recalled. In that imaginary realm, Harry has his share
of struggles too. An orphaned son of Hogwart wizards, he sleeps in
a cupboard in the home of odious relatives (of the nonwizard Muggle
persuasion) until he enrolls at the Hogwarts School.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There, equipped with a holly-and-phoenix-feather wand, he
studies potion mixing and herbology and trains on his broomstick to
play quidditch, a sky-high form of basketball with six hoops and
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's world has struck a chord with both children and adults:
the first book in the series has lingered in the upper reaches of
the New York Times best-seller list for 14 weeks and ranked No. 9
in the hardcover fiction category on Sunday. The closest any other
children's novel has come to that long a stay was the three weeks
E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web'' spent on the list in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the word `miracle' mean anything to you?'' said Nancy
Pines, a publisher of children's books at Simon &AMP; Schuster's Pocket
Books. ``What we're talking about here is a foreign import with no
television show, no movie and no celebrity. It's a noisy world, and
it's hard to get attention for a children's book.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice adults in Britain, the book's British publisher,
Bloomsbury, printed a second edition with a more sophisticated
cover so grown-ups could read it in public without embarrassment.
But many adults here are not shy about expressing enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   At the Morton household in Elk Grove Village, Ill., a suburb of
Chicago, both Connie Morton, 43, and her 12-year-old daughter,
Jessica, so loved the characters that they ordered the second
volume directly from Bloomsbury. ``Since then we found out that
Amazon has a United Kingdom Web site, and next time we'll order
from them,'' said Mrs. Morton, a homemaker, adding that her
daughter had read both books a total of 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lord, a 44-year-old lawyer from Boise, Idaho, purchased
the second book from Amazon's British site. ``Harry Potter carries
a sense of innocence in a hostile world,'' said Lord, who posted a
positive review of the book on Amazon and received about a dozen
e-mail messages seeking to know how he got the copy. ``Harry is a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   This steady stream of orders to Britain worries executives at
Scholastic Press in New York, who know that it's possible to order
a British copy and receive delivery in less than eight days.
</P>
<P>
   But the Amazon view is that publishing executives have to face
certain facts. ``The Internet is changing the way the world shops
and the way the world works,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman for
Amazon. ``And it's shaking up the old order and raising concerns
and issues as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic is now trying to respond to increasing demand by
moving up the publication of the second Harry Potter volume to June
and the third book to October. In the meantime they say that they
are working to resolve the situation with Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now feel it's substantial numbers,'' said Michael Jacobs,
Scholastic's senior vice president for trade, who noted that he had
received calls from American booksellers complaining about lost
sales. ``This is the little book that could. And now some
booksellers are starting to feel that if they can't satisfy
customers they're going to lose customers, who will get used to
going to Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Scholastic has been diplomatic in its dispute with
Amazon. But it is hashing out the issue with its lawyers, and the
Association of American Publishers also met with its lawyers last
week and concluded that it might have to take action by seeking new
copyright legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Current U.S. copyright law does not provide firm answers
addressing Internet sales that cross borders. The law bars
importing a copyrighted book without permission but allows an
individual to buy one copy if it is for private use and not for
distribution. But what happens if more than one book is ordered, or
a bookseller buys copies to resell here? How can the law be
enforced? The answers are evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Scholastic intended to sue, Jacobs said he could not
comment. He vowed, though, that the company would protect its
territorial rights. He could not explain precisely how that could
be done short of a lawsuit. Or dragon-blood potions. Or the Draught
of Living Death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give up,'' he said, then brightened for a
brief moment. ``We could turn them into Muggles?''  &QL;

 &HT;    THREE U.S. SOLDIERS MISSING IN MACEDONIA AFTER REPORTED CLASH
 &HT;    EDS: New details on missing soldiers; adds 4th and 5th grafs for
context
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. combat troops on the ground and in Blackhawk
helicopters were conducting a massive search Wednesday night after
three American soldiers came under fire and went missing along
Macedonia's mountainous border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by British and other NATO search and rescue teams, more
than 80 American troops were combing the area late Wednesday,
Pentagon officials said, hours after the missing soldiers' last
radio contact with U.S. forces in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy, but fears that the three might have been
abducted by Serb forces raised tensions over a NATO Balkans mission
that is escalating by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark has asked to add 75
carrier-based warplanes to the U.S. and allied forces attacking
Serbs across Yugoslavia, the Pentagon said Wednesday, as U.S.
officials sharply rebuked Russia for its plan to send spy ships to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   While those two developments were not specifically linked, they
pointed to the rising stakes in a NATO mission that drew fire on
the ground on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said three Army troops traveling in a Humvee
military vehicle were ambushed, shot at and surrounded by gunmen
shortly after 2:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   The attack came shortly after the troops split off from two
other Humvees conducting what the Pentagon called ``a routine
reconnaissance patrol'' near the town of Kumanovo. The town
straddles a major road leading from the Macedonian capital of
Skopje into the embattled Serb province of Kosovo, site of
extensive Serb military and paramilitary operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans radioed to a nearby unit that they had come under
fire and were surrounded, the Pentagon said, and then the group
lost radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would not release the names of the troops as of
late Wednesday. But officials said the families of the missing
soldiers had been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was notified early Wednesday afternoon, but
made no public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Joining in the search were British troops and helicopters, other
NATO forces, and Macedonian police, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops are attached to the First Infantry Division
based in Wurzburg, Germany. The soldiers have been stationed in
Macedonia supporting a NATO mission there that would make up the
vanguard of a proposed peacekeeping force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has stepped up its patrols along the Macedonia-Kosovo
border since the alliance launched air strikes March 24 against
Serb forces attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. NATO officials
have also taken steps to strengthen the security of patrols near
the border, out of concern that Serb commandos might cross over in
the rugged terrain and try to engage NATO forces in retaliation
against the allied air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth day of NATO attacks struck more deeply than ever into
Yugoslavia and across the province of Kosovo on Wednesday, as
NATO's political arm formally agreed to target military and
government facilities in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO struck Serb special forces headquarters near the capital
and hit tanks and troops inside Kosovo. At the same time, Serb
forces continued to shell civilians, burn villages and terrorize
entire communities, extending a rampage aimed at expelling ethnic
Albanians from the tiny Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   With supersonic B-1 heavy bombers set to join in the raids on
Thursday, NATO officials insisted that the air strikes were
beginning to bite into the bone of Serb offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Harried from the skies for three straight days, at least one
Serb battle group had been forced to withdraw from attacks in
Kosovo, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving, I'd say almost daily, to a broader set of
targets,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``We'll attack
all the facilities needed to support, fuel and feed the forces, and
we will, as rapidly as possible, choke them off.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serbs continued to force thousands of ethnic Albanians out of
Kosovo, President Clinton ordered $50 million in emergency aid as
part of a broader NATO effort to get desperately needed tents, food
and medicine to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to give a speech on the Kosovo crisis on
Thursday at the Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia, adjacent to the
home port of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier. He's
expected to speak while standing alongside an F-14 Tomcat and F/A18
Hornet, the Navy's top warplanes which are the tip of the spear of
the Roosevelt's firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt is steaming across the Atlantic and due to arrive
in the Mediterranean Sea by this weekend en route to a scheduled
deployment in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the supreme commander of allied forces in Europe, has
asked the Pentagon to add the carrier and its 75 Tomcats, Hornets
and other warplanes to the NATO mission, Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said no decision had been made on that
request, or on Clark's earlier request for Apache combat
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt would add extensive firepower to the NATO mission.
It travels with a protective carrier battle group made up of four
warships and an attack submarine, all capable of firing long-range
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots from the ship have flown combat air patrols over the
Balkans before, in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In echoes of the Cold War, Russia announced plans to dispatch a
group of seven Navy ships, including a high-tech spy vessel, to the
waters off the Balkan coast in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp rebuke, the Clinton administration voiced concern
that the move might lend relief to Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia. He warned Moscow to hold to its public vow
not to inject the ships into the NATO conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deployments of these ships, we don't see as a particularly
helpful gesture,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
``We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large deployment
might send to Belgrade and other countries in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Navy's long Cold War experience of having carrier
battle groups tailed by Russian spy ships had taught U.S. sailors
and airmen how to protect their communications and operations from
eavesdropping by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the most powerful ally of its Slavic brethren in Serbia,
has opposed the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The allied military campaign continued apace on Wednesday, with
NATO reporting that the city of Orahovac, in southwestern Kosovo,
was being emptied of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Still unaccounted for as of Wednesday were thousands of ethnic
Albanians reportedly forced by Serbs to march into concentrated
areas near the provincial capital of Pristina and several
surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Serbs were following up forced expulsions by
wiping out public records of the lives of ethnic Albanians driven
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Property deeds, marriage licenses, birth certificates,
financial and other records, public records, are being
systematically destroyed,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told
reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``This is a kind of
Orwellian scenario of attempting to deprive a people and a culture
of the sense of past and the sense of community on which it
depends.''

PARAGUAY GLIDES FROM DESPERATION TO EUPHORIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ ``Goodbye 20th century, goodbye
assassins,'' reads a fresh scrawl of graffiti a block from the
plaza where snipers killed five protesters who were demanding the
overthrow of the president of Paraguay less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment sums up a sudden change of mood here from
desperation to euphoria after the most rapid and complete overhaul
of government and politics in this country since the 35-year-old
dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was overthrown in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Raul Cubas Grau was forced to resign on Sunday
and he and his military mentor fled into exile, the first civilian
coalition government in a long history of one-party rule and
military dictatorship has emerged from a week of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the new ``national unity'' government are promising
nothing less than a complete overhaul, including privatizing
several inefficient government agencies and attacking the dominant
Colorado Party's well-oiled apparatus, which is said to seek
payoffs from smugglers and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must seize this great opportunity to change the destiny of
this country,'' Luis Gonzalez Macchi said in his first news session
as president.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi, 52, the former senate president and a former
professional basketball player, succeeded Cubas because he was next
in the succession line after the assassination of Vice President
Luis Maria Argana last week.
</P>
<P>
   The new president has had an undistinguished career as a
legislator and has never shown any desire to overhaul the Colorado
Party, of which he is a member, experts and Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   But he emerged as a skilled conciliator from negotiations with
two opposition parties that first led to Cubas' removal and then
put together a new cabinet, including two members each of the
Liberal and National Encounter Parties. The three parties also
agreed to back a liberal as the vice-presidential candidate of the
coalition in an election to be held in six months.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in 52 years that anyone not a member of
the Colorado Party _ which has controlled the government and
military by doling out ``pork'' and favors _ has held a cabinet
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened from 1989 until Sunday was simply a
continuation of the prior 35 years of Stroessner,'' said Mario Paz
Castaing, a National Encounter leader and second vice president of
the senate. ``But no longer will we have a Colorado government.
From now on, this will be a national government.''
</P>
<P>
   Paz Castaing said Colorado leaders had been forced to agree to
privatizing the government water, electricity and telephone
companies, moves that would reduce the leaders' power by ceding
150,000 government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gonzalez Macchi also chose two veterans of the
Stroessner administration as ministers of health and public works,
in a sign that he is not able or willing to break entirely from the
traditional apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've opened a door of hopes,'' Carlos Martini, a political
scientist at the Catholic University, said. ``But we still have all
the doubts that go with a weak economy and a political class that
has no experience at governing in coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Martini warned that weakness in cotton and beef prices, as well
as the recession in neighboring Brazil, threatens to produce a
long-term slump that could weakened the new government's
popularity. Widespread disenchantment could help pave the way for a
comeback for retired Gen. Lino Oviedo, the populist former army
commander who fled to Argentina on Sunday to escape charges that he
had ordered the assassination of Argana &UR;  &LR; and was granted political
asylum. (Interior Minister Carlos Corach of Argentina said his
government would consider revoking Oviedo's asylum if Paraguay
formally requested his extradition, the BBC reported.)
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo won the primary for the Colorado presidential nomination
last year. But he was forced to give up his candidacy when he was
sentenced to jail for trying to overthrow a previous government, in
1996. For three years, Paraguay has careened from one crisis to
another over jailing Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
   A total collapse was averted when the ambassadors of Brazil, the
United States and the Vatican brought together Cubas and other
political leaders to work out an agreement that would lead to the
president's resignation and the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial role was also played by the leaders of the army and
air force, who made it clear to Cubas that they would not support
him and Oviedo, his mentor, over the will of congress and thousands
of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials said they hoped that Oviedo's departure
would give the new government a chance to maneuver and mend
troubled relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has repeatedly complained that
Paraguay has made an insufficient effort at disassembling a vast
underground economy that encompasses a wide range of goods like
smuggling pirated CDs, videos and electronic goods; money
laundering, and trafficking Bolivian cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Colorado officials and army officers
routinely took protection money from smugglers and drug
traffickers, as well as Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists, who retain
networks along the Argentine and Brazilian borders.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nation that the Supreme Court believes has achieved
color-blindness, the murder indictments issued Wednesday against
four white police officers in New York tell a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   Race bias has been treated as a theoretical issue by the
justices, but it is a daily, street-level torment for millions of
Americans. At its worst, it is perpetrated not only by neighbors
but by government agents, especially those trained and armed to
protect the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   The bare facts of the New York case are well known. On Feb. 4,
four plainclothes officers in search of a rapist encountered Amadou
Diallo, 22, in front of his Bronx home. Sensing, they said later,
that Diallo might be reaching for a weapon, the cops blew him away.
Forty-one shots were fired; 19 hit their target. Diallo, a West
African immigrant, had no gun.
</P>
<P>
   Gross police overreaction is certainly involved here, and some
may see no need to stress the racial element. Such a killing would
warrant a murder indictment even if no prejudice were involved.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine that this slaughter would have taken
place if Diallo had been white or the police had been of different
races. And it is impossible to imagine that the response of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir would have
been so callous and slow. Belatedly, Safir is talking about
assigning more minority officers to the Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of continuing race bias in America are evident in
stacks of statistics relating to education, income, health, and
nearly every aspect of life.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic and worrisome examples are those in which
racist actions are carried out by law enforcement personnel _ the
very people designated to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case is extreme, but it is not alone. Anyone who
thinks it is is truly blind.

NELSON IS GIVING MAVS FANS A GAGGING FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, we know how Latrell Sprewell felt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we know why Sprewell wanted to take his coach by the throat
and strangle him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes _ and today's one of those times _ don't you just want
to grab Don Nelson by his big old thick neck and shake him a bit?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing serious, you understand. Just throttle the Mavs'
coach/general manager until his face turns blue and his tongue
sticks out. Nothing a little heavy-duty CPR can't reverse, but
enough to get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   I'd do it, too, I swear, except that Nellie's 6-6 and built like
a bull elk. I wouldn't get physical with him if you paid me Kevin
Brown money.
</P>
<P>
   We love you, Big Don baby, but it's getting harder and harder to
believe that you know what the hell you're doing any more.
</P>
<P>
   Our patience has grown as thin as your sorry, depleted bench.
</P>
<P>
   Now, comes word that Nellie has decided that, by golly, it's
time to bag the season and play for that lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   What lottery pick, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   You mean the one Nelson failed to get protection for when he
traded the Mavs' 1999 No. 1 choice for point guard Steve Nash?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that lottery pick, the one that belongs to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   You do remember Nash, of course. Most of you showered him with
boos a couple of home games ago. Should have saved that for the GM
who told us the Suns' No. 3 point guard was exactly what the Mavs
needed, then signed him to a six-year, $33 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Nelson made that deal and said if the Mavs didn't
make the playoffs this year, ``it's a terrible trade?''
</P>
<P>
   So, whom do we hold accountable? Don't ask Ross Jr. He ain't
talkin'. He knows the first critical word he says about Nelson, Big
Don's back in his swim trunks, basking on the beach in Maui,
sipping mai tais and counting his millions.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea, at that.
</P>
<P>
   But the resume, you say. Oh yes, we know it by heart. It's why
so many of us applauded when Junior hired Nelson in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Nellie and Pat Riley are the only three-time
winners as NBA coach of the year; that Big Don was named one of the
top 10 coaches in NBA history by a panel of former coaches, players
and media; that when he was coach/GM at Golden State in the late
'80s and early '90s, he turned that franchise from a 20-62 loser
into a 55-27 club in four years.
</P>
<P>
   We know he has drafted or developed such eventual NBA stars as
Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Mitch Richmond, Tim Hardaway,
Tyrone Hill, Chris Gatling and Chris Webber, and that he once had a
knack for finding nuggets, like Sprewell, late in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 10 years ago. Let's check the facts now.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over the Mavs, he has coached 98 games. His record
is a dismal 26-72. The coach he fired, Jim Cleamons, also coached
98 games. He was 28-70, two games better than Nelson over the same
span.
</P>
<P>
   This, after Nelson turned this team over not once, but twice to
get ``his players'' in place.
</P>
<P>
   The only move he has made this year that has turned out even
half decent was signing Gary Trent. And that was more accident than
design, because it would never have happened if Kurt Thomas hadn't
suddenly bailed out to take the Knicks' offer.
</P>
<P>
   By signing Trent, Nelson was telling Cedric Ceballos ``we don't
need you.'' Then Ceballos came crawling back, got hurt and now he's
Nelson's No. 1 alibi for why another season has gone into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the season was doomed even before the lockout and
before the 10-22 start, when Nelson made the deals for Dirk
Nowitzki and Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the weary and overmatched Mavs players have gotten a peek
at the finish line and they've quit on Nelson, who had promised
that this team would be competitive and fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Play the kids? Sure. Should have been doing that from the start.
Why A.C. Green or Hot Rod Williams ever got any minutes is the
question.
</P>
<P>
   We should have already been seeing Chris Anstey, ``best running
big man in the NBA,'' according to Nelson. We should have been
seeing Samaki Walker instead of Williams and certainly Nowitzki,
even if it means sitting Michael Finley. We know what Finley can
do.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Nelson must develop the young players he has because
they're all he has. What you see now is what you're going to get
next year, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes all this so hard to take and why fans are
gagging at what they see. It's not just that the Mavs are bad
again. Lord knows, we've endured that. It's that the future has
already been mortgaged, too.
</P>
<P>
   That tightening you feel around your throat? That's the hope
being choked out of you one more time.

   KUKES, Albania _ Serbian forces are now shelling villages, towns
and cities across a wide swath of Kosovo, refugees arriving here
said &UR;  &LR; Wednesday. The shelling drove more than 10,000 ethnic
Albanians from their homes, according to figures from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardment from tanks and mortars began in some areas around 9
p.m. Tuesday and continued Wednesday, refugees said. Villages and
towns were reported in flames in an arc surrounding the cities of
Prizren and Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said they were from Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
the first large group to arrive here from the city. They reported
that the city was in flames, with widespread death and destruction.
</P>

   ((It is impossible to confirm refugees' accounts, but Air
Commodore David Wilby, a NATO spokesman, said said in Brussels that
a ``large number'' of refugees and some separatist rebel troops
were trapped in the Pagarusa valley, about 30 miles southwest of
Pristina, where three brigades of Yugoslav and Serb forces were
``raining artillery fire'' on them.))
</P>
<P>
   There was a stark difference in the appearance of the refugees
who arrived in Kukes on Wednesday from those who crossed the border
on Tuesday, having heeded Serbs' orders to leave or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the refugees seemed stunned, their faces frozen. On
Wednesday their faces were contorted, many openly weeping or on the
verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were driving down the street, all the shops and houses
were burning on both sides around us,'' said an elderly man aboard
one of three city buses packed with frightened people that arrived
Wednesday afternoon from Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombardment has been going on since yesterday,'' said
Gjergj Mertur, 33, from the door of the first bus from Djakovica.
``There are hundreds of dead people. The police and the
paramilitaries are burning the houses.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man driving a tractor pulling a cart full of
refugees, said that in Prizren ``they attacked at 9 o'clock in the
evening _ boom, boom _ they fired with many types of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel of the next tractor, Zenel Kadashi said: ``All the
villages surrounding Prizren are burned down. On this tractor are
people from 10 different villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Prizren and Djakovica said that in both cities,
Serbian forces had moved from military-style encampments and taken
shelter in factory buildings to avoid becoming targets of the NATO
air strikes. There have been similar reports from other areas of
the Serbs dispersing their men and equipment for cover in civilian
areas.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 o'clock Wednesday evening, 10,000 people had passed the
border crossing at Morini, according to figures compiled by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, joining 84,600
since the crossing was opened on Saturday after being sealed for 11
months. About another 3,000 have managed to get over the border in
the rugged mountains northwest of here and are being assembled in
Kruma, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as rain began to fall, Albanian officials instituted a
new and cumbersome system of registering all refugees, who have
been routinely and methodically stripped of passports and all other
identity documents by Serbs at the border. Albanian officials
processed only 200 people in the space of an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A long line of refugees, many of them on foot, was left
stretching back across the border into Serbian territory. Some
refugees estimated the length of the line at almost 10 miles.
Serbian officials asked the Albanians to please hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day it was the Serbs who delayed the flow. It
has become the custom of the Serbian border guards, after a morning
of robbing refugees and unbolting their license plates, to close
the border at midday while they enjoy a long lunch, coming back to
work at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Wednesday's refugees had been walking for three days
without food or water, they said. In some rural areas, people in
outlying hamlets went to a more central, larger village thinking
they would be safer there. One such gathering point was Rugova,
which took in people from a half dozen smaller places.
</P>
<P>
   But about 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the Serbs began shelling Rugova,
refugees from there said. They crossed the border during the night
and spent the dawn in an open field on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugova doesn't exist anymore,'' said Hasan Hyesenan, 45, who
had been a history teacher in the school there.
</P>
<P>
   Hazar Shala, 53, added: ``They started a heavy bombardment at 3
o'clock. I was one of the last to leave. They fired with tanks and
afterward they burned the village.''
</P>
<P>
   Several villagers said they had hoped to be able to remain in
their homes, perhaps because they were too isolated, and perhaps
because they had not been visited by Serbian forces giving the
orders to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have an ultimatum, but hearing the shelling we left
on our own,'' said Rakip Kryezim, 30. ``At the border they took our
money, cars and identity cards. They also took 15 of the best cars,
Golf, Renault, Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man put in: ``The situation is very bad. We have nothing
with which to live.''

BRAZILIAN CENTRAL BANK PLANS A CURRENCY INSIDER INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The nation's central bank said Wednesday
that it is conducting an investigation into accusations that
several domestic and foreign financial institutions used inside
information in January about an impending shift in exchange-rate
policy to profit from the devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The assertions _ first made public in February by Aloizio
Mercadante, a member of Congress from the opposition Workers Party
_ include charges that nine banks used access to government
officials in the days leading up to the Jan. 13 policy shift to
make trading decisions resulting in a combined profit of roughly $1
billion. The list of banks includes Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks in recent weeks have reported preliminary results to
the central bank showing they made substantial profits after the
devaluation of the currency, the real, largely through a
combination of successful bets in futures markets and purchases of
dollar-linked government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous size of these profits comes as the economy is
struggling with recession, and has resulted in calls by several
members of Congress to look into the legality of such financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sen. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the
Senate and a man widely considered Brazil's most powerful
legislator, said he would support a congressional inquiry into the
accusations that some banks used inside information to profit from
the devaluation. That move is separate from the central bank's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Georges Lamaziere, a spokesman for President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, said on Tuesday that the government sees no problem with
the congressional inquiry going forward. The central bank's
investigation should be finished by next week and the results will
be announced then, a spokeswoman said in Brasilia, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the banks have said they broke no laws by accumulating
profits in the aftermath of the devaluation, which pushed the real
down by 40 percent against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There had been widespread expectations for months that Brazil
might have to abandon its artificial support for the currency and
let market forces of supply and demand determine its value.
Currency traders at banks and other financial institutions who had
bet on that possibility, based on publicly available information,
did nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a devaluation, you tend to make money,'' said
Richard Howe, a spokesman for Citigroup in New York. JP Morgan and
BankBoston also denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the devaluation, the central bank was led by an
interim president, Francisco Lopes, who has since resigned. It is
now headed by Arminio Fraga, a former fund manager, who ordered the
insider-trading investigation last week.
</P>
<P>
   He has also ordered an inquiry into accusations that the central
bank may have acted illegally in helping two small Rio de Janeiro
investment banks, Banco Marka and Banco Fonte Cindam, after the
devaluation. The banks lost millions of dollars after betting
against the likelihood of a devaluation. Marka has since been taken
over by the central bank, while Fonte Cindam has been sold to
Banque Nationale de Paris.

ECONOMIC SCENE: NO COMFORT IN NEW SOLVENCY FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The administration boisterously pointed this week to new actuary
studies showing that Medicare and Social Security will remain
solvent for a few more years than previously estimated. Social
Security would not go bankrupt until 2034, rather than 2032, and
the Medicare trust fund would last until 2015 rather than 2008.
</P>
<P>
   But the revised estimates should bring little comfort to anyone
who looks seriously at the numbers. Solvency is an accounting
measure that can be achieved merely by shifting costs from the
trust funds to general taxpayers. The fundamental problem posed by
government retiree programs has not gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Longer life expectancies, rising medical costs and falling birth
rates combine to drive up the working Americans' burden of
supporting the elderly. Add up the cost of Social Security,
Medicare and the part of Medicaid that pays for nursing homes for
the elderly. These three retiree programs alone will account for
more than a third of federal spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, retirement benefits will account for more than
two-thirds of the budget. That means the fraction of the federal
spending devoted to other parts of government, from law enforcement
to housing subsidies, will shrivel unless Congress substantially
cuts the growth rate of retiree benefits or raises taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute points out that the
baby-boom generation can look forward to generous retiree benefits
even as birth rates fall, leaving fewer workers to support a
growing number of the elderly. By locking in layers of retiree
benefits for rich and poor alike, Steuerle observes, the baby
boomers are leaving themselves a government ``almost the sole
purpose of which will be to care for their consumption needs in
retirement, a government by, of and only for the baby boomers.''
</P>
<P>
   The footprints of Steuerle's stern warning lie all over the
White House and congressional budgets. Sam Elkin of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities tracks domestic discretionary
spending, which encompasses nearly all the programs except military
and entitlement programs like Social Security and welfare. Elkin
points out that under the recently passed Republican budget, such
spending will fall by 18 percent by 2002 and almost 30 percent by
2009, after taking account of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That would take domestic discretionary spending from almost 3.5
percent of the national economic output today _ which is as low as
this figure has been since the early 1960s _ to about 2 percent by
2009. As Medicare and Social Security costs rise thereafter, this
figure would fall further still. By comparison, domestic
discretionary programs accounted for more than 5 percent of the
economy in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed evisceration of discretionary spending comes as no
surprise from the party that has all but declared war on big
government, but the fact is that President Clinton's budget would
not restore the proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In his winning presidential campaign in 1992, Clinton pledged to
raise government spending by $50 billion a year on public programs,
for example high-speed trains and improved training for the work
force. His current plan would use about 10 percent of the expected
surpluses over the next 15 years to preserve some discretionary
spending. That would avoid more than half of the Republicans'
proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But the added money would not come close to honoring his 1992
pledge, even though the current and projected economies are flush
compared with the economy that Clinton inherited from President
Bush. Indeed, Elkin said that after taking account of inflation,
Clinton's latest budget would probably cut domestic discretionary
spending by 7 percent by 2002 and 13 percent by 2009. There goes
part of the president's investment bridge to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   To do more, Clinton would have had to propose trimming retiree
benefits, perhaps by proposing to raise the eligibility age for
Medicare. Or Clinton would have had to propose cutting Social
Security and Medicare benefits for upper-income families, measures
neither he nor the Republicans would touch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposed to use most of the expected surpluses to
give Medicare and Social Security first call on general tax
revenues in the future when the trust funds run dry. Therein lies
the fate of future discretionary programs.
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences between the Clinton and
Republican plans. His plan buys back far more of the government's
$3.7 trillion debt from the public, a sound economic step that
would pump trillions of dollars into private capital markets for
use by companies to invest in plants and equipment. The Republicans
would return about $800 billion of the future surplus to taxpayers
in the form of a tax cut over 10 years. They would not use the
surplus to bolster domestic discretionary spending, unlike the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities overwhelm the differences. Both budgets
call for a future wherein the government takes in tax dollars from
a diminishing number of workers in order to support the consumption
of an increasing number of elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Few take seriously the prospect that Congress, even if it stays
in Republican hands, will gut discretionary spending anytime soon.
It would seem ludicrous to believe a Congress that needed decades
to summon the political courage to strip wartime subsidies from the
producers of mohair would immediately whack nearly a third out of
the budget for border patrols, medical research and highway
construction.
</P>
<P>
   But budget logic will eventually have to overcome cowardice.
Over time, Congress will have only grim choices: Trim retiree
benefits, eviscerate discretionary spending or raise taxes. ``Never
before,'' says Steuerle of entitlement spending for the elderly,
``have so many commitments and so much growth been scheduled in our
laws _ literally for an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists make the point that in about 30 years a third of
the adult population will be retired and that these people will
spend about a third of their lives in retirement. Congress can
promote private savings in a number of ways. It can generate
federal surpluses far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   But, Steuerle points out, there is no way that Congress can spur
savings enough ``to support close to one-third of the entire adult
population on Social Security for one-third of their adult lives,''
adding, ``Doesn't the blessing of longer life involve some
obligation to share in its cost?''

GQ NAMES A PUBLISHER, SIGNALING POWER SHIFT AT CONDE NAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a transition that re-establishes him as one of the
company's central players, Thomas A. Florio, the publisher of Conde
Nast Traveler and the former publisher of The New Yorker, was named
publisher of Conde Nast men's title GQ on Wednesday. He replaces
Jack Laschever, 38, who is resigning for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Steven T. Florio, the president and chief executive officer of
Conde Nast Publications and Florio's older brother, made the
announcement from his home on Long Island, where he is recuperating
from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is going to a magazine that is really central to the
success of the company,'' the elder Florio said. ``It's a very
profitable title for the company, and it's a very meaningful move
for Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Cooper, the editor in chief of GQ _ which generated more
than $88 million in advertising revenue for Conde Nast last year _
said that it would be the first time that he and Florio, both
15-year veterans of Conde Nast, would work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy, and I like tough guys,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Florio, 42, was moved out of his position as publisher of
The New Yorker by his older brother last May; his forced departure
from The New Yorker for Conde Nast Traveler was seen as a clear
sign of the competitive spirit between the two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   And during the last 10 months while Tom Florio was publisher of
Conde Nast Traveler, he did not report to his brother, reporting
instead to Cathy Viscardi Johnson, the executive vice president of
sales and marketing at Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that for personal reasons more than anything,'' the
elder Florio said. ``Like all brothers, we have our moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the younger Florio making something of a comeback as
the publisher of a strong Conde Nast title, but the appointment has
set off a chain of movement within Conde Nast, which is a unit of
Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of House &AMP; Garden, Lisa Henriques Hughes, resigned
her position to become the publisher of Conde Nast Traveler, a
magazine she supervised as publisher from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hughes was publisher of House &AMP; Garden, she raised the
magazine's rate base _ the circulation guaranteed to advertisers _
by 18.2 percent, to 650,000, in February of this year. The current
circulation, as of December 1998, is 722,195, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   The associate publisher of The New Yorker, Brenda Saget _ who
has worked in publishing roles at Elle Decor and Architectural
Digest _ has been named publisher of House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Laschever was not available for comment. A veteran of American
Express Publishing, he was named publisher of GQ in July of last
year, and published GQ's largest issue in a decade, with 317 ad
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Nast announcements came on the same day that Maxim
magazine, a powerful competitor in the men's magazine marketplace
that is published by Dennis Publishing Ltd., named its new editor,
Mike Soutar, the editor of the English men's magazine FHM.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the men's marketplace is fierce; GQ's circulation
is 708,743, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, while
Maxim's has surpassed that with 733,744 and is guaranteeing a rate
base of 950,000 for the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim's previous editor, Mark Golin, left the magazine last
Friday. He has been named editor in chief of Conde Nast men's title
Details.

BOEING NEEDS SUCCESSFUL SEA LAUNCH MONDAY TO WIN NEW CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fresh off the successful firing last week of its first
Sea Launch rocket from a platform in the Pacific Ocean, The Boeing
Co. is hoping for similar results Monday night when it attempts for
the second time to launch its new Delta 3 rocket from Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   The first Delta 3 exploded in a spectacular nighttime fireball
over the Atlantic on its maiden flight in August, and the
Seattle-based aerospace giant can ill afford another catastrophic
failure this time, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Though no customers have canceled their orders for Delta 3,
Boeing has not booked any new orders since the highly publicized
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that we need to demonstrate success for more
satellites to get on the vehicle,'' said Jay Witzling, vice
president of the Delta 2 and Delta 3 programs for Boeing's
Expendable Launch Systems in Huntington Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing engineers say the problem that caused the first Delta 3
to veer out of control has been corrected by a software fix. To
further improve the rocket's reliability, modifications were made
to Delta 3 hardware not involved in the failure, said Dan Collins,
Boeing's Delta 3 program manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought in some very tough outside consultants, who have
looked at everything we have done,'' Collins said. ``They are as
convinced as I am that we have done everything we can do and that
this rocket is ready to go fly, and fly successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Delta 3 on its first flight resulted in the loss
of a multimillion-dollar Galaxy X communications satellite built by
Hughes Space and Communications in Los Angeles for PanAmSat Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Delta 3 will carry a 4.5-ton Orion 3 satellite built
by Hughes for Loral Orion in Rockville, Md. Once in a
geosynchronous orbit about 22,300 miles in space, the satellite
will provide broadcast and communications services to the
Asia-Pacific region, including Korea, China, Japan, Australia,
India, Southeast Asia and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Orion 3 will be Loral's first satellite to serve the
Asia-Pacific region, Loral spokeswoman Jeanette Clonan said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not say how much the satellite cost. It typically
costs about $250 million to build, insure and launch a
communications satellite the size of Orion 3.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it would charge customers about $85 million to
launch their satellites on Delta III, though some industry analysts
believe the actual figure is closer to $55 million for competitive
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong launch window for the Orion 3 mission opens at 6:14
p.m. Monday, Seattle time. The launch can be watched live on the
Internet at www.Boeing.com.
</P>
<P>
   Delta 3's future may well ride on the success of the Orion 3
mission, said Marco Caceres, a rocket and space analyst with the
Teal Group, a marketing analysis firm in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing can't afford to have a completely disastrous launch
failure a second time,'' he said. ``If there is a slight
malfunction, that might not be so bad for the program _ just as as
long as it doesn't blow up and you have TV footage of pieces of the
rocket and satellite raining down over the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 128-foot Delta 3 is the first large launch vehicle ever
built entirely with corporate rather than government money. Boeing
has not said how much the three-year Delta 3 development project
cost, but it was at least $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Hughes agreed to pay McDonnell Douglas in 1995
to launch a block of 10 satellites, with options to launch 10 more
_ the first of which was the Galaxy 10. Boeing inherited the Delta
program when it acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Communication satellites are getting bigger and heavier, and it
takes more powerful rockets to launch them. Delta 3 was designed to
launch payloads twice as heavy as the very successful Delta 2.
</P>
<P>
   Using the $1.5 billion commitment from Hughes, Boeing raised
other private capital to build its more powerful rocket. So far,
Hughes has signed nine customers for Delta 3, including the
upcoming Orion 3 mission and the failed Galaxy launch last year,
Hughes spokeswoman Fran Slimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is not worried about the rocket, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We followed the failure review very closely and have
participated in some of the engineering reviews,'' she said.
``Boeing has been very cooperative, and we are satisfied they have
determined the cause of the failure and taken steps to ensure a
successful launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing put together an accident investigation team that included
representatives from NASA, the Air Force and the Aerospace Corp., a
federally funded research and development center that provides
technical oversight of U.S. military space programs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined that the Delta 3 control system was not
programmed to anticipate a roll motion of the booster that
gradually increased after liftoff. The control system consists of
the rocket's main engine, two vernier engines and three
solid-rocket engines that have thrust-vectoring nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   Those three solid-rocket engines tried so hard to steer the
wavering vehicle during its final seconds of flight that they ran
out of hydraulic fluid. The rocket then pitched over more than 30
degrees about 70 seconds into flight and was ripped apart by
aerodynamic forces and its self-destruct system.
</P>
<P>
   The real improvement in horsepower that allows Delta 3 to hurl
much heavier satellites into orbit comes not from the nine bigger
strap-on rockets on the first stage, but from the development of a
cryogenic upper stage _ another first for the Delta program.
</P>
<P>
   The engine _ whose fuel is stored at super-low temperatures to
increase the amount of fuel that can be carried _ is built by Pratt
&AMP; Whitney and is used on Lockheed Martin's heavy-lift Titan and
Atlas rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Delta 2 will likely be around for many years to come
because of the need to launch smaller satellites into low Earth
orbits, Delta 3 probably has a fairly short life. That's because
Boeing is already developing an even more powerful rocket, called
the Delta 4, under an Air Force contract.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of Delta 4 is scheduled for 2001. Delta 3 and
Delta 4 will have several overlapping systems, including the new
cryogenic upper stage on Delta 3. ``Clearly, Delta 3 is very
critical to that evolution'' from Delta 2 to Delta 4, Boeing's
Witzling said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins called Delta 3 the ``key to both the present and the
future'' as Boeing pushes toward its goal of becoming the world's
leading provider of launch vehicle services.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was echoed by Caceres, the industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta 3 may make some money for Boeing,'' he said, ``but it
will not make them rich. What's going to make Boeing rich is Delta
4. That is really going to be the rocket that will take Boeing into
the next generation of launch vehicles for heavy satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing needs Delta 3 to work before it can take that next
step.
</P>
<P>
   If its new rocket does work the second time around, Boeing plans
for two more Delta 3 launches this year and six or seven next year.

KILBORN: AN   ECHO OF `DAILY SHOW' ON `LATE LATE'

<P>
   The names are impossible to keep straight (``Late Night,''
``Late Show,'' ``Late Late Show''), which is why real people think
of the shows as ``Conan,'' ``Dave'' and ``Craig Kilborn, that guy
from Comedy Central.'' His version of ``Late Late Show'' began
Tuesday night, following David Letterman and going head-to-head
with Conan O'Brien. More important, Kilborn replaces Tom Snyder in
that slot and instantly zaps CBS into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Kilborn got to take along his ``intellectual
property,'' as comedy routines have come to be known in the
late-night wars. Though the first show was extremely smooth and
amiable, the host seemed to breathe most easily when settling into
routines familiar from his time as host of Comedy Central's
sardonic news parody, ``The Daily Show.'' On Tuesday he played the
popular ``Five Questions'' with his first guest, Bill Murray,
asking bogus questions like, ``How do you make a perfect Rob Roy?''
Murray walked to a concealed liquor cabinet, mixed a stiff drink
and lovingly whispered the word ``vermouth'' over the glass as only
he could.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had also been the first guest on the Letterman show, and
his droll approach makes him the perfect match for both.
(Letterman's production company is behind the new show, as it was
Snyder's.) Letterman, of course, pioneered and mastered the ironic
approach to talk shows that made the Kilborn and O'Brien shows
possible. On Tuesday, Letterman had the best running joke of the
three, with his straight-faced claim that his is ``the only late
night talk show ever to receive a standing ovation at Sundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn's show is not reconfiguring that late-night model. He
begins with a monologue and even has the standard set, with fake
windows and a skyline behind him. Though there is no sidekick or
band (there will be musical guests), even these tweaks in the
format make the new show more like his old ``Daily Show'' (which is
doing well with Jon Stewart, a more cerebral wit, as host).
</P>
<P>
   Smaller differences can be telling, too. There is sports
equipment piled in a corner, the green-topped desk resembles a pool
table and the big leather guest chair screams ``retro macho.'' The
set might as well have ``looking for young male viewers'' written
all over it. Kilborn joked about that demographic hope by referring
to an audience member as a ``nice guy, about 18 to 34.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in that category, your fear might have been that
the Jekyll-Hyde Kilborn might have been at his smarmiest. He plays
the unthinking sexist so well that it's easy to believe he is,
beneath the layers of winking irony, a throwback to the swinging
Playboy era. But on Tuesday he wore his good-Craig face, and irony
won out. He changed into a blue silk smoking jacket to interview
the model Heidi Klum, making fun of his image even while indulging
it. That sardonic approach is his most enticing quality.
</P>
<P>
   What matters ultimately, of course, is how a late-night show
plays over time. Each cultivates a rhythm that is easy to feel and
hard to duplicate. The Conan O'Brien show is sailing along now,
with an impeccable balance of comedy and guests. The Kilborn show
can't match that, but it has done the best it could have hoped for:
If you're flipping around channels, it's already a place to stop.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Conor McPherson was 10 and growing up in Dublin,
he would gather his friends in his family's garage and entertain
them with ghost stories of his own invention.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, he is still telling stories, but the
stage and the audience are considerably larger. Along with Martin
McDonagh, Sebastian Barry and Billy Roche, he is a leader _ and, at
27, the youngest _ of a wave of Irish playwrights who are bringing
new vitality to the contemporary theater.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson's play ``The Weir,'' which opens Thursday night at the
Walter Kerr Theater, has already been a hit in Dublin and London
(where it won an Olivier award as best new play). An earlier work,
``This Lime Tree Bower,'' will open in May at Primary Stages, which
presented his ``St. Nicholas'' with Brian Cox last year.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Weir,'' old friends exchange ghost stories in a rural
Irish pub, trying to impress a young woman who has moved to the
village from Dublin. In response, she offers a far more personal
remembrance that has a disturbing effect on her listeners.
</P>
<P>
   As the playwright indicated during a recent visit to New York,
``The Weir'' is about some people who are reminded of their
situation in life, of who they are, and they either face up to it
or they don't.'' In common with his other plays, it is about ``the
act of telling somebody something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to a dam: ``On one side it is quite calm, and
on the other side water is being squeezed through. Metaphorically
the play is about a breakthrough. Lots under the surface is coming
out. It's resonant of two worlds, the supernatural and our ordinary
world past and present. I thought it was a great title, but 90
percent of the people I've met just don't know what a weir is.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I saw a production of the play in Paris, called `La
Fille de Dublin,' `The Girl From Dublin.''' He laughed at that
title and then merrily sang it to the tune of the ``Girl From
Ipanema.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson was moved to write the play by memories of his visits
as a teen-ager to his grandfather, who lived alone in Leitrim, a
desolate area in the west of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very quiet and dark there,'' he said. ``It was like a
culture shock. I suppose the whole environment was always somewhere
in me. I couldn't forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' conjures up a feeling of that solitude and
intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to McDonagh's power struggles (``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane'') and Barry's visceral explorations of recent Irish
history (``The Steward of Christendom''), McPherson's plays are
quiet and conversational, overheard stories that disarm audiences
and linger dreamlike in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright himself is disarming. With his closely cropped
hair and wire-rim glasses, he looks like a graduate student. When
he speaks it is with a combination of modesty (about his success)
and self-assurance (about his artistic intention).
</P>
<P>
   Among the new Irish playwrights, there seems to be a
collegiality despite their vastly different approaches. McPherson
regards Roche, whose ``Wexford Trilogy'' has not been done in New
York, as ``one of the greatest playwrights,'' someone who is ``not
ashamed to write about people who fall in love and have their
hearts broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said about ``The Weir'': ``I'm sure the play will capture
the imagination in New York as it has done on the other side of the
water. From my point of view, he's the only Irish playwright I've
seen, including McDonagh, who has a gift for structure.''
</P>
<P>
   To audiences, the structure may not be immediately apparent. In
McPherson plays, people stand around talking, and except in ``The
Weir,'' they do not address one another.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic events occur offstage and are recalled in the
present. The stories are about people not always in control of
their lives and sometimes swept into acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Barry's remark about his work, McPherson said that
instead of structure, he might credit himself with ``an instinct
for pace,'' for the ebb and flow of dialogue, or, in this case, of
successive monologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find monologues liberating,'' he said. ``I think the freedom
they afford is great, just the simplicity of it and the images that
people are creating themselves. In three sentences you can convey a
whole day. I want to get to the nuts and bolts very quickly. Maybe
it's a cinematic way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' a three-character
collage of monologues, is being made into a film with 43 speaking
roles _ and no monologues. McPherson is the director as well as
writer, and his work on the movie in Ireland will keep him from
attending the opening of ``The Weir'' on Broadway. But his mother
will attend. As he said, ``We don't have the author, we have the
author's mum.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the Irish playwriting tradition, McPherson
expressed a particular affinity for Samuel Beckett: ``What we
perceive is very limited, and to watch us walking around like
peacocks expounding our theories is comic. That's why I think
Beckett was brilliant, showing people right at the edge looking
into absolute meaninglessness. How do you face the fact that you
might not know anything and you're completely lost?''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as with Winnie in Beckett's ``Happy Days,'' he said,
one goes right on through the rituals of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   As a playwright, he also feels a strong connection to American
writers. He said that reading the work of Arthur Miller and David
Mamet inspired him to write his first plays. He ``devoured''
``Death of a Salesman'' and then moved on to Mamet's ``Glengarry
Glen Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to write by copying the way Mamet wrote, that kind
of very fast dialogue,'' McPherson said. His first play, written
when he was studying philosophy at the University College Dublin,
was directly derivative, a one-act ``about businessmen in
shirt-sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was called ``Taking Stock,'' but, he joked, the title could
have been ``Glenagaire Glen Ross.'' McPherson also directed it.
</P>
<P>
   His early plays were ensemble pieces. Then suddenly he switched
to monologues. This was a breakthrough, a kind of artistic weir.
</P>
<P>
   With ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' which moved from Dublin to the
Bush Theater in London, McPherson broadened his canvas. In this
story of friendship and the limits of loyalty, three young men
reveal themselves in a series of high-spirited, overlapping
monologues. The next step, ``The Weir,'' demonstrated that he could
use his gift for monologue in a play with interaction.
</P>
<P>
   His works often contain an eerie element. Cemeteries and funeral
parlors figure prominently, which he attributes to a feeling of
``Catholic guilt.'' He returns to this in his next play, ``Dublin
Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   It is set in an undertaker's office on Christmas Eve and is
about ``someone who cannot understand that what's happening to him
is beyond his control.'' He continued, ``I think audiences can
identify with that. It's the need to project a coping persona when
you might feel you're going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his countrymen, he never deals with politics in
his plays. ``I don't want to make a fiction out of it,'' he said.
``For me it's too current, too real.'' He added: ``I think I write
about very ordinary things. It's enough to have a story about those
guys in the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bleakness of the setting in ``The Weir,''
theatergoers have apparently warmed to the environment. As
McPherson said, ``Many people have said to me that they'd love to
go to that bar. Does it exist? I say that I'm not sure, but I had
to make it up because I wanted to go there too.''

POLL FINDS WHITMAN IN LEAD FOR SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A survey of New Jersey voters showed Gov.
Christie Whitman leading by 16 percentage points over former Gov.
Jim Florio in a matchup for the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by
Frank Lautenberg next year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Whitman nor Florio have formally declared their
intentions in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who narrowly lost a race for re-election to Whitman in
1993, has formed an exploratory committee to consider seeking the
Democratic nomination. Whitman is expected to announce next week
whether she will enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Quinnipiac College poll, Whitman was favored by
51 percent and Florio by 35 percent in the poll that asked 984 New
Jersey residents their preference if the governor and former
governor were paired in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent said they believed Whitman has been a better
governor than Florio; 18 percent said they preferred Florio. The
poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said that other recent polls, conducted by Democratic
Party officials, suggest that he would beat Whitman. ``I don't
think that there is anybody in the state who does not believe, if
it comes to pass, that this will be a competitive race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman, said that ``walking
into a race that you have not even entered with a 50 percent base
is a very strong place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, a Democrat, is not seeking a fourth term.

STEVENS' WIFE GETS CREDIT FOR HONEST LADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Long before she became Mrs. Gary Stevens, Nikki
Stevens was an accomplished exercise rider, learning her craft
while growing up in Doncaster, England, and graduating from Equine
College.
</P>
<P>
   That training will come in handy Saturday, when Nikki will have
dual interests in the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby. In addition to
rooting for her husband, who will be aboard the Bob Baffert-trained
General Challenge, Nikki will keep an eye on the only filly in
Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady, the first filly to start the Santa Anita Derby
since Sharp Cap in 1997, is trained by Bobby Frankel. He credits
Nikki for whipping the horse into top racing form.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the one who got (Honest Lady) to the point where she
wanted to train,'' Frankel said of Nikki. ``I haven't been around
her too much, but she did a nice job with this filly and certainly
deserves credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikki, who said she started riding Honest Lady in a gentle
manner, says there was no secret, just a female touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated her like a woman,'' Nikki said with a laugh. ``We
all know what we're like.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nikki will follow her husband's exploits Saturday, she
admits she will sneak a peak from time to time to see how her
friend -- as she calls Honest Lady -- is doing in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the ability, but things all have to go right,'' Nikki
said of Honest Lady's chances. ``She's not invincible but she will
give you 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   This week has special meaning for the couple, especially for
Nikki.
</P>
<P>
   ``For exercise riders, this is what it's all about, to get one
that ends up being good,'' Nikki said. ``I went over to Hollywood
Park and saw her the other day and it would be brilliant if she
could win because we all know she's got the ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But obviously, my priorities are with my husband. I'm behind
him all the way and he supports me all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Mr. Stevens think of Honest Lady's chances?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he's a good judge,'' Nikki said. ``But if he felt
she was going to win, I'm sure he would have pushed to get on
her.''
</P>
<P>
   One might say Stevens pushed to marry Nikki. They dated for all
of two weeks before becoming engaged. They were married last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went out one night and that was it,'' remembers Nikki,
who says she was friends with Stevens for a long time prior to
their first date. The two spent countless mornings at the Arcadia
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got married two months later after our first date in Las
Vegas and then married again in April in front of our family and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stevens, having Nikki nearby days and nights relieves some
pressure for one of the nation's most accomplished jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes (life) easier for me,'' Gary said. ``She knows the
pressures that I'm under from her close connections with the sport
and is understanding of the travel that I do. To have somebody I
can talk to about it and having her understand all of that is
really helpful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the track, the two seem inseparable. Rarely during
morning workouts do you see one without the other. They spend a
great deal of time most mornings sharing a cup of coffee during
breaks near Clockers Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with Gary is great because we have so much in common,''
Nikki said. ``We'll sit in the bath late at night and go on talking
and talking about our thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through Equine College so I know my stuff. Most of
my (knowledge) is through the books and Gary's is like first-hand
experience. We swap our ideas and both of them seem quite
logical.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikki has worked the likes of Labeeb and Earl of Barking, but
says working Halo's Sunshine, who finished fourth in the 1996
Kentucky Derby, is the horse she's most fond of.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was an awesome horse,'' Nikki said. ``I thought,
God, I was on a horse that's been in the Derby. It was pretty
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Juddmonte Farms, Honest Lady has won two of three
starts and $85,480. She finished fifth, beaten by a length, in the
Feb. 28 San Rafael Stakes, won by Desert Hero.
</P>
<P>
   She is attempting to join Winning Colors (1988), Silver Spoon
(1959) and Ciencia (1939) as the only fillies to win the Santa
Anita Derby. Overall, fillies are 3-for-22 in the 61-year-history
of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who admits he will be rooting for Nikki as well, will
have these thoughts as he leaves the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's obviously got a big interest in Honest Lady,'' Gary
said. ``But should my horse not run well or something then I would
be rooting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud of her. She's a great horsewoman, and to see
somebody else have faith in what she does on a horse makes me real
proud.''

SAVING A SPACE FOR A RUDY SITE 
BEARS ON BROADWAY 
DRINKS FOR 70
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, there is a Rudyno.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not registered to Hillary Rodham Clinton. Nor has it
been assigned to Republicans hoping to head off a cyberspace attack
on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the undeclared Republican candidate for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the mayor's fund-raising committee opened the site
www.Hillaryno.com. When Dr. Amos Grunebaum, a gynecologist and
practiced Internet surfer, saw a story about it on television on
Monday evening, his first thought was whether anyone had claimed
www.Rudyno.com.
</P>
<P>
   He went to his computer and discovered that no one had. So he
registered www.Rudyno.com himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you attack, you need to cover your back,'' he said.
Referring to the mayor, he added, ``He asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunebaum, who maintains a site for women who are pregnant or
want to be (www.babydata.com) and is the co-author, with Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, of a just-published book, ``Dr. Ruth's Pregnancy Guide
for Couples,'' said that he set up the Rudyno.com site ``purely for
the fun of i.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any political agenda,'' he said, refusing to say
whether he would vote for Mrs. Clinton if she ran, or for Giuliani
if he ran.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that he did not mind paying the $70 registration fee
for the Rudyno.com site. ``For $70 I got more fun out of it than a
nice dinner,'' he said. For now, anyway, visitors to the site see a
message that says, in 11 languages, that the site is ``under
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed Audience
</P>
<P>
   Between numbers from musicals that the late Gower Champion
directed or choreographed, from ``Hello, Dolly'' to ``Bye Bye
Birdie,'' the singer Barbara Cook told a story about ``42nd
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Cook said the producer, David Merrick, canceled the
previews of ``42nd Street'' to prevent anyone _ curious critics or
eagle-eyed editors, for example _ from finding out what was going
on at the Winter Garden Theater before opening night in 1980. At
the time, it was said that Merrick spent about $400,000 on salaries
of the cast and crew during a month of ``rehearsals'' for a show
that had already run for five weeks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days of playing to an empty house, Miss Cook said,
someone in the cast brought in some stuffed animals and put them in
orchestra seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara?'' a voice interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Gurewitsch, a freelance writer, held up two stuffed
bears. They came from the clan of 50 or so that Gurewitsch and his
wife, Susan, own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara had told me the story'' before her opening on Tuesday
night at the Carlyle Hotel, he said. ``I said I was going to bring
some in case no one showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-Party Party
</P>
<P>
   T-minus 35 days, and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit for Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, an East Side
social services agency, is not until May 6. But the pre-party
parties have already begun. On Wednesday, Audrey Gruss _ the wife
of Martin Gruss, the financier _ had the 70 designers who will do
the dinner tables at the benefit over to her Park Avenue apartment
for drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gruss said it was the only time she had ever invited people
over who were not personal friends. And this was not exactly a safe
crowd: All those designers were casting practiced eyes on the
walls, the windows, the furniture, the floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Hampton did it nine years ago,'' Mrs. Gruss said,
referring to the designer who died last year, and Albert Hadley
told Mrs. Gruss not to change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call Duane and tell her how wonderful it is,''
Hadley said. (Duane Hampton is Hampton's widow.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the tables at the benefit, the designers will base them
on paintings from the International Fine Art Fair. The benefit will
serve as its preview party. One designer, Kitty Hawks, had a memory
lapse when asked which painting she had chosen. ``Oh, God, I can't
remember the name of the painter,'' she said. ``But I'd love to own
the picture.'' (It is by Arthur Carles Jr.)

SUBWAY SHOULD REMAIN CLOSED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's baseball quiz: What's more arrogant and detestable than
a Yankee fan talking about a World Series? Answer: Yankee and
</P>
<P>
   Met fans talking about a Subway World Series.
</P>
<P>
   This bilious chatter began in late February when spring training
began, and it is now being trumpeted in the New York tabs and some
national magazines. The latest edition of Sport Magazine has Derek
Jeter and Mike Piazza on the cover wearing burn-your-soul, whup-ass
stares.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your acid reflux.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't going to happen, of course. The Yankees will not
repeat last year's fantastic season because Roger Clemens and
interim manager Don Zimmer are carriers of the Red Sox curse, and
the Mets will implode because Piazza is a sullen millionaire and
manager Bobby Valentine a smarmy, disingenuous manager who could
only win a popularity contest if Tommy Lasorda were the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could make that better is the thought of the
Angels and Dodgers breaking New York hearts and riding the backs of
Kevin Brown and Mo Vaughn into a Freeway World Series. But only the
incurably optimistic would believe that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are better today than they were last September, but
that is no guarantee. Both still have more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Can Davey Johnson shake up a stagnant Dodger locker
room? (end bold) Absolutely. Lasorda was bombastic and Bill Russell
quiet. Either way, players tuned them out. No one tunes out
Johnson. He's considered a player's manager because he treats them
like men while demanding an honest day's effort.
</P>
<P>
   But in the feckless '90s, merely shaking up a locker room will
not automatically produce wins. In any 25-man locker room, there
will always be five players who are too sensitive or too rich to
give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   What happens the first time Gary Sheffield gets his feelings
hurt? Or the first time Johnson sits Todd Hundley because he can't
get the job done? Or the first time Johnson asks Ismael Valdes to
complete a game (two in 90 starts the last three seasons)?
</P>
<P>
   The Foxified Dodgers want to win now, and they are not reluctant
to make a move. But embracing that attitude is easier than making
it work.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Is Todd Hundley capable of replacing Mike Piazza?
(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, in the sense that he's weak defensively. And that
was before surgery on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers overlooked Piazza's defense because of his offense.
Plus, after throwing out an embarrassing 18 percent of all thieves
in 1996 (34 of 189), Piazza did improve his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is the son of a former catcher, Randy Hundley, which
makes his comparable stats all the more specious. Of all catchers
with 100 or more starts in 1997, Hundley ranked last in throwing
out runners. He was among the trailers in 1996 and 1995, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will trade that for some left-handed power. But over
a nine-year career, Hundley's two good seasons 41 home runs, 112
RBI in 1996; 39 and 86 in 1997 look like aberrations. His career
average is just .240, too, a mere 93 points lower than Piazza
(.333), and he has managed 400 plate appearances in a season in
just three of nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Is this team too new, too old and too rich? (end
bold) Yes, yes and yes. The Dodgers will start only two players who
were Dodgers in 1997. All of the major imports are in their 30s
Kevin Brown (34), Hundley (30 in May), Devon White (36), Alan Mills
(32), Mel Rojas (32) and Jeff Shaw (32).
</P>
<P>
   Rather than question whether Kevin Brown is overpaid, one should
wonder what inspired Kevin Malone to invest almost $50 million in
contracts for White, Shaw, Hundley, Mills and Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Is Mo Vaughn the answer to the Angels' problems each
September? (end bold) Only if he can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting has never been a problem for this franchise, not in 1961
when five different Angels hit 20-plus home runs, not when Jim
Fregosi and Alex Johnson were its stars, not when Don Baylor,
Reggie Jackson, Fred Lynn, Rod Carew and Bobby Grich wore halos,
and not now, pre and post-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels go into the season with one new pitcher, Tim Belcher,
who is 37 and has a career A.L. ERA of 4.62; an ace, Chuck Finley,
who is 36; and with two other starters who are longshots to match
their modest career-best seasons in 1998, Omar Olivares (9-9, 4.02)
and Steve Sparks (9-4, 4.34).
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Will Mo produce the way he has the last three seasons
(averages of .316, 40 home runs, 118 RBI)? (end bold) He's
certainly capable. But Edison Field may neutralize some of his
power.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hit 129 home runs last year, but only 48 of them came
at The Big E. The right-field alley is listed at 365 feet, but that
doesn't account for an 18-foot fence and wind which blows to left
when it blows at all. The Angels' 1998 home run index at Edison was
92, eight percent lower than the league average. In 1996-97, the
home run index was 127, or 27 percent higher than the average.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds averaged almost 16 home runs a season in Anaheim
from 1995 to 1997. Last year he hit nine. The flip side is that
Edison produces higher averages for left-handed hitters, and Vaughn
hits for average and is used to playing in a difficult home run
park (Fenway) for lefties.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Will the Angels miss Gary DiSarcina? (end bold) Does
a baby miss its mommy? The Angels were 16-27 without him in
August-September of 1996 and upchucked their big lead over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's freak arm injury, plus the loss of Jason Dickson and
Matt Walbeck, reinforces the franchises's jinx complex. Adding a
key player from a team with its own curse sort of makes Anaheim
Ground Zero for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Is Terry Collins nearing the same precipice he fell
from in Houston? (end bold) It looks like it. Collins won 66, 76
and 82 games in his three years in Houston, but he was fired in
spite of that improvement. His high-strung personality grated on
the players.
</P>
<P>
   He's won 84 and 85 in Anaheim despite beleaguered pitching. But
a summertime rip last year at players for checking out early before
the All-Star break lingered into the fall. Vaughn is a huge
clubhouse presence; how well he and Collins get along will be a key
theme for '99.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Is there any reason to believe the two locals will
make the playoffs? (end bold) One can dream of the first I-5 World
Series. But the real novelty would simply be a postseason victory.
It's been 11 (Dodgers) and 13 (Angels) years since either team
claimed one. Maybe we're due.

HAROLD STEINBERG, 77, PUBLISHER AND WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.H.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Steinberg, a former co-owner and executive of
Chelsea House publishing company, died last Friday at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 77 and had
moved to the Kateri Residence nursing home in Manhattan from East
Hampton, N.Y., three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea House Publishers was founded in 1964 and named for the
Chelsea Hotel, on West 23rd St. Steinberg was living there at the
time and had been working in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986 Chelsea House was based in Greenwich Village and
publishing reference works, mainly in the field of American
studies, and series like ``American Presidential Elections'' and
``World Leaders.'' Its project editors included the historian
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the literary critic Harold Bloom and Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. For years the company's main owners
were Steinberg and Andrew Norman. The business was sold in 1983 to
Main Line Book Co. of Pennsylvania, and Steinberg stayed on for
some years as Chelsea House's chairman and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's own writings ranged from early novelty books like
``The Psychiatric Coloring Book'' and ``Animals in Love'' to
pseudonymous fiction and two plays. But the work he liked best
seemed to be publishing books. ``Having the privilege of making
them,'' he said in a 1986 interview, ``is a very satisfying
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn and used to say
that he studied at five colleges without staying long enough at any
one of them to receive a degree. He served in the Army Air Corps in
World War II and held various jobs before going into public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Rebecca Vyorst ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary McCarthy Steinberg of Staten
Island, N.Y.; a daughter, Katharine Steinberg Golick of Brooklyn,
N.Y.; a son, Anthony Burgess Steinberg of Los Angeles; two
brothers, Bernard of Los Angeles and Herbert of Manchester, N.H.; a
sister, Joy Schwartz of Staten Island, and two grandchildren.

WITH SEASON IN TATTERS, MAVERICKS TURN TO YOUNGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Expect to see a lot less A.C. Green, Shawn Bradley and
John ``Hot Rod'' Williams this season for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be a pleasant sight for fans who paid to see them,
but the Mavericks will be playing more of their younger players,
such as Chris Anstey, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, Samaki Walker and
Erick Strickland, to get more experience for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Gary Trent, another young player, was surprised the
Mavericks didn't put forth maximum effort against the Minnesota
Timberwolves, in Tuesday's 98-78 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you really don't realize until the lead starts
building and you start going down two, six, 12 and 20,'' Trent
said. ``That's when you realize it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' defense has been lacking lately, especially on
the inside, as teams often attack the basket for easy layups or
dunks. The Mavericks have allowed an average of 102 points per game
over the past three games after allowing 89.2 points during the
previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson, who is slated to take over as the Mavericks coach
when the new American Airlines Center is completed in time for the
beginning of the 2000-2001 season, believes the Mavericks' ship
will be righted one day soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take \Rlosing\S personal and hard,'' Nelson said. ``It's
very frustrating. We don't get much sleep after games like \Rthe
loss to Minnesota\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we do like the guys in that locker room. If
you're going to be in a trench, we feel very comfortable being in
the trenches with that kind of group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a go-to guy to emerge for us. We have, right now, a
team of very, very good support players. We have no superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash, who was handed the starting point guard spot and a
six-year, $33 million contract extension before the season started,
agrees with Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have, per se, a superstar,'' Nash said. ``We
don't have a guy who commands a $70 million or $80 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RMinnesota forward\S Kevin Garnett makes everyone on his team
better by leaps and bounds. We don't really have that type of
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Nash said the Mavericks have to use other means
just to scratch out a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a premium on rebounding and outhustling the
other team, and we're not doing a good enough job of that,'' he
said. ``We've hit the wall, so to speak. But we have to try to
solve this riddle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will try to solve the riddle by turning to their
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to play our younger guys, but I don't want to
jeopardize losing a game that I feel we should win,'' Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``It's a fine line between
trying to get our youth some experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope to get the best of both worlds, and that we win
and they get experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Mavericks are experienced at is losing
ballgames. They are the NBA's worst franchise this decade, with a
dreadful 190-498 record (.276).
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks haven't been to the playoffs since the 1989-90
season _ the longest drought in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson was supposed to change all of that. But he's 26-72
since he took over as Mavericks coach on Dec. 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's frustration with the team's failure boiled over Tuesday
against the Timberwolves. That's when he received two technical
fouls and was ejected from a game for the first time this season
for protesting a noncall on a collision that sent guard Erick
Strickland to the showers with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got frustrated, and a lot of times when you don't have a
good record refs might take the night off or not give you the
respect you deserve,'' Nelson said. ``And that's happened a few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland is OK, and practiced with the team yesterday. He will
be in uniform tonight when the Mavericks (10-22) play the 3-26 Los
Angeles Clippers at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clippers own the worst record in the NBA, Nelson is
proceeding with caution. He knows the Clippers just beat up Utah,
103-77, and also recently won at Minnesota, 100-85.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also knows his team's psyche has been affected by losing
eight of its past 10 games. That includes the loss Tuesday to the
Timberwolves, a 109-101 loss to Seattle in a Monday game that the
Mavericks trailed by 21 points in the fourth quarter, and last
Saturday's 99-77 loss to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very dangerous team for us,'' Nelson said of the
Clippers. ``We are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team that comes in here thinks they can beat us. So,
it's up to us and it's important that no one comes into our home
and gets away with an easy win.''

UT WOMEN SET FOR TEXAS RELAYS TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ After years of battling to climb the mountain, Bev
Kearney has finally reached the top. And, curiously, she has found
that the view from up there looks amazingly like that from down
below.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 10 years as a perennial runner-up in women's
track and field, Kearney and her Longhorns won the prize last June,
breaking Louisiana State's domination of the NCAA Outdoor
Championships with a stirring victory in the meet's final event.
</P>
<P>
   But as she prepared her team for the first major meet of the
1999 outdoor season _ the Texas Relays, which begin today at
brand-new Mike A. Myers Stadium in Austin _ Kearney said she has
seen no difference between opening the season as the champion,
rather than one of the pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized in my heart years ago that as long as we were in
the top three or so, we were a championship-caliber team,'' said
Kearney, whose teams at Texas and Florida earned four second-place
outdoor finishes before last year's title. ``The last couple of
years before we won, we were second in the nation. Every team but
LSU would have loved to switch places with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this year is the same as last year. The goal is to win the
national championship. That we did it last year doesn't make it any
different than what we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a little extra incentive this week. Despite
their victories in the '98 outdoor meet and the '99 national indoor
championships last month, the Longhorns opened the outdoor season
ranked a shocking fifth by Trackwire, the sport's most respected
college rating service.
</P>
<P>
   With No. 1 LSU, No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 SMU all expected to make an
appearance in Austin, the stage is set for the Longhorns to send an
early season message that they haven't gone anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to trade teams with anyone,'' Kearney said.
``All of our ladies feel they are capable of carrying the team, and
we want all of them to feel responsible for the success or failure
of this team. We feel we've got the athletes who can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the heart of last year's championship squad is back in a
senior class that has powered Texas from the day it arrived on
campus. Among them, Suziann Reid, Nanceen Perry, LaKeisha Backus,
Kim McGruder and Aminah Haddad have won 15 national titles in the
sprints and relays and have carried the Longhorns since their
freshman season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine people thinking we've been in college forever,''
laughed Reid, whose eight NCAA championships include the '98
outdoor and '99 indoor 400-meter titles. ``To us, it's gone by
fast, but to them ... We started to clean up in our first year, and
we've cleaned up big-time since then. It's only natural to wonder
how much longer we're going to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those wondering, this will be the last time around for
Texas' version of the Fab Five, and their drive to win is as strong
as it was when LSU ruled the women's track world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really drives you is competition,'' Reid said. ``When you
look at our team, just about everyone there is in the top five in
the country in her events. We are the best, so in practice we're
running with the best. We use each other to push ourselves.''

WETTELAND, PALMEIRO EXPECTED FOR OPENING DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Closer John Wetteland and first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro will start the Rangers' final Florida exhibition
game today, manager Johnny Oates said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Rangers are convinced the two will be available
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, neither one of them will go on the disabled list,''
said Oates, who witnessed Wetteland and Palmeiro play in a
minor-league camp game yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Oates plans for Wetteland to start and pitch one inning and for
Palmeiro to be the designated hitter and bat fifth in today's game
against Cincinnati at Charlotte County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oates also revealed his probable Opening Day lineup, which will
be unveiled for today's game. Left fielder Rusty Greer will not be
displaced by Palmeiro as the Rangers' No. 3 hitter in a decision
the manager described as a ``no-brainer.'' Palmeiro will bat fifth
behind right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rusty is more suited to hit third,'' Oates said.
``Raffy can hit in either one of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who like Greer would prefer to bat third, accepted the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with that lineup,'' Palmeiro said. ``I'm
fine with that. I just want to be in there. I just had two knee
surgeries in one month. I don't care where I hit. He could hit me
first or ninth. I just want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who underwent arthroscopic surgery March 7 to remove
torn cartilage from his right knee, went 0-for-6 during yesterday's
minor-league camp game. Perhaps the most important numbers, though,
were 4.9 and 4.8. That's how many seconds it took Palmeiro to run
from the batter's box to first base, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball pretty well,'' Palmeiro said. ``I'm not worried
about hitting. I'm just concerned about running and getting out of
the box. I did that pretty decently today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be full-strength Opening Day, but I'm confident I'll
be able to play. I'm still a few weeks away from being
full-strength, but I'm confident I can go out there and do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland (soft-tissue injury, right ankle) threw 25 pitches in
his one-inning appearance, but Boston's Triple-A Pawtucket ballclub
scored twice on two wind-aided home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I talked to said it was encouraging, but it never
feels good to give up home runs, whether they're wind-blown or
not,'' Wetteland said. ``However, the stuff was definitely there.
Obviously, I wasn't as sharp as I'd like to be. I just want to
continue to see improvement _ improvement on the bite of the
slider, improvement on throwing the changeup for strikes and
consistency on the velocity of my fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part is that stuff will come swiftly, provided you're
healthy and strong. The reason pitchers need three weeks to get
ready is they're fighting soreness all the time. For me, that part
is over and done with. My arm strength was great coming into
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wetteland and Palmeiro available for Opening Day, reliever
Jeff Zimmerman likely would begin the season at Triple-A Oklahoma
and only two roster berths would be needed for bench players.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers likely would carry another utility infielder (Scott
Sheldon, Jon Shave or Rafael Bournigal) and a fifth
outfielder/pinch runner (Milt Cuyler or Scarborough Green).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every roster decision you make,'' Oates said, ``impacts
somebody.''

   PEORIA, Ariz. _ If it's true that where there's smoke there's
fire, shouldn't the same be true of a fire sale?
</P>
<P>
   So, the intrepid detective searches the San Diego Padres'
spring-training camp for a telltale puff or two.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, none in the clubhouse. Or in the front office. Or on the
practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the main stadium. Isn't that smoke?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But it's coming from a Trevor Hoffman fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman? What's he doing here? Surely the best closer in
baseball, in the final year of his contract, would fetch a high
price in young prospects. Isn't that what you do when you're
conducting a fire sale?
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman is not only here, he's also the proud possessor of a
four-year, $32 million contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the defending National League champions aren't
conducting a Florida Marlins-style fire sale after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even accurate,'' Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn said.
``I don't agree with that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins held the mother of all fire sales after winning the
World Series in 1997. The Padres stand accused of doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins spent liberally on free agents in an attempt to
build a contender and attract fans. They succeeded at the former,
but failed miserably at the later.
</P>
<P>
   So, after winning the Series, they began dumping players. Owner
H. Wayne Huizenga wanted to sell the team, and to make it more
attractive to potential buyers the payroll went from $52.5 million
to $19.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Marlins, the Padres went to the Series, although they
lost to the New York Yankees in 1998. Like the Marlins, there was
an element of attracting fan interest. The postseason push
contributed to San Diego voters' approval of a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Marlins, the Padres no longer have a lot of their
star players. Gone are pitchers Kevin Brown and Joey Hamilton,
third baseman Ken Caminiti and outfielders Steve Finley and Greg
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it looks suspiciously like a fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   However, a look at some other numbers shows that might not be
the case. The Padres' payroll was $44 million last season. It's $48
million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Caminiti and Finley are gone because they became free
agents, and the small-market Padres were outbid for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried,'' first baseman Wally Joyner said. ``They tried to
re-sign everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitchers Woody
Williams and Carlos Almanzar. Vaughn was dealt to the Cincinnati
Reds in the only true cost-cutting deal the club made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a small market trying to survive until they get
the new ballpark built,'' Gwynn said. ``You're losing money every
year already. Now, you're going to throw an extra $20 million on
there because you went to the World Series? Sooner or later, teams
have to make responsible decisions. Sometimes they're not popular,
but they're the right ones to make. I think in our case, they've
made really good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were a true fire sale, Joyner wouldn't be around. He
also was a free agent, but was re-signed. The Padres also signed
Sterling Hitchcock, Dan Micili, Williams, Chris Gomez, Carlos
Hernandez and John Vander Wal to long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   And they gave Hoffman the contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that he's going to be here for a while now, that's
huge,'' pitcher Andy Ashby said. ``It's good to show the fans that,
hey, we're still trying to win. Some things had to change, but some
things they are keeping the same.''
</P>
<P>
   A true fire sale shows up in the record. The Marlins went from
World Series winners to 108-game losers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects the Padres to contend this year. But they
shouldn't fall that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a young team, but I think we have one that can be very
competitive,'' Gwynn said. ``If things fall into place, if our
young guys play well, we can be right there again.''

LAKERS LIMPING DURING BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ So much for the luxury and benefits of a three-day
break.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had looked forward to this unusually long gap between
games _ first to rest, then to practice hard and get new parts like
Glen Rice further acclimated. But when they returned from their day
off Wednesday, the Lakers got dealt their usual bad hand.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, out with the flu. Robert Horry, sidelined with a
strained left hip. Bumps and bruises all around. (And don't be
surprised if they all come down with writer's cramp after players
took turns signing 300 official NBA basketballs.)
</P>
<P>
   A fresher team after taking Tuesday off? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, aside from Robert being hurt, Glen not being here, Shaq
(O'Neal's) stomach problem, (Derek Fisher's) foot, Rick (Fox's)
foot, Fish's face, (Derek) Harper being 37 years old, Dennis
(Rodman) being (38) . . . what else?'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``Aside from about half the team being hurt, I guess we looked as
fresh as we could be.''
</P>
<P>
   His sarcasm was understandable. The Lakers haven't been at full
strength all season, and even when healthy, they've been busy
incorporating new players or changing the starting lineup or
dealing with some other unplanned change.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, Fox and O'Neal all practiced Wednesday despite
season-long ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But without Rice, the Lakers were denied a precious opportunity
to get the ace shooter and his teammates more adjusted to one
another. Rambis has been tweaking the offense to give Rice more
shooting opportunities off of screens and movement, rather than set
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got done what I could get done with the players that we
have,'' Rambis said. ``But even some of the players that are here
are injured, so we couldn't get done everything that I wanted to
get done. . . . It does get frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Worm on MJ: Dennis Rodman was incredulous over reports that
former Bulls teammate Michael Jordan was considering playing for
the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you nuts? There's no way,'' Rodman said of the prospect of
Jordan playing again. Rodman figures Jordan floated the rumor
himself. ``He's just doing it because he wants his name in the
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling fined: O'Neal, fined $3,500 for tossing the Knicks'
Chris Dudley into photographers along the baseline Sunday, was
unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who got fined, me? How much I get fined?'' he said. ``That's
cool, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal later made fun of the entire issue while talking about
the Lakers' new offense with Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Kurt he doesn't have to call plays for me. I'm gonna do
what I get paid to do, and that's push people into cameras,
dominate and get fined,'' O'Neal said, laughing.

TERM-LIMITS _ It's hard to imagine a more ardent supporter of
congressional term limits than Rep. Matt Salmon, who was elected to
his third, presumably his final, term in November. All of which
raises a large question: What was Salmon doing holding a
fund-raiser at a fancy Washington restaurant last month? By JEFF
BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WIND-ARIZ _ It tipped over trucks, caused one death in a
multiple-car pileup and blew off roofs in northern Arizona. It
kicked up dust so thick in the Valley that it looked like snow.
Wednesday's gale was one of the worst northern Arizona has ever
experienced, with gusts as high as 104 mph. Much of central and
eastern Arizona were under high-wind warnings all day Wednesday,
and parts of Interstate 40 remained closed early today. By MAUREEN
WEST. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;
