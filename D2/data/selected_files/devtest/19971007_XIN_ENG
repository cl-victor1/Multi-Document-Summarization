<HEADLINE> Heroic Welcome Greets Hamas Leader's Return to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of cheering
Palestinians in Gaza today granted a heroic welcome to Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the radical
Islamic group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was flown from Jordanian capital Amman this afternoon
in a Jordanian military helicopter to a tumultuous welcome by
cheering Palestinian residents and Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) officials.
</P>
<P>
Posters and freshly painted slogan in the walls of buildings
congratulated the return of Yassin, who has been imprisoned by
Israel for nine years and was released last week in a prisoner
exchange deal reached between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's release was reportedly part of a deal to release the
two alleged special agents from Israeli secret service Mossad,
who were detained for trying to assassinate Hamas leader in
Jordan Khaled Mashal.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Yassin's arrival in Gaza, the two agents
returned to Israel. And 20 prisoners, 11 Palestinians and nine
Jordanians, were released from Israeli prisons apparently as
part of the exchange deal.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Jordanian King Hussein spoke with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone today over the
return of Yassin, but the Prime Minister's Office here denied
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who held a chaotic news conference before leaving
Amman, vowed to carry on Hamas' fight against Israel occupation
despite his claim that Hamas activists were peace-seekers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel must recognize the rights of the
Palestinians' return to their homeland and release all
Palestinian prisoners, otherwise there could be no cease-fire to
end Hamas' violent attacks against Israeli targets.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says British Public Remain Hostile to EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A national referendum on
Britain's membership of the planned single European currency would
pose a serious political risk for the Labor government, according
to the Annual British Social Attitudes Survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published in today's Financial Times newspaper,
revealed that some 61 percent of the British voters remained
firmly opposed to the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
This findings indicate that British Prime Minister Tony Blair
faces an uphill battle in persuading the British people of the
benefits of EMU, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators predict that the British government is
likely to hold a referendum on joining a single currency before
any decision was made.
</P>
<P>
A Financial Times report two weeks ago said the government
would shortly make a statement that sterling is likely to join EMU
soon after its 1999 launch sent stock and bond markets soaring.
</P>
<P>
However, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook have both dismissed the report as
pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy
Ashdown urged the government for a clear statement of intent on
the single currency as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of intent should include a clear commitment to
joining EMU within a defined timescale -- say no later than the
end of 2001," Ashdown said.

<HEADLINE> World Steel Consumption Forecast to Rise 4.5 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Global steel consumption will
grow by 4.5 percent in 1997 to reach a record 695 million tons
due to strong economic growth, according to a report published
today by the International Iron and Steel Institute.
</P>
<P>
The report said that demand is growing fastest in South
America, where it is likely to rise 12 percent this year, led by
growth in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic recovery in western Europe will boost steel
demand there up 7.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
As the recent drastic decline in steel consumption in the
former Soviet Union appears to have bottomed out, steel demand in
central and eastern Europe is forecast to grow by 4-5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
It said that apart from increases of more than 10 percent in
steel consumption in Mexico and Canada, strong economic growth in
the US also adds to great steel demand in North America.
</P>
<P>
The report added that in Asia, growth in demand in China, South
Korea and China's Taiwan is offsetting a downturn in Japan and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that world steel use will continue growing steadily
by about 15 million tons a year in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian-German Trade Increases: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The trade volume between Iran and
Germany amounted to 1.7 billion Marks (about 988 million
U.S. dollars) over the past five months despite U.S. embargo
against Iran, an Iranian trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Matthias Boddenberg, Managing Director of the Iran-Germany
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said that Iran exported 500
million Marks (290 million dollars) worth of oil, fresh and dried
fruits and carpets to Germany in the period, while it imported
1.2 billion Marks (697 million dollars) worth of machinery,
equipment and raw materials from Germany.
</P>
<P>
The export of Iranian oil to Germany rose by 83 percent, and
that of fresh and dried fruits by 35 percent. But carpet exports
fell by 8 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He termed the commercial relations between Iran and Germany
as being "friendly and based on mutual interests."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embargo against Iran has had no negative effect on
the relations between the two countries except for those companies
which are under influence of the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the D'Amato Law signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
1996, the U.S. would impose sanctions on foreign companies
investing more than 40 million dollars in Iran or Libya. The
investment cap in Iran reduced earlier this year to 20 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the extensive relations between Iran and
Germany, he said no other countries in the world are able to
replace Germany in its trade exchanges with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's No. 1 trade partner. Iran's import from
Germany accounts for 15 percent of its total imports while export
to Germany makes up 5 percent of its total exports.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Army Succeeds in Containing Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Chief of
Defense Staff, Brigadier Samuel Koroma said today that his army
continues to "register successes in containing attacks from
Nigerian forces" stationed in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He did not give details about casualties, but said, "the cost
of human lives to the Sierra Leone fighters have so far been
minimal."
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian forces are increasingly counting the costs in
skirmishes and even through the explosions of land mines they
planted at the (international) airport," he said in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to Koroma, the planted mines are made of plastic
which cannot be easily detected.
</P>
<P>
"They are located in places frequented by local farmers and
peasants who earn their living through subsistence agriculture,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
A military coup was staged on May 25 this year to oust the
civilian government of A. T. Kabbah and the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) asked the Nigerian-led
west African peace keepers (ECOMOG) to force out the military
junta and reinstate the legitimate government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Koroma also accused Nigerian military pilots of using cluster
bombs on civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
"For them to use such bombs on targets in Freetown indicate
deep sinister purposes," he charged.

LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A conference was told here today
that London in the future will be car free in the center, public
transport will be integrated and hotels will subject to compulsory

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a London Tourist Board (LTB) conference -- London
Tourism the Millennium and Beyond, its chairman Sir John Egan

business and leisure travel in the world."
</P>
<P>
Egan wanted to see 28 million visitors from overseas and 18
million from the rest of the UK coming to London and the industry
to generate 28 billion pounds (44.8 billion US dollars) for
London's economy in that year.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held to outline the LTB's vision for London
in 2010 and to launch the tourism strategy for London 1997-2000.
</P>
<P>
Chris Smith, secretary of state for culture, also speaking at
the conference, said, "London is vital to Britain's tourism
success. This is why the government has funded the LTB to run a
number of very successful overseas promotions."
</P>
<P>
London now attracts over 14 million visits from overseas and a
further 12 million from elsewhere in Britain. They spend in total
9 billion pounds (14.4 billion US dollars) and support a wide
variety of jobs across the capital, according to the LTB.
</P>
<P>
London's success means that other parts of the country also
benefit, the LTB added.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Sign Land-mine Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa
International Affairs Representative (Saiar) declared October 6
to be Africa day of action against land mines and urged African
governments to sign the International Land-mine Ban Treaty this
December.
</P>
<P>
Saiar said in a statement issued here today that about 10
anti-land mine campaigners used the day to make correspondence,
congratulations and pleas to African governments to continue
their stance on land mines.
</P>
<P>
''Campaigners also urge governments to work to bring the
international ban treaty into force before the year 2000,
increase de-mining activities and release funds for victim
assistance,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
One of the activists, former Mozambican first lady Graca
Machel wrote letters to African leaders, saying she was proud of
the way in which they supported land-mine ban during the
negotiations for the land-mine ban treaty in Oslo last month.
</P>
<P>
The Saiar urged the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt,
Eritrea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone which were not
represented in Oslo to give up the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
The statement said African members of the Commonwealth which
would meet in Edinburgh, Scotland, from October 24 to 26 should
urge their partners to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the United States to sign the treaty.
</P>

Representatives from many countries will meet in Ottawa,
Canada, in December this year to sign the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Vote for Electoral Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's citizens have
voted in favor of amending the country's constitution to allow
for electoral reforms, according to sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In a public vote on Sunday, 59 percent voters supported
lowering the voting age to 18 from 21 years old, 73 percent to
establish an independent electoral commission and 70 percent to
allow Botswana's citizen outside the country to vote, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth amendment to the constitution, that the president
shall serve only two terms of five years, was recently approved
by Botswana parliament, and will not be subject to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has had only two presidents, the late Sir Seretse
Khama, who died in office after serving for 14 years, and
Ketumile Masire, who has been in power for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Although there is wide speculation that Masire, 72, will step
down before 1999, the constitutional amendment is not retroactive
and he will be allowed to serve a further two five-year terms if
his party maintains its majority, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Talks to End S. Leone Crisis to be Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Renewed talks to end the
current political impasse in Sierra Leone will begin in Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire Thursday, state house aides told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to the aides, the Sierra Leone delegation will leave
Freetown Wednesday and will take with them proposals for "a quick
solution" to finding a peaceful resolution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Initial talks broke down in July after military strong-man
Major Johnny Paul Koroma announced in state radio and television
he would return democratic rule to the west African state in four
years' time.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the capital said delegates representing
the ousted civilian government will travel from Guinea, where
they are in exile, to the meeting, which has been called by the
committee of five on Sierra Leone, namely Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire,
Guinea, Nigeria and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The daily Expo Times newspaper, which normally mirrors the
views of the military government, said in an editorial today, "We
think the junta should be ready to make concessions and go along
with the wishes of the international community which might mean
well."
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is gradually, if not speedily becoming one of the
stake-holders in our crisis," the paper continued.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerians now have two hostages (ousted President Tejan)
Kabbah and detained rebel leader Foday Sankoh. Kabbah and the
junta should now start talking to each other indirectly through
ECOWAS-5."
</P>
<P>
The junta has repeatedly called for the formation of a
national unity government to solve the crisis in Sierra Leone,
which has been rejected by both ECOWAS (Economic Community of
West African States) leaders and the ousted civilian government,
saying constitutional rule should be returned to the civilian
government.

LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Clashes broke out between
soldiers and former rebels at the weekend in eastern Sierra
Leone, leaving 16 fighters seriously wounded, a report reaching

</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses and local journalists were quoted by two
independent radio stations as saying that regular army soldiers

Security forces had to intervene to end the fighting, which

No one was killed in the clash but 10 soldiers and six former
rebels were seriously wounded, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thapa Appointed Nepal's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra tonight
named Surya Bahadur Thapa as the country's new prime minister
while the outgoing Lokendra Bahadur Chand demanded that Thapa and
his followers be stripped of parliament membership for violating
the law.
</P>
<P>
With support from the Nepali Congress (NC), Nepal Sadbhavana
Party (NSP) and two independents, Thapa, president of the National
Democratic Party (RPP) and prime minister for five times between
1964 and 1983, garnered a majority of 107 votes in the Lower House
to stake his claim for the premiership, according to a communique
issued by the king's Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of this Himalayan kingdom, a minimum of
103 votes is needed to claim the post of prime minister in the
event that no single party holds an outright majority in the
205-member Lower House.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-term election in late 1994, no single party
commands a majority in the Lower House and coalition politics has
thus emerged in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Thapa's coalition government will first be one between the RPP
and NSP before the NC joins later, sources said.
</P>
<P>
This government must win a vote of confidence in the Lower
House within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chand has written to the king and the speaker of the
Lower House respectively, accusing Thapa and his followers of
violating the Anti-Defection Act, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, MPs risk losing their seat in the parliament if
they vote against the party whip.
</P>
<P>
Before the Lower House voted on the NC-tabled no-confidence
motion against the Chand-led government, Thapa and 14 other RPP
MPs held a parliamentary party meeting in the absence of Chand,
their parliamentary party leader, and decided to vote for the
censure motion, leading to the fall of the government on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his letters, Chand demanded that those MPs voting against
its own government be stripped of their parliament membership, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
But the Anti-Defection Act also provides that MPs will not be
considered defecting when joining a party formed by 40 percent of
either the party's working committee members or the parliamentary
party committee members.
</P>
<P>
Thapa now has two-thirds of the RPP Lower House members on his
side.
</P>
<P>
"In no circumstance will our party split," Thapa claimed one
day after Chand resigned.

<HEADLINE> Third African Land-use Workshop Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A month-long third African
community-based land-use planning workshop for rural development
started today in Masvingo, south Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The workshop being attended by 27 participants from 13 African
countries is aimed at promoting the sustainable use of natural
resources for agricultural and rural development.
</P>
<P>
At a opening ceremony, Masvingo provincial Governor Josaya
Hungwe said African countries should put more emphasis on
land-use planning which involves participation of the community
if meaningful development is to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He stressed conscientization and participation of the
community on resource management and environmental issues was an
important product of land use planning for rural communities.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said, ''the development of an articulate expression of
community interests is more strategic than the physical
development of the land and its resources.''
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, he said, policy makers had put emphasis on
land-use planning involving the community for visualization of
resource management plans in a dynamic manner.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that land-use planning was the only way to
reduce ''negative'' land-uses.
</P>
<P>
''Today we live in situations where every piece of land has
multiple uses. This is more so with the communally managed
land,'' Hungwe said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said, ''through the process of land-use planning
we hope to reduce mutual negative impacts of different land uses
to a minimum.''

<HEADLINE> 20 Tons of Illegal Weapons Destroyed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Twenty tons of confiscated
illegal firearms worth more than 2 million Rand (420,000 U.S.
Dollars) were destroyed in Pretoria today, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Police
Commissioner George Fivaz watched as the first of 4,504 pieces of
weapons were crushed and melted at 1,600 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
"By destroying these arms, we are making certain that they
will never again be recirculated in our community," Mufamadi
said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons destroyed today included pistols, revolvers,
rifles, shotguns and homemade arms. They were confiscated by
police during countrywide investigations.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the availability of firearms to criminals
created fear among communities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of extreme importance and priority to strictly
control legal arms and to stem the flow of illegal firearms into
the country," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The South African Police Service was committed to stopping
illegal arms being brought across South Africa's borders.
</P>
<P>
To this end, joint operations with Mozambican police had
resulted in the destruction of several tons of firearms and
ammunition over the past two year, Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
During the last operation in August and September this year,
more than 100 tons of firearms and ammunition were destroyed in
northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Andrew Lesch said another 4,500 illegal arms
are awaiting destruction.
</P>
<P>
Firearms played a crucial role in South Africa's seemingly
endless waves of violence. Incidents of armed robbery, rape and
shootings were reported almost every day across the country.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nepali New Prime Minister Thapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Surya Bahadur Thapa, one of
Nepal's old timers in the premiership, was named again tonight by
King Birendra to head the country's next government.
</P>
<P>
Born into a landlord family in eastern Nepal on March 21, 1928,
 Thapa graduated from Allahabad University, India.
</P>
<P>
He began his political career in 1950 by participating in the
underground student movement. He joined the Nepali Congress (NC)
in 1954 and four years later, he was elected chairman of the Royal
Advisory Assembly.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 31, Thapa was elected into the Upper House of the
Nepali Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, he was appointed minister for agriculture, forest and
industry before becoming minister for finance and economic affairs
in 1962 and minister for finance, economic planning, law and
justice the following year.
</P>
<P>
From 1964 to 1983, he served as prime minister five times
including as chairman of the Council of Ministers (cabinet) from
1964 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a setback in his political career in 1972 when he
was arrested under the country's Security Act and had been
imprisoned until 1974.
</P>
<P>
Thapa founded the National Democratic Party (RPP) in May 1990
and merged his party with the RPP (Chand) in January 1992. He has
since been president of the RPP.
</P>
<P>
He believes that democracy cannot flourish without proper
protection of nationalism, human values and human dignity in a
liberal environment.
</P>
<P>
His sole hobby is reading while his recreation is gardening.

<HEADLINE> Somali Refugees Return from Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 Somali refugees
today reached the southern port town of Kismayu, 500 km south of
the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kismayu said the refugees who stayed in camps
inside Kenya have voluntarily returned back home.
</P>
<P>
VHF field radio reports in Kismayu said the refugees who
looked very weak, tired and malnourished complained about
insecurity and what is characterized as mistreatment by the
Kenyan police force in the camps.
</P>
<P>
They had also protested against scarcity of medicine and lack
of proper education for their children.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the Bajun community, one of the Somali
unarmed ethnic clans living in middle and lower Jubba regions
have forwarded a letter to the United Nations High Commission for
Refugee (UNHCR), complaining about a repatriation plan by the
agency for nearly 3,500 Bajun refugees in camps in the Kenyan
coastal town of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Local elders from the Bajun community in Kismayu said they
asked UNHCR to delay its plans for the repatriation since their
home islands near Kismayu -- Kudhayow, Jula and Jawaia -- lack
the basic facilities needed for the existence of human being.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bajuns, there are no adequate potable water
and shelter in these islands. The elders furthermore said they
have invited the UNHCR to send an assessment team to visit these
islands before the repatriation takes place.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, 95 Somali refugees have returned to Mogadishu from
Mombasa on commercial ferries that docked at the natural port of
El-Ma'an, 30 km north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The refugees who arrived on two different ferries in the past
two weeks said they have not been deported or repatriated, but
have returned back home voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The refugees who did not receive any welcome from anybody
complained about the recent insecurity in Mombasa, saying they
feared for their lives and preferred to come back to Mogadishu
from where they ran away about six years ago at the height of the
civil war in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a committee for the business community in Mogadishu
have appealed to people in the capital to refrain from all kinds
of activities that might add to the already insecure atmosphere
there.
</P>
<P>
The business committee have made their appeal at a time when
the high seas have ended and the natural ports are beginning
their normal activities.
</P>
<P>
The call by the business committee also came at a time when
some sub-clans living in south Mogadishu have been busy in
looting vehicles from one another for retaliatory reasons. The
public transport buses in several areas in the capital have been
scarce following the fear of looting by the bus owners.

<HEADLINE> UK Public to Be Questioned on Womens' Fighting Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The British public are to be
asked whether they approve of women serving in frontline combat
roles in an opinion poll to be launched by the Ministry of Defense
(MoD).
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson is expected to make
an announcement about opening up more jobs for women in the three
services during a Commons defense committee at the start of the
parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
Before a final decision was made, Robertson and Armed Forces
minister John Reed, both of whom are keen to expand equal
opportunities in the Armed Forces, have decided to ask the public
for their views.
</P>
<P>
An MoD report said, "Apart from being the quickest and cheapest
method, this approach carried the advantage that the questions
would be included among a wide range of other questions on
non-defense issues and would therefore be less likely to attract
public attention."
</P>
<P>
Women already serve widely within the Armed Forces, including
front-line RAF aircraft and on board Royal Navy ships, but they
have not been allowed to serve in the front line roles in the
Army.

<HEADLINE> Irish FM Resigns Amid Allegations Against Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Ray Burke
resigned from parliament early today amid allegations against him,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Burke, who has been accused of accepting a 30,000 Irish punt
(about 43,700 U.S. dollar) political donation from an Irish
businessman in 1989, tendered his resignation following fresh
controversy over the granting of passports to an Arab banker in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Burke, who is co-chairman of crucial all-party Northern Ireland
peace talks, was reported to have authorized naturalization
certificates under a legal "passports for investment scheme" in
return for a promised investment of 20 million punts (about 29
million dollars) in job-creation.
</P>
<P>
Opposition political parties have been pressing for Burke's
resignation, saying the recent allegations against him have
undermined his credibility in the Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old government minister was quoted as saying that
he had been a victim of the smear campaign.

<HEADLINE> Ease of Mideast Crisis to Help Doha Summit: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has expressed hope for the ease in the Middle East crisis
to help the controversial Middle East and North Africa Economic
Summit achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks at a meeting with Secretary-General of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan in the United
Nations headquarters in New York Monday night, a statement by
Riyadh-based GCC secretariat said today. The statement gave no
details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief hoped that the ease of the Mideast crisis will
encourage Arab states to attend the gathering scheduled in
November in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, launched in 1994 and held last year in
Egypt, is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel and
their major trade partners in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
But a deadlocked Middle East peace process has soured the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates have announced their intention to boycott the
summit in line with the Arab League's decision to suspend
normalization with Israel following Israel's construction of a
new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League decided last month to let its
members to decide for themselves whether to take part in the
meeting or not.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has expressed time and again its resolve to host the
annual economic meeting, but its Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Ahmed Abdullah al-Mahmoud announced recently that the
conference would be downgraded to the level of foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar's decision to organize the conference was adopted in
the light of progress in the peace process," the minister of
state was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met the foreign
ministers of the GCC states in Saudi Arabia trying to persuade
these countries to take part in the summit during her Middle East
tour last month.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> China, US to Promote Bilateral Economic and Trade Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States will
take the forthcoming Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit
to the US as an opportunity to expand their economic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), and the visiting US Commerce Secretary
William Daley expressed this common belief at the 11th Session of
the Sino-US Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), which
opened here today and was co-chaired by the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting was held on the eve of Jiang's state visit
to the US and this "is of special significance," Wu Yi said,
hoping that the two countries would plan their economic and trade
relations strategically, and will further develop such relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US relations are at an important moment, Daley said,
adding that President Jiang Zemin will soon visit the US and
President Bill Clinton will visit China next year and the two
nations should use the opportunity to push forward the bilateral
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that MOFTEC has established and developed good
relations of cooperation with the US Department of Commerce in
recent years through the JCCT.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that Sino-US economic and trade relations have
developed healthily in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
She said Daley's visit will "inject new impetus into bilateral
economic and trade relations."
</P>
<P>
Wu also noted that new progress has been made in Sino-US economic
and trade ties since the 10th session of the JCCT, which was held in
Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
Issues of intellectual property rights and textiles have been
resolved, bilateral trade and two-way investments have increased
steadily, exchanges of commodities are becoming more active, US
industrial and commerce enterprises are becoming more and more
involved in China's constructions, and the negotiations between
the two nations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) have shown a positive momentum, Wu recalled.
</P>
<P>
She said that the JCCT meetings in the last couple of years
have laid a solid foundation for an effective cooperation between
two sides in the economic and trade fields, and the very purpose
of the current meeting is to push such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Daley said that the JCCT has already become a good mechanism
for maintaining contacts and dialogues between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the MFN issue, Wu said the US side "can do something" so as
to thoroughly resolve this issue at an early date, which has long
been troubling Sino-US economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's entering the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Wu reiterated that China's request to enter the
organization demonstrates the country's determination and
confidence in opening up wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
As a major signatory state of the WTO, Wu said, the US should
take a reasonable attitude and honor its promises, and play a
positive role.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the US side regards US-China ties as very important
and wants to see China entering the WTO, because this not only is
in the interests of China but also of the US.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the US "sanctions" on China, the Chinese minister
pointed out that the US removal of some of its so-called
"sanctions" against China, which obstruct bilateral cooperation
and contacts, will enjoy popular confidence at a time when the
Sino-US economic and trade ties are developing fast.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the loans of the Export-Import Bank of the US and
financial issues, Wu noted the US financial institutions have
offered strong support to American exporters, increasing the
competitiveness of their products.
</P>
<P>
She added that this is an important way to balance the trade
deficit of the US with China.
</P>
<P>
Coming back to the issue of textile products, Wu said she hopes
the US side would present specific cases of illegal transhipment
for the two sides to clarify the responsibilities, work together
to fight against such activities and to eventually remove this
obstacle in textile trade.
</P>
<P>
On the cooperation in space technology, Wu said he hopes the US
government would simplify and accelerate the formalities in
approving China's launching of US-made satellites.
</P>
<P>
She also hoped the issue of export control on meteorological
satellites can be resolved early so as to promote the further
cooperation between space industries of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that in dealing with economic and trade
ties, it is important to maintain contacts and dialogues, which
will help increase mutual understanding, reduce differences and
enhance cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opens Advanced Military Information Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt opened a military
information center here today, describing it as the "most advanced
specialized one" in the Middle East, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the center as part
of the country's celebrations of the 1973 October War with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Defense Hussein Tantawi also attended the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak gave the go-ahead for military news dissemination on
the Internet, which will present subscribers with accurate and
reliable information on the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The computerized center have access to various information
sources and decision-making bodies at home and abroad, according
to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing information on Egypt's armed forces, the
center will follow up news through 39 radio stations, 35 TV
channels, eight news agencies, the Internet and the Arab and
foreign press.
</P>
<P>
The new establishment will analyze news in regard to national
security, military affairs, disasters, crisis, national
development and terrorism, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The 1973 October war was launched by Egyptian troops to recover
territories including the Sinai Peninsula captured by Israel in
the Six-Day War in June 1967.
</P>
<P>
The war ended after an 18-day fighting and a ceasefire
agreement was reached between Egypt and Israel. Egypt recovered
the Sinai Peninsula under U.S.-brokered disengagement agreements
in 1974 and 1975. In 1979, Egypt signed a peace treaty with
Israel, becoming the first Arab country to conceive peace with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not Hurry for Return of European Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian foreign minister said
here today that there is no hurry on the part of Iran for return
of the European ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Kharrazi made the remark while delivering a report on his
mission in the United Nations General Assembly at today's
Parliament session.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the European ambassadors to take decision in this
respect. What is of importance to us is the strength of the
Islamic Republic of Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the return of the European ambassadors, he said, it is a
mutual issue between Iran and Germany and it should be settled by
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that ambassadors can return but that the German
envoy must be the last to go back. Germany, backed by its European
Union partners, has rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
However, German Foreign Ministry on Sunday rebuffed an Iranian
offer of bilateral talks to solve the dispute blocking the return
of EU ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Germany said that Bonn would only hold talks when the EU
envoys are back in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
EU's 15 members, except Greece, called back their
ambassadors from Tehran after a German court ruled in April
that Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 killing of four dissidents
in Berlin.

CHANGSHA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has
called for the intensive implementation of the Water Law in a bid
to make a sustainable use of limited water resources in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China should vigorously battle flooding, water
pollution and wasted water resources in accordance with the
law. However, he also noted that remarkable achievements have been
made in water conservancy construction and the protection of water
resources since the law went into effect in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Wang, leader of a fact-finding group looking at implementation
of the law, made the remarks today at Changsha, capital of central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Results of the tour will be fully considered in future
revisions of the law, according to Yang Zhenhuai, a member of the
NPC Standing Committee and co-chairman of the NPC Environmental
and Resources Protection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the Water Law centers on the exploration, use and
protection of water resources, as well as the protection of water
conservancy projects, management of water usage and flood
prevention projects.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned 11-day fact-finding mission is being carried
out around the Dongting Lake, the second largest lake in China,
which holds some 30-40 percent of annual floodwaters from the
Yangtze River. The area is a crucial flood prevention and
protection area in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and provincial governments have invested
heavily in water conservancy construction in order to form flood
prevention, power generation and irrigation networks in recent
years, according to Hunan Governor Yang Zhengwu.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake area is still vulnerable to annual flooding
due to the limited capacity for floodwater discharge.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Optimistic About Economy: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are feeling good about
the country's economic prospects, according to a new poll
published today.
</P>
<P>
Half of those surveyed by Angus Reid Group Inc. said they
expected the national economy to improve in the next year.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest-level of optimism the polling firm has
recorded since it began asking the question a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
"Thinking about the next year or so, do you yourself generally
feel that the Canadian economy will improve, stay about the same,
or get worse," the poll asked.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 50 percent of the respondents said they think the
economy will strengthen in the next 12 months, compared with 12
percent who said things will get worse and 37 percent who expected
no change.
</P>
<P>
The 50-percent reading is up from 45 percent in a July survey
and 39 percent in a January poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that optimism is more prevalent among
men, university-educated people and the affluent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the mood of Canadian consumers has been
improving steadily since January 1996, when pessimists outnumbered
optimists by a two-to-one margin.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,503 people was conducted on September
23-30. It is considered to be accurate within 2.5 percentage
points 95 percent of the time.

<HEADLINE> Leading Securities Company Reports Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The past five years have
witnessed a rapid growth of the securities underwriting and
brokering business of the China Securities Company Ltd, one of the
three top securities firms in China.
</P>
<P>
The company now has 90 securities branches in more than 20
provinces and municipalities, and the total volume of its
securities trading, in which it either traded on its own or acted
as a broker, has been growing steadily during the period to 460
billion yuan last year, said Shao Chun, president of the China
Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 8.4 times that of 1995, the second biggest for
all the Chinese securities firms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shao said his company grew in tandem with the young securities
market. The Chinese stock market as a main part has more than 700
companies listed for the present, with its market capitalization
exceeding 1.62 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, China Securities has acted as the lead
underwriter and listing recommender for the stock placement of
nearly 70 firms, according to Shao.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first batch of approved primary dealers of the
treasury bonds, it has also underwritten a total of 5.65 billion
yuan's worth of government bonds so far.
</P>
<P>
The company also made fruitful attempts in perfecting its
information network, while achieving headway in the investment
bank services and other news services such as the setting up
investment funds and developing financial derivatives. Its
international business is also on steady rise, together with a
gradual formation of a network of overseas clients, Shao added.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites Don't Boost Sales: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Few North American retailers are
making money from their Internet investments, according to a new
study published today.
</P>
<P>
North American retailers are pouring an average of roughly
20,000 U.S. dollars into setting up their Web sites, but they
expect little payoff in the way of increased sales.
</P>
<P>
"Until the typical middle-aged consumer feels comfortable with
this burgeoning technology, adoption rates in most retail
categories will remain low and various retail applications will be
restricted," the study said.
</P>
<P>
"Like many technological innovations, it may take a generation
for Internet shopping to attain mainstream status," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, retailers who ignore the Internet do so at their own
peril, warned the study, which was done by the Toronto-based
Polytechnic University's Center for the Study of Commercial
Activity.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, large chunks of some retail sectors will have to set
up shop on the Internet, according to Prof. Ken Jones, who
co-authored the study.
</P>
<P>
But a big stumbling block is money, he said. The cost of
experiments and the uncertainties of adoption have created many
barriers to entry.

ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China today told a U.N. conference
on desertification that it will join hands with other countries in
the fight against desertification.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, head of a Chinese delegation to the first session
of the Conference of Parties to the U.N. Convention to Combat
Desertification (CCD), said here that "extensive and effective
international cooperation" is needed to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called on the developed countries to actively transfer
advanced technology to developing countries to help with their
fight against desertification.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries should also intensify scientific
research and training to combat desertification and try to get
their own people mobilized in the fight," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that China, as one of the countries worst
affected by desertification, is willing to cooperate with other
countries to combat desertification and make its own contribution
to the implementation of the CCD.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification,
designed to curb degradation of arid lands affecting more than 1
billion people worldwide, was adopted in June 1994 and went into
force in December 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat met with U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross in Ramallah this afternoon and discussed with him
measures for speeding up the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat and Ross discussed the ongoing
preparations for the forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
scheduled in Washington on October 13, the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center said.
</P>
<P>
Ross' second meeting with the Palestinian side since his
arrival from the U.S. Monday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiating teams from Israel and the PNA met here last night,
kicking off the preparations for the peace talks. Several
committees appointed by both sides are busy at working their
agandas for the talks, which include the security cooperation, the
definition of the time-out of Jewish settlements, Israeli troop
redeployment and the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. His second meeting with Netanyahu is scheduled for
later today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spiritual leader of the Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin issued a statement
today in Gaza, saying that Hamas will not fight against the PNA
even if PNA kills Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Hamas does not hate the Jews because
the Jews are a people too, but "what is going on is (that) Israel
occupies the Palestinian lands."
</P>
<P>
"We do not fight the United States...do not fight Israel,
but we demand our rights in our raped lands," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin returned to his home town of Gaza on Monday from Amman
after being released from Israeli prison. The 61 year-old Hamas
leader received hero's welcome upon his returning home.

<HEADLINE> Weakening Peso Forces Manila to Defer Corn Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Food
Authority (NFA) has decided to temporarily shelve the importation
of 300,000 metric tons of corn because of an increasing world
market price of corn caused by the weakening Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the NFA told the Philippine News Agency today that
the peso depreciation plus the 35 percent tariff to be imposed on
this corn importation has resulted in higher landed cost.
</P>
<P>
They said the landed cost of corn is already at 8 pesos (22
U.S. cents) per kilo while the domestic wholesale price for the
commodity is only 7 pesos per kilo. Farm-gate prices are just more
than 6 pesos during the corn harvest season in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the landed cost is still higher than the existing
domestic prices, the country's corn users are now hesitant to
commit to buy the imported corn, they said.
</P>
<P>
The importation of the 300,000 metric tons of corn was approved
by President Fidel Ramos last month to prevent an expected corn
shortage resulting from a severe drought due to the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen have forecast that El Nino will hit the Philippines
from late this year to mid-1998 and will lead to a severe drought
in the country.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a large-scale oceanographic and meteorological
phenomenon that develops in the Pacific Ocean. It can cause
extreme climatic variability such as devastating rains, winds and
drought.
</P>
<P>
The peso today depreciated to as low as 35.537 against the U.S.
dollar at the local currency market, a 34.6-percent drop in its
value in two and half months.

<HEADLINE> New Gene Sequencing Center to Open in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada is planning to open a
center next year in Vancouver to research on the genes of people
with breast, prostate, colon and lung cancer, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Chemist Michael Smith, a Nobel laureate, will head up the new
genome sequencing center.
</P>
<P>
"There is no institution like this in Canada... Canada would
really have been left behind if we were not getting into this
field," Dr. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Gene sequencing involves analysis of DNA structure and the
exact order of the molecules in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
The order is considered important in understanding the cause of
disease. When the order of the molecules is altered, mutations
that lead to disease can sometimes develop.
</P>
<P>
Canada has research programs that hunt for genes and other
programs that extract information about DNA.
</P>
<P>
But until now, its scientists have been forced to leave the
country to pursue research in genome sequencing involving humans.
</P>
<P>
The new center will try to bring back Canadian scientists who
are now working in other countries as well as provide facilities
for those educated in Canada, Dr. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Gene sequencing research is currently undertaken in labs in the
United States, Britain, Japan, France and Germany, according to
the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Smith said that the new center will not be duplicating work
done at other centers. Instead, it will deal specifically with
cancer-related issues.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on types of cancer in which it is possible to
follow the disease from early to advanced stages, he added.

plane were released in Bandar Abbas, 1,331 kilometers south of the

<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that a 30-year-old
hijacker who attempted to force the Flight No. 257 plane to
change its direction toward Iraq or Israel Monday afternoon was
arrested by flight security guards.

<P>
A number of passengers said that about one hour after the plane
took off from Tehran to Bandar Abbas, a southern port city, the
hijacker shot and wounded a flight security guard standing near
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was also injured when the other flight security
guard opened fire at him, the passengers added.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker had first claimed that he had three other
accomplices on board the plane but no reaction was seen from any
other person aboard the airliner, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker must have been alone, they added.
</P>

The plane continued flying its normal route toward Bandar
Abbas after the hijacker was subdued and arrested by the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel, Jordan Ties Soured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his readiness Monday night to mend
the relationship with Jordan, soured over the assassination
attempt by Israeli agents on a Hamas leader in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Two men holding fake Canadian passports attacked the political
chief of Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas Khaled Mashaal on
September 25 in the Jordanian capital. The two assailants were
arrested by the police, who uncovered that they were sent by the
Israeli intelligence service Mossad to assassinate Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, who has been a close ally of Israel
among the Arab countries, blamed the attack as a "reckless
act...carried out by a party with no faith in peace." He reportedly
told his confidants that he had come to the brink of breaking ties
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is one of
the two Arab countries that have diplomatic relationship with the
Jewish state besides Egypt. King Hussein mediated the Hebron
accord between the Palestinians and Israel in January this year
and has been carrying out cooperation with Israel since the
normalization of their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In an immediate effort to calm the fury of Hussein and to mend
the relations, a high-ranking Israeli delegation, including
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon and security officials, was dispatched to
Amman on September 28 to negotiate for the return of the two
agents.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein publicly called on Israel on September 30 to
release the jailed Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin. On the next day, Yassin was set free by Israel and flown to
Amman in a Jordanian airplane, believed to be under a deal between
Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, 11 Palestinians and nine Jordanians were
released by Israel after Jordan set free the two Israeli agents
who got home in obscurity, in sharp contrast with the hero's
welcome received by Yassin upon his return to his home town of
Gaza on Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the issue of assassination attempt by the Israeli
agents has come to a conclusion for the time being, but diplomats
here argue that the gap between Jordan and Israel is not so easy
to be bridged. It is understood that distrust, especially on the
part of Jordan, has cast a shadow over the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz to Switch to Euro in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial group
Daimler-Benz AG today announced its support for the European Union
(EU)'s plans to introduce the single European currency, the Euro,
as the "corporate currency" from its planned start-up date of
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made today by the board of management of
Daimler-Benz, the Euro would replace the German mark as the
company's standard monetary unit for all relevant business
transactions from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The board also decided that the company's business results for
the first half of 1999 are to be drawn up in Euro. Its customers
would also be able to choose Euro or their national currency to
pay their bills on a voluntary basis during the transition period
of the Euro from 1999 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision is basically a signal for our customers,
suppliers and partners in industry and public administration that
we see a tremendous chance both for Europe and our group in the
European Monetary Union," said Daimler-Benz Chairman Juergen
Schrempp.
</P>
<P>
Under the Euro timetable, the conversion to the single currency
would not be compulsory in its member states until January 2002,
when the Euro banknotes and coins would be officially introduced
after a three-year transition period during which the Euro would
only be used in cashless transactions.
</P>
<P>
By deciding to convert to the Euro as early as January 1999,
Daimler-Benz is one of the first German companies to take such a
step at this early stage.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz Chief Financial Officer Manfred Gentz estimated
the company's costs for the currency conversion at about 200
million marks (114 million U.S. dollars), with more than half of
the money used for the requisite adjustments to data processing
within the group.
</P>
<P>
However, the Euro introduction would also cut the company's
currency exposure by about 30 percent, thus largely eliminating
performance risks from unforeseeable exchange-rate fluctuation,
Gentz said.
</P>
<P>
"This would yield greater security for corporate planning, in
turn considerably enhancing the operating conditions for the
individual business units," Gentz added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Warned Against Tomahawk Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The former head of the U.S.
strategic nuclear forces, General Lee Butler, today warned that
any move by Australia to purchase Tomahawk cruise missiles could
spark a regional arms race.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of such a weapon into Southeast Asia is
unlikely to go unanswered by Australia's neighbors, Butler said
when answering a question at Canberra's National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"My experience in 33 years is that if nations view you as a
threat, equally as you do them, they will never concede to you an
advantage they consider strategic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan confirmed in August
that the country was considering purchasing the long-range
missiles, used with devastating effect in the Gulf War against
Iraq, the Australian Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, with a range of 1,500 kilometers, could be fitted
to Australia's F-111 strike bombers or new Collins class
submarines.
</P>
<P>
Australia's consideration of the weapons has already been
criticized by New Zealand's opposition Labor Party which has
warned that such a purchase would place defense ties between the
two countries under considerable strain.
</P>
<P>
Butler advised that a series of questions have to be asked
before considering such a purchase.
</P>
<P>
"What are the threats to Australia?" he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen Republic, which has
been struggling for complete independence from Russia, is ready to
issue its own passports, the Itar-Tass new agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ruslan Alikhadzhiev, speaker of the Chechen parliament, who
announced this move in an interview with the Itar-Tass in Grozny,
said more than half a million Chechen citizens will receive their
new passports.
</P>
<P>
As for the fact that the republic has not been recognized by
the international community as a sovereign state, and the new
passports can cause inconvenience when their holders go outside
the republic, the speaker said, "If the international community
does not recognize our passports, we shall not ask them for this."
</P>
<P>
The Chechen leader also said that Chechnya had dispatched 200
samples of new passports to various countries so that their
officials would have an idea of new Chechen documents.
</P>
<P>
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has noted that he did not
want Chechen citizens to have passports with Russian symbols.
</P>
<P>
"We shall have our own Chechen passports with a Chechen coat of
arms," he said in a televised speech.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov issued a statement Monday to reaffirm Chechnya's
further drive to develop interstate relations with Russia. He
complained that the sour relations between Chechnya and Russia had
aggravated recently.

<HEADLINE> Wang Wins First Diving Gold for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Unheralded Wang Tianling beat
Olympic silver medalist Yu Zhuocheng to win the gold medal of the
men's one-meter springboard for host Shanghai in the 8th Chinese
National Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang trailed Yu by 16.16 points before the last dive but he
beat the Atlanta Olympian to second place with a nearly flawless
final dive which earned him 79.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Yu, from China's diving powerhouse Guangdong Province, made a
fatal slip in the board before starting the last dive, which only
got 59.45 points.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 20, cheered on by a fervent home crowd, had led Yu by
15.12 points with a total of 417.30 in semifinals. He accumulated
432.66 points for the win, only 3.64 ahead of Yu.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yilin from Shanxi Province settled for third with 423.06
points.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who teamed up with Barcelona Olympic platform champion Sun
Shuwei and another star diver Lan Wei to anchor the men's team
title on Sunday, was believed to be a sure shot at the one-meter
board in absence of Olympic champion Xiong Ni.
</P>
<P>
Three time Olympian Xiong finally fulfilled his gold dream in
Atlanta last year after taking a silver in Seoul in 1988 and a
bronze in Barcelona in 1992. The veteran from Hunan Province had
quit the one-meter event to focus on his favorite three-meter
board.
</P>
<P>
The week-long diving competition features eight events,
including men's and women's teams, one-meter and three-meter
springboard and 10-meter platform.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province swept the team titles while the women's
10-meter platform gold medal went to Wang Rui of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 8th National Games, China's biggest sports gala before the
turn of the 21st century, will officially open on Sunday.

said that they would definitely vote yes, 18 percent probably yes,
13 percent probably no and 46 percent definitely no.
</P>
<P>
And for the first time in several years, definite no voters
outnumbered definite yes voters by a 2:1 margin.

<P>
The survey of 500 Quebecers was conducted October 1 to October
3. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent, 19
times out of 20.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Fund Indigenous People in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government with all
major players in the tourism industry is looking into ways to
establish a revolving fund to assist indigenous people interested
in tourism, The Herald daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Public relations manager for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority
(ZTA) Lesley Gwindi yesterday said most indigenous people who
wanted to venture into the industry did not have enough capital.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of potential in the tourism industry but
indigenous people have not been able to utilize it because of
lack of funding. We have agreed to set up a revolving fund and we
are now looking into ways of sourcing for funds," said Gwindi.
</P>
<P>
Although tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in
the country, only a few indigenous people are actively involved
in it. Last year Zimbabwe earned about three billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (about 250 million U.S. Dollars) from tourism.
</P>
<P>
Over 150,000 people are directly employed in the tourism
industry. Expansion of the industry would result in more jobs
being created.
</P>
<P>
To increase indigenous participation, the ZTA recently carried
out a tourism investment project to identify community leaders
countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Several viable projects were identified by the teams and ZTA
is now helping them to source funds and implement the projects.
</P>
<P>
The ZTA also will hold tourism development conference in
Harare at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be attended by tourism practitioners of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Gwindi said millions of dollars would be needed to fund
indigenous tourism projects which have already been identified.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today instructed his government to solve the auto
trade dispute with the United States through "dialogue and
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"It is not desirable to emotionally react to the U.S. decision
to invoke Super 301 provision against South Korea's auto
industry," said the president. "We should make a cool-headed
judgement on what is in our national interest."
</P>
<P>
Increased trade friction with the nation's largest trade
partner would not benefit either country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the instructions after receiving a report
on the ongoing South Korea-U.S. auto trade dispute from Trade
Minister Lim Chang-yul.
</P>
<P>
"I want the government to do its best to solve the problem
through dialogue and negotiations," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim asked the minister not to accept any undue and
excessive demands from Washington.
</P>
<P>
South Korea should make it clear to the U.S. side that it
would never accept any demands beyond international standards, Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
Kim also instructed his government to bring the case to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and take other steps to defend his
country's national interests provided the U.S. takes any
unilateral action.

night for what he truly is - a danger to the nation and to the
security of its citizens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Meretz Party leader Yossi Sarid asked the
Knesset subcommittee for secret service to investigate the role of
Arthur Finkelstein, Netanyahu's electoral campaign adviser, in his
national decision-making.
</P>
<P>
"Each time the government hits a crisis, Netanyahu calls in
Finkelstein to advise him instead of calling on someone from the
defense establishment," Sarid complained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the problem lies with the prime minister.
Netanyahu is a serious security hazard. He is not suitable as a
prime minister. His decision-making is defective and deficient."
</P>
<P>
Two Mossad agents were arrested by Jordanian police after they
failed to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan's
capital Amman on September 25. The incident led to a secret deal
on swap of prisoners and the release of founder of Hamas Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin and his return to home town Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
After the two agents were freed and back home, Netanyahu
declared to set up a three-member committee, which will be chaired
by Yosef Ciechanover, a former legal advisor of the Defense
Ministry, to investigate the failed attack.
</P>
<P>
But security sources said this three person committee has no
legal authority and only a official state commission of inquiry
would have sufficient authority to determine the truth and draw
appropriate conclusion.
</P>
<P>
They also voiced the fear that Hamas would be strengthened by
the Mossad failure and that it will step up terror activities
against Israel in order to press for the release of more Hamas
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Australia Moves to Limit Damage After Tourist Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's new federal Tourism
Minister Andrew Thomson today moved to limit damage to the
multi-million dollar Japanese tourist trade from the murder of a
young Japanese tourist in northern Queensland, Northeast
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who was appointed earlier this week following Prime
Minister John Howard's ministerial reshuffle and has yet to be
sworn in, said however that he did not think the murder was
racially motivated and that it would probably have no impact on
the number of Japanese tourists visiting northern Queensland.
</P>
<P>
"Economic factors have a much bigger influence on the number of
tourists than isolated incidents of this kind," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourist Michiko Okuyama, 22, went missing in Cairns
late last month and her body was found naked and covered by palm
fronds and leaves on October 4 in the Cairns Central Swamp in
suburban Manunda, about two kilometers northwest of Cairns.
</P>
<P>
Her disappearance and murder have been widely publicized in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
As police interviewed a juvenile and examined what they
believed to have been the murder scene, the Japanese-speaking
tourism minister conducted interviews with Japanese reporters who
were in Cairns to cover the story and asked them not to overreact
to the murder, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan is an important tourism market for Australia. More than
600,000 Japanese tourists visited Australia in 1995-96 with 77
percent of them going to the state of Queensland, whose tourism
industry ranks first among Australia's six states or territories.

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union countries
have bolstered economic optimism due to strong exports as
demonstrated in rising industrial, consumer and retail trade
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The favorable economic climate was reported today by the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union,
through business and consumer surveys.
</P>
<P>
The overall sentiment was up by more than 10 percent as
compared with the indicator of 1985.
</P>
<P>
The industrial confidence indicator remained unchanged at a
level above the average over the last decade while consumer and
retail trade confidence also reflected stable gains in confidence.
</P>
<P>
The only decline was found in the construction sector that
dropped slightly, mainly because of erratic movements in the
Spanish figure, according to the surveys.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wheat Exports Hit All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wheat exports
smashed a decade-long record this harvest season to post an
all-time high of 19 million tons, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB)
said today.
</P>
<P>
The 19 million tons of exports loaded on 750 ships in the
harvest year to September 30, 1997, broke the previous record of
15.9 million tons set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the harvest, in the four months between
December 1996 and April 1997, a record average of 2.2 million tons
of wheat exports were shipped from Australia.
</P>
<P>
AWB General Manager International Nigel Officer said the export
figures were an endorsement of Australia's integrated marketing
system.
</P>
<P>
Officer said that based on the benchmark Australian Standard
White 10 pool return, about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in export
revenue is expected to flow back to growers from the 1996/97
harvest.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between grain handlers, waterfront unions,
rail and transport providers and the growers enabled the AWB to
achieve the record outcomes.
</P>
<P>
"We delivered on time every time and this has enhanced
Australia's reputation as a reliable international supplier."

<HEADLINE> Europeans Cautioned on Taiwan Official's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen
Guofang today cautioned Western European nations that they will
risk relations with China by allowing Lian Chan, a Taiwan
official, to visit those countries.
</P>
<P>
"China strongly demands that concerned European countries will
proceed in line with their friendly relations with China and will
not allow Lian Chan to engage in any activities. Otherwise said
countries will cause serious consequences to their bilateral
relations with China," according to Shen.
</P>
<P>
"Should concerned countries allow Lian Chan to visit,
regardless of excuses or format adopted, the nature will be
serious, and it will constitute interference in China's internal
affairs," said Shen.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "China will have to respond strongly."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks during a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lian Chan's attempts to go to some European
countries under the pretext of travel or vacation is aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and sabotaging
friendly relations between China and European countries,"
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly opposed to such actions," said Shen.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taiwan issue is a crucial issue of
principle concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
China, and the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, and
stressed that the government of the People's Republic of China is
the only legitimate government representing the nation.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China firmly opposes the Taiwan authorities'
efforts to carry out international activities designed to split
the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that his country is interested in
a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, but it
would not lobby other countries for the position.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral in Cape
Town, Mandela also avoided backing India's bid for a permanent seat,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"These are questions we will agree on at the appropriate time,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of the 185 member states of the United
Nations agree that the UN Security Council should undergo reform,
they could not agree on how to reform it.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the expansion of the UN Security
Council would be a long process that would definitely involve enormous
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council has five permanent members -- Britain,
China, France, Russia, United States -- and 10 non-permanent members,
half of which are replaced every two years.
</P>
<P>
Gujral arrived in Johannesburg on Sunday night. He flew to Cape
Town for talks with Mandela, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to address parliament this afternoon, and will
attend a banquet in his honor hosted by Mandela later today.

WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton used his new line-item veto
power to pinpoint and strike out more than three dozen military
spending items cherished by Senators and Representatives who said
projects in their districts were essential to the national
defense.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who had several
hours of talks with his French counterpart, said any action
the United States takes against a French oil company's decision to
invest in Iran would not disrupt relations between the United
States and France.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton exhorted Americans Monday to avert a
potential "catastrophe" for their children by supporting decisive
action to counter global warming, but he warned that the West
could not solve the world's environmental problems alone.
</P>
<P>
-- The shuttle Atlantis glided to a sunset touchdown Monday,
bringing astronaut Michael Foale back to Earth after four and a
half months aboard the Russian space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The White House said there are more videotapes of
fund-raising events beyond the film excerpts of 44 coffees that
have been given to congressional investigators. Clinton said it
was "just an accident" that the videotapes weren't turned over
sooner, but the Justice Department and a Senate panel plan to
investigate the matter further.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Firms Fined for Fishing in Aussie Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Indonesian fishing
companies, which were convicted today of "illegally" fishing in
Australian waters, have paid 1 million Australian dollars (720,000
U.S. dollars) to have their fishing boats returned, the local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Northern Territory's Foreign Fishing Operations
Unit, Col Mellon, said the owners of 10 other Indonesian fishing
boats caught illegally fishing in Australian waters in the last
three weeks would also stand trial soon, the Australian Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He said a change of wind direction was one of the main reasons
for the recent increase in the number of Indonesian fishing boats
in Australian waters.
</P>
<P>
Mellon said the 720,000 U.S. dollar payout for the four boats
as well as their equipment and catch is far from a record amount.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past 4.2 million U.S. dollars had been paid for
the return of one fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
Mellon also said that even though the number of Indonesian
boats "intruding" into Australian waters has increased lately many
people are exaggerating the problem.
</P>
<P>
"People have become alarmist because they think we are being
invaded. Well we are not. These are just fishermen."
</P>
<P>
But he did say the problem of illegal foreign fishermen in
Australian waters is "huge" and needs constant vigilance by units
such as his.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign fishing operation units, funded by the federal
government's Australian Fisheries Management Authority, are
positioned at strategic points all along Australia's coast.

BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s annual
inflation rate rose to 1.8 percent in August from 1.7 percent in
July, Eurostat, the statistical body of the 15-nation union,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase is registered in every EU member state except
Britain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium, the Eurostat report said.
</P>
<P>
French and Finnish rates were both up from 1.1 percent to 1.6
percent; Austria hiked up from 0.9 percent to 1.3 percent; Sweden
gained from 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent; the Netherlands rose from
2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, and Greece increased from 5.2 percent
to 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ireland recorded the lowest rate with a decline from 1.5

</P>
<P>
The EU's annual inflation was 2.2 percent a year ago, according
to Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
The figures were calculated as a weighted average of the
harmonized indices of consumer prices (HICPs) in accordance with
the new European index of consumer prices.

<HEADLINE> Development Along Yangtze River Offers Opportunities to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from provinces,
municipalities, cities and state-owned corporations along China's
longest Yangtze River here today welcomed investors all over the
world to join the drive to develop the river basin.
</P>
<P>
The further opening up and development of the areas along the
Yangtze River will generate enormous business opportunities for
investors, Tong Qiqing, president of China Changjiang (Yangtze
River) Development Group, told a seminar on Development along the
Yangtze River at the 28th General Assembly of the World Trade
Centers Association (ETCA), which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group was established on September 28, 1992 in Shanghai's
Pudong. It is designed to band together the upper reaches, middle
reaches and lower reaches of the river for common progress.
</P>
<P>
The group aims to develop commerce and trade, consumer products
manufacturing, transportation and real estate in cities along the
river.
</P>
<P>
Following the successful implementation of the opening policy
along the coastal areas, the Chinese government has decided to
shift its strategic emphasis to the development along the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta and the Yangtze River region cover a
vast stretch of land, which is abundant in natural resources and
excels in industries and technologies.
</P>
<P>
The 6,380 kilometer-long Yangtze runs through nine provinces
and municipalities: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi,
Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a well-developed land transportation network which is
composed of railways, highways and express ways have taken shape
in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The drainage area of the river hits 1.8 million square
kilometers, one fifth of China's land area, which is dwelled by 42
percent of the country's 1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhongmin, deputy mayor of Chongqing, the biggest economic
center in the upper reaches, told participants of the seminar that
his city will act in accordance with international practice and
carry on the treatment of Chinese citizens to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Chongqing is duty-bound to protect the legal
rights and interests of the investors so long as they engage in
legal operation.
</P>
<P>
The further opening-up and development of the areas along the
Yangtze River can quickly spread the energies of these areas to
the whole country so as to expedite the economic take-off of the
Chinese mainland, Han Zhongxue, deputy mayor of Wuhan city in
central China's Hubei province, said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, located in the middle section of the Yangtze River, is
an important link between the eastern, western, northern and
southern parts of China with advanced transportation and
communication systems.
</P>
<P>
The city is also one of the educational and technological bases
of China.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan looks forward to cooperating with countries across the
world in business, finance and industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, standing at the outlet of the Yangtze River into the
sea, is the largest economic center in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai has established trade relations with more than
40,000 businesses in 205 countries and regions around the world
and has more than 10 major export and import markets, said Hua
Yequan, vice-chairman of the WTCA Shanghai branch.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Shanghai absorbed nine billion U.S. dollars in
contracted foreign investment, up 36.23 percent from the previous
year. At present, more than half of the world's top 100 industrial
multinational corporations have invested in Shanghai
</P>
<P>
The rate of success of overseas-invested enterprises in
Shanghai stands as high as 95 percent. Over 80 percent of
overseas-invested enterprises are profitable after they went into
operation.
</P>
<P>
Hua said he believes that based upon equality and mutual
assistance, the economic and trade cooperation between Shanghai
and other places around the world will be more extensive.
</P>
<P>
The super large water conservancy project on earth -- the
Yangtze Three Gorges Project is well under way. By the year 2009
when the project is completed, the river basin area will benefit
in terms of flood control, power generation and navigation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was chaired by Annie Wu, deputy chairman and
secretary general of the 28 WTCA General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Guy Tozzoli, president of the WTCA, and Chang Wan-Fung,
chairman of Hong Kong Wen Wei Po Daily, co-organizer of the
seminar, delivered opening and closing speeches respectively.

the Macao Charity, told the local Tai Chung Pou newspaper that her
department has received more than 600 such complaints from women
this year, compared with only over 300 last year.
</P>
<P>
"Certain departments of the government should take actions,"
she was quoted as saying, "so that the problem will not
deteriorate."
</P>
<P>
She said many women began to seek help from her department
since early last year, and because most of the cases involve
couples living together without marriage certificates, her
department could offer little help.
</P>
<P>
Most of the women seeking help were of lower-income family, and
they had to live on their husbands' income. They said they had
great difficulty in their daily life, in their children's
education and housing, after their husbands left them and started
a new family elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Once the problem occurred, she said, there was narrow chance
that the couple renew their relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Such problems cannot be overlooked," she said. "Only when the
unfaithful husbands get punishment can such problems be stopped
from further spreading."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stage Military Maneuvers in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it is
to stage grand military maneuvers in the Persian Gulf amid reports
that the U.S. orders its aircraft carrier Nimitz to rush to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani told a press conference that the
war games will cover a 50,000-square-kilometer area in the
northern section of the Gulf "up to the Kuwaiti border."
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said some 50 Iranian destroyers and vessels, two
Russian-made Kilo-class submarines, 100 speed boats and 18
aircraft will take part in the two-week-long maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, following the most massive drill which ended
late last month in Qom, some 100 kilometers south of capital
Tehran, are scheduled to begin on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said that different branches of the Iranian armed
forces will take part in the maneuvers in order to "create
coordination and bring about a common operation language."
</P>
<P>
He said the war games will involve the ground, naval and air
forces of the regular army as well as the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, the main and largest fighting force formed by
Iranian government after it came to power in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came only days after the U.S. aircraft carrier
Nimitz, carrying 50 warplanes, was ordered to gear up toward the
Gulf. Pantagon has warned Iran that its aircraft are in danger of
being shot down if they violate an allied-imposed ban on flights
over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On September 29, Iranian warplanes struck a rebel base inside
Iraq, 170 kilometers southeast of Baghdad. The base is within the
no flight zone designated by the U.S. to prevent Iraqi attacks on
Iraqi Shiite rebels.

<HEADLINE> Two German Managers on Trial for Exporting Technology to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Two German managers stood trial
today in the western German city of Moenchengladbach on charges of
illegally exporting poison gas production facilities to Libya, the
German news agency DPA reported.
</P>
<P>
The two men, aged 48 and 55, were accused of smuggling
facilities for the production of lethal poison gas to Libya via
Belgium in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Having been in custody for more than one year, the two had
denied the accusations and argued that they had no idea of how to
use the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Moenchengladbach trial was the fourth one since 1990
concerning illegal German exports of poison gas technology to Arab
countries, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In two previous trials, two convicted German managers was
sentenced to five years, and four years and three months in jail
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Monks Gather for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- About 800 monks from all over
Sri Lanka gathered here this afternoon to show their support for
the peace process initiated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the scorching sun, the monks sat around a Buddha statue
in the Viharamahadevi Park and prayed for peace. Many of them came
from Trincomalee, Batticaloa and other places, where Tamil rebels
are fighting with government troops.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 bystanders joined the prayer and some of the
supporters distributed leaflets to passersby. On walls near the
park, stickers read: "Stop the brutal war."
</P>
<P>
One senior monk in a speech said: "All the nation should get
together, all people should live as brothers as the Lord Buddha
had taught."
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist monks blessed an undivided country which, while
retaining its integrity, will provide a peaceful settlement to the
present ethnic war so that all communities could live in an
atmosphere of peace, unity and harmony in one country.
</P>
<P>
They described the peace package of the government as the only
way to peace.
</P>
<P>
However, their view is not shared by some other Buddhist monks.
In the very same park, a sit-in demonstration was held on
September 30 by some 200 monks to express their opposition to the
peace process of the government.
</P>
<P>
The monks said the devolution package, put forward by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, was aimed at satisfying the Tamil
extremists and therefore they would not support it.
</P>
<P>
Though the government is making every effort to push through
the devolution package and bring peace to the war-torn island,
some major obstacles exist.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said it would be very difficult for the
government to push through the proposals if it cannot gain support
from the Buddhist monks as Buddhism is quite influential in Sri
Lanka's social affairs and politics.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has
already rejected the devolution proposals. It seems the rebels
will continue their war with the government to gain independence
in the north and east of the country, where the Tamils make up
almost two-thirds of the total population with the Sinhalese
accounting for only 13.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Jobless Edging Toward 4.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people in
Germany rose by a seasonally adjusted 34,000 to 4.497 million in
September, the German Federal Labor Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was higher than the 25,000 expected earlier by
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Although unadjusted figures showed the jobless dropped from
4.327 million in August to 4.308 million in September, that still
represented an increase of 459,600 since September last year.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate, based on unadjusted data, fell to 11.2
percent in September compared with 11.4 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the labor office, said he was
disappointed by the latest figures. "Unfortunately, we still have
to wait for an improvement on the job market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Peter Hausmann today also admitted that
the current economic upswing in Germany was still not good enough
to bring a turnaround on the job market.
</P>
<P>
It remained a top political priority to combat unemployment, to
create new competitive jobs and to prepare Germany as a production
base for the next century, Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the German business daily the
Handelsblatt, Germany would face an average unemployment of 4.45
million in 1997, which would be 150,000 more than foreseen by the
current government budget and would incur an additional 7.5
billion mark (4.3 billion U.S. dollar) financial burden.
</P>
<P>
The huge cost of unemployment benefits is a major drawback to
Germany's efforts to meet the fiscal qualification for the planned
single European currency, the Euro.

<TEXT>
<P>
The secretary made these remarks on Monday while addressing an
on-going meeting of Macao's overseas tourism offices in 13
countries and regions. The meeting will close at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in visitors' arrival shows that Macao is still a
good sightseeing place," he said. "Confidence has again returned
to heart of visitors."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the drop in the number of visitors over the past few
months on both interior factors (rising crime rates) and
outside ones.
</P>
<P>
Fewer people visited Hong Kong during the handover period,
which resulted in a drop in the number of visitors from Hong Kong,
he said. Hong Kong is the dominant source of visitors for Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financial crisis in the Southeast Asian
nations has also cut the number of visitors from the regions.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that tourist arrivals dropped 7.7 percent
in the first seven months of the year, and in August alone, the
number plummeted by 36.7 percent, or 314,00 visitors, compared
with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials predicted that visitor arrivals will rise for
the rest of the year, and that the number of visitors for the
whole year will be about the same as last year.

HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flagcarrier,
Cathay Pacific Airways, says it will continue with plans to accept
delivery of 10 new planes next year although it has called this
year as its "worst year in decades".
</P>
<P>
"We are not canceling any of our orders for next year," deputy
managing director Philip Chen was quoted as saying in today's
South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said the company has four Boeing 777-300 aircraft,
five A340-300s and one A330-300 on order.
</P>
<P>
Last week Cathay managing director David Turnbull warned staff
the airline faced tough times because of its "appalling" passenger
 loads. Outside factors such as a fall in Japanese business and
the depreciation of Southeast Asian currencies had hurt the
airline this year.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the number of passengers began in the
summer. Rather than growing, Cathay's year-on-year monthly totals
started to fall, by 12 percent in June and 13 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a sound balance sheet, thanks to the many years
of being prudent," he said, adding that in this business a
long-term view should be taken.
</P>
<P>
Cathay's main advertising push was outside Hong Kong because
other markets contributed 80 percent of its revenues.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Down Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Federal Ministry of
Finance announced Monday that the country's inflation rate
dropped to 13.5 percent in August, 1.5 percent lower than the
government's target for this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate of Nigeria has been kept sliding since last
year, mainly due to the government's tight fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the inflation rate was as high as 72.8
percent. It went down to 28 percent a year later and stood at 26
percent at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
By last June, it had dropped to 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government projected that the figure for September would
be 12.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's effort in bringing down the inflation has
been commended by most observers. "Prices are very stable now and
this means people can buy." One of them was quoted by This Day as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But according to this newspaper, some analysts are doubtful if
the figures reflect the realities on ground.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the inflation rate is down simply because the
government refuses to release the budgetary money to critical
segments of the economy and the ordinary people have virtually
lost the financial muscle to buy essential goods.
</P>
<P>
They are worried about the embarrassing level of inventories
at the warehouses of many companies and poor manufacturing
capacity utilization.

JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) has won its support in Western
Cape Province to a position where it could challenge the
white-dominated National Party in an election, according to a
poll by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that declared voting intention for the ANC had
stabilized nationally at roughly the same level as 1994,
recovering to 54 percent from a low in last November of 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Party has suffered major erosions in
five provinces, the poll said, noting that the support for the
white party in the critically important battleground of the
Western Cape province has dropped from 41 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is administratively divided into nine provinces.
</P>
<P>
Bob Mattes, who announced the result of the poll, said that
all the political parties in South Africa had lost support.
</P>
<P>
"ANC identification among blacks had dropped from 75 percent
to 51 percent" while the National Party's white support had
fallen from 48 percent to 19 percent, he said.

<P>
Direct overseas investment came from some 160 countries and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A Iraqi trade delegation, first
since 1994, is in Beirut for talks with Lebanese officials on ways
to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member delegation, headed by Adnan Qudsi, chairman of
Iraq's chamber of commerce, which arrived here on Monday on a
six-day visit, has met with Lebanese Economy and Trade Minister
Yassin Jaber, Minister of State for Finance Fouad Seniora and
Industry Minister Nadim Salem.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Yassin Jaber, Qudsi said that he was
here to "beef up commercial and economic ties", Lebanese newspaper
the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was traditionally one of Lebanon's leading trading
partners, accounting for 20 percent of exports of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic ties were severed after the 1994 killing
in Beirut of an Iraqi dissident. And the political controversy
erupted again two months ago as Iraqi athletes were barred
from the Pan Arab Games held in Beirut under the pressure
from other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Jaber played down the possibility of restoration of diplomatic
ties, saying "At the moment it's a matter of economic ties only."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese will have to be patient. Iraq is a major market
in the region and a good outlet for Lebanese industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the Beirut Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Adnan Qassar told the newspaper that contacts between the Lebanese
and Iraqis will only lead to private arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was advocating breaking the sanctions on Iraq, he
responded, "Maybe. Dubai is doing it. So are the Jordanians, the
Turks and the Egyptians."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is doing it, so why should Lebanon be left out?" he
added.

A Lebanese industrial fair is scheduled to be held in Baghdad
between October 13 and 18.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Task Force to Probe Into Albania Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Assembly of Albania
today approved launching a parliamentary task force to probe into
the turmoil that devastated the country early this year.
</P>
<P>
The special commission, to have 11 members, would review the
series of events leading to the widespread unrest across the
country in the first few months of the year, said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At a parliamentary session tonight, some representatives
suggested the task force analyze the roles and workings of the
state intelligence, presidency and armed forces at the time.
</P>
<P>
They expected the investigators to determine whether the
initial demonstrations were normal responses to the political and
economic tensions then or part of a premediated armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil, during which over 2,000 Albanians were killed or
injured and 1,200 arms depots looted, was believed to be triggered
by the failure of shoddy get-rich-quick pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
It led to international intervention into this tiny Balkan
nation with troops deployment and the resignation of the
government then. A general election was held June 29 ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
A proposal for kicking off a parliamentary investigation was
raised by some legislators and then went through parliamentary
President Skender Gjinushi and all parliamentary groups.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi also consulted parliamentary committees in charge of
public order and intelligence operations before submitting the
plan to the floor of the People's Assembly, the spokesman said.

navigation, hauling 80 percent of the country's goods that go by
waterways.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that by the year 2000, there will be 15.5
million tons of goods going via the Three Gorges Dam annually and
2.5 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
The construction work for the whole project is in three
stages. During the first, from 1993 to 1997, workers have
completed building a water diversion canal and other work. It will
be completed with the blocking of the main stream in early
November.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will be from November to the year 2003, with
work on the big dam itself and its numerous generator
rooms. During this period, ships will use the man-made canal with
the help of a temporary ship lock on the northern bank. The start
of generating electricity will mark the end of the second stage.
</P>
<P>
The third stage will be from 2004 to 2009, when the man-made
canal is cut, the permanent ship lock finished, by 2003, and ships
will use it.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the Three Gorges Dam will improve navigation
conditions on the 660-km section in Sichuan province because 100
dangerous shoals will be covered by a huge reservoir.

<HEADLINE> Party School Professor on Joint Stock Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The report of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is a theoretical
breakthrough in the structure and form of ownership, a Chinese
professor said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jue, a professor at the CPC Central Committee Party
School, says in an article in "China Securities News", that Jiang
Zemin's report is bound to have a powerful impact on China's
economic reforms and will avoid panic about privatization and
arouse the initiative of everyone in the current primary stage of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
The joint-stock system, which is a form of organizing capital
in the modern enterprise system, is more convenient for turning
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises that have a direct
bearing on the nation's economy into market-oriented modern
companies, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But, "we should not rush headlong into mass action in the joint
stock and stock co-operation. It is impossible to introduce the
two systems into all state-owned firms. These reforms should go
step by step under the leadership of the Party and government. In
this way the joint stock system reform can proceed in a healthy
way, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Events: Yassin's Release and Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is a chronology of
events concerning Israel's release of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin and his return to homeland Gaza in exchange for Jordan's
freeing of two Israeli agents captured in the failed assassination
attempt on Hamas leader in Jordan Khalid Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
September 25 -- Two Israeli Mossad agents, carrying fake
Canadian passports, attacked Mashaal outside his Amman office and
injected poison into his ear. Mashaal was taken to hospital for
treatment and the two Israelis were detained. Jordanian officials
described the incident as "a quarrel" between Canadian tourists
and Mashaal's driver, but Hamas insisted it was an assassination
attempt launched by Mossad and vowed to attack Israeli targets
worldwide in revenge.
</P>
<P>
September 27 -- Mashaal was treated with an antidote after
Israel opened its poison at the request of Jordan's King Hussein
and reportedly the persuasion of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
September 28 -- The Israeli Embassy in Amman denied Israeli
agents' involvement in the bungled attempt on Mashaal's life, even
after Jordan admitted that Mashaal was actually attacked. But a
top-level Israeli delegation led by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, National infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and
security officials visited Amman secretly to negotiate the release
of the two Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
September 30 -- Jordan's King Hussein publicly called on
Israel to release jailed Hamas founder and spiritual leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was sentenced to life in 1989.
</P>
<P>
October 1 -- Yassin was released in a secret overnight
operation and flown to a hospital in Amman by a Jordanian
helicopter, apparently under a deal between Israel and Jordan on
prisoner exchange. He was said to have Israeli tacit approval of
his return to his homeland Gaza.
</P>
<P>
October 2 -- Canada announced it was recalling its ambassador
to Israel to protest the use of Canadian passports by Israeli
agents in the botched mission in Amman.
</P>
<P>
October 4 -- Jordan said Israel would soon release dozens more
Palestinian prisoners including senior Hamas leaders.
</P>
<P>
October 5 -- After six hours of negotiations, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon failed to reach a deal with
King Hussein to win the release of two Mossad hit men.
</P>
<P>
October 6 -- Under a secret deal on releasing prisoners, an
Israeli helicopter flew to Jordan in the morning to pick up the
two detained Mossad agents. In the afternoon, Yassin gave a news
conference in Amman before leaving for Gaza, vowing to continue
armed struggle until the end of Israeli occupation. The Hamas
leader was accorded a hero's welcome in the Gaza Stadium attended
by tens of thousands of cheering Palestinian residents and
officials.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Palestinians and nine Jordanians were set free from
Israeli jails after the two Israeli agents returned home. In the
evening Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held the first
press conference after the incident to defend the attack on
Mashaal but said a "clarification committee" would be appointed to
investigate the government's handling of the Mashaal affair.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not to Seek Military Confrontation With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran said here today that
it does not look for military confrontation with the American
forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said "I do not see any
reason for conflict between the Iranian forces and the American
forces. We are not seeking confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister made the statement at a press
conference held here this morning on a question whether the
Iranian forces and the American forces would have conflict as
USS Nimitz Aircraft Carrier is approaching the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, Shamkhani added, "We do not know the intention of the
other side," which he referred to the American forces deployed in
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the purpose of deploying USS Nimitz Aircraft
Carrier by the United States is to legitimatize its presence in
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian defense minister said that Iran was interested in
holding joint maneuvers with the Arabian Gulf countries as part of
Iran's policy of strengthening regional peace and security and
beefing up the self-defense capabilities of littoral states.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will positively review any offer for joint maneuvers
with the regional countries," he said, noting that Iran has been
calling for such war games among regional states.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was keen on forming defensive pacts with the
Arabian Gulf countries and signing a regional non-aggression
pact.
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals and dreams is to achieve the defensive
pact," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Friday that it had dispatched the
aircraft carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf in the
wake of Iranian incursions into "no-fly zone" in Southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the USS Nimitz and accompanying warships "is
related to our ability to carry out responsibility given to us by
the international community," White House spokesman Michael
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to air raids carried out by Iranian
warplanes earlier this week against opposition targets in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces in the region currently include five Tomahawk-
capable destroyers, three frigates and two minesweepers. The
battle group en route to the Persian Gulf comprises the
Nimitz, with about 80 tactical aircraft on board, along with
two cruisers, one destroyer, one frigate, an attack submarine
and support ship.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the White House announced the deployment of
USS Nimitz Aircraft Carrier in the Persian Gulf, Iran has been
highly nervous about the latest move and termed the U.S. naval
fleet a threat to regional security.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Navy Commander Admiral Abbas Mohtaj noted that the
presence of foreign powers mainly the United States in the
Persian Gulf region is unlawful and threatens the security of
the region.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of tens of U.S. warships in the sensitive region
of the Persian Gulf is regarded as a major cause of tension and
insecurity at this part of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of alien forces is aimed at heightening tension
and selling million dollars worth of arms to the Arab countries
of the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
noted that the growing friendly atmosphere between Iran and the
regional states has made the redeployment of the U.S. warships in
the Persian Gulf seem as an act in desperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the dispatch of the USS Nimitz Aircraft Carrier to the
Persian Gulf is an attempt to misportray the Persian Gulf as
trouble spot.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are dissatisfied with the growing confidence and
 friendship between Iran and its neighboring Muslim states in the
region and see the current atmosphere as harmful to their
illegitimate interests in the Persian Gulf," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Opposition Parties Boycott Budget Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese opposition parties
today boycotted the debate at the Budget Committee of the House of
Representatives, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The parties, including the New Frontier Party (NFP), walked out
after their call for testimony by a scandal-tainted oil dealer was
rejected by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget committee of the lower house of Diet, or parliament,
was forced to run a question-and-answer session without members
from the NFP, the Democratic Party of Japan and the Taiyo Party.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters that
his party may agree to summon oil dealer Junichi Izui to the Diet
for questioning over his alleged payoff to LDP politicians.
</P>
<P>
Izui, now standing trial on bribery, fraud and tax evasion
charges, claims to have donated massive political funds to six
influential politicians of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The three opposition parties had warned that they would not
attend deliberations at the lower house budget committee unless
the subpoena of Izui is promised, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Severe Trauma Among Afghan Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The majority of children in
the Afghan capital of Kabul are experiencing serious traumatic
stress during the on-going bloody fighting in the war-torn
country, a UNICEF study said.
</P>
<P>
About 72 percent of the children interviewed experienced the
death of a family member between 1992 and 1996 and in 40 percent
of these cases the child lost a parent, according to the results
of a new study "Psychosocial Assessment of Children Exposed to War
Related Violence in Kabul", issued here today by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The study, the first of its kind in Afghanistan, was conducted
by a UNICEF mental health specialist and is based on interviews
with more than 300 children aged between 8 and 18 years in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that almost all of the children have been
witnesses to acts of violence during the fighting while two thirds
of them saw dead bodies or parts of bodies and nearly half saw
many people killed at a time in rocket and artillery attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We are reminded daily of the physical scars of war on
children, but the results of this study confront us with the fact
that the mental wounds are as deep," said UNICEF Executive
Director Carol Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-quarters of the children said that they do not
expect to live to adulthood and the majority of them suffer from
nightmares, anxiety and concentration problems which also affect
their appetite and their ability to play, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The war in Afghanistan, now in its 19th year, has affected
almost every family in the country. Kabul has borne the brunt of
the fighting over the past five years, being the center of the
power struggle among various warring factions, most recently
between the ex-government and the Taliban forces which are now in
control.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most significant findings of the study is the
chronic nature of the trauma being experienced," explained Dr.
Leila Gupta, author of the study. "The psychological impact is not
short-lived."
</P>
<P>
"Violence has been a hugely influential factor in the emotional
development of these children and has dramatically affected their
views of themselves and of their future," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the children interviewed said that they worry about
what will happen to them and their families in the future and 90
percent of them said they would die during the conflict, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has begun to train a core group of 15 mental health
workers in ways to help children express their painful experiences
through artwork, writing, role playing and other activities.
</P>
<P>
"While the UNICEF study focuses on children, it is clear adults
in Kabul have also experienced loss in their families as a result
of the horrific events that they witnessed during the fighting,"
said Gupta.
</P>
<P>
"In order to help the children we must also address the needs
of their families, care givers and communities to help them cope
with these losses and traumas," she said.

<HEADLINE> Safina out as 10 New Parties Registered in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
refused to register the Safina Party but allowed 10 others,
bringing the total number of registered political parties to 21.
</P>
<P>
Safina was denied registration on the grounds of "peace,
welfare and good order in Kenya", local press today quoted
Registrar of Societies Omondi Mbago as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of Safina, which has been lobbying for its
registration since 1995, provoked immediate condemnation from its
officials who termed the decision by Mbago as "wrong,
politically-motivated and sinister."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) leader Sheikh Balala
said IPK was not ready for registration, adding the governmental
move was a blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
"If we accept registration by KANU (the ruling Kenya African
National Union), we shall have been soaked in KANU's dirty
waters. It is our prayer the IPK is not registered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Treaty Party of Kenya and People's Democratic
Congress were also denied registration.
</P>
<P>
The newly-registered parties are Liberal Party of Kenya,
People's Party of Kenya, Kenya Socialist Party, New People's
Democratic Party, Democratic Assistance Party, the Reform of
Political and Kenya Union, Green African Party and the Umma
Patriotic Party of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The rest are Kenya Nationalist People's Democratic Party and
the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy for the People
(FORD-People), which originally was Kenneth Matiba faction of
FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
The registration of the new parties is in line with the
recommendations of the Inter-Party Parliamentary Group (IPPG)
reforms package which also instructed the Registrar to give
reasons whenever an application was denied.
</P>
<P>
All the parties were registered between September 29 and
October 2.
</P>
<P>
If all the parties field presidential candidates, Kenya's
presidential race will attract 21 contenders.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Tighten Media Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG. October 7 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland will impose
tight control over mass media, according to sources reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's cabinet has approved a bill granting it powers to
decide which journalists can work in the country, local daily
Business Day quoted the sources as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The media council bill, soon to be tabled in parliament,
stipulates that media owners face a hefty fine or up to seven
years' imprisonment if they run a newspaper without themselves
being "accredited" journalists.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisages the establishment of a media supervisory
body -- the Swaziland media council, which will grant
accreditation to and discipline journalists.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member council wishes to promote press freedom and
responsible journalistic standards by ensuring journalists and
publications do not contravene a code of ethics yet to be
circulated.
</P>
<P>
Swazi residents with a journalism diploma can apply for
accreditation and journalists and media owners operating without
accreditation will face fines, imprisonment or both.
</P>
<P>
The University of Swaziland started offering a journalism
course in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Journalists or publications found by the council to have
committed a serious breach could be ordered to publish the
council's findings, issue a retraction, publish an apology or be
de-registered.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, India Sign Trade Promotion Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and India
Monday signed a commercial alliance agreement aimed at
strengthening trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries, Business Day newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, it didn't say where or by whom the agreement was
signed.
</P>
<P>
The India-South Africa Commercial Alliance would be made up of
government officials and representatives from different sectors,
including the private sectors, it said.
</P>
<P>
Jointly chairing the alliance would be South Africa's trade
and industry director-general Zav Rustomjee and the Indian
commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who is in South
Africa for a week-long visit, said the joint commission had
"identified a target of 2 billion U.S. Dollars for our bilateral
trade by 2000."
</P>
<P>
Sectoral forums of the alliance would strengthen ties and work
out cooperative programs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said the
alliance, especially the sectoral forums, would facilitate
cooperation at an operational level. The partnership with India
was based on economic, political and historical ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said the volume of business between the two countries
was constantly rising. In the past year, bilateral trade exceeded
600 million Rand (128 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gujral arrived in Johannesburg Sunday night and left for Cape
Town Monday for talks with South African President Nelson Mandela
and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Mandela, the two leaders will sign three
agreements in tourism, mining and cooperation in science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
South African-Indian relations saw significant improvement in
recent years. Mandela have visited India for three times after he
took office in 1994. In the last three year, 18 South African
ministers have visited India.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 agreements have been signed between the two
countries, encompassing political, diplomatic, scientific,
defense and commercial ties.

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Up in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The price of foodstuff in
Indonesia has increased 1.91 percent in average due to
long-running dry season and monetary turmoil, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
The price hike happens to most of foods, Beddu Amang, chairman
of the State Logistics Agency (Bulog), said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, prices of peanuts go up 6.6 percent,
vegetables 5.83 percent, fruits 3.56 percent, processed foods
2.65 percent, fat and cooking oil 2.16 percent, rice and cassava
1.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the prices of meat, eggs, milk and flavors
decrease 0.29 percent, 0.47 percent and 0.51 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The prices of non-foodstuffs also increase like housing,
garment as well as various goods and services, he added, which
respectively go up 0.82 percent, 0.61 percent and 1.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Amang said, the price hike is still at normal level according
to the current long drought situation and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
To maintain stable food price, he said, Bulog conducts market
operations everyday in all regions throughout the country. Bulog
also distributes rice to the peripheral regions including Irian
Jaya and Kalimantan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Though Indonesia's rupiah has fallen 50 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year, the Bulog chairman
said, Bulog does not increase flour price since it still has old
stock in adequate amount.
</P>
<P>
Rice stock in the country amounts to 2.8 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, long-running dry season causes food shortage in
several regions and claimed 413 lives in Irian Jaya. Government
officials said that the victims died from starvation, dehydration,
respiratory problems and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The drought also contributes to forest fires in Kalimantan and
Sumatra that spread haze to neighboring countries -- Malaysia,
Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Attempt on Iranian Plane Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An armed hijacker of an Iranian
passenger plane Monday afternoon was subdued and arrested by
security guards on board, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The domestic passenger plane of the Iran Air, flight No. 257,
was flying from capital Tehran to Bandar Abbas, an Iranian port
city in the south facing the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that shortly after the plane took off, the hijacker,
about 30 years old, ordered the crew at gunpoint to change the
direction and fly to Iraq, Iran's long-time foe.
</P>
<P>
It said the man also mentioned Israel, a sworn enemy of Iran,
as an alternative destination.
</P>
<P>
It quoted passengers as saying that the hijacker then fired at
the cockpit and the flight crew to force the captain to change
route.
</P>
<P>
The security guards on board opened fire at the hijacker and
overpowered him, preventing any possible catastrophe. The hijacker
and the security guards were reportedly wounded.
</P>
<P>
There remain unclear the identity of the man and the objective
of his hijacking. IRNA gave no clue to whether he acted alone or
he had any accomplice.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Top Business Groups Poor in Management Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Twenty of 30 largest South Korean
business conglomerates showed a failing mark in management
performance this year.
</P>
<P>
The LG Economic Research Institute reported that only 10 of the
30 top groups showed their return on invested capital (ROIC) over
the market interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Now bankrupt or near-bankrupt, Hanbo, Jinro, Sammi, Dainong and
Kia groups registered 1.7 percent, 1.9 percent, 3.2 percent, 5.5
percent and 8.7 percent in ROIC last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures, said the LG institute's report on corporate
business performance, went below the market rate of 12 percent
last year, and much lower than the five groups' average ROIC over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Top five conglomerates on average showed profitability of 23.3
percent for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The Samsung Group placed first with 35.3 percent, followed by
LG with 31.9 percent, Sunkyong with 25.3 percent, Hyundai with
24.0 percent and Daewoo with 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, however, Sunkyong was on top with 43.7 percent,
Samsung in second with 26.1 percent and Hyundai in third with 23.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Return on invested capital is a typical profitability index of
evaluating management performance, which measures the proportion
of earnings to assets used for operation for a business year.
</P>
<P>
The percentages below the market rate indicate that it would be
less lucrative to do business than to buy bonds.

</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:

<HEADLINE> Ex-PM Urges Thais Not to Give Up to Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai statesman and former prime
minister Prem Tinsulanonda urged Thai people to exercise tolerance
and not to surrender to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a rare interview with senior editors of a few local
newspapers Monday, Prem said, "The country is sick and needs
treatment. There must be confidence in the sick nation and in
doctors providing the treatment."
</P>
<P>
He added that confidence is of utmost importance before
anything can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Prem called on the people to show confidence in the efforts
made by the three key persons in charge of the country's financial
matters, Deputy Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangura, Finance
Minister Thanong Bidaya and Bank of Thailand Governor Chaiyawat
Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have trust in them, we cannot move forward," said
the well-respected statesman who had been a non-elected prime
minister for eight years until 1988.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Thailand experienced a major economic slump
and the baht was devalued in 1984. But Prem's administration has
often been cited as one of the most politically-stable, and one
which helped lay the foundation for the country's strong economic
growth in the subsequent 10 years after 1987.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister also urged business people to be
considerate of their workers by trying to avoid lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
"Poor people cannot do anything. Goods are dearer and earnings
are lower. Their children must go to school. They cannot maneuver
and have no way out. They can only remain under the reduced value
of money," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Thai people "to accept the situation and fight
with tolerance... We cannot escape nor run away from the problems.
We must fight on together."

<HEADLINE> 10 Suspected Bosnian War Criminals Flown to the Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ten Bosnian Croats suspected of
committing crimes in the Bosnian civil war were flown today to an
international tribunal in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The surrender of the war criminal suspects was the result of
recent negotiations among U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard, Croatian
President Fanjo Tudjman and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak.
</P>
<P>
Ivic Pasalic, an advisor to Tudjman, said the Croatian
government helped arrange the surrender in order to fulfill its
commitments to the war tribunal under the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at maintaining the overall interest of
Croatia and Bosnian Croats, he said, urging that the United States
and the international community keep their promises to his people.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said Croatia made the move under tremendous
pressure from the United States, but obtained the U.S. guarantee
that the 10 suspects would be tried "fairly" within 3-5 months.
</P>
<P>
In his comment, Gelbard said the move signaled "an important
and positive step" in the peace process initiated by the Dayton
accord that ended a war of three years and a half in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
With the latest development, the U.S. government is now
expected to consider supporting Croatia's bid for loans from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Advanced Petroleum Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China has become a major figure
in the world's petroleum engineering and research, as well as in
production, according to Li Desheng, an academician at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chief geologist with the China National Petroleum
Corp.'s Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and
Development, told Xinhua that China has a number of important
developments in continental petroleum geology, after decades of
research. This runs in conjunction with another theory on
hydrocarbon formation in marine geology.
</P>
<P>
The theory has enabled China to find 27 large oilfields with
reserves of more than 100 million tons each, like those at Daqing
in the Northeast and Renqiu in the North.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has finally developed layer-by-layer oil
extraction technology, technology of stabilizing oil reserves by
injecting water, and using the polymer-drive extraction method.
</P>
<P>
Other major oilfields like Shengli, Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei,
and Dagang in the Bohai Bay area have developed rolling
exploration technology, which has increased exploration, found
oil reserves of 7.28 billion tons and ensured annual crude output
of 61 million tons, making the bay the second largest oil and gas
production base after Daqing.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, China has come up
with thermodynamic technology to explore thick oil, mainly by the
use of steam and has developed an annual thick oil output of 12
million tons, the fourth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that by the turn of the century, China plans to
verify oil reserves totaling 2.5 billion to 3 billion tons and
pump 150 million tons of oil and 25 billion cu.m. of natural gas a
year.
</P>
<P>
To attain that goal, China is launching eight huge petroleum
science and technology projects, and 32 technological
developments.

<HEADLINE> Cracks Found in Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Numerous cracks have developed in
the piers and deck slabs of the 900 million U.S. dollar Jamuna
Multipurpose Bridge (JMB), which may ultimately lead to the
collapse of the most prestigious project in Bangladesh, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Local daily The New Nation said the JMB authority is expected
to hold a three-day meeting today to discuss this serious problem
which might jeopardize the future of the 4.8 kilometer-long, 18.5
meter-wide bridge.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of foreign experts and the donors, the
meeting is to find remedial measures for the cracks of the bridge,
which is expected to function through centuries after completion.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the JMB is divided into four sections and
the work was awarded to three contractors including two foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the cracks were found at almost
every segment of the completed works -- deck slabs, hinge
segments, pier stems and pile cap shells.
</P>
<P>
The cracks may have developed because of lack of control of
moisture content, improper transverse stressing or some other
reasons, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They added that the contractors should be inquired whether they
had followed the design truthfully and used the material according
to the specification.
</P>
<P>
The JMB project, funded by the Bangladeshi government and its
donors, is scheduled to complete its two-year construction by the
end of this year, which may not be possible now, the sources
added.

to combat marine pollution in the western coasts of the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Zanzibar Minister for Agriculture,
Livestock Development and Natural Resources Adam Mwakanjuki while
opening a four-day workshop in Zanzibar Monday on the
implementation of the global program of action for the protection
of the marine environment from land-based activities in the east
African region.
</P>
<P>
According to a news dispatch reaching here today, Mwakanjuki
said that in small island states like Zanzibar which have few
resources, the marine environment is the principal sources of
economic sustenance.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in most countries of the region, emphasis has
understandably been on economic exploitation of marine resources
and very little regard to environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
He observed that marine and coastal environments are extremely
fragile and sensitive and that there is a limit to the ocean's
carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is therefore a need to consider the amount
of waste which can be dumped into the ocean without causing
damages.
</P>
<P>
Mwakanjuki pointed out that poorly managed agricultural
activities, dumping of untreated domestic and industrial wastes
along coastal areas have all contributed to the degradation of
numerous marine resources.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "The threat to the productive capacity and
biodiversity of marine environment is so real -- and so in the
danger to human health."

<HEADLINE> Manila Halts Lessening Foreign Investments' Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) is holding in abeyance its plan to change the foreign
investments' ratio in the local bourses, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vet Vitug, chief of the PSE corporate communications
department, said the plan was shelved for a while in light of the
implications brought about by the region-wide currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no idea of whether it could still be revived
while the currency turmoil still prevails and has pulled down the
peso and the local bourses to unreasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
PSE president Jose Luis Yulo put forward earlier this year the
plan that seeks to keep foreign investors' interest in the local
stocks at 40 percent instead of the current more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
This way, the shares controlled by foreign investors at the
stock exchange will not be influenced so much whenever these
investors pull out of their money to other booming markets, Yulo
said.
</P>
<P>
At this time, a slight rumor in the business community would
immediately tip the scale of stock market investments in the
country, thus affecting the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Due to the currency turbulence, the 30-share composite index of
the Philippine Stock Exchange has fallen more than 800 points,
closing at 1920.63 points at today's trading.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Strike Talks Deadlock in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The talks on teachers' pay
dispute between the Kenyan government and the Kenya National
Union of Teachers (KNUT) has reached a deadlock, the Daily Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the teachers' union vowed to continue with
the four-day-long strike until the Kenyan government meets its
demands.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a statement last night, advising all
teachers who started a nationwide strike on October 1 to report
to their duty stations by 8 a.m. tomorrow or face unspecified
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph
Kamotho was issued when the talks aimed at ending the strike was
going on under the chairmanship of Labour Minister Philip
Masinde.
</P>
<P>
After learning this development, John Katumanga, Chairman of
the Teachers Service Commission said that "it is unfair, immoral
and against all known labour laws to make prejudicial statements
when the talks were going on."
</P>
<P>
The striking teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging
between 150 and 200 percent, but the government has agreed to
give a 10 to 28 percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
The KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo noted that "we went
to the talks with an open mind" and prepared a proposal of
spreading the salary increase over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, the Kenyan government has not offered
anything new to the teachers at the talks and kept on saying
there is no money.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the talks had to be adjourned to
facilitate "further consultations at the political level" and to
"give the parties time to see whether all grounds were acceptable
to them."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Parliament Will Endorse Law to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian president Negasso
Gidada said Monday that Ethiopian parliament is expected to
endorse a law which will help streamline the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to houses of federation and people's
representatives which began their third year tenure on Monday,
the president told the two houses that it is beyond doubt that
the private sector has an irreplaceable role to play. However, he
said the sector does not have the capacity to play a decisive
role at the moment.
</P>
<P>
He said, as market economy is new to the country, the quality
and quantity of the products of the private sector is minimal,
adding that a close cooperation between the private sector and
government is not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
The house of people's representatives is expected to ratify a
proclamation providing for the reorganization of the private
sector in a much better shape, he said, and added that a law
relevant to small scale and micro-enterprises would also be
issued this year.
</P>
<P>
On revising the investment code, the president said to attract
more investment, the incumbent investment code must be revised
and the house of people's representatives would also ratify the
ammended law this year.
</P>
<P>
The president referred to the problems arising from rain
failure this year. He said rain failure has fully destroyed crops
in some areas and significantly reduced harvest in other areas.
</P>
<P>
There has been shortage of potable water while the amount of
water in some of the dams has diminished causing a reduction in
the supply of electric power, he continued.
</P>
<P>
He said, the government believes in the need for foreign
assistance which should be complemented with local initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Petrochemical Company Improving Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yangzi Petrochemical
Corp., a major state-owned enterprise in east China's Jiangsu
province, has spent more than 2.2 billion yuan upgrading
technology and equipment since it started full-scale production in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money has been spent on equipment to turn out
ethylene, PTA (purified terephthalic acid), and arene. Following
completion of the upgrading project at the end of this year, the
company will be able to increase its annual production capacity by
30 percent and reduce production costs.
</P>
<P>
Yangzi can now produce 400,000 tons of ethylene, 600,000 tons
of PTA, and 850,000 tons of arene a year, compared to the previous
300,000 tons of ethylene, 450,000 tons of PTA, and 640,000 tons of
arene.
</P>
<P>
It has scored an annual increase of over 20 percent in exports,
and in the first half of this year, exported 265,500 tons of
products worth 72.5 million US dollars, up 148 percent and 165
percent from the same period in 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
It has allocated two billion yuan to upgrade equipment to
manufacture ethylene, PTA, and arene, 540 million of that for
ethylene equipment, 700 million for PTA equipment, and 720 million
for arene equipment.
</P>
<P>
The improvement project began in 1994 and took three years to
complete. The company has tried hard to work in line with local
conditions and use as little investment as possible to improve
production instead of simply expanding production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The measures include inviting experts from the United States to
examine upgrading plans or inviting experts from equipment
manufacturers to provide advice.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company has recovered 20 to 30 percent of its
investment on ethylene and PTA improvements, which were finished
in 1995 and 1996, respectively. All investment is expected to be
recovered within three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Arene production improvements will be finished by the end of
this year and investment is expected to be recovered in four years.
</P>
<P>
The value of the company's assets has doubled since 1990 to 19
billion yuan, and its asset-to-debt ratio dropped from 100 percent
to the present 44.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company made 590 million yuan in after-tax profits in the
first half of this year.

<P>
HELSINKI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An energy-saving week started
here today as winter sets in this Scandinavian country.
</P>
<P>
Finland has scant energy resources that can provide only 30
percent of the energy needed by the country. Since the oil crisis
in the 1970s, the government has adopted a series of policies,
trying to encourage people to explore every means possible to save
energy.
</P>
<P>
Timer-controlled lamps are used everywhere, in dwellers'
buildings or in public facilities. Central heating is now common,
in-house heating devices are smaller, and thermostats are widely
used that can be set to keep room temperatures stable.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 drivers of the city bus service have taken lessons
on how to save fuel, according to a staff member of the bus
service.
</P>
<P>
An energy-saving exhibition held concurrently with the
energy-saving week reminds people of the need to cultivate good
habits of turning off light upon leaving a place, and the need for
rational use of air-conditioners in public places.
</P>
<P>
computer users were advised to save energy at night and over
the weekend and people were told to replace old, energy-consuming
refrigerators at home.
</P>
<P>
A nation-wide campaign for energy saving will be underway. The
Trade and Industry Ministry will stage an energy-saving day
Thursday that will lay emphasis on techniques for less energy
consumption.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria To Sign National Minorities Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 6 (Xinhua) - Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov
will sign the Framework Convention on the Protection of National
Minorities at the Council of Europe summit on October 9-11 in
Strasbourg, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency (BTA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Before that, a draft of the translated declaration to the
convention will be read and reviewed in parliament by Foreign
Minister Mihailova along with the bill for its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers decided to sign the convention on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the convention will not change anything
inside Bulgaria, since the country is known for its tolerance to
ethnic groups whose rights are guaranteed by the constitution,"
Mihailova said. "But this would also give our country the moral
and legal justification to monitor the rights of Bulgarians
abroad."

In the first round, results showed that Prime Minister Milo

Meanwhile, Serbia's second round of elections also collapsed
Monday because of the less than 50 percent voter turnout necessary
to achieve a valid result. Only 47.5 percent of the 7.2 million
registered Serbian electorate voted.

In the first round of elections held on September 21, none of

<HEADLINE> Indo-U.S. Trade Dispute Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indo-U.S. trade dispute
continues and the United States has turned on the heat towards
India's trade curbs.
</P>
<P>
The United States has put on the agenda for the World Trade
Organization (WTO) October 16 meeting a request to set up a panel
to probe India's so-called quantitative restrictions (QRS) regime,
a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The American request came late on Friday (October 3) evening.
Indian officials had earlier said that October 6 was the deadline
for closing the agenda for the October 16 WTO meeting, but the
actual deadline should be October 3. The United States
deliberately put forward its request until the last day to make it
impossible for India to make a revised offer.
</P>
<P>
In its request, the United States has used the same words it
used two months ago when it complained to the WTO that India
continues to use a precarious balance of payments (BOP) situation
as an excuse to restrict imports when its BOP is no longer
threatened. As reported earlier, India's foreign reserves of 30
billion U.S. dollars make its BOP argument very weak.
</P>
<P>
The United States has indicated that the consultations with
India have not resulted in a mutually agreeable solution. It has
therefore sought the constitution of a panel whose ruling would be
legally binding.

<HEADLINE> Russia, India Discuss Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation between Russia
and India in military technology will not pose a threat to the
security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, Russian Defense
Minister Ignor Dmitriyevich Sergeyev said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev made the statement to the press after meeting with his
Indian counterpart Mulayam Singh Yadav, who arrived in Moscow
Monday on a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will not disturb the balance of forces in the
region, Sergeyev said, adding that Instead, it will help stabilize
the balance.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the cooperation is being conducted under
the year 2000 Military Technological Cooperation Plan between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also reached an agreement on the extension of the
plan's duration, the Russian minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mulayam said the relations between India and Russia are of
great significance to world peace.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers discussed solutions to the activities
of extremists in Central and Western Asia, including countries
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
The two sides shared the view on this issue, Mulayam said.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the Indian military delegation will also
negotiate the possibility of purchasing two submarines (about
800 million U.S. dollars each) and some other military equipment
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
India is a traditional importer of Russian weapons. From 1990
to 1996, It bought 3.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of weapons from
Russia.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Holds Conference on Global Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank opened today a
six-day conference on environment, during which Indonesia's forest
fires, the tempestuous effect of El Nino and the need for tougher
curbs on greenhouse gas emissions are major topics.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred of the world's scientists, government
ministers, economists, lawyers and environmentalists attended the
bank's Conference on Environmentally and Socially Sustainable
Development.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the conference, World Bank Group
President, James D. Wolfensohn, warned that unless the world moves
aggressively to safeguard its environment, and merges social,
environmental, and economic concerns together in charting a
sustainable global future, the lives of its children would suffer.
</P>
<P>
The conference will hold a series of related meetings on the
current state-of-health of the global environment, covering the
increasing evidence of climate change, the steady destruction of
the world's coral reefs, and the threat posed to forests and
farmland by poor environmental practices.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has noticed that despite the fact that many
countries have signed environmental treaties such as the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change and other agreements
governing seas and oceans, forests and hazardous waste, few
signatories have so far carried out their legal obligations.
</P>
<P>
A lack of shared interests between international scientists,
economists, and lawyers may be a key reason for this slow progress.
</P>
<P>
By convening the conference, the bank hopes to settle some
issues that prevent countries from living up to their existing
legal obligations and clear the way for new environmental
treaties.

<HEADLINE> Raging Fires in Indonesia Cause Heavy Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian government officials
estimated forest fires and haze in the country have caused heavy
losses.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Minister Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo disclosed Monday
that fires have razed at least 96,700 hectares of forests chalking
up an estimated 12.3 million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the forests lost, 70,200 hectares were
productive forests while the rest was protected and preserved
forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto said the
smoke caused by the fires, better known as the haze, has cost the
nation's airlines up to 5.4 million U.S. dollars in losses since
January.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 3,372 flights have been canceled during that period
with total opportunity loss damages reaching up to 5.4 million
U.S. dollars," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the smoke haze has also adversely affected land and sea
transportation, particularly in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya
islands, but he did not quantify the damages.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Sjarifuddin Baharsjah also said the
slash-and-burn methods for land clearing have affected a total
land area of 121,630 hectares in the country.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, plantation companies that are suspected of having
employed slash and burn methods to clear land have been given 15
days to deny causing any fires, which are the source of the smoke
haze that has blanketed parts of Indonesia and several other
nations in Southeast Asia, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Fires have occurred on 242 plantation companies' estates, he
said, adding that 29 of them were suspected of having burned to
clear land.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said earlier, thick smoke from fires
raging across 300,000 hectares of forest had been hanging over
Malaysia and Singapore during the past two months. At one stage it
also reached the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 30,000 people in Sumatra and Kalimantan, plus
tens of thousands in Malaysia and Singapore, have reportedly been
suffering from respiratory illnesses and eye irritations.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection in Unabomber Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jury selection for the trial
of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in
Sacramento, California, with an unprecedented number of nearly 600
prospective jurors to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that several hundred prospects may be eliminated
quickly because the trial and selection process could cause the
trial to last for six months, including the jury courtroom
selection, which is scheduled to begin November 12.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys are hopeful they can impanel 12 impartial jurors and
six alternates to decide the fate of Kaczynski, a 55-year-old
former college math instructor, who was arrested at a remote
Montana cabin last year, United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
He is charged in Sacramento with placing or mailing four bombs
that killed computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985 and timber
lobbyist Gilbert Murray in 1995, and with injuring two scientists
in the San Francisco Bay area and in Connecticut in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a
separate case in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell Jr. has ordered that
jurors' identities in the Sacramento trial be kept secret, but
said they won't be sequestered.

<HEADLINE> Prompt Action Against Cholera Epidemic in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's public health
authorities have taken prompt action to prevent the spreading of
cholera following the discovery of over 100 positive cases in a
fishing village at the north western coastal area of Chilaw
lately.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic began spreading about a week ago in the area,
which lies some 70 kilometers north of Colombo. It is believed
that the virus causing the disease has come from India after some
people returned from their pilgrim trip to the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Medical department sources said today that medical teams have
been sent to Chilaw to carry out a massive public health campaign
there. They are helping people chlorinate wells, burn rubbish and
clean hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Ice cream has been prohibited from selling in the area. In
hospitals, special wards have been set up to accommodate suspect
patients.
</P>
<P>
The area has a population of around 25,000 whose sanitary
conditions sometimes leave much to be desired, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Government's Budget Proposals Inadequate: Bertinotti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The government's proposals to
Communist Refoundation leaders in an attempt to win their support
for the 1998 draft budget and avoid a government crisis are
inadequate, party secretary Fausto Bertinotti said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget contained too many welfare cuts and not
enough measures to boost employment.
</P>
<P>
His party asked the government to "give a sign of equity" by
withdrawing its plan to cut big welfare spending from the draft
budget and by reducing or eliminating costs for certain types of
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Pensions and health care spending are among the key areas
targeted in the 5 trillion lire (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
welfare spending cuts called for in the budget.
</P>
<P>
This hard left party also demanded the government shorten the
working week from 40 to 35 hours and to create jobs in the south
where the unemployment rate is the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of the communist deputies in the lower
house, the Chamber of Deputies, Prime Minister Romano Prodi has
next to no chance of passing the budget, which is seen as vital to
Italy's hopes of joining the launch of a European single currency
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It may also trigger a vote of confidence. If Prodi fails in the
vote, he has to tender his resignation and bring down his 17-month
center-left government.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti's party commands less than 10 percent of the vote
but its 34 deputies hold the balance of power in the lower house
of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Step in Modernizing Air Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has decided that Boeing and
Airbus Industries will serve as its long-term suppliers to
modernize the state-run carrier Air Ukraine fleet.
</P>
<P>
Air Ukraine is planning to buy two long-range Boeing 76-200ER
and three medium-range Airbus 320-200 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The selection of two companies, announced as winners of a
tender in early May to supply aircraft to Air Ukraine, surprised
those who expected only one supplier to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts hailed the decision, but some of them said it
showed Ukraine's dependence on the world's major aviation
superpowers.
</P>
<P>
"By this decision, Ukrainian leaders killed two birds with one
stone," said Alexy Golub, an aviation industry analyst with Den
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
First, it is good because the current condition of Ukraine's
flagship carriers could cause much harm to the nation's future
image, said Golub.
</P>
<P>
Second, Golub said, refusal to buy either Boeing or Airbus
would automatically bury the number of joint projects that are
currently under way between Ukraine and other international
aircraft companies.
</P>
<P>
Defending the forthcoming purchase, Air Ukriane officials
contend the new planes will be more efficient and will consume
less fuel than the present fleet made by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine's aircraft fleet is already very old. It's almost
impossible to penetrate the international market with our outdated
Tu-134s and Il-62s," Vatily Gusin, an Air Ukraine official, said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the shortage of spare parts supplied by enterprises in
other CIS countries, Air Ukraine, with 12,000 employees, has
grounded about 40 percent of its 250 aircraft, most of which are
Illiushin-62s and Tupolev-134s produced in the days of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Since Ukraine, which failed to inherit any of the Il-80s, a
huge 350-seat jumbo jet made in the former Soviet Union, is still
using Il-62s on international routes, which, Golub complained, are
very inefficient economically due to high fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
"One Il-62 consumes 150 percent more fuel than a similar-sized
Boeing, which makes our current trans-Atlantic routes
unprofitable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can hardly attract passengers with the Il-62 aircraft. That
is why we need the new planes," he added
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Il-62s do not meet safety standards of many
countries, including the United States, and face future
prohibitions on landing rights.

MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measured 6.8 on the
Richter scale hit the southern Philippines Monday night,
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said

Siargao Island, Surigao del Norte province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
An initial report by the PHIVOLCS said the quake was felt in
nearby areas, however, no casualties and property damage were
reported. Some Aftershocks are expected.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale shook the
nearby area earlier the same day, the PHIVOLCS said, adding no one
was killed or wounded in the jolt.

<HEADLINE> Canada Gets No Assurances From Israel on Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today it has got no assurances that Israel will not use Canadian
passports for covert operations in the future.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Israel has given any assurances that it will not
use Canadian passports again, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy replied: "Not at this stage, no."
</P>
<P>
Khaled Meshal, political chief of the militant Islamic group
Hamas, was assaulted outside his office in Amman, Jordan, on
September 25.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers, carrying Canadian passports, were arrested
and proven to be agents of Israel's secret service Mossad.
</P>
<P>
The two agents returned to Israel this afternoon, in exchange
for the release of a Hamas leader, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Axworthy spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy on the phone about the passport incident.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Levy expressed to Axworthy his "very
deep regret" at the use of Canadian passports by two Israeli
agents in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Levy promised his Canadian counterpart that Israel will
investigate into the assassination attempt and that Canada will
receive a report on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canada recalled its ambassador to Israel to protest
the use of forged Canadian passports by the two agents.
</P>
<P>
The latest passport incident apparently broke a tacit agreement
between Canada and Israel that the latter would bar its secret
service from using Canadian passports after they were caught doing
so in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Italy: No Interference Intended in Algeria's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy's expressed readiness to
contribute to finding a solution to the crisis in Algeria, even by
acting as a mediator between the opposing sides, should have been
seen as a gesture of friendship and not an attempt to interfere in
Algeria's internal affairs, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dini's remarks came in response to a call Sunday by the
Algerian Foreign Ministry to Italy's ambassador, who was asked to
explain comments Dini made Saturday in Palermo, when he said: "We
cannot just sit and watch the tragedy in Algeria, we have a moral
responsibility to do something.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that our proposal was not directed at the
government but at those responsible for the massacres," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
"Italy knows that this is the way it is, that the Algerians
think they can resolve the problem by themselves. But after the
recent massacres, we thought that it might be possible to bring
together those forces which have abandoned or who claim they are
against the use of violence."
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed any further initiatives will only be possible
"when Algeria shows its readiness."

<HEADLINE> China To Expand Qaidam Basin Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China has drafted a strategy for
the large-scale development of natural resources in the Qaidam
basin as part of an effort to promote economic revitalization in
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the establishment of a fund for developing
potash mineral resources in the Qaidam Basin in northwest China's
Qinghai Province. This will be one of China's first special funds
for an individual project.
</P>
<P>
"This marks an important step for expanding development in the
Qaidam basin," according to a high-ranking official with the
Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Plant, the largest plant of its kind in
the country.
</P>
<P>
China currently faces a severe shortage of potash resources,
and has to spend more than one billion yuan (160 million US
dollars) to import potash fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin, which covers 256,000 sq.km., is home to 97
percent of China's total potash reserves which have not yet been
fully developed due to insufficient funding and outdated
technology.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop the basin into the country's major
production base for potash fertilizer in order to meet the
increasing demands of rapid agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Plant will
have an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons by the end of
the century, with second phase output expected to hit 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Developing potash resources is only one aspect of China's
overall development plan," according to the official. He pointed
out that the basin leads the country in reserves of more than 30
minerals.

<P>
The basin's reserves of lepidolite and magnesite rank first in
the country, with the future development of reserves expected to
provide substantial economic benefits to the region.
</P>
<P>
feasibility research has been carried out for the exploration
and use of lepidolite resources, and a magnesite plant with an
annual capacity of 3,000 tons is currently under construction.
</P>
<P>
China is actively seeking cooperative partners to introduce
capital and expertise in promoting further development of the
basin.
</P>
<P>
The basin's ideal composition and high quality resourced have
also promoted development. Qaidam has large reserves of various
types of precious minerals, including nonferrous metal, as well as
readily exploitable reserves of oil, natural gas, water and
hydropower.
</P>
<P>
China has drafted policies to provide financial support for the
construction of a group of resource-oriented enterprises in the
region, with emphasis to be placed on infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Golmud, located in the central part of the basin, has been
transformed into an important traffic hub in western China, with
the construction of the railway line linking the Qinghai and Tibet
autonomous regions listed as a priority project.
</P>
<P>
The basin's installed power generating capacity now stands
70,000 kilowatts, and a new microwave telecommunications system
linking the provincial capital of Xining and Golmud has entered
operations.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the Qaidam Basin will be transformed
into China's largest base for chemicals, petrochemicals, natural
gas and nonferrous metals, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Intervenes as Rupiah Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah plunged to
another new low Monday dropping to 3,850 against the U.S. dollar
at midday before easing in the afternoon due to Bank Indonesia's
intervention, currency dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
The dealers said the central bank intervened in the spot market
with some 200 million U.S. dollars, which helped prop up the
rupiah to close at 3,710/25 against the opening of 3,725/35.
</P>
<P>
The worsening currency market also perforated trading
activities on the Jakarta Stock Exchange with the main price gauge
falling by 2.58 points to close at 512.89.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers attributed the persistent weakening of the
rupiah to the high demand for dollar from local companies to
refinance their dollar-denominated debt as well as the weak
regional currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said Monday that
the government will not set artificial targets for the rupiah but
will intervene in extraordinary circumstances to save it from
falling further.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing currency crisis, he said, the government
would maintain its free foreign exchange regime.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has plunged 35 percent against the dollar since
early July, with most of the tumble occurring after the government
floated the currency in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Meordiono, who met with President Soeharto Monday, also said
the president called for cooperation between the government, the
private sector and banks to deal with the country's monetary
crisis.

that country, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Perron tendered his resignation and will return to Canada,
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said today.

In an interview with a Mexican magazine, the Canadian diplomat

The Mexican government's war on drugs is a sham and that

<P>
"The remarks made by Ambassador Perron, he recognizes, are
inappropriate for a diplomatic representative," Axworthy said.

"He's taken the proper steps and I don't think it will in any

JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Another 151 drought-related
deaths have been reported in Indonesia's easternmost province of
Irian Jaya, lifting the toll to at least 413.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures were provided by officials of Jayawijaya

<HEADLINE> Two Percent Volatility Band Set for Philippine Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines has decided to impose a two-percent volatility band on
the peso-U.S. dollar trading starting today.
</P>
<P>
Deogracias Vistan, president of the association, said the move
would foil speculative attacks on the peso amid the Southeast
Asian currency turmoil which had pulled the peso to unreasonable
levels.
</P>
<P>
If the peso fluctuates over two percent beyond the reference
rate, trading will be suspended for 30 minutes, Vistan said,
adding if the peso continues to fluctuate even after the
suspension, the band would be narrowed down to one percent upon
resumption of trading.
</P>
<P>
If after three suspensions, the peso still fluctuates beyond
one percent, the association will suspend trading for the day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So the rate will not move more than four percent in a day,
either up or down," Vistan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the volatility band would not hamper trading but only
temper wild fluctuations caused in moments of panic.
</P>
<P>
The peso has been battered and devaluated by 31 percent in the
regional currency woes, falling to a new low of 34.926 pesos to
one dollar on Monday's trading.
</P>
<P>
The Bankers Association, which earlier had a volatility band of
1.5 percent, was forced to abandon it on July 11 after the sharp
fall of the peso and other currencies in the region.

BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn will pay a two-day official visit to Myanmar later this
month in a bid to strengthen bilateral relations while mending
ties between Myanmar and the European Union, according to
Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Saroj Chavanaviraj.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Thailand and Myanmar will top the agenda,
but relations between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and other regional grouping will be given high priority
during October 29-30 talks between Prachuab and his Myanmar
counterpart Ohn Gyaw, Saroj was quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos were admitted into ASEAN in July. But, the
15-nation EU made clear its stance not to include Myanmar into a
1980 ASEAN-EU cooperation agreement which offers trade and
training benefits.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently plays a role as a coordinator between ASEAN
and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Saroj said ASEAN foreign ministers agreed, during their
informal meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations' Assembly
on September 24 in New York, that no ASEAN members should be
excluded from that inter-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We(ASEAN) will uphold our principle that all ASEAN members are
subject to the (ASEAN-EU) agreement because it is a bloc-to-bloc
agreement," Saroj said.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab is expected to covey ASEAN's position when he meets
Manuel Marin, the European Commission's vice president who is in
charge of the EU's external economic cooperation, during his
official visit to Belgium on October 16.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab will also visit Spain for three days from October 13

"Large numbers of yaks formerly died during the harsh cold
winters in Tibet. Treasures turned to waste," according to
Professor Zhang, director of the Intl. Yak Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan yaks will enter both the domestic and international
markets. Tibet plans to establish an yak industry stock company in
the near future to develop the international market.
</P>
<P>
The "Mad Cow" epidemic in Britain, which alarmed European beef
lovers, has presented an excellent opportunity for Tibetan yaks to
enter the world market.
</P>
<P>
A symposium on the yak industry development will be held in
Tibet next Spring, according to the Tibetan Agriculture and Animal
Husbandry Department.

<HEADLINE> NZ Registers Record Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's current account
deficit reached a record of 6 billion dollars (3.84 billion U.S.
dollars) by the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
This came as a result of the 2.2 billion-dollar (1.4 billion
U.S. dollars) deficit recorded in the second quarter this year,
including 563 million dollars (360 million U.S. dollars) spent on
the purchase of the Australian-built frigate "Te Kaha", said
Statistics New Zealand in a press release received today.
</P>
<P>
The current account, also called the balance of payments,
measures a country's total income and spending. A deficit means
New Zealand is sending more money overseas than it is bringing in.
</P>
<P>
As a percentage of GDP, the current account deficit for the
year ending June 1997 was 6.4 percent, compared with 4.8 percent
for the March 1997 year and 3.7 percent for the June 1996 year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics NZ blamed falls in all of the invisible components -
 services, investment income and transfers- for the rise in the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The services balance declined due to lower growth in the number
of inbound tourists and their spending. Net investment income has
continued to fall with mixed returns on overseas investments.
Lower inflows of migrants and their funds contributed to a lower
transfers balance, according to Statistics NZ.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Reservoir to Become China's Largest Fishpond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality will
turn the Three Gorges reservoir area into China's largest fishpond
using box-like nets.
</P>
<P>
The city, which faces the Yangtze River but has a limited
supply of fish, initiated a technique in 1989 to raise fish in
large nets, which ensured 200-300 kg of fish yield per square
meter.
</P>
<P>
The damming of the river for the Three Gorges reservoir offers
Chongqing good opportunities to breed fish on a larger and more
intensive scale, as the project will help form a water area of
more than 1,000 sq. km.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of the water area can be used for fish raising,
said Sun Pengshou, director of the city's Aquatics Science and
Technology Spreading Station, adding that the new method will take
the place of pond and paddy field fish-raising in the city.
</P>
<P>
The heavy water flow, high flow speed and high silt content
have hindered the development of the new method in the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the damming project has unveiled bright prospects, as
it will make it possible to have a stable water flow and also
regular runoff, which are especially helpful in fish raising.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Opens New Drug Rehabilitation Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fuzhou, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A new drug rehabilitation center
in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province. is currently
providing compulsory rehabilitation and education to 74 drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou has introduced strong measures to crack down on
drug-related crime and is extending greater efforts to reinforce
drug rehabilitation drive. The city allocated special funds of
some 2.8 million yuan (343,400 US dollars) in 1997 to establish
the drug rehabilitation center, which covers 2,000 sq.m. and has
300 beds. The center restricts the movement of addicts as part of
the rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
The Fuzhou city government considers drug control as an
important aspect in achieving security and social stability. The
government fully supports all public security departments and has
achieved significant progress in eliminating drug cultivation,
consumption and trafficking. Statistics show that 705 narcotics
cases have been prosecuted, with the arrest of 1,494 producers of
illegal drugs, traffickers and addicts leading to the confiscation
of 207.3 kilogram heroin, 8.4 kilogram opium and 415.8 kilogram
ice.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Atlantis Returns to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Space shuttle Atlantis
returned to Earth today, bringing home American astronaut Michael
Foale after a tumultuous four and a half months aboard Russia's
Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis swooped through a hazy sky and landed at Kennedy Space
Center shortly before 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Thick clouds had prevented Atlantis from landing on Sunday. The
U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) closedly
watched the clouds and wind throughout the afternoon before
finally ordering the seven-member crew the go-ahead to land.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Atlantis rolled to a safe stop, Rhonda Foale, wife
of Michael Foale, gathered near the runway with her two children
and about 400 other well-wishers. She waited cheerfully to welcome
her husband, who has left her to the space for 145 days.
</P>
<P>
Foale, a 40-year-old British-born astrophysicist, moved from
the battered Mir into Atlantis on September 28, one day after the
shuttle arrived with his replacement, a new computer, patches for
holes punched in the hull by a colliding cargo ship, and other
urgently needed supplies.
</P>
<P>
Foale was replaced by American astronaut-physician David Wolf,
to stay in Mir for another four months.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Deepened Partnership to Improve Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on all member states and all people to
deepen the partnerships to improve the quality of life in all the
world's cities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of World Habitat Day, October 6, 1997,
the U.N. chief said that human beings continued to face a
compelling challenge: how to make cities fit places to live, work
and dream.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that nearly one half the world's
population now lives in urban areas and two-thirds of the world
population would be city dwellers. Already straining under the
pressures of meeting their peoples' needs for housing, jobs and
basic services, cities must be also addressing the environmental
and social consequences of rapid urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Annan said cities and towns were engines of progress, the
source of much of the world's cultural, intellectual, educational
and technological achievements and innovations. However, the
stress of rapid urban population growth was often overwhelming,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that despite growing investments,
more than one third of the urban population were living in
substandard housing and 40 percent of urban dwellers had no access
to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation. These and other
common problems -- such as declining infrastructure, congestion,
pollution and crime -- were not only threatening the economic
potential of cities, but also social cohesion and political
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said World Habitat Day this year should be an opportunity
for people everywhere to continue looking at how they could
contribute to implementation of the Habitat Agenda -- the
comprehensive blueprint for creating sustainable human settlements
in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Information and Culture Woldemichael Chemu said today the ever
increasing loss of heritages can be attributed to nothing but
lack of effective control and protection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a training course prepared for regional heritage
experts, the minister said the existing condition in the loss of
heritages is very shameful for the generation and could gradually
dwindle the country's heritages.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that every one should stand against such threat.
</P>
<P>
In order to preserve heritages in a proper manner, it is
necessary to identify them in their type and their present
condition and have a tight protection, Chemu said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that it is decisive to build the capacity
of regions to accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
He also said the training program is prepared to develop the
capacity of trained manpower in the field.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Firmly Against EU Farm Policy Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- German Agriculture Minister Jochen
Bochert today stressed Germany's firm opposition to European Union
(EU) plans to reduce farm subsidies and price supports, saying the
move would cause the income of German farmers to drop by 15 to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The plans "would lead to a situation in which our agricultural
producers would be confronted even more strongly by cheaper
producers from outside of the Union," Bochert told the newspaper
Die Welt in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The EU is considering proposals to reduce its set prices for
grain, beef and milk by 10 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Farm subsidies are estimated to account for just under 50
percent of the EU's 90 billion ECU (100 billion U.S. dollar) budget
this year.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has also complained that while Germany was paying 20
billion marks (11 billion dollars) a year for EU agriculture, it
only got back 11 billion marks (6.05 billion dollars) in this
sector.

<HEADLINE> UN Report: 45 Percent of Africans Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report distributed here
said that 45 percent of Africans are now living in poverty, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 U.N. report on human development said poverty is
posing a serious threat to socio-economic stability on the African
continent, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The African region along with south Asia now emerges as the
worst poverty-stricken spots on the world map, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, per capita share of gross national
product (GNP) dropped to 21 percent on average during 1981-1989
period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It singled out Gabon as the hardest hit, with the average per
capita income shrinking by 58 percent. Nigeria followed with 50
percent drop and Cote d'Ivoire with 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in Mozambique and Niger also regressed by 30
percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
In another report, MENA said the number of the poor in Africa
had increased by two-thirds in a span of 15 years between
1970-1985 and is expected to hit 265 million people over the
coming three years.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with a population of 700 million, is the third most
populous continent in the world, after Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Satisfied with Progress in Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Jose Lamego said today his
government is "satisfied" with the recent progress in the Angolan
Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to the press here after attending a
meeting of the Joint Commission of the Angolan peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lamego said, institutions of national authority
were re-established in two major strategic regions previously
occupied by the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), namely Negage city of the Uige province in the
north, and Kuango city of the diamond-producing Lunda-Norte
province in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the secretary, is a major step forward
toward the peace process, which indicates the wishes by the two
signatories of the Lusaka Peace Accord in 1994 to consolidate
peace.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, as one of the observer countries, he added, is very
"satisfied" with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Lamego also disclosed that Prime Minister Antonio Guierres
will pay an official visit to Angola on October 20-24. This will
be his first visit to Angola, which is also an important visit
this year.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit, Lamego noted, is to pledge
Portugal's support to the Angolan peace process and to enhance
the friendly ties of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said he was regretted to say that during the
forthcoming visit, the premier cannot meet UNITA chief Jonas
Savimbi as he is not in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Lamego arrived here today to start a three-day visit in
Angola, which is aimed to make arrangements for Guierres' coming
visit.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Rejects Interference in Its Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Attaf reiterated here today Algeria's rejection of any attempt to
interfere in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here today, Attaf said that
circulating reports about prospective foreign interference in
Algeria's internal affairs had "greater media weight rather than
political significance."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the few voices which call for
internationalization of the Algerian case were isolated voices
which have no impact on the course of events in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian people and government had categorically rejected
any such attempt in this direction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Attaf said that the international community acknowledges the
existence of strong establishments in Algeria capable of handling
the affairs of the state, and that the destiny of the nation is a
matter of concern to the Algerians alone.
</P>
<P>
Several western powers have recently expressed the desire to
internationalize the Algerian case under the pretext of escalated
terrorist acts throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 people have been reportedly killed since the
Algerian government in January 1992 scrapped a general election
dominated by the radical Islamic Salvation Front.

<HEADLINE> W. Nigerian City Put Among "Sustainable Cities" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ibadan, the capital of west
Nigeria's Oyo state, has been selected as one of the 12 cities
worldwide chosen as demonstration projects in the United
Nations-sponsored "sustainable cities program".
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Nigeria's Minister of Works and
Housing Major-General Abdulkarim Adisa in an address to mark the
World Habitat Day in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the project would practicalize the concept
of sustainable development by finding effective and realistic
solutions to the serious environmental problems facing Ibadan,
the second largest city in west Nigeria next to the national
economic center of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
A replication was being considered for Kano in the north and
Enugu in the south, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a remedial program tagged Unban
Basic Services (UBS) had also been initiated with the assistance
of the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the program was set at "contributing to
the alleviation of poverty both in terms of income and basic
services, thus reducing the incidence of children at risk," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's largest cities, including Lagos, Ibadan, Onitsha,
Port Harcourt, Kano and Kaduna, had been selected to implement
the UBS program, the minister said, adding that 72 slum areas, at
a rate of 12 slum areas per city, would be rehabilitated over the
five-year period up to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The government had set the goal of promoting awareness on
population problems and the effects of rapid population growth on
development within the frame of the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
The government would also ensure that urban families could
have access to low interest housing loans.
</P>
<P>
In the last one year, the minister said, the federal
government staff housing board had disbursed over 25 million
Naira (about 300,000 U.S. Dollars) as housing loans to federal
civil servants at four percent interest rate.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Issue New Currency: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada today announced that the nation will change its currency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint meeting of the houses of People's
Representatives and Federation, the president said it is high
time the currency is changed.
</P>
<P>
He said, as the Eritrean government which had been using the
Birr currency has recently issued its own currency, this is one
of the factors that reciprocated the change.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a new currency will avoid problems which
might arise from the launching of the new Eritrean currency, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gidada said the change is important also because the symbols
that are on the bank notes are not consistent with the
constitution, adding that ''we need symbols and logos that are in
consistence with the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
The necessary measures have been taken to avoid complications
that could occur when the new currency enters into it full force,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the people to continue to use the Birr
until the new currency is issued, and said the details of the
conversion will be made public soon by the government.
</P>
<P>
The currency Birr which is used in Ethiopia was issued during
the former Mengistu regime. Eritrea announced its independence
from Ethiopia in 1993 and issued its own currency Naqfa last
August.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has Right to Fight Against Hamas: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel has the right to fight
against the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) at any time in a
bid to protect its civilians from terror attacks, an Israeli
security official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing held in the Israeli Government Press Office,
Hared Gadi, a member of the bureau for counter-terrorism in Prime
Minister Office, told reporters that Israel "holds the right to
fight against Hamas, to fight against the terror activities, and
to limit the option of terror activities whenever they are."
</P>
<P>
Gadi's remarks on Hamas indicated that the Israeli government
would not change its stance on fighting terrorism after it allowed
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Hamas, to return to the Gaza
Strip and released 20 Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas is an organization, which waves the flag to fight
against Israel in all places without choosing targets. It's
hitting and targeting whenever it is possible when it likes to
do it, never mind it is military or civil target, women or
children," said Gadi, commenting on the recent suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem, which killed more than 20 Israeli
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the failed attack on Hamas political leader
Khaled Mashal in Amman, Gadi said that Hamas in Jordan has
existed for a long time and all the efforts which have been done
to minimize the Hamas presence in Jordan were not successful.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hamas in Jordan is not a political party but
headquarters that sends orders, manpower and weaponry to the cells
of Hamas in Israel and tell them when, how and to what limit
to execute terror activities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the release of Yassin last Wednesday, Gadi said
that his release was arranged "under pressure and due to the
current circumstances."

<HEADLINE> Minister on Housing Shortage in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian
government official has appealed for making greater investment
and implementing birth control policy so as to ease shortage of
housing.
</P>
<P>
The annual supply for housing in Tanzania is 20 percent lower
than demand, Gideon Cheyo, Minister for Lands and Human
Settlement Development, told an international conference which
opens here today.
</P>
<P>
Cheyo said in a speech, read by his deputy Mohamed Mudhihir,
human settlements conditions in developing countries have been
deteriorating because of the little investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
For example, only 5.6 percent of central government
expenditure in developing countries went to housing, social
security and welfare, compared with 39 percent in developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheyo said high population growth rate has somehow
contributed to the high demand of housing in many countries,
including Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The growth of population need "proper planning and
management," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that better housing is a pre-condition for
better social life and proper planning can ensure better housing
conditions and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by 100 participants, is held on
planning legislation, housing and environment in Africa. Similar
conferences have been held in Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Calls for UN Pressure in Resolving Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides today renewed his call on the international
community to help resolve the long-standing Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
"It is with great regret that once again in addressing the
General Assembly, I have to report that no progress has been made
towards the solution of the Cyprus problem due to the
inflexibility of the Turkish side," Clerides said in the general
debate of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He asked the international community to draw attention to the
Cyprus problem and appealed to the U.N. Security Council to use
"all means in its power to persuade the Turkish side to abandon
(its) intransigent position."
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided
into the North and South since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the island to protect the Turkish minority following a failed coup
by the Greek military officers allied with the junta then ruling
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been making efforts for a long time for
the peaceful reunification of the island nation. U.N.-brokered
talks between Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
broke down in August after the European Union reaffirmed that it
would begin talks with the Greek-led Cypriot government on EU
membership. Denktash wants Turkey to join the EU too.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said that they believe the Greek Cypriots
would offer no new proposals to resolve the dispute until after
the Greek Cypriot presidential elections next year.

<HEADLINE> Angola's C. Bank Sells Dollars to Stablize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola National Bank has been
selling a large sum of U.S. Dollars twice recently in a bid to
reverse the depreciation of its currency Kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that due to a recent shortage of foreign
currencies in Angola's monetary market and the local currency,
Readjusted Kwanza has been increasingly depreciating.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the trend, the National Bank dumped 45 million
Dollars on Saturday to its commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The money, which is to be used mainly by industrial sectors,
includes nearly four million Dollars for import substitution of
the industrial products, one million for maize, four million for
animal husbandry, 12 million for industrial development and the
rest for free trade in financial market.
</P>
<P>
Emanuel Carneiro, Minister of Planning, said after the
dollar-sale ceremony, that the Angolan government is working hard
to achieve social and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the stability of macro-economy cannot be
obtained without the help of entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose for the Central Bank to sell U.S. Dollars is
to build up an atmosphere of trust so that all Angolans are
confident to participate in the development of national economy.
</P>
<P>
The selling of Dollars this time by the National Bank has
contributed much to stablizing the exchange rate between
Readjusted Kwanza and foreign currencies. Today's exchange rates
between Readjusted Kwanza and major foreign currencies remained
the same level as during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the National Bank will once again sell a
large amount of Dollar on October 10 to further stabilize the
local currency.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today held talks with a visiting British minister on closer
ties here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
His discussions with British Secretary of State for
International Development Claire Short centered on bilateral
relations including aid and eradication of poverty in the east
African country, the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that the subjects were with his feelings
especially with regard to their social dimensions.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is doing her best in this regard, said Moi, adding that
Kenyans have recently collected 570 million Kenyan Shillings
(about 9 million U.S. Dollars) for youth development fund and 845
million Shillings (about 13.6 million Dollars) for women
development fund.
</P>
<P>
The British minister who arrived here today for a one-day
visit, said he is optimistic that eradication of poverty in
countries could be achieved through working together with the
governments as equal partners.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, a former British colony, and Britain enjoy strong
economic, political, military and cultural links, with the latter
expected to spend about 48 million Dollars on aid projects in
Kenya this year.
</P>
<P>
Short, who is on a five-day visit to east Africa, is scheduled
to spend two days in Uganda and another two in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
She announced no new aid in Kenya but Britain is due to grant
an extra 32 million Dollars for primary education in Uganda.

Russia in the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Justice Department said

Those arrested were: Kurt Alan Stand, 42, of Washington, D.C.,
who works for a union representing food, hotel and other workers;
his wife Theresa Squillacote, 39, who until January was a senior
staff attorney in the office for a deputy undersecretary of

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government, KNUT Resume talks on Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
resumed talks with the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) in
a bid to end the on-going nationwide teachers' strike starting
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government today issued a statement, advising
all teachers currently participating in the illegal strike to
report back to their duty stations by 8:00 a.m. on October 8.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph
Kamotho said those who fail to report to work would be deemed to
have deserted duty and that disciplinary measures would be taken
against such teachers.
</P>
<P>
The teachers who will report for duty as required will not be
victimized for the period they have been on strike, it added.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo said last week that the
nationwide strike by 200,000 primary and secondary school
teachers would continue until a breakthrough was achieved.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union is demanding a salary increase ranging
between 150 and 200 percent while the government has agreed to
give a salary increase ranging between 10 and 28 percent plus
allowance increment of between 15 and 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Labor Minister Philip Masinde noted last week that the
government could not meet the demands raised by the union, noting
that the higher salaries would amount to 89 billion Shillings
(about 1.4 billion Dollars) a year, or 56 percent of the total
government revenue.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Kenyan government could not
reasonably be expected to devote more than half of its budget to
paying teachers.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that teachers are too essential to
relegate them to the periphery of national concerns, in other
words, ways must be found to pay them a decent salary so that
they can function as real professionals.

UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani Foreign
Minister Hassan A. Hassanov stressed here today that one of the
directions for the UN reform must be strengthening of the UN
activity in the field of coordination of international cooperation
for development.
</P>

Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assemble, the

He said his country believed that strengthening of coordination
in the activities of various agencies would add to the efficiency
of the operative development activities of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Elaboration of a complex strategy of the activities of
specialized agencies vis-a-vis the recipient countries,
elimination of the overlap of functions and programs,
concentration on the priority tasks, improvement of the
partnership mechanism with state institutions and non-governmental
organizations of the UN member states would help achieve this
goal, the foreign minister added.

<HEADLINE> Two-Thirds of States Fail to Meet Child Support Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Two-thirds of the states in
the United States failed to meet a deadline to install computer
systems tracking child support, with one-third facing massive
fines.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a week after the October 1 deadline, 33 state systems
have not been certified as complete by federal inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 16 states are ready to be certified, said Michael
Kharfen, spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS).
</P>
<P>
That leaves 17 states, representing nearly half the nation's
child support cases, with systems that are not even near
completion.
</P>
<P>
The computerized systems are important because one-third of all
child support cases involve an out-of-state parent, and the
automated systems should help find parents who move from state to
state. They'll also help track in-state cases by making a wealth
of employment and other information about parents available
electronically.
</P>
<P>
States have spent 2.6 billion dollars on the task since 1980,
when Congress agreed to pay for 90 percent of the cost of
computerization.
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires HHS to cut all child support funding to
states without working child support collection systems.
</P>
<P>
In addition, without a working child support system, a state is
also in jeopardy of losing its entire federal welfare grant.
</P>
<P>
No fines are expected until mid-1998, after a series of
reports, reviews and appeals are completed.
</P>
<P>
State officials are reportedly lobbying for a second deadline
extension by Congress.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Founder: No Ceasefire with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Founder of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmad Yassin said here today
that there would be no cease-fire between his group and Israel
until Israel withdrew from all the occupied Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Yassin made the remarks during the first ever press
conference five days after he was released from Israeli prison
and just before he was flown from here this afternoon in a
Jordanian helicopter to his home in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians refused to stay under occupation and would
do their best in a positive way to "dismiss occupation," said
Yassin, who was allowed to go home after Jordan released two
alleged special agents from Israeli secret service Mossad, who
attempted to kill a Hamas leader here last month.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had made a call for a cease-fire in Palestinian
attacks against Israelis, he said that "the cease-fire can't be
obtained until the occupation is over."
</P>
<P>
Yassin called on the international community to support the
Palestinians in their efforts to gain their freedom and realize
their dream of an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
"I would address the whole world and say that we are peace
seekers," he said. "We love peace. And we call on them to
maintain peace with us and to help us in order to restore our
right by means of peace."
</P>
<P>
Yassin was jailed by Israel in 1989 and had been expected to
serve a life sentence for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrilla
against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the release of himself was a good and positive
step and a good indicator for the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations which has been stalled since March this year when
Israel began to build the Har Homa settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is now
one of the only two Arab countries that conceived peace with the
Jewish state.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Central Inter-sectoral
Operation Group said today despite some obstacles, the first
phase of re-establishing national authority in areas occupied by
former rebel UNITA movement has produced "positive results".
</P>
<P>
The operation group made the conclusion at a meeting here with
the Joint Commission of the Angolan Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 101 UNITA-occupied regions
have been handed over to the central government in the first
phase, including 33 cities and 68 towns. Sixty others have not
accomplished the goal as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 37 members of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) have been appointed to the posts
of city mayor or vice mayor, and town chief or deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
Under the program passed by today's meeting, national
authority will be re-established in 172 more areas occupied by
the former rebel movement during the second phase starting
October 11.
</P>
<P>
The operation group believed that with the establishment of
local authority in UNITA-occupied areas, free movement of
personnel and cargo have been improved around the country.
Transport on the country's major highways has resumed to the
normal state. Furthermore, they said, nationwide tension will
disappear and stability will take its place.

<HEADLINE> US President Vetoes 38 Items in Military Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today used his line-item veto power to strike out 38 projects
worth 287 million U.S. dollars from a military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
"Government must continue to live within its means," Clinton
said in cutting the military outlays from the 9.2 billion U.S.
dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
The vetoed projects include a 19.9 million dollar plan to
build a new wharf for ship repair at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in
Virginia; a 17.9 million dollar pier improvement project at
Florida's Mayport Naval Station; a 16 million dollar railroad
project at Fort Carson, Colo.; four projects in California and
three in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an
angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction
projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of
specific congressmen and senators.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state was spared,
although six Mississippi projects were added to the military
construction bill. Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, home state of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will lose a 6.8 million dollar
combat search and training center if the president's veto is
upheld.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto, sought by U.S. presidents for more than a
century, gives the president the ability to cancel special
interest tax breaks as well as specific spending items that he
deems wasteful while avoiding killing the entire measure.
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time Clinton had exercised the line-item
veto authority, which went into effect in January.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chiefs of Staff Gather for Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of Staff from the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries gathered in Doha, Qatar
today to attend an annual meeting on strengthening regional
security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the 15th since the GCC was set up 17 years ago,
took place with a joint GCC naval exercises off the coast of
Bahrain which began Saturday and will last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, dubbed "Solidarity-5", came after Iran bombed
two Iranian rebel bases inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that Iran's air raids violated the
Western allies' no-fly zone over souther Iraq and it warned that
further violations would invite U.S. retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency said that during the meeting, the GCC
chiefs of staff will discuss the latest developments in the
region, and ways of strengthening GCC member states' defense
capabilities and further boosting military cooperation and
coordination among them.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and military alliance, was set
up in 1980. It groups Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the GCC states began seeking ways to
strengthen their self-defense capabilities by purchasing advanced
weapons and holding military exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, due to relatively limited human resources, the GCC
countries still remain seriously reliant on a large foreign
presence, particularly that of the U.S. and its western allies
to protect their security.

<HEADLINE> US: Israel Must Take Consequences of Assassinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States, irritated
with Israel over a botched assassination attempt on a Hamas
leader, said today that the Jewish state had to take account of
the consequences of its actions.
</P>
<P>
Two agents of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad attacked
Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal in Amman, the Jordanian
capital, on September 25 with a device that stunned him and
injected a poison into him.
</P>
<P>
Meshal's bodyguard and the Jordanian police caught the two
assailants, who were carrying Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
The botched assassination led to a complex swap, in which
Israel freed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last Monday who
then returned to Palestinian-ruled Gaza and Jordan released the
two suspected Israelis agents.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, avoiding direct
criticism of Israel for such terror-like assassination, suggested
Washington thought the affair had been mishandled.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis have the obligation to defend their people from
terrorist acts, and we are not in the habit of second guessing
Israel when it comes to her security," he said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"That said, we believe that Israel must take into account the
repercussions and consequences of any actions it takes in its
fight against terror," he added.
</P>
<P>
While refusing direct comment on the Israeli assassination,
Rubin noted that American agencies were prohibited by U.S. law
from carrying out assassinations. "Therefore we're opposed to
assassinations by other governments as well," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Action Against Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he is convinced that the threat of global warming is
real and carbon emissions must be cut to avoid a catastrophe for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
However, opening a White House conference on global warming,
Clinton said any reduction of green-house gases emissions should
be done through technology changes and rejected any new energy
taxes or other measures to make energy more costly.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by scientists, business groups and
environmentalists, was designed to gather support for the
administration's global warming policy.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is intended to sign a treaty on
climate change in Kyoto, Japan, in December while many U.S.
senators and businessmen have launched a campaign in recent weeks
against the move.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the science for climate change is real,"
Clinton told the conference held at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
"Although we do not know everything, what we do know is more
than enough to warrant action," Clinton said. "It would clearly
be a grave mistake to bury our heads into the sand and think the
issue will go away."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the U.S. must take a leadership role and be
prepared to commit to realistic and binding goals for reducing
heat-trapping greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, from
burning coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
"We must be prepared to commit to realistic and binding goals
on our emissions of greenhouse gases," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of the world's climate scientists have
concluded that if we don't cut our emission of greenhouse gases,
temperatures will rise and will disrupt the global climate. In
fact, most scientists say this process has already begun," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the conference said broad patterns of high
temperatures over the last several years were consistent with
computer predictions of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists have predicted that increased emissions of
"greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide from burning of fossil
fuels and other human activities, will trap heat in the atmosphere
and lead to a gradual increase in temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the conference the U.S. will ask at the Kyoto
conference for "meaningful, but equitable commitments" from all
nations, but he did not spell out in detail what the U.S. position
would be there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a recent news release that
mandatory cuts in energy use could cost the U.S. economy 277
billion U.S. dollars a year by the year 2010, and said many
developing countries may remain exempt from the limitations.
</P>
<P>
"The White House should not allow our country to be stampeded,"
the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
In a three full-page advertisement on the Washington Post
today, hundreds of economic and trade organizations signed a call
urging Clinton not to sign the global climate treaty in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
The call said that the treaty is "really one of the most
potentially damaging economic and trade agreements the U.S. will
ever be asked to sign."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Releases Alleged Israeli Agents Attacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan released this afternoon
two alleged Israeli agents and all the others detained for
attempting to kill a Hamas leader in Jordan last month, according
to senior Jordanian government officials.
</P>
<P>
The release was the result of "a good bargain" between Jordan
and Israel in exchange for the release of Hamas founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin by Israel on October 1, the officials who declined to
be named said.
</P>
<P>
Yasser, jailed by Israel in 1989 and expected to serve a life
sentence for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli
targets, arrived in the Gaza Strip this afternoon from Amman. He
was released on demand by Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
As part of the bargain, Israel also agreed to save the life of
Khaled Mashal, head of Hamas political bureau, by giving the
medicine that helped him defeat vomit and coma caused by the
attack against him by the two alleged special agents from Israeli
secret service Mossad.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, the two men attempted to kill Mashal in front
of his office, but were arrested following the failed attempt.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. Most Hamas political bureau members live
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is now
one of the two Arab countries that conceived peace with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Rains May Relieve Tanzania's Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- After a long spell of
drought, rain has finally started to fall in Tanzania, and it
may relieve the country's drought, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
The current rainfall recorded more than 170 millimeters from 9
am local time on Sunday to 9 am on Monday in Tanga, Zanzibar and
Dar es Salaam combined together, Noel Kamenya, acting
meteorological director general, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kamenya told reporters that Tanga recorded the highest,
120.0mm, followed by Zanzibar, 40.1 mm. Dar es Salaam has
received 3.0 mm at the airport and 14.0 mm at the port area.
</P>
<P>
The meteorology official explained that the current rain was
caused by disturbance of air over the sea.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he appealed to farmers to plant drought
resistant crops as it is still uncertain whether the rain will
last.
</P>
<P>
Kamenya said the water level in hydro-electrical power
stations remains unclear at present because water levels depend
on the amount of rainfall in key catchment basin.
</P>
<P>
People are waiting for more precipitation to give relief to a
power crisis in the country. Last Friday water level at the main
electricity-generating dam Mtera which fuels the major power
stations, was only 0.63 meters above the minimum level, dropping
to the lowest water level ever in the history.
</P>
<P>
The drought, influenced by the El Nino weather phenomenon
sweeping most of east Africa, has forced power cuts in some areas
of Tanzania which last for up to 15 hours a day and four times a
week.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel to Continue to Fight Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu vowed here this evening that his government
will continue to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after a special cabinet meeting,
Netanyahu said terrorism is still prevailing in this region and
the Israeli defense forces and security services will not only
defend the country but also fight against terror.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism must be wiped out and there will be no safe heaven
for terrorism," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu explained his government's success and "failure" in
fighting against terror, and said that the cabinet has decided
to set up a three-member committee to investigate the "failure",
which apparently refers to the failed attack by two agents of the
Israeli security services "Mossad" on Hamas leader Khaled Mashal
last week in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would resign after the committee found that
he is responsible for the failure, he shouted angrily that his
"sole responsibility" is to fight terror.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would not conduct any negotiation with
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which he described as
the main sources of terror.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet secretariat said this evening in a statement that
the three-member committee will examine all aspects related to
the Amman incident, both prior to, and during its occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The two agents, who conducted a bungled attack on Mashal on
September 25 in Amman and were arrested in Jordan, returned home
today after being released by the Jordanian police.
</P>
<P>
Their release was carried out under a deal reached by Israel
and Jordan, in exchange for Israel's release of Hamas spiritual
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and 20 other Hamas members jailed
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu admitted that this failed attack operation has
harmed Israel's relationship with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side will continue to explain further about
Israel's policy of fighting terror to Amman in order to improve
its relations with Jordan, the Israeli prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that Netanyahu so far does
not want to swallow the bitter outcome of the failed Amman
incident due to his hardline attitude, which would cause more
damage to Israel's international prestige.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had a meeting
today in New York to discuss the Cyprus problem and possible
developments in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency reported today that in statements to the
press, Clerides said he and Annan examined "where we stand today"
in the Cyprus question and possible developments until
presidential elections in Cyprus scheduled for February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president said he and Annan discussed a visit to
Cyprus by the secretary-general's special sdvisor on the Cyprus
problem, Diego Cordovez, but he added it is up to Cordovez to
decide the timing of his visit.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Manolis Christofides, who
accompanies Clerides, said Cordovez was likely to visit the island
in November.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez sponsored two rounds of peace talks between Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the U.N. chief agreed to appoint a new third
member to the U.N. Investigatory Committee for Missing Persons in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Denktash called on Annan to appoint a new
third member in an agreement to exchange information on the
missing reached in Nicosia in July.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Investigatory Committee for Missing Persons in
Cyprus was set up in 1981 and comprises of a Greek and a Turkish
Cypriot representative and a third member appointed by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative in the committee, Paul Wurth of the
International Red Cross Society, retired in 1996 and has not been
replaced since.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declines Comment on Israel's Failed Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday declined any comment on a botched assassination by the
Israeli intelligence service Mossad on a Hamas leader, only
saying U.S. policy forbids political assassinations.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after two Mossad agents were arrested in
Amman, the Jordanian capital, on Sept. 25 when they were attacking
Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal with a device that stunned
him and injected a poison into him.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the United States for our own conduct is and
has been I believe for more than 20 years, under presidents of
both parties, that we do not engage in assassinations," Clinton
told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
But when asked what was his comment on the failed Israeli
assassination, the president said: "Since the government of
Israel and the government of Jordan have made no comment about
this, I think it is inappropriate for me to make any comment."
</P>
<P>
"I can make no comment on what others did or did not do when
it had not been confirmed by either of the governments in
question," he added.
</P>
<P>
The botched assassination led to a complex swap in which,
Israel freed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last Monday who

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides today urged the international community to be more
actively involved in efforts for a Cyprus settlement, Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the
president said that "it is with great regret that once again I
have to report that no progress has been made toward the
solution of the Cyprus problem due to the inflexibility of the
Turkish side."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side, Clerides explained, refused to discuss the
substance of the problem during the latest round of U.N. talks
unless the European Union freezes plans for accession
negotiations with the government of the Republic of Cyprus in
accordance with its decision in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The clear conclusion to be drawn is that more active
involvement of the international community is needed, if talks
are to produce results," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed his firm resolve to secure the country's
defense and take decisions on its arms programs.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to make it abundantly clear that we cannot and will
not relinquish our inalienable right to defend our country and
decide about our armaments," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Turkish threat emanating from the continued
aggression and occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the
Republic exists, we have not only the right but also the duty to
provide for the security of the people of Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame arrived in Kinshasa today for his first visit to the
Democratic Republic of Congo to discuss the refugees issue, a
U.N. DHA release quoted Congo's state television as saying today.
</P>
<P>
An informed source in the Congolese capital said Kagame, who
led the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front to power in Kigali
in 1994, was to discuss the border situation with President L.
Kabila, who assumed power in May backed by Rwandan troops as
Kagame admitted.
</P>
<P>
Kagame made a brief statement in Kinshasa, saying he would
hold talks on "common problems to find solutions," notably
regarding tension arising from clashes between Rwandan troops and
Hutu rebels near the border and their repercussions for "the
situation in Goma (in eastern Congo) and other concerns."
</P>
<P>
Congolese Interior Minister Mwenze Kongolo announced yesterday
Congo (K) had found over 1,000 heavily-armed soldiers of the
former Rwandan Hutu-dominated army and their Interahamwe militia
allies in Equateur Province in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the soldiers were near
Mbandaka and holding an unspecified number of Rwandan refugees as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo added that they were dangerous and military action
would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
Earlier yesterday, Congo's Interior Ministry announced the
closure of its border with Rwanda, and the expulsion of more than
4,000 Rwandan refugees. And it also ordered the staff of the U.N.
refugees agency out of Goma in the eastern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Crete Meeting to Help Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Greek and
Turkish leaders on the island of Crete in early November might
help improve the relations between the two countries, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem are expected to hold talks with Greek leadership while
attending the forthcoming Balkan summit on the southern Greek
island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that "what remained from New York is the
ineffectiveness of the approach since, on the sole responsibility
of Turkey, there was no possibility for success."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that something would change in Turkey's policy so as
to make the Crete meeting "effective".
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have since early this year been trying hard
to improve their strained relations for decades, but the failure
of recent talks between the two countries' foreign ministers in
New York has shadowed the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Communication between the two countries continued to exist, he
said, adding that both Greece and Turkey were quite able to
formulate their respective policies.

WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States, while
avoiding criticizing Israel for its failed political
assassination, on Monday condemned Hamas as a "terrorist"
organization and demanded the Palestinian Authority to dismantle
its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Hamas remained "an enemy of peace (and) we are opposed to
Hamas for that reason and believe it is essential for its
terrorist infrastructure to be dismantled," State Department

When asked about the botched assassination of Hamas leader
Khaled Meshal in the Jordian capital of Amman on Sept. 25, by
two agents of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, Rubin
took care not to make any direct criticism.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis have the obligation to defend their people from

</P>
<P>
The spokesman just made remark in a very general term about
Israel's actions, saying Israel had to take the consequences of
any actions it had taken against the Palestinian organization.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Israel must take into account the
repercussions and consequences of any actions it takes in its
fight against terror," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Rubin was seeking to walk a line between U.S.
rock-solid support for Israel and its policies opposed to
terrorism, and to Hamas and to political assassination.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Islamic Party Vows to Fight for Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) vowed today that it will continue its struggle
against the call for its closure, according to the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press following the submission of RP's final
written defense to the Constitutional Court, RP parliamentary
group Deputy Chairman Temel Karamollaoglu said that it is
unreasonable to close RP, a legally established party.
</P>
<P>
Only those parties which are involved in unlawful actions
could be banned, Karamollaoglu said. He called on the
Constitutional Court to make a just decision on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be forgotten that those who pass judgement
will also one day be judged by history," the RP official noted.
</P>
<P>
RP submitted its final written defense to the court today,
the last day of the 30-day extension granted by the supreme
judicial body.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas filed a case with the
Constitutional Court in May demanding the closure of the
pro-Islamic RP on grounds that the RP, led by former prime
minister Necmettin Erbakan, had been encouraging the
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his party had long been criticized for their
reluctance to take tough measures against the rapidly growing
fundamentalists in the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
The RP is now preparing to make its verbal statement to the
court on a certain date to be determined by the Constitutional
Court.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's Party Law, Erbakan and some RP
officials will be banned from engaging in politics for at least
five years if the party is outlawed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Erbakan threatened that he would apply to the
European Court of Human Rights if the RP was closed on grounds of
anti-secularism charges.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President: Northern Iraq Used As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that northern Iraq has been used as a
terrorist base against Turkey, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on flight to Kuwait for a two-day
official visit, Demirel said outlawed Turkish militants are
making use of the uncontrolled area to threaten Turkey's border
security.
</P>
<P>
However, some Arab countries will protest loudly when the
Turkish troops enter northern Iraq to crack down on the outlawed
militants, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched military operations in northern
Iraq in the past two years to strike the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) bases.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by jets and
artillery fire, entered northern Iraq to attack the PKK camps,
touching off severe protest from the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and some Arab countries said that Turkey's action
inviolated Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging
immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
An earlier Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said that the
Turkish military had the right to do so if they thought it was
necessary, adding that the ongoing operation was only "a limited
and routine one."
</P>
<P>
More than 140 PKK rebels were killed in the latest Turkish
military incursion in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects Cyprus' Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today rejected a proposal by the Cypriot government on
a partial lifting of trade embargo against Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that the Cypriot government's recent proposal to
have limited trade with Turkish Cypriots was a game aimed at
facilitating Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU), the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposal, Turkish Cypriots' products have to be
approved by the Cypriot government, Denktash said, adding this
would mean a Greek Cypriots' influence in northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to the island
and took over the northern third of the eastern Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which has
deployed 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has been prohibiting its companies
from having trade relations with Turkish Cypriots and also
Turkey, a political, economic and military supporter of Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Cypriot government's proposal as meaningless,
Denktash stressed that Turkish Cypriots must strengthen their
relations with Turkey if they wants to defend their own interests.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots have been criticizing the Cypriot government's
plan to become an EU member country, saying it cannot represent
the interests of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Heroic Welcome Greets Hamas Leader's Return to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 cheering
Palestinians in Gaza today extended a heroic welcome to Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the radical
Islamic group Hamas, upon his return home.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, 61 and wheel chair-bound, was flown from Jordanian
capital Amman this afternoon in a Jordanian military helicopter
to a tumultuous welcome by cheering Palestinian residents and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) officials in the packed Gaza
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Posters and freshly painted slogan in the walls of buildings
congratulated the return of Yassin, who has been imprisoned by
Israel for nine years and was released to Jordan only last week
in a prisoner exchange deal reached between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat and his wife Soha were conspicuous
at the welcome ceremony waiting for Yassin's arrival. Arafat's
spokesman Marwan Kanafani told reporters that the PNA was pleased
with the return of the Hamas leader to his home in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PNA hoped that Yassin would join efforts to
strive to establish a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as
its capital. He added that the PNA is continuing dialogue with
not only Hamas but also other opposition groups in order to
achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Yassin's return to Gaza was a political
boost to the militant group and was in fact an awkward moment for
Arafat and the PNA, which had been kept in the dark over the deal
on releasing Yassin. Arafat has failed in his repeated attempts
to secure the release of Yassin in a bid to rein in the most
powerful opposition group in the territories.
</P>
<P>
And the popular Hamas leader's return is expected to increase
the difficulty for Arafat to conduct his ongoing crackdown on
the militant group that has been launching terror attacks
against Israel aimed at derailing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's release was reportedly part of a deal to release the
two alleged special agents from Israeli secret service Mossad,
who were detained for attempting to assassinate Hamas leader in
Jordan Khaled Mashal.
</P>
<P>
The two agents, holding forged Canadian passports, were
arrested after they attacked Mashal outside his Amman office and
injected poison into his face. But Mashal survived after being
treated in hospital, and the incident caused extensive damages
to the relations between Israel and both Jordan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Netanyahu had personally ordered the
attack against Mashal because he was considered to be the No.1
in the Hamas, who often gives orders to launch suicide bombing
attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was responsible for the July 30 twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market and the September 4 triple
bombings in the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, which killed 25
people and wounded over 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Yassin's arrival in Gaza, the two Israeli
agents returned to Israel under the Israeli-Jordannia deal. And
20 prisoners, 11 Palestinians and nine Jordanians, were released
from Israeli prisons apparently as part of the prisoner
swap. Israel Radio reported that 50 more Palestinian prisoners,
who were not involved in murders, would also be freed from jails
within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein reportedly spoke with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone this afternoon to
discuss Yassin's return to Gaza and the prisoner exchange, but
the Prime Minister's Office here denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who held a chaotic news conference before leaving
Amman, vowed to carry on Hamas' fight against Israel until the
end of Israeli occupation. He stressed that Israel must
recognize the rights of the Palestinians' return to their
homeland and release all Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader also called for the unity among all
Palestinians, as well as between Hamas and the PNA, in order to
fight for the establishment of a Palestinian state with East
Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Announce Resumption of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- After nearly seven months'
deadlock, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process will be formally
resumed Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian officials announced here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) here in the Laromme Hotel which was
attended by United States special peace envoy Dennis Ross, the
two sides announced to revive the negotiations of the nine joint
committees created to discuss the implementation of the Interim
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's meeting ...is the expression of mutual desire to
continue in our efforts to make progress to our mutual goal,
goal of peace between us," Levy told a tripartite news
conference held with Mazen and Ross after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that the two sides would make determined efforts to
advance the issues concerning the implementation of the Interim
Agreement in order to reach an agreement. He stressed that the
need to fight terrorism in order to create the atmosphere needed
to make progress.
</P>
<P>
"Our determination to advance the issues, to proceed, is also
intended to create the necessary atmosphere which stands firm in
opposition to terrorism, and our work together is giving
expression to that strong opposition against terror and create
the atmosphere needed for making peace between us," Levy added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mazen expressed appreciation for the role
played by the U.S. administration in bringing the two sides back
to negotiating table after the prolonged deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has been off the track for a long time,
and I say now it's time to revive it," he said, promising that
the PNA would honor its commitments to fighting terrorism in
order to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, I would reiterate our commitments to
activate our coordination and cooperation in all spheres,
including security sphere, and our efforts to combat violence
and terror, which are committed to Israelis and Palestinians,"
Mazen added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that both sides would discuss the urgent issues,
especially the "unilateral steps" taken by Israel, including the
settlement activities, confiscation of Palestinian land, and
demolition of Palestinian homes and revocation of ID cards of
Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"These issues constitute the basic principles and fundamental
basis to revive the peace process, and to give the peace process
a chance it deserves," Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
He demanded Israel implement the signed agreements according
to the prinicples stipulated by United National resolutions 242
and 338, and the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the agreements on the ground will be
the only way to revive and restore the confidence and
credibility to the peace process," Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting was convened according to the agreement
reached late September in Washington by Levy and Mazen to break
the prolonged peace deadlock caused by Israel's building of the
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem since March.
</P>
<P>
After initial talks here, the negotiations are expected to
shift to Washington to continue the efforts to reach
agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Investigate Total's Deal with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States is sending
experts to France, Russia and Malaysia as part of a U.S. probe to
determine if sanctions should be imposed in connection with their
companies' 2 billion US dollars natural gas deal with Iran, the
State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be sending experts to the three countries to
investigate and talk with officials in those countries about the
terms of these contracts as part of the work that we need to do to
make a determination of whether sanctionable activity has taken
place or will take place," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to anticipate the results of our review or
speculate about what decisions we will make," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched the investigation after the Total
Oil Group of France and its Russian and Malaysian coalition
partners announced on Sept.29 that they, defying threat from
Washington of imposing sanctions, had concluded the $2 billion
deal with Iran to develop Iran's vast South Pars natural gas
field, which is expected to produce 20 billion cubic meters of
natural gas a year.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, President Bill Clinton
is required to impose sanctions on any foreign company investing
more than 20 million dollars a year in the two countries, energy
industries.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that "no decision has been made concerning
the imposition of sanctions" under the act. But he indicated
Washington might waive the sanctions if European governments agree
to increase pressure on Iran, which Washington alleged to have
supported "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
However, members of the European Union have threatened to file
a complaint with the World Trade Organization if the United States
tries to impose such sanctions.
</P>
<P>
EU trade chief Leon Brittan warned the United States at a
meeting at Luxembourg on Monday that meddling in European trade
affairs could lead to counter-sanctions and the 15 EU nations
unanimously backed the $2 billion natural gas deal.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the EU would take the case to the WTO by Oct. 15
unless there was substantial progress on resolving the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are entitled to disagree with Us," Brittan said.
"What they are not entitled to do is to impose their will."

<HEADLINE> Third Euro-Mediterranean Industrial Summit Opens </HEADLINE>

ATHENS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The third Euro-Mediterranean
industrial summit opened here today with the aim of discussing
progress towards a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and
recommendations for a Euro-Mediterranean zone.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of industry federations from 31 countries of
Europe and the Mediterranean basin are participating in the
two-day summit which was organized by the Federation of Greek
Industries, the Development Ministry, the European Commission and
the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe.
</P>
<P>

European Union (EU) and its Mediterranean partners, would enable
the Mediterranean basin to become an area of strengthened
political dialogue, transactions and cooperation in ways that
would guarantee peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
