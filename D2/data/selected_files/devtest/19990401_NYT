WINDS GUSTS HIT 104 MPH IN NORTHERN ARIZONA

<P>
   It tipped over trucks, caused one death in a multiple-car pileup
and blew off roofs in northern Arizona. It kicked up dust so thick
in the Valley that it looked like snow.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's gale was one of the worst northern Arizona has ever
experienced, with gusts as high as 104 mph. Much of central and
eastern Arizona were under high-wind warnings all day Wednesday,
and parts of Interstate 40 remained closed early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about bad storms in the Northwest part of the
country, but this has been right up there in line with those,''
said Darren McCollum, meteorologist for the National Weather
Service in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person died in a seven- to 10-car pileup near
Winslow that involved about 20 people. Police and the Arizona
Department of Public Safety received more reports of more
wind-related accidents than they could immediately handle.
</P>
<P>
   DPS Capt. Bill McCance said it was the most severe storm he had
ever seen. Officers on the scene of the fatal pileup wore ski
goggles to see through the dust. Details of the crash still were
sketchy late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   I-40 remained closed eastbound from Flagstaff and westbound
between Holbrook and Winslow. Rigs began stacking up at truck stops
about 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Because rainfall has been below normal throughout the state,
Wednesday's winds scoured up widespread dust storms.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church in Winslow fed chili and sandwiches to about
60 people who were stranded by the storm, including a busload of
second and third-graders from Vernon Elementary School in Vernon,
in Apache County. The children were on a class outing to Meteor
Crater when they were caught in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Church teenagers came directly from school to entertain the kids
with basketball and games of Red Rover in a successful effort to
calm the frightened children.
</P>
<P>
   The group wound up sleeping overnight at the Winslow home of one
of the teacher's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the children were crying because Meteor Crater was
closed by the winds, according to Kelley Covert, a teacher's aide
at Vernon Elementary. Then, as the wind rocked the bus and they saw
a truck and trailer flip over, the kids became frightened and
started crying for their mothers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was zero visibility in front of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If they hadn't stopped at a gasoline station to allow the
children to go to the bathroom, she believes they would have been
involved in the big pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the pileup also spent several hours at the church
before spending the night at a Winslow motel.
</P>
<P>
   A weather station in St. Johns, northeast of Show Low, recorded
a gust of 104 mph. Most of the damage, however, was being reported
around Winslow and Holbrook. Gusts up to 93 mph raked Winslow, and
they reached 95 mph in Show Low.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three storms with gusts of 70 to 80 miles per hour
normally occur in Arizona in early spring, McCollum said, but this
was extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you will get 70 or 80 mph at the worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Joseph City, between Winslow and Holbrook, there were reports
of roofs blown off houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have truckers everywhere,'' said Lucille Taha, assistant
manager of the Holbrook Truck Stop General Store, off Arizona 77,
near Holbrook. They were stranded there from 11:30 a.m. until about
8 p.m. Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are worried about missing their delivery deadlines in
Phoenix and California,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss was in his new truck and called to say that he had just
been involved in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Stay off the roads because you can't see
anything,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to weather forecasters, winds will calm overnight in
northern Arizona, followed by freezing temperatures and snow
possible about 5,000 feet today and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a winter storm for the next three days _
anything can happen,'' McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have to get on Interstate 40, I would avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff high temperatures will be in the 30s and 40s instead
of the normal 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, winds were 20 to 30 mph, just enough to cause some
discomfort for hikers and outdoor workers. No major accidents due
to the wind were reported, though some of Arizona's landmarks were
lost in the haze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camelback looked like it was in a snowstorm,'' one caller told
The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Lower than normal temperatures are expected Thursday and Friday
in the Valley, with highs the 60s. That may set a record low for
the date, according to Jim Perfrement, meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Phoenix. &QL;

HAS SALMON FORGOTTEN HIS TERM PLEDGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's hard to imagine a more ardent supporter of
congressional term limits than Rep. Matt Salmon, who was elected to
his third, presumably his final, term in November.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman in 1995, one of the Arizona Republican's first
congressional acts was to submit, with a certain flourish, a ``Six
Year Resignation Letter'' to the House clerk announcing that he
wanted his name removed from the membership rolls after his third
term expired in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a large question: What was Salmon doing
holding a fund-raiser at a fancy Washington restaurant last month?
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast event cost $500 for political action committees
and $250 for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon didn't publicize the fund-raiser but, this being a
gossipy town, word leaked out to ``The Arizona Republic'' and to
various political operatives who wondered whether Salmon _ as some
other term-limits advocates have _ might be having a change of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That raises my eyebrows,'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics, when told Wednesday
of Salmon's breakfast at the tony La Colline restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a reporter in Arizona, I'd be asking them, `What are
you doing holding a fund-raiser?' He's got to have a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Salmon's top aide said the congressman was
merely responding to the wishes of a small group of friends who
still harbor hope he may run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a few folks that like Matt that want to be
helpful to his campaign, hoping that they can somehow convince him,
even though we told them up front before they gave a penny that
he's (not a candidate),'' said Mike Paranzino, Salmon's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Paranzino said the event took in about $3,000, which he called a
small sum by Washington standards. Salmon's wife, Nancy, attended
the breakfast with her husband. The contact for the event was
listed as Brandon Winfrey, whom Salmon has retained in the past to
raise money for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (Salmon's) full expectation is that he's not running
again,'' Paranzino said. ``We're hearing that people are trying to
get petitions signed to try to convince him. I hear that other
members are trying to get him to run, because they seem to be
worried about (Republicans holding onto) that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard ``The Republic'' was writing a story, Paranzino
called back a reporter Wednesday night to insist that Salmon was
not equivocating about his term-limits pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee already is
eyeing the seat as one it could take back in 2000 if Salmon doesn't
run. The GOP has only a six-seat majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress in its Easter recess, Salmon was traveling
overseas and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Salmon's House colleagues are having second thoughts
about their term-limits pledges. Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., ran in
1992 on a rallying cry of ``Eight Is Enough,'' but now is
considering a fifth two-year term. Reps. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., may abandon their three-term
pledges and run again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking elsewhere around the oountry, whether it's
to Washington or Florida or Massachusetts, and they're seeing
members who have made similar statements who are probably going to
run again,'' Paranzino said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Salmon doesn't run, he could use the money to pay
overhead campaign expenses, or squirrel it away for a campaign in
the future, Paranzino said. Salmon is weighing a run for governor
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission gives candidates broad leeway on
using campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prohibition is against using funds for private, personal
use,'' FEC spokesman Ian Stirton said. ``But there are several
things you can do with excess campaign funds, and one of them is to
run for state office. You can also donate the money to charity, or
set up foundations, or set up a political action committee and
donate to other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said, in a perfect world, contributors would be able to
know in advance where their money is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way of controlling the candidate,'' he said. ``They
really have an enormous number of options once they've collected
that money, and candidates tend to be using those options more
today than they ever have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Salmon's future is wide open, Paranzino said it's not
certain where excess funds could end up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 41 years old, and federal campaign funds could be used
down the road and transferred to a Senate race someday if there's
an open seat,'' he said. ``And I don't even think it (the $3,000)
will last that long. Between the rent and the overhead and paying
someone to keep the campaign books . . . '' &QL;

TO HIS BROTHER, SLAIN OFFICER MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER COP
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
They grew up in a middle class neighborhood in West Valley City,
Utah, south of Salt Lake. Darin was the oldest, then Marc, then
sister April.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the kind of town that held on to the 1950s well into the
1970s and 80s. Maybe it still does. Kids played kick-the-can in the
streets and could stretch a roll of toilet paper across the road _
just to watch a car bust through _ knowing the driver wasn't going
to get mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is when you're the oldest,'' Darin Atkin son
says. ``I've got this little brother trailing along behind me,
driving me nuts. But, you know, it was a wonderful place to live.
We spent over 20 years in that neighborhood. Our mom is still
there. It's not like it is . . . in a big city.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Darin had been to the Maryvale precinct of the Phoe nix
Police Department to clean out Marc's locker and to pick up his
truck. Now he was thinking about what me might say at his brother's
funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't ever think anything is going to happen,'' he
says. ``You put it out of your mind and don't think about it. Af
ter all, you hear all the time about cops who go their whole ca
reers and never have to pull their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, when Officer Marc Atkinson was gunned down in an
ambush in an industrial park west of the freeway, all of the
headlines and all of the TV newscasters and all of the people
who've stopped by at the improvised memorial at 30th Ave nue and
Catalina have referred to him exactly that way _ as Officer Marc
Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   That's how they'll refer to him to day when they show pictures
of the long line of police cruisers and mo torcycles leading the
funeral proces sion.
</P>
<P>
   The attention has been a comfort to Atkinson's family. Darin
says over and again how grateful they are for the kind words and
the support.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't see him like we do.
</P>
<P>
   We mourn the loss of a good cop.
</P>
<P>
   They mourn the loss of a good husband, a good father, a good
son.
</P>
<P>
   A good brother.
</P>
<P>
   Darin runs an insurance and in vestment firm in St. George,
Utah, just across the Arizona border. He was at work when he got
the call about Marc. He was the one who had to tell their mother,
whose hus band passed away only five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how things will work out,'' Darin says. ``Marc
wanted to be a rock and roll star for a while. He loved music.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Marc took piano les sons. In high school he became a
drummer for the marching band, then, with some friends, formed his
own group. He moved to Phoenix because some of the guys from the
band had moved here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a restaurant manager back then,'' Darin says, ``and
they rented space in a warehouse and practiced music.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc's wife, Karen, has a broth er-in-law who's a police
officer. It was through him that Marc got in terested in the job.
Eventually, he took many family members on ride-alongs, hoping to
ease their anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved people,'' Darin says. ``I hope there is no one out
there who thinks Marc was one of those cops who went out of his way
to do things to people who were different than him. He wasn't. By
the same token, our family doesn't harbor any ill will toward any
community or ethnic group or anything else be cause of what
happened to Marc. We don't think that way. Marc didn't and we
don't. Not now. Not ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson wanted to become a motorcycle officer. He wanted to see
his son, Jeremy, grow. He wanted to grow old with his wife. He had
hopes and dreams, like ev eryone else in his line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Most times, we don't recognize that in police officers, or
choose not to. It's as if the shields they wear in public block our
view of the men and women behind them. Except in death.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a good cop like Marc At kinson can be seen for what he re
ally was. A good husband. A good father. A good son. A good
brother.
</P>
<P>
   A good man. &QL;

 &HT;    Gunfire near church leaves officer dead
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith and Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta police officer was fatally wounded in a
shootout on Peachtree Street that ended with the man suspected of
firing at him fleeing down the aisle of St. Luke's Episcopal Church
during a solemn worship service Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Inside St. Luke's, worshippers heard ``popping sounds'' but
continued Holy Week services even while the wounded assailant ran
down the main aisle, pursued by the church's security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the man had been captured inside the church would
parishioners learn that a policeman had died in the struggle
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the slain policeman was being withheld at press
time, but his death was confirmed by Sgt. Lou Moore of the Atlanta
Homicide unit.
</P>
<P>
   According to police Lt. William Charles, the slain officer was
in his 20s and has worked on the force for at least three years.
The officer was assigned to the inner city Zone 5 district, which
covers the neighborhood around Crawford Long Hospital and the
church.
</P>
<P>
   A second officer was shot but spared from serious injury when a
bullet lodged in the police radio hanging on his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The melee began about 7 p.m. when two patrol officers stopped a
man pushing a pickup truck down the center of Pine Street in front
of Crawford Long Hospital, said Charles.
</P>
<P>
   An argument developed between the officers and the man, then
escalated. After two more officers joined the scene, the man was
wrestled to the ground. As officers rolled him over to handcuff
him, he pulled a gun and shot several times, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   The police returned fire, and at least one bullet struck the man
in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   The man jumped into a police car and tried to drive away.
Hindered by his wound, he wrecked about a block away at the corner
of Peachtree Street and Pine Street, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   A St. Luke's parishioner said the man then ran into the church
parking lot and tried to carjack a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Her screams alerted the church security guard, who chased the
man into the church and down the aisle, said the Rev. Dr. John
Westerhoff, who was leading the candlelight service.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 worshippers witnessed the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard chased the man into the sacristy, a small
room with no other exit and which holds the Holy Communion
sacraments, and locked the door.
</P>
<P>
   Police almost immediately entered the side doors of the church
and subdued the man in the sacristy, Westerhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Holy Week and the church was dark except for candles,
so all we could really see was a shadowy figure running down the
aisle,'' said parishioner Barry Bynum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choir was singing a canticle and didn't miss a beat, even
when we could hear the thumping and banging noises in the sacristy
as he was being captured,'' Bynum said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it says about St. Luke's, that the service proceeded
to its conclusion amid the violence and noise, Westerhoff replied,
``Well, we're an inner-city church.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's was founded in 1864 by refugees fleeing the Civil
War. The parish is known for its work with the homeless, including
a soup kitchen that feeds at least 400 on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not such a surprise that people who are in trouble would
come in our door,'' Westerhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, prayers were offered in the church for the
policeman slain near their doorstep.

L.A. TO LOSE MORE THAN ARCO'S LOGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- London-based BP Amoco Plc's expected buyout of
Atlantic Richfield Co., symbolically at least, sets the Union Jack
fluttering above Los Angeles, right next to the city's white
surrender flag.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to be announced early this morning, blots
another familiar logo from the downtown skyline as Arco joints the
ranks of companies that disappeared from Los Angeles either through
acquisition or a move to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown
is headquarters to more major corporations -- four -- than downtown
Los Angeles, which has one. It's a far cry from even a decade ago,
when companies such as First Interstate Bancorp, Lockheed Corp. and
Great Western Bancorp called the Los Angeles area home.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also raises questions about whether the new corporate
culture at Arco, the nation's eighth-biggest oil company, will be
as civic-minded as the one it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   Arco officials declined to discuss the deal late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being one of the city's biggest enterprises, Arco
also played a big philanthropic role, annually donating millions of
dollars to local charities.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, Arco has been working hard to cut costs in the
face of record-low oil prices and is in the midst of trimming 1,200
positions from its 18,000-strong work force worldwide. One
troubling aspect of the BP Amoco buyout is that it provides further
opportunity to cut costs in Arco's Los Angeles operations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Arco could be hit hard with further reductions if BP's
past practice is any indicator. When British Petroleum joined
Chicago-based Amoco, the deal was initially called a merger of
equals. But BP trimmed the payroll by a lot more than the 6,000
initial positions and the ax fell heaviest at old Amoco jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that company's top management left during the
transition. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Now it is Arco's turn, and the reverberations might be felt
outside of the corporate corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bode well,'' said Mike Roos, president and chief
executive of LEARN, a private, nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now has
received $700,000 from Arco since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two letters in profit are PR and Arco always
understood that more than any company that has ever come along,''
Roos said, alluding to Arco's well-known public relations efforts.
``They were the pace setters and standard setters and no one ever
came close in terms of the professional staff they employed. When
they gave you a gift and made a commitment it meant something
because it was substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when LEARN was founded in the early 1990s, Arco
President Robert Wycoff personally helped get the education
foundation going and raise funds from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Haggerty, president of the United Way of Greater Los
Angeles, said Arco has always been one of the nonprofit group's
biggest supporters and had an active employee contribution plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, United Way received about $1.3 million from Arco
after the company matched employee contributions of more than
$600,000. Additionally, company employees served on many United Way
boards and contributed time to charitable endeavors. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Now Haggerty wonders what kind of attitude the new regime will
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the new corporate culture will be or if
things will change. We will meet with whomever the (leaders) are
and talk with them about the issues facing Southern California and
hopefully they will continue to have some major involvement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Dozier, Arco's spokeswoman, said that last year the
company's philanthropic arm, the Arco Foundation, donated about $14
million to charity with 30 percent of the money funneled into the
Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the corporate downsizing, that amount was reduced to
$12 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   As more corporations are bought out or leave Los Angeles,
raising money has become more difficult, Haggerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headquarters companies tend to set high standards,'' he said.
``What we have been doing at United Way is looking at more of the
new entrepreneurial companies and at wealthy individuals and the
new markets in the Latino and Asian communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Zusman, vice president of legislative affairs for the
Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, downplays the impact
Arco's buyout will have on the city's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business community and the chamber are sorry to
see Arco's headquarters move in part because Arco was such a
generous and important corporate contributor to the community,''
she said. ``We're losing headquarters but at the same time we have
this whole new layer of small growing entrepreneurial companies
that basically are changing the face of the L.A. economy,'' she
said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Regardless of how the deal shakes out, Arco will probably
maintain a presence downtown. But even that has been dwindling in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1980s the company employed about 1,500 people in twin
towers with a stylish logo visible from downtown freeways. Today
there are about 380 at the corporate headquarters and Arco Products
Co., the marketing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Finding new tenants for Arco's current headquarters shouldn't be
a problem, according to Paul Stockwell, corporate managing director
at Julien J. Studley Inc., a commercial real estate firm in Los
Angeles. He said that prestige office space downtown continues to
attract corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during last year's fourth quarter Deloitte &AMP; Touche
leased 350,000 square feet of space at 2 California Plaza in the
300 block of South Grand Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arco has been downsizing for quite a while in downtown L.A. so
I don't know necessarily that this merger or acquisition will
result in a lot of further reductions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Stockwell noted that BP will still require a West Coast
headquarters, so Arco should remain a big presence in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the commercial real estate market, it's dollars
and cents and square footage. Not whose name is on top of the
building,'' he said.

 NEW YORK: for guns. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers'
lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss, and James Culleton, the
lawyer for Murphy, both said that their clients heard gunfire and
saw McMellon on the ground, leading them to assume that McMellon
had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   After the arraignment, Kornberg said his client, Carroll, had
seen a ``black object'' _ which turned out to be Diallo's wallet _
coming out of the victim's back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client saw him reaching into his back pocket, saw this
black object come out and my client yelled `Gun!''' Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After the court proceedings, the officers briefly thanked their
supporters, and proclaimed their innocence. Eyes welling, brows
knitted, Murphy said, ``I did nothing wrong and this trial will
show that I did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallos, who met with Johnson for half an hour before
the arraignment, and their supporters expressed satisfaction with
the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone
in this life,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, at a news
conference after the arraignment at the Manhattan law offices of
Johnny Cochran, who said he would prepare a civil suit on behalf of
the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers have rarely been convicted for killings that
occurred while they were on duty. The last such case was in July
1997, when Officer Paolo Colecchia was convicted of second-degree
manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back as he
fled down a Bronx subway platform.

VALENZUELA PLEADS INNOCENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA -- Ex-jockey Patrick Valenzuela, who once rode Sunday
Silence to victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes,
pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges he robbed a cabbie of $150 at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with one count of robbery and one count of using a
handgun in the commission of a felony. If convicted, the former
jockey could be sentenced to 16 years in state prison. Valenzuela
is currently free on $40,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Janice Claire Croft ordered Valenzuela back to court on
April 28 for a pre-trial hearing. The judge scheduled a tentative
trial date of May 28 in the case, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested on Feb. 26 on suspicion of committing the robbery two
days earlier, Valenzuela, an El Monte resident, has maintained his
innocence. His attorney, Donald Calabria, said that at the time of
the robbery Valenzuela was watching the Grammy Awards ceremony on
television with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 16-year career as a professional jockey,
Valenzuela was constantly in trouble. In 1989 he tested positive
for cocaine and was suspended for 60 days. The following year he
refused to take a drug test and had to enter a rehab program as a
condition of reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela has had several petty brushes with law over the past
three years. In 1996 he was arrested and charged with vandalism and
being under the influence of cocaine. Both cases were dismissed. In
1997, he was arrested on suspicion of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Valenzuela had talked of making a return to racing.
Those plans are now on hold as he awaits trial.

N.Y. HOSPITALS QUIT PROGRAM TO TRAIN FEWER DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, dozens of teaching hospitals across
New York state embraced an unusual pilot program to ease the
nationwide glut of physicians. The federal government would pay
bonuses to the hospitals if they trained fewer doctors, just as it
once paid corn farmers not to grow corn.
</P>
<P>
   But half those hospitals have now dropped out of the plan after
finding that they cannot function without the low-cost labor
provided by doctors in training, known as residents.
</P>
<P>
   The development, which comes even as the government is planning
to expand the New York pilot program nationwide, raises doubts
about federal efforts to curb the number of doctors in the nation,
and it illustrates a conundrum of health care today. While society
at large can ill afford to have an oversupply of doctors, which
experts say drives up the cost of health care, hospital officials
cannot afford to run their institutions without the trainees who
will add to that oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial benefits to teaching hospitals are still so
great that there's an incentive to train more physicians, whether
they are needed in the long run or not,'' said Edward Salsberg,
director of the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the State
University of New York in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program in New York was devised by officials from the
Greater New York Hospital Association, an influential trade group.
It was approved in early 1997 by the federal agency that pays for
the training of physicians, the Health Care Financing
Administration, which hoped to reap eventual savings of hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, hospitals needed to cut 20 percent to 25 percent of
their residents over six years to receive the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospitals found that in many cases, they were replacing
the trainees _ fully qualified medical doctors who log 80-hour
weeks and earn about $50,000 a year _ with more established
doctors, who work a more typical 40-hour week and earn about
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear how indispensable the residents are to
providing high-quality care on a day-in, day-out basis,'' said
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association. ``When you actually began to go to the drafting board
and engineer it, that's when all the problems began to pop up. It
became clear that they couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals that have dropped out _ mostly large private
institutions like New York Hospital and Beth Israel Medical Center
_ knew what the program entailed when they entered it. But they had
been counting on two things that never materialized: declining
patient populations, which would reduce the need for residents, and
sharp cuts in the Medicare reimbursements paid to hospitals to
train doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen hospitals that have remained in the program have,
in fact, experienced declines in their patient loads, making it
easier for them to pare their resident positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., eagerly joined
the program but soon discovered that the ``replacement costs were
extraordinary,'' said Edward Stolzenberg, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Center officials estimated that it would actually cost the
institution $1.5 million a year to stay in the federal program. So
three months ago, they withdrew and are now planning to put back
most of the 40 resident positions they had cut.
</P>
<P>
   While costs were the main reason that Westchester Medical bowed
out, the less tangible benefits of running a robust training
program also affected the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents keep you on the cutting edge,'' Stolzenberg said.
``They push the faculty to a higher standard of care. When a
student is watching you and you're teaching, it's harder to get
away with short cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, health care experts have decried the overabundance of
doctors in the United States. A surplus of doctors, particularly
specialists, pushes up health costs, economists say, and drains
Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly that
provides $7.4 billion a year nationally to hospitals for medical
training. In 1995, one group, the Pew Health Professions
Commission, recommended shutting down a quarter of the nation's
medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, an excess of doctors could be expected to
reduce costs, based on theories of supply and demand. But most
health economists say the opposite is true. The oversupply of
doctors in many specialties and in urban areas of the country, they
say, results in unnecessary tests, procedures and referrals to
other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of medicine, supply and demand are not
dependent,'' said Salsberg of the Center for Health Workforce
Studies. ``If you have 100 doctors, they will keep themselves busy,
and if you have 200 doctors, they will keep busy also. If a
specialty gets crowded, you wind up with subspecialists, and the
danger is they will have a narrower perspective and you can end up
with more services being delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state, which trains 15 percent of the country's
physicians, is by far the nation's largest producer of new doctors.
That is one reason the Health Care Financing Administration was
interested in pursuing a pilot program in New York. The agency is
now writing regulations that would expand the program nationwide,
as required by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Health care analysts and even some hospital officials say
Medicare's reputation over the years as a generous provider of
training dollars has led, in part, to the continuing expansion of
hospital residency programs. Medicare pays hospitals up to $100,000
a year for each resident they train, and there was no ceiling in
early 1997 on the number of residents that a hospital could have.
</P>
<P>
   Some health care experts say hospitals have traditionally made
money on the trainees, though officials at the Greater New York
Hospital Association deny that, pointing out the costs of
employment benefits, administration costs and the inefficiencies
associated with rookie doctors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 49 hospitals that joined the federal program in New York,
officially known as the Medicare Graduate Medical Education
Demonstration Project, were facing a radically altered health care
landscape that offered unprecedented financial pressures.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was managed care, newly established in New York and
dictating price concessions from doctors and hospitals. Then, there
was deregulation. At the start of 1997, New York lifted the
state-mandated rates that hospitals could charge insurers, a move
that ushered in a new era of competition among hospitals for
managed-care contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Medicare itself seemed poised to scale back the
reimbursements to hospitals for training doctors as Congress hashed
out the terms of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. A separate proposal
before the Medicare commission was even more worrisome, removing
the financing for graduate medical education from Medicare
altogether and handing it over to a special appropriations budget
so that New York would have to compete with other states for a
limited pool of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of hospitals thought inpatient capacity would plummet
like a stone,'' said Patricia Wang, a senior vice president of the
Greater Hospital Association of New York, ``and if it drops, you
can't have all these residency programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials in New York reasoned that the federal subsidy
program would help end their reliance on medical residents, who
treat patients under the supervision of attending physicians, and
would help them withstand expected cuts in Medicare funds. Under
the pilot program, Medicare continues to pay participating
hospitals as if those young doctors were still there, slowly
phasing out the payments over six years.
</P>
<P>
   But for many hospitals, the sky never fell. The average length
of time a patient stays in the hospital has dropped, but the number
of admissions has stayed about the same or even risen. At the same
time, the Balanced Budget Act lowered the reimbursement rate just
slightly, although it did cap the number of residents that Medicare
would pay to train at 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the Balanced Budget Act created its own
incentive for hospitals to shrink residency programs. Though the
subsidy was smaller than New York's pilot program, it did not
entail the specific reduction targets or timetables. Hospital
officials realized that they could derive some benefit from
downsizing, but at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals in the New York program were also struggling to
cut their residency programs while adhering to state rules, adopted
in 1989, that limit the workloads of medical residents to 80 hours
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to meet two contradictory objectives,'' said
Bruce Vladeck, former administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, the federal agency that runs the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   ``One objective was to reduce the number of residents and the
other was to reduce the number of hours the residents are
working,'' said Vladeck, who is now the senior vice president for
policy of the Mount Sinai NYU Medical Center and Health System in
New York City. ``They weren't able to square that circle.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, 26 hospitals have left the program, including three
hospitals in the Mount Sinai consortium and five in the New York
University consortium that defected early last month. Officials of
the Health Care Financing Administration, which is part of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, are certainly not pleased
that so many participants have pulled out but assert that the
program has still succeeded in raising awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised that some of the hospitals have chosen to
withdraw because the residency reductions are demanding,'' said Dr.
Robert Berenson, director of the administration's Center for Health
Plans and Providers.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat by so many hospitals from the New York program may
come as a surprise to critics from other states who contended that
the federal government was playing favorites in giving New York
such a sweet deal. If the original participants had all stayed in
the program, the government would have paid the New York hospitals
$400 million in incentives. But that was $300 million less than
what the government would have spent if the current system was
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to pretty conclusively demonstrate to people that
this was not a giveaway of largess from the federal treasury to New
York hospitals,'' said James Tallon, president of the United
Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group. ``It was partial
assistance for a very difficult shift.''

LAWYER SENTENCED TO PRISON CRIMES COMMITTED IN DEFENSE OF DRUG
CLIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former lawyer who had been accused of joining the
criminal activities of his clients was sentenced to just over seven
years in prison Wednesday by a federal judge who refused requests
for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Pat V. Stiso, 38, had pleaded guilty last year to
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to distribute heroin. He also
had agreed as part of the plea to resign from the bar and to
forfeit $600,000 in proceeds from illegal drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Stiso had spurred debate in the legal community
about how far lawyers may go in defending their clients. Wednesday,
choking back tears, Stiso told a judge that he was embarrassed and
ashamed of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed to honor my own moral and ethical obligations,''
Stiso told Judge Denny Chin &UR;  &LR; in Manhattan, ``and the ramifications
have been overwhelming: disbarment, financial ruin and complete and
total devastation of an entire family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had accused Stiso of crossing the line and
becoming, in effect, ``house counsel'' to a profitable heroin
organization that operated in the Bronx and that prosecutors said
was led by Francisco Maisonet. A number of other defendants,
including Maisonet, face trial later this year on federal
racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty, Stiso had admitted receiving thousands of
dollars that he knew to be the proceeds of narcotics trafficking,
and concealing the money in his office in the Bronx. He also
pleaded guilty to a charge that he identified to Maisonet an
informer who might testify against him or other members of the
gang, in direct violation of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the plea last August, Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said, ``Lawyers who forsake their
professional oath should face punishment under the law as cynical
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence of 87 months was the maximum allowable under
sentencing guidelines. Chin said that he had been moved by the
letters he had received on Stiso's behalf, including those from
former colleagues who wrote that it had been Stiso's ``passion for
his clients, his desire to do the best that he could for his client
that caused the blurring of the line between proper conduct as a
defense attorney and breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chin said the letter writers had missed ``the side of him
that allowed him to accept grocery bags of money, tens of thousands
of dollars in cash in grocery bags, money that was earned from the
sale of heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Chin added: ``Defense lawyers have to do their jobs, there is no
question. But this is not a case about the blurring of a line. This
case doesn't even come close.''

IN HONORING A SLAIN OFFICER, MAYOR MAKE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (With DIALLO-INDICT) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just hours before the second-degree murder charges
were unsealed against four police officers in the death of Amadou
Diallo on Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir visited another part of the Bronx to rename a street
in honor of an officer who died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   There, they made impassioned speeches urging greater respect for
the police.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani and his aides acknowledged the delicate timing of
the ceremony, held at the same moment that crowds were gathering
outside state Supreme Court in anticipation of the Diallo
indictments, they said the event honoring Officer Vincent Guidice
had been planned for weeks and was not postponed out of respect to
the Guidice family.
</P>
<P>
   But if they were sensitive to the coincidental timing, the mayor
and the police commissioner did not hesitate to make the recent
criticism of the Police Department over the Diallo case the thrust
of their remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that we show them as a city more respect,'' Guiliani
said of the city's officers. ``As we ask the Police Department to
show more respect and we make Herculean efforts _ they do _ to show
more respect, we have something we have a right to demand. We have
a right to demand more respect from the citizens of the city for
the police officers of the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In reference to the protests outside Police Headquarters in
Manhattan and the Bronx courthouse, the mayor continued: ``And it's
about time to stop carrying signs pretending that they are racist.
It's about time to stop carrying signs equating them to the KKK,
and it's about time to stop invocations of Adolf Hitler about our
Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said: ``We have been called upon to acknowledge the
tragedy that befell the Diallo family, and it is a tragedy indeed.
And we do that because it is the right thing to do. However, I
would call upon others, particularly those of our critics who would
paint the members of this department as uniformly uncaring,
unfeeling and brutal to acknowledge the tragedies that befall our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidice died after responding to a domestic dispute on May 21,
1996. During a struggle to arrest a suspect, a shard of broken
glass from a mirror severed an artery in the officer's leg. The
suspect, Anthony R. Rivers, was charged with manslaughter but later
acquitted by a jury. Giuliani had harshly criticized Bronx District
Attorney Robert Johnson in the Guidice case for not seeking murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson personally handled the arraignment of the
four officers in the Diallo shooting.

MAX MANDELL, FOUNDER OF NURSERY SCHOOL, IS DEAD AT 90
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Max Mandell, who grew up with a mother who didn't
love him and a grandfather who did, died on Saturday at Cabrini
Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 90 and as the founder of the
Mandell Nursery School and Kindergarten had devoted his life to
making up for a mother's rejection by passing on a grandfather's
love to generations of young children.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that Mandell wore his psyche on his sleeve would
hardly do justice to a man who attributed his entire life's work to
his feelings of rejection at the hands of an overbearing mother who
lavished all her maternal love on his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   That and the example of the counterbalancing love of his
grandfather helped explain why, for more than half a century,
Mandell was a weekday morning fixture in front of his school at 127
West 94th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the 50 or so children from 3 to 6 received a more or
less conventional preschool experience, perhaps with an extra
emphasis on positive reinforcement dictated by Mandell policy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, they received total, unconditional acceptance of their
very beings, greeted daily by Mandell with whoops and hugs and
piling laughing into the open arms of a man who made a point never
to close off a child. But then, how could he? With his snow white
hair and bushy beard, he was a West Side incarnation of Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   The daily greetings, Mandell once explained, provided a
consistency that inspired a copycat consistency in the children's
school work.
</P>
<P>
   But that, he admitted, was mere pedagogical cover for a deeper
and more personal motive. ``This is for the satisfaction of my own
soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandell's soul was tested almost as soon as he was born in
Romania in 1908 into family circumstances shrouded in mystery ever
since his mother abruptly brought him and his older brother, Harry,
to the United States three years later. Because the two boys were
such striking physical contrasts, there were inevitable whisperings
that they had different fathers, but no one in the family seems to
know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   What they do know is that Mandell's mother, who eventually
opened a candy store in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, so
preferred his older brother that Mandell grew up feeling slighted
and inadequate, or would have if his mother's father, a master
carpenter, had not provided a consistent antidote of love and
affection.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not unusual for a mother to prefer a firstborn son,
Mandell's mother seemed to have carried the preference to extremes.
Until someone provided an extra ticket, for example, she had been
prepared to leave her younger son behind in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Then, years later, after Harry had been allowed to attend
regular high school, Mandell was forced to work as a packer at a
hat company during the day while attending Brooklyn Evening High
School at night.
</P>
<P>
   Although he studied business at City College, from the beginning
Mandell focused on children, serving as a Scoutmaster, working for
four years with disturbed adolescents, and in the late 1930s
opening an afternoon recreation program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, in which Mandell drove children to parks, museums
and other attractions, was such a hit that parents in the
neighborhood clamored for him to open a nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Mandell worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
but as soon as the war was over, he opened his school.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a startling, if momentary, maternal thaw,
his mother actually lent him the $14,500 it took to buy the
brownstone on West 94th Street, but almost immediately undercut the
gesture. Within days after the closing, she demanded her money
back, camping on her son's doorstep until he arranged alternate
financing from loan sharks at a crushing 20 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   For its first two decades, the school limped along, as Mandell,
his wife and their two children, who lived above the school, spent
weekends cleaning classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Mandell, believed to be the last privately owned
nursery school in Manhattan, has flourished in the hothouse
atmosphere of parental ambitions. Seen as a sure stepping stone to
Harvard or Yale, the school, which charges about $8,000 a year,
regularly receives 120 applications for a dozen openings.
</P>
<P>
   Although his daughter, Barbara Rowe, has ostensibly run the
school for years, Mandell continued to review virtually every
expenditure and until late September could be found at his familiar
post outside the school, passing on a grandfather's love and
receiving his share in return.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, Mandell, whose wife and brother died
several years ago, is survived by a son, Paul, a professor at the
University of Brazil in Brasilia; five grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.

LAWRENCE D. DUKE SR., 86; FOUGHT THE KLAN IN GEORGIA
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ga.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Daniel Duke Sr., a retired state judge who as a young
prosecutor fought for civil rights and against the Ku Klux Klan in
rigidly segregationist Georgia, died on March 24 at Fayette
Community Hospital in Fayetteville, Ga. He was 86 and lived in
nearby Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   Duke successfully prosecuted several Klansmen in the early 1940s
for the flogging of a black man who was found frozen to death with
two whips near his body. After he won convictions against the men,
Gov. Eugene Talmadge signaled that he would grant them clemency.
</P>
<P>
   An irate Duke confronted the governor at a public hearing and
waved one of the whips before his face to make a point about
slavery and racism. Talmadge reconsidered and did not let the men
go free until late in their prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant state attorney general in 1946, Duke
passionately argued the state's case for revocation of the Georgia
Klan's state charter of incorporation. The organization, he told
the court, ``systematically is carrying out a policy designed to
violate the rights of Georgia citizens guaranteed under the
Constitution of the state and of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed assertions by the Georgia grand dragon that his
Association of Georgia Klans had nothing to do with lynchings
ascribed to the Ku Klux Klan Inc. The grand dragon's new outfit,
Duke told the court, was merely the ``ragtag and bobtail of the old
order, and their claiming to be different will not interfere with
the legal procedure contemplated in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's courtroom victory over the Klan paralleled his successful
campaign against Columbians Inc., a small, virulently anti-black,
anti-Jewish Klan offshoot with links to pro-Nazi conspirators
involved with the German-American Bund. The Columbians, hatched by
the Ku Klux Klan, were ``the juvenile delinquents of the KKK,''
Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   His fight against the two organizations was cited in 1947 when
the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named him one of its 10
outstanding young men of the year. Others so honored with him that
year included John F. Kennedy, then a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   His stand also made Duke and his family targets of threats and
physical violence from segregationists. At times he spent nights at
the local sheriff's lock-up, changing cells during the night for
his own safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duke, as he was known, was born in Palmetto, Ga. He found
his social conscience after his father, a merchant, went broke in
the Depression, and he had to seek work at age 14. The experience
taught him respect for all working men and women and made him an
advocate of labor unions and black defendants.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way through college and law school, graduating
from Oglethorpe University and from Atlanta Law School and earning
another degree in administrative law at Emory University. He
pursued additional studies at Heidelberg and Oxford Universities.
</P>
<P>
   His public career began when he was named assistant state
solicitor in 1941, followed by his stint as assistant attorney
general. Gov. Carl Sanders appointed him to the bench of the state
court of Fulton County in 1961, and he served as its chief judge
before retiring in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is survived by a daughter, Dorrie Fletcher, of Roscoe, Ga.;
three sons, Lawrence Duke Barnes, of Denver, Daniel Jr., of
Alpharetta, Ga., and Tarleton C., of Tyrone; a sister, Myra D.
Coulon, of Barnesville, Ga., and four grandchildren.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   While NATO warplanes attack Serbia, the alliance must also tend
to the needs of a tidal wave of refugees fleeing Serbian atrocities
in Kosovo. In the past eight days, nearly 150,000 Kosovars have
arrived in Albania, Montenegro and Macedonia, three of Europe's
poorest republics. Clinton administration officials fear that could
grow to one million in the days ahead. These refugees need food,
shelter and medicine. The lands receiving them need help as well,
lest the burden of caring for so many foreigners tear apart their
own fragile societies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement by the Clinton administration of $50
million in new assistance for Kosovo refugees is a good start to
meeting American obligations. Britain, France, Italy and Germany
have also announced useful relief efforts. But the measures
announced thus far represent only a down payment on what will
eventually be required.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees have been fleeing Kosovo since Serbia began its terror
campaign against the local Albanian population last year. Their
numbers increased as Slobodan Milosevic escalated the violence in
recent months. Since NATO began bombing last week, Serbian
atrocities have multiplied and the exodus has increased. One out of
three Kosovo Albanians have been chased from their homes, and most
of these 600,000 displaced people are headed for the nearest
border. Nearly 90,000 have reached Albania in the last week and
about 25,000 each have arrived in Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In all three receiving republics, the most urgent needs are
tents and blankets to keep the refugees warm and dry and medical
staff and sanitary water supplies to prevent epidemics. Food must
also be transported from places where it is currently stockpiled,
like Italy, to the areas where refugees are concentrated. NATO can
help in this task.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will channel half of its new aid through the Pentagon
and half through relief groups. It is also rightly seeking to help
the regions receiving the refugees. The influx must not destabilize
Montenegro, which has been particularly generous. Though part of
Yugoslavia, it has distanced itself from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee problem has grown faster than anyone anticipated
because few outsiders expected that Milosevic would attempt the
wholesale removal of Kosovo's Albanian population. NATO must now
help cope with the consequences of his inhumane behavior.

DEAF CELEBRANTS PUT SPIN ON SEDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- About 90 deaf Jews shared the meaning and
spirit of Passover on Wednesday in a unique and innovative way
through the experimental use of multimedia projectors at a Seder.
</P>
<P>
   The two towering projection screens allowed the group to follow
the prayers, songs and readings together, where in the past they
would have struggled to watch a sign language interpreter while
trying to read along with the Haggadah prayer booklet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. Deaf people need the visuals so there's no
miscommunication, no misunderstanding. That way they get accurate
information,'' said Evylyn Zola, 76, who is deaf and communicated
through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Several deaf actors attended the dinner Wednesday, including
Marlee Matlin, who won a Best Actress Oscar for ``Children of a
Lesser God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we didn't feel like we could pray together all at
the same time. Each table prayed separately and the timing was
off,'' Matlin said through interpreter Connie Schultz. ``It's very
exciting. Now we can pray together.''
</P>
<P>
   Zola said she traveled from her home in Concord, Calif., to
Burbank's Temple Emanu El specifically to see the Jewish Deaf
Community Center, a national organization based in Burbank, try the
new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Tarzana resident Sue Carol Zola, said the
projectors gave her mother an opportunity to better follow the
symbolism of Passover and participate in its sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she gets to understand what the customs are, why we
celebrate this holiday and its historical impact,'' said Sue Carol
Zola.
</P>
<P>
   Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, started at sundown
Wednesday. The first of the eight nights is treated as a feast to
God, with family and friends gathering to remember and celebrate
the Israelites' freedom from slavery and their exodus from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally each person takes turns reading from the Haggadah,
a ritual that deaf people found difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what page they were on or what words they were
following,'' said Gary Sidansky, a deaf 11-year-old from Thousand
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the Jewish Deaf Community Center used
sign-language interpreters at its local Seder dinners.
</P>
<P>
   With the projectors, there was no need for a print version of
the Haggadah, although two interpreters were hired to sign along
with the colorful graphics on the screens.
</P>
<P>
   The projectors were made possible by a $5,600 grant from the
Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to repeat this event next year in the suburban
San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and be the model for other
deaf Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's nice about this technique is that it's run by
computers, which means we have the ability to distribute a copy of
the program on CD-ROM to other deaf Jewish groups around the
country to use,'' said David Rosenbaum, a board member at the
center.

EDITORIAL: IMPEDIMENTS TO AN ACCURATE CENSUS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are up to their usual mischief on the census.
Fearing a loss of House seats, they have proposed legislation that
would disrupt efforts by the Census Bureau to produce accurate,
adjusted population counts in time for the states to draw state and
national legislative boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in January that federal census law does
not allow the bureau to use scientific sampling techniques to
supplement the traditional head count in apportioning congressional
seats among the states. But the court allowed sampling for other
purposes, like drawing the boundaries of congressional and state
legislative districts and distributing federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling was a disappointment to Republicans who fear that
using adjusted figures in redistricting will result in more
districts with large urban and minority populations, who tend to be
undercounted by traditional methods and who tend to vote
Democratic. So their current tactic is to try to push through
legislation that would undermine the ability of the Census Bureau
to produce those figures with the help of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst of their proposals is H.R. 472, which would
allow local governments to review the census numbers for accuracy.
That change sounds deceptively worthy but would actually be
disruptive. In 1990, that post-census review was so cumbersome that
only about a quarter of the nation's 39,000 local governments even
participated. The procedure added only 125,000 people to the
overall population count, and has since been replaced by a process
by which local governments review Census Bureau address lists
before the counting begins. This works well. But the House bill
would reinstate the old review, which would probably delay
completion of the count by many weeks, making it difficult to
produce the adjusted figures in time for states to use as they
begin redistricting in 2001. Kenneth Prewitt, director of the
Census Bureau, has called the Republican efforts ``just short of
disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the census also bodes ill for the federal
judiciary and the Commerce, Justice and State departments could
lose their funding and be shut down on June 15 unless Congress and
the White House resolve their census fight. The threat has prompted
Chief Justice William Rehnquist to ask Congress to protect the
judiciary from this bitter battle.
</P>
<P>
   A vote in the House is expected to fall largely along party
lines, inviting a presidential veto. New York Republicans in
Congress have no business supporting efforts to tamper with the
census in ways that would harm the state's urban areas.

EDITORIAL: RETURN OF THE `HEART BILL'  
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Legislature has passed and sent to the
governor a bill decreeing that any state corrections officer who
comes down with a heart problem is suffering from a job-created
disability and thus entitled to a tax-free pension worth
three-quarters of his or her pay. The only real surprise is the
timing. This is the sort of special-interest giveaway that usually
gets passed under cover of the chaotic last-day race to
adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Inveighing against the ``heart bill,'' or asking Gov. George
Pataki to veto it, seems almost futile. The Legislature overrode
the local collective bargaining process last year to confer the
same benefit on New York City corrections officers, and Pataki
signed it into law, even though Mayor Rudolph Giuliani claimed it
would cost the city at least $3.5 million a year in added pension
costs. In the past, lawmakers have handed the same sweet deal to
city police officers and firefighters. It is at least some solace
that this time the legislators passed a heart bill their own budget
has to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Public employees who are genuinely injured on the job should be
compensated properly. But there is no reason to assume that any
corrections officer who comes down with a problem as common as
heart trouble was stricken because of his or her work. The
Legislature's impetus for passing the bill seems to have less to do
with medical evidence than with a dramatic increase in campaign
contributions from the state correction workers' union.

PRIME MINISTERS RETURN AS TALKS ON DISARMING IRA   CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `I think ..., to UPDATE with talks continuing
Thursday morning with no deal announced.) 
 (rk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, Northern Ireland _ For the third consecutive
night, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland pressed Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders Wednesday
night to compromise in the bitter dispute over the disarmament of
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is blocking the advance of the peace effort in this
British province.
</P>
<P>
   The two men left Ulster Wednesday morning after two days of
negotiations, took part in parliamentary debates in London and in
Dublin and returned Wednesday night to Hillsborough Castle, 15
miles south of Belfast, the residence of the Northern Ireland
secretary, Mo Mowlam, to try to reach a settlement by Friday, the
deadline set by Ms. Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can make it,'' Blair said before leaving Wednesday
morning, promising to return if he felt a compromise could be
reached Wednesday night. He returned in a helicopter about 8:30
p.m. As the talks continued at 1:30 a.m. Thursday, no settlement
had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates, a group of Protestants aligned with the Rev.
Ian Paisley, who opposes the peace agreement, yelled ``Traitor!''
and ``No surrender!'' at official cars.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of the disarmament dispute would pave the way for
the transfer of home rule powers by Britain to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly. The transfer is part of the peace agreement
approved in Belfast last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives more political power to the Catholic
minority in Ulster and more influence in the north to the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to settle the disarmament problem could lead to
increased sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting problem is that the transfer of home rule powers
may not start until the new Northern Ireland Assembly, led by a
Protestant first minister, David Trimble, forms a cabinet. Sinn
Fein, the IRA political wing, is to receive two of the cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble says he will not form a cabinet with Sinn Fein until
the IRA makes a ``credible beginning'' to disarming its arsenal,
estimated at 100 tons of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 20 months, which is
regularly cited by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, as proof that
the group supports the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the IRA issued a statement that was immediately and
predictably described as negative by Protestant Unionists and as
positive by Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, part of an annual proclamation marking the
anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising of Republicans against the
British colonial power, said: ``The IRA guns are silent. Over the
past five years, we have called and maintained two prolonged
cessations of military operations to enhance the democratic process
and underline our definitive commitment to its success. If the
political will exists, the peace process contains the potential to
resolve the conflict and deliver a durable peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestants, including Trimble, said the statement was
politically useless because it did not contain an unequivocal
promise to start disarming in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   But other politicians, including Sinn Fein officials, noted that
the guerrilla group had dropped its explicit vow last August not to
disarm. The IRA also emphasized that the agreement does not require
disarmament before May 2000.

NEUHEISEL'S BIGGEST TASK: DITCHING DITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Identify the speaker:
</P>
<P>
   ``You got some 'splaynin' to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't Ricky Ricardo. It's Ricky Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in fact. Much like his namesake's wife in the ``I
Love Lucy'' show, Neuheisel has been caught doing the preposterous.
He knows that the University of Washington, Husky recruits and much
of college football have hands on hips, foot tapping, glaring at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question the publicity surrounding the ... mistake, has
left us with some explaining to do in the homes of recruits,''
Neuheisel acknowledged. ``But once we tell our side, I think you'll
see a positive impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to (dismayed UW fans), we just have to play. This
team will play with enthusiasm, and will be fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like these people don't want to be fans of the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, maybe so. Still, I can't recall anyone in Seattle's
modern big-time sports history who took such an important job with
so many people hoping he fails.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of spring football practice, Neuheisel met with a
handful of reporters over lunch to begin the climb out of the
ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Before he's even seen his players on a practice field, Neuheisel
finds himself in the crosshairs of coaches, administrators and fans
at two major rivals _ Oregon and Colorado _ under scrutiny by the
Pac-10, officially reprimanded by his new boss and resented by many
fans who liked his predecessor, who remains in the neighborhood,
stewing.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's $1 million annual stipend has caused consternation
throughout campus and around college football for unreasonably
inflating salary scales. And he's made himself the butt of jokes
after he was identified by the FBI as a partier, albeit an innocent
one, at the Los Angeles home of a convicted mobster.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't even gotten to the part about inheriting a 6-6 team
whose defense was nearly the worst in the UW's last 30 years, a
team that will receive meager relief from a mediocre recruiting
class.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention Washington plays Oregon and Colorado on
consecutive Saturdays?
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel has more than 'splaynin' to do. He has to coach as if
he's the second coming of Rockne and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my father I took the Washington job, after he
congratulated me, he said, `You go another step up the ladder, the
more your rear end is exposed,''' Neuheisel said. ``That has become
evident over the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The bull's-eye on his backside might never go away, at least
until he is no longer perceived to be too young, too glib and now
too rich for his station in life. But the criticism has yet to
produce a perceptible flinch in his game face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given a great opportunity,'' Neuheisel said. ``When
you're in the spotlight and you do well, you can derive a lot of
benefits, with people jumping on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the bandwagon unstuck, Neuheisel scored what might prove
to be his most crucial recruit. It isn't freshman-to-be running
back Paul Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   When Neuheisel appointed Keith Gilbertson assistant head coach,
he bought himself some quick local credibility. Think of it as
marrying into the Husky family _ if Gilby says Neuheisel's OK,
Uncle Torvald just might take the arch out of his eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had an assistant head coach before,'' Neuheisel
said. ``I used to think of it as just a title. But I see this as a
bridge to history and to the behind-the-scenes activity associated
with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson is the guy who knows everybody, from prep coaches to
Tyee Clubbers. He has the map to most of the local land mines. In
his third tour of coaching duty at Washington _ the last one
produced a team that shared the national championship _ and after
three years as a Seahawk assistant, he's the guy who will get
Neuheisel a table, a recruit, a tee time, maybe even a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a country club,'' Neuheisel said of the culture
surrounding the Husky program. ``It's the social hub for the movers
and shakers in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel said at Colorado there were three or four influential
Buffalo backers of whom he said, ``you have to know.'' The circle
is larger at Washington, and even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Husky program is still dialing for private dollars to
complete the facilities renovations for athletics, the head
football coach remains the primary shakedown artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Keith knows the politics,'' Neusheisel said. ``That's
important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final news conference as Husky coach, Jim Lambright said
his one regret was that he ``wasn't more political.'' He couldn't
have been more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel has made more than his share of mistakes already, but
he won't be repeating Lambright's error. Some may find the
political aspect distasteful, but to dismiss it would be as foolish
as speed-reading the NCAA rulebook _ another mistake Neuheisel
isn't likely to make again.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson can't bulletproof Neuheisel, but he can help reduce
the amount of time he spends having to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   The man needs every moment to get the bandwagon out of the
ditch.

STEWART PRACTICES DAMAGE CONTROL AS ISLES BEAT PANTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Bill Stewart has seen plenty of ugliness during
his three months as coach of the Islanders, but the ugliest
situation of his brief tenure is one he brought on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Stewart held a 10-minute meeting with his
players to clarify remarks he made after the Islanders' emotional
3-1 loss to the Rangers on Monday. The young coach's words, which,
he said, were taken out of context, not only hurt the feelings of
the players in the Islanders' locker room, but they were also taken
personally by the team's general manager and owners.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has since backtracked, saying that he was emotional
after the bitter loss to the Rangers and that his comments referred
to the training camp mode that the team has been in since it was
dismantled before the National Hockey League trading deadline. The
remarks were not meant as a put down, Stewart said. But that was
how they were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday night, after the Islanders beat the Florida
Panthers, 5-3, Stewart said: ``Everybody makes mistakes. I'm man
enough to admit it. I think it was a situation where things I said
were misunderstood a bit. I'm a rookie coach in this league, and
I'm going to learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, the Islanders' general manager, was so upset with
Stewart that he faxed him two articles from New York newspapers at
the team hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Tuesday morning.
Milbury circled a line that quoted Stewart as saying: ``Have you
looked at our lineup? Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Stewart received a phone call from Milbury, and the two
had a heated conversation as Stewart paced the hotel lobby on his
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Mike Milbury was mad,'' Stewart said, ``and I apologized
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 48 hours since Stewart told reporters, ``Certainly if we
had the resources to go out and acquire some National Hockey League
talent, it would be a different story,'' outside the Islanders'
locker room at Madison Square Garden, the coach has been trying to
limit the damage. He may feel that his NHL future and reputation
have been tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for the second straight day, Milbury was not
commenting. Islanders officials said that did not bode well for
Stewart, who is 8-16-6 with the Islanders since taking over as
coach on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing Milbury's displeasure, Stewart, who had wavered
on the issue of whether he wanted to return to the Islanders next
season, said publicly for the first time on Tuesday that he wanted
to come back, that he would like the challenge of rebuilding the
Islanders (20-45-9), who have been eliminated from the playoffs for
the fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that prior to the trading deadline we were headed in
the right direction,'' Stewart said. ``We lost a lot of one-goal
games, but we weren't embarrassing ourselves. There was some
chemistry building. We'd all like to have Robert Reichel, but there
were some economics involved, and I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart described Wednesday's team meeting as very constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed to the guys the situation that occurred after the
New York game,'' Stewart said after this morning's pre-game
practice. ``I was emotional after that game. Right to the man, we
expressed our feelings and thoughts. It was positive. Sometimes
things get taken out of context. That's how we're leaving it. Let's
move on, let's move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain, agreed, saying that it
was no longer an issue. Linden said: ``I never actually saw the
comments, but I heard a little bit about it. He's frustrated. He
was successful for the three years before he came here. It's a
difficult situation to be in. There's a lot of young people in our
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Panthers, the Islanders trailed 2-1 after the first
period, then got two goals in a span of 42 seconds in the second
period to take a 3-2 lead. The first came from Mark Lawrence and
the second from Mike Watt.
</P>
<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski clinched the victory with two goals in the
third period, one into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Flaherty made 33 saves for the Isles, who snapped a four
game losing streak. Mark Parrish scored twice and Radek Dvorak
scored once for the Panthers. Sean Burke made 14 stops for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game that the Islanders helped the
Rangers' slim playoff hopes. The Rangers and the Panthers remain
tied with 72 points in their pursuit of the Boston Bruins (77
points) for the final playoff berth in the East. The Islanders lost
to the Rangers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday's loss was costly for the Panthers. Mike Wilson,
the Panthers newly acquired defenseman, was knocked unconscious
during the second period after a frightening collision with the
Islanders' Steve Webb near center ice. Wilson was motionless on the
ice for several minutes before he was helped to the locker room and
taken to the hospital where he was kept overnight with a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Kvasha, the Panthers' rookie wing, sustained a separated
shoulder in the third period. Those injuries come two days after
the star forward Pavel Bure had season-ending knee surgery.

DEVILS SET SIGHTS ON BIGGER GOALS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils finished the month the same
way they started it. Their lopsided 7-1 victory over the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim Wednesday night at Continental Arena was their
seventh victory of the month, clinched a playoff spot and put the
Devils a step closer to the Atlantic Division title.
</P>
<P>
   After ties in their previous two games after slow starts, the
Devils came out with spark and enthusiasm, scoring three goals in a
span of six minutes before the game was 10 minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were so coordinated from defense to attack that they
caused disarray in the Mighty Ducks, who came into New Jersey with
a two-game winning streak and two of the league's top snipers in
Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came on a night of flawless hockey, from the
goaltending of Martin Brodeur to the last forward on the Devils'
fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph made the Devils a strong candidate to become the
first team to capture a third consecutive divisional title since
the Philadelphia Flyers did it 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through this scenario before, chasing titles and
losing in the playoffs,'' said Bobby Holik, who ended a scoring
slump with his first goal in 14 games Wednesday night. ``You can't
get distracted with minor goals like division titles. Nobody is
talking about the division title. It's all about playing well, like
we did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were so effective that five of their players scored
goals to end long slumps.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Holik ending a slump, Kevin Dean scored his first
goal of the season, Dave Andreychuk scored his first in three
months, Vadim Sharifijanov scored his first in two months and Randy
McKay found the target for the first time in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   With only two losses in March, the Devils, 40-22-11 over all and
9-2-4 in their last 15 games, seem as if they are peaking at the
right time. They have nine games remaining before the National
Hockey League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving in the right direction,'' Dean said. ``We're
starting to get production from guys, and we're getting ready for
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils clinched a playoff spot as a result of Florida's loss
to the Islanders, putting Coach Robbie Ftorek's mind at ease. As
recently as a week ago, Ftorek refused to address any talk about
his team's possible matchup in the first round of the playoffs by
proclaiming, ``We're not in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Devils' first-round opponent will be the Buffalo
Sabres and Dominik Hasek, who played the Devils to a 1-1 tie here
eight days ago and will meet them again in Buffalo with three games
left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Sharifijanov started the scoring with his eighth goal of the
season, 3 minutes 6 seconds into the game. Then McKay extended the
lead with his 17th goal 1:32 later. Holik gave the Devils a
three-goal lead 9:03 into the game, before Kariya narrowed the gap
30 seconds later with his 34th goal for Anaheim (33-29-11).
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk's 12th goal of the season and first since Dec. 28
allowed the Devils to regain their three-goal lead with 2:37 left.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage was extended to five by the end of the second
period on Sharifijanov's second goal of the night and Sergei
Brylin's fifth before Dean scored the only goal in the last period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played with effectiveness even though they were
missing Lyle Odelein (bruised right knee), Jason Arnott (bruised
hip), Denis Pederson (sore back) and Jay Pandolfo (bruised
shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   They also played without Bob Carpenter for the final two periods
because of back spasms.

OLD-SCHOOL SHURMUR RAISES DEFENSE TO HIGHER DEGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ They call him Fritz. Have for almost 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Leonard Frank Shurmur how it is that he goes by Fritz, and
only Fritz, and the Seahawks' new defensive coordinator can't help
but break into a hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, my grandfather had a red-haired cocker
spaniel named Fritz,'' Shurmur offers. ``As I was crawling around
on the floor, every time he'd call the dog, I went. So that's how I
got the name. I'm named after a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur laughs again and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever calls me Leonard,'' he says. ``I've always been
Fritz.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur, and the game of football, have come a long way since
those days of rug-ratting with his grandfather's pooch in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Now 66, Shurmur is entering his 45th year of coaching football
and 24th in the National Football League. He came to Seattle from
Green Bay in January when former Packers head coach Mike Holmgren
took the job of Seahawks general manager and coach. Shurmur built
his reputation as one of the best and most innovative coaches in
the league during stints with the Detroit Lions, New England
Patriots, Los Angeles Rams, Phoenix Cardinals and the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Under that thinning patch of smoke-white hair is the mastermind
that devised so many of the defenses that have altered the course
of the game. Behind those wire-rim glasses are eyes than can
analyze and dissect every nuance of an opposing offense, and also
stop a 250-pound linebacker in his tracks with one fixed gaze.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz is a trip, man,'' says Eugene Robinson, a Pro Bowl free
safety with the Packers and Seahawks before jumping to Atlanta last
year. ``First, he'd come out in those little, messed-up gray sweats
that he wears. So he looked like Burgess Meredith in `Rocky.' Then,
he'd lay into us with that gravely voice and spit was flying
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just come back at him with, `One more round, Rock,' and
we'd start doing the `Rocky' theme song and dancing around like we
were boxing. That's what's cool about Fritz; you can joke with him
as if he's one of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Shurmur has not forgotten one of the first things
he learned about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never remove the word game from football, and game means
fun,'' he says. ``I have never ever had someone do a better job
with a frown on his face than with a smile on his face. So we laugh
and we joke around a little bit. But when it's time to go, we go.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shurmur, to twist another movie analogy, has taken a ``Star
Trek'' approach to his coaching. That is, taking his defenses where
no defenses have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz has been extremely innovative,'' says Hudson Hauck, who
was on the same Los Angeles Rams' staff with Shurmur in the 1980s
and now coaches the offensive line for the Dallas Cowboys. ``A
couple of times when we were coaching with the Rams together, we'd
break the huddle in practice and just stop because he was running a
defense we or no one else had ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them was the ``Eagle'' defense that used only two down
linemen and five linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five really good linebackers, and we didn't have many
defensive linemen,'' Shurmur says with a shrug. ``So it seemed
almost a sin to have really good players sitting on the bench while
you're playing with guys who aren't as good. So that `Eagle'
defense was born.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first or the last unexpected delivery by this
doctor of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, while coaching at the University of
Wyoming, Shurmur unleashed the blitz on college football. Later,
while with the Cardinals, he devised the ``Big Nickel'' that uses
four linemen, two linebackers and five defensive backs, and has
become as much part of football as the shotgun formation. Once,
while entering a game against the Philadelphia Eagles and
scrambling quarterback Randall Cunningham, Shurmur was down to one
healthy lineman so he deployed his Packers defense in a 1-5-5 that
robbed Cunningham of his lanes to run or pass.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of other examples. Mention Shurmur's names to
other coaches and the word innovative usually follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the No. 1 thing about Fritz, he's not afraid to change
things to help the team win,'' says Joe Bugel,who hired Shurmur to
coach the Cardinals' defense in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that,'' Shurmur responds, ``comes about as a result of
survival as much as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   More of it comes about because Shurmur dreads doing something a
certain way just because that's the way it has always been done or
not trying something just because it never has been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two statements stick at me, and what they do is refute
any responsibility to be creative,'' Shurmur says. ``That says,
`Hey, I find a comfort zone, I find guys who will fit into my
scheme and if they can't fit into my scheme I can't use them.' That
seems to be a little bit stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur is not stupid. He has helped turn playing defensive
football into a science and is the author of four books on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz is a very intelligent football coach,'' Houck says.
``Not only is he real sharp and cerebral, he's also old school.
What he teaches is physical, get-down-to-basics, play-hard
football. That allows him to take some defensive sets and be
creative with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur has yet to determine exactly what he will do with a
Seahawks defense that led the NFL by scoring 10 TDs and the AFC by
collecting 53 sacks last season, but also allowed an average of
355.6 yards per game to rank 27th in the league. It's too early.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's quarterbacks camp he has been stressing
fundamentals, effort and precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to implement a scheme wide enough and broad
enough so we can identify the skills our guys have and find the
best spots for them,'' he said. ``It's kind of a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase was reviewing last year's games on video tape.
This week's camp is the second phase. The next phase will be seeing
the players perform in full pads, which won't happen until training
camp opens at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Shurmur will continue to teach and scheme.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur goes back so far that what is now considered old school
was then the only school. He began his coaching career in 1954 as a
graduate assistant at his alma mater, Albion College, a small
liberal arts college in Michigan that did not have spring football.
So Shurmur spent his springs compiling the knowledge that remains
the base for everything he does. He made trips to the Michigan
State, where he became a sponge for anything offered by Spartans
head coach Duffy Dougherty and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take the last $5 of grocery money and put enough gas in
the car to get from Albion to East Lansing, and then I'd sleep on
somebody's floor once I got there,'' Shurmur says. ``I had an
interest to see if I could progress in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur did take the next step, moving to Wyoming in 1962 and
eventually becoming head coach in 1971. He continued his learning
process. While at Wyoming, he would make trips to the St. Louis
Cardinals' training camps to study under defensive assistant
coaches Chuck Drulis and Jim Champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Shurmur really blossomed into his role as a beautiful
schemer during a nine-year stint with the Rams (1982-90), in part
because they were forced to play the San Francisco 49ers twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that was the best decade of
football anybody ever played in the National Football League. If
you didn't play well against the 49ers, they could just kill you,''
says John Robinson, the Rams head coach at that time and now coach
at UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers compiled a 96-30-1 regular-season record and won three
Super Bowls between 1983-90, when Shurmur was the Rams' defensive
coordinator. Six of those losses were to the Rams, and three times
Shurmur's defense held the 49ers to fewer than 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz always managed to come up with stuff that hurt them,''
Robinson says.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson talks about Shurmur being ``grounded in football and
grounded in life.'' He first saw it in the way Shurmur handling
being elevated to defensive coordinator in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz doesn't have an ego that gets in the way of success,''
Robinson says. ``Some of the guys who get into these coordinator
positions, their level of genius obscures all else _ including
winning and losing and the best overall interest of the team. Those
kinds of things don't get in the way with Fritz.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson continued to see it in the way Shurmur handled not
getting a head-coaching position in the NFL when less-qualified
assistant coaches did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz is and basically always has been a happy man. Happy with
his family. Happy with his life,'' Robinson says. ``It was always a
treat to go to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur's football philosophy has three tenets: play hard and
fast; play well together; and play efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   They roll from his mouth like a mantra, and the Seahawk players
will be hearing them in their sleep before the end of the first
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur inherits a defense that features four Pro Bowl players _
linebacker Chad Brown, defensive end Michael Sinclair, cornerback
Shawn Springs and defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy _ and made up for
a lack of consistency with big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur won't stand for such contradictory efforts. Before he
will allow his new players to spin off into what looks like some
scheme from another football galaxy, they must be grounded in the
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the moving around we did, we simplify what we
do,'' says LeRoy Butler, the Packers Pro Bowl strong safety. ``If
you get too fancy, that's when you have a lot of breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   And breakdowns are the quickest way to see the dark side of
Shurmur, especially defensive penalties that prolong offensive
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty volatile guy. Always have been,'' Shurmur says.
``So I tell the guys, `Just don't hold me responsible for anything
I say between 1 and 4 o'clock on Sunday, and I won't hold it
against you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur recalls getting more than one disbelieving glance from
defensive end Reggie White during his sideline snits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie used to kind of look at me and shake his head,''
Shurmur says. ``I'd tell him, `Reg, that's why the Good Lord put
you on this earth _ to take care of my soul.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some expected Shurmur to retire after last season, what with
Holmgren moving to Seattle. Shurmur admits he thought Green Bay
would be his final coaching stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose someday something will tell me it's time to go, or
someone will tell me,'' Shurmur says. ``But I still come to work
each day with the same excitement I did 45 years ago. My wife says
there's something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fans of Shurmur's old-school ways can only hope that
excitement is contagious.

ROOKIE MCCOY KEEPS IT REAL WITH POWERFUL START

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ An immediate urge is to refer to him as ``The Real
McCoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jelani McCoy has burst onto the court after being
virtually obscure to fans for most of this season, displaying what
the Sonics knew from the time they drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   Around the basket, McCoy is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to describe his eye-popping penchant for rejecting
shots is to say that the blocks are the real intimidating kind. He
often plays with an expression that is real mean. His overall
skills are raw. But McCoy makes it obvious that he is real
comfortable on the court.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's recent play has impressed to the point that a borrowed
nickname isn't justice for the 6-foot-10 forward/center. He has
blossomed into one of the team's most aggressive forces down low.
There is nothing ambiguous about that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown a lot better focus than he was advertised to
have,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal, who plans to use McCoy
often Thursday night against the young, athletic Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been enthusiastic and working hard. He's really been
showing that he can play whenever he had a chance. That, coupled
with Vin (Baker's) injury and us needing help inside, it was a
natural thing to see what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been real impressive. He's really making a case for
increased playing time because of his shot-blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's past three games have been most impressive since he was
activated Friday. He's averaged eight points, five rebounds and 2.3
blocks during the first three games of the Sonics' current
five-game, six-night road trip.
</P>
<P>
   That production has come in 19 minutes a game. The impact of
having McCoy, and fellow rookie forward Vladimir Stepania, has been
more noticeable than the statistics suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are changing the flow of games with their exuberant
play. Stepania's slick ball fakes in the paint, solid outside shot
and willingness to scrap for rebounds give the team a different
dimension from the post.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy takes pleasure in being the brute on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He attempts to throw down a vicious dunk just about every time
he receives the ball within arms-length of the rim. The Sonics
haven't seen that attitude since All-Star forward Shawn Kemp was
traded to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kemp, McCoy is strong enough to fight for rebounds. McCoy's
blocks, though, are the consistent and forceful part of his game.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy held his own in his toughest test during Tuesday's loss to
the San Antonio Spurs. He battled the Spurs' Twin Towers _ David
Robinson and Tim Duncan _ and left Duncan with a bold impression.
</P>
<P>
   On one play, McCoy leaped and blocked Duncan's shot attempt from
the foul line, then converted a dunk on the other end. McCoy
finished with four blocks in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't try to block everything, then you get caught in a
jumping-jack situation, going for everybody's head fakes,'' McCoy
said. ``But I try to get the ones that I know I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you make a big play around the basket, it sets up
your area. It sets up your paint. It changes a lot of shots. People
go in the paint second-guessing and looking around to make sure
they can get their shot off. By getting one or two blocks you might
change five or six shots in the course of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is anything but intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   He got that out of his system after playing three seasons at
UCLA, in the NCAA tournament and against NBA players for several
summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm used to mixing it up with pros,'' said McCoy, who left
UCLA as a junior with the school's record in career shooting
percentage (69 percent) and blocked shots (188). ``I'm not going to
be intimidated by anybody. I'm going to play my game, which is to
go out there to hustle and play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always go out there and be aggressive. I'm not going to
let a guy have an easy layup. I'll put him on the line and make him
earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy makes his share of mistakes. He played only 16 minutes
against the Spurs because of foul trouble; Westphal wanted to use
him more. McCoy still struggles with NBA defenses. He doesn't
always know the tendencies of his opponent or when to rotate off
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania has the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're hustling so much and they're so active that even
when they make a mistake, the seem to recover,'' guard Hersey
Hawkins said. ``They've been getting in some kind of position to
make something good happen just by hustling around out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, McCoy wasn't pegged to see much playing
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   His training camp performances weren't noteworthy. McCoy was
also considered sort of a problem child after being suspended from
the UCLA basketball team for violating team and university rules.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Sonics drafted in the second round (33rd overall),
the patented line on McCoy from team insiders was ``he's good
enough to play in this league for 10 years, or he could go the
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is still out, but McCoy is off to a regal start.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing was staying mentally prepared so when I got an
opportunity, I could just play and not go out there and be happy to
be on the court,'' said McCoy, who spent 19 of the first 25 games
on the injured list. ``You get down (being on the bench). You
always want to earn your check. It's just a matter of keeping your
head and having patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely exciting (to play). But at the same time I'm
not going to go out there like a little kid. I have to act like an
adult and handle my business, which is what this game is all
about.''

STARS WIN UGLY, LOSE MODANO TO INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It wasn't pretty, but it sure was humorous.
</P>
<P>
   In what might have been their ugliest game of the season, the
Stars survived a 6-4 victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning last
night.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Stars lost Mike Modano to a first-period
groin strain that likely will keep him out seven to 14 days. Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said Modano, who was reaching for a loose puck
at the time of the injury, likely will miss three to five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that was one awful hockey game,'' Hitchcock said. ``What
you saw was a great game of \Ryouth pickup hockey\S. We ended up
winning, so we get the ice cream cones.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans couldn't tell by the performance, but the Stars improved
their NHL-best record to 47-15-12, good for 106 points.
</P>
<P>
   With eight games remaining in the regular season, that's already
the second-best record in Stars franchise history _ the team had
109 points last season _ and is 66 points better than the
Lightning, who fall to a league-worst 17-50-6.
</P>
<P>
   With Modano out of the lineup, the Stars should be able to take
a better look at their young players. Two Stars players _ Jon Sim
and Brad Lukowich _ scored their first NHL goals last night, and
young forwards Grant Marshall and Jamie Langenbrunner stepped up
their play in the absence of Modano and Guy Carbonneau, who
suffered a sprained ankle and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we had some poor players, we also had some good
players,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars dominated the first period and leaped to a 3-1 lead on
strong plays by Langenbrunner, Marshall and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull carried the puck in on a breakaway and took Lightning
goalie Corey Schwab out of the play midway through the first
period. Lehtinen then swooped in to scoop in the rebound and it was
1-0 at the 10:37 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning's Stephane Richer then rambled in to push a goal
past Roman Turek and tie the game just over a minute later.
Langenbrunner answered with a wrister from the off wing at the
15:50 mark and Marshall gave the Stars a seemingly insurmountable
lead when he made it 3-1 at the 17:37 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Why insurmountable? Turek (15-2-3) had yielded three goals in
only four previous games this season and had not yielded four
before last night.
</P>
<P>
   But the scrappy Lightning wouldn't go away and the
not-so-scrappy Stars defense wouldn't settle down. Darcy Tucker
scored twice for the Lightning in the second period off great plays
from Michael Nylander to tie the score at 3-3 heading into the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who are 12-2-5 when tied after two periods, quickly
took the lead once again on Sim's goal, a wrister from the slot set
up by Marshall. But Richer scored his second of the game at the
7:14 mark to tie the score once more.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor coughed up the puck on the power
play and then let Richer walk around him for the game-tying goal in
what appeared to be a complete Stars' breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lightning defense proved even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk whipped in a snap shot from 35 feet to get the
game-winner at the 11:10 mark of the third period. It was
Nieuwendyk's 24th goal in 62 games this season and his eighth game
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich then added his first NHL goal when Marshall made a
smooth feed off a transition play with 1:11 remaining to seal the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could bundle this up as a ride and sell it to Disney
World,'' Hitchcock concluded. ``If there was ever justice for two
practices back to back, it's now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Stars will practice hard for the next two
days before traveling to St. Louis for a game against the Blues on
Saturday.

NEUHEISEL READY TO FOCUS ON FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The 23rd football coach in University of Washington
history fields a team for the first time Thursday, and Rick
Neuheisel hopes any April Fool's Day shenanigans are well behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by recruiting violations in the first month after he was
hired by the UW and sharply criticized by Colorado boosters,
players and writers for leaving the Buffaloes, Neuheisel begins
spring practice eager to get on with the more predictable business
of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting a 6-6 team that returns 48 lettermen after losing 20
to graduation, including three starting offensive linemen,
Neuheisel's first order is to find ``a core group of guys who are
committed'' not only to him but to turning the Huskies' fortunes
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't squander any day,'' he said Wednesday. ``This is not
a team that has the luxury of just showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38 the third-youngest coach in Division I, Neuheisel promises
a fresh start for the UW program and its players while treading
lightly on Husky football traditions. How does he want his team to
respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play fast and furious and look like we're
having a blast,'' said Neuheisel, who replaces the fired Jim
Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the coach is approaching spring practice with an open
mind, saying he chose not to spend hours poring over video on
players so that he can evaluate them on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come into this with any preconceived
notions,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   That even extends to Brock Huard's replacement at quarterback, a
position that Marques Tuiasosopo would appear to have locked up.
Neuheisel said Tuiasosopo reminds him of Kansas State's Michael
Bishop or the Pittsburgh Steelers' Kordell Stewart, a quarterback
Neuheisel coached at Colorado in his one year as an assistant
before succeeding Bill McCartney as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuiasosopo's ability, ``the option will be a threat for
us,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players returning for the spring, there are five starters
on offense and eight on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fringe guys have to realize that if they're going to be on the
team, they have to come into the center,'' he said, promising not
to ``weed out'' any players until they've had a chance to prove
what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   Going into spring practice, only two players have left the team
for reasons other than graduation: sophomore tight end Kevin Cooper
transferred after the Oahu Bowl and freshman defensive back Darnell
Parhms was declared academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define his coaching philosophy, Neuheisel said he plans
to be the overall administrative head of the program in its initial
stages, rather than one of the main teachers and coordinators on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that you have someone overseeing the
whole system,'' he said. ``My role needs to be evaluating and
making adjustments as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   He has former UW and Seahawk assistant Keith Gilbertson to serve
as assistant head coach and former Troy Aikman tutor Steve Axman to
coach the quarterbacks, a responsibility Neuheisel assumed until
his last year at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He also has Randy Hart, a Lambright assistant, returning to
coach the defensive line, a group that Neuheisel believes will
continue to be a source of strength with the return of Mac Tuiaea
and Jabari Issa. Defensively, the Huskies might try a new
three-down front line in passing situations, but Neuheisel doesn't
see a major change in focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Hart has done a great job and there's a reason we led
the nation in pressuring the quarterback,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, some of the questions might not be answered by the
end of spring practices, which culminate April 24 with the 1 p.m.
annual spring game. Neuheisel hopes to revive the inconsistent
Husky running game, but isn't yet sure how his inexperienced
offensive line will respond or if incoming freshman Paul Arnold
will be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't want to run,'' Neuheisel said. ``But
you have to have the ability to run the ball effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's a former quarterback and quarterbacks coach,
that doesn't mean Neuheisel lives and dies with a passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I want to throw the ball. But I'm not of the mind that
you have to throw to get offense,'' he said. ``... I'm not locked
into any particular system. I'm locked into making defenses
behave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies open the regular season with a nationally televised
ESPN Thursday night game on Sept. 9 at Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me a great opportunity because the spotlight will
be on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HUSKY NOTES: Spring practices are open to the public, beginning
Thursday at 3:35 p.m., the time for all weekday practices. The
first scrimmage is April 9 at 4 p.m., with the second scrimmage at
10 a.m. April 17. The first practice in full pads is Saturday at
9:25 a.m. ... Three players will not participate in spring
practices: Senior inside linebacker Lester Towns still is
recovering from foot surgery in January; senior tailback Maurice
Shaw is recovering from back surgery; and junior wide receiver
Ja'Warren Hooker is running track this spring.

FINLEY HURT IN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE ELSINORE -- With the news of shortstop Gary DiSarcina
having to miss the first three to four months of the season still
fresh in their minds, the Angels took another blow Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Chuck Finley, pitching against Oakland in the team's
final spring game in Tempe, Ariz., suffered a bruised left tricep
after getting nailed with a line drive off the bat of the
Athletics' Jason Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who threw out Giambi on the play, subsequently was
removed from the game after facing only three batters and throwing
20 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' probable Opening Day starter is listed as day-to-day
after being relieved by Scott Schoeneweis. Finley left Tempe Diablo
Stadium without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last day of camp, what else can go wrong? Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``Luckily, he's fine.
</P>
<P>
   Finley allowed a leadoff double to Tony Phillips and a walk to
Ryan Christenson before suffering the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Finley's injury didn't reach many on the Angels squad
here for the team's other exhibition game Wednesday night against
the organization's top minor league prospects at the Lake Elsinore
Diamond, home of the Angels Single-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   But outfielder Jim Edmonds certainly is one player tired of
talking about the team's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys just need to step up and stop making excuses, said
Edmonds, who sat out Wednesday's game, but not because of any
serious injury. ``Enough has been said about it and I think it's
time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Besides DiSarcina's situation taking a turn for the worse
Tuesday, the Angels also traded veteran third baseman Dave Hollins
to Toronto and released relief pitcher Rich DeLucia.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa, one of DeLucia's bullpen comrades last
season, said he was a bit surprised by the club's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised because he did kind of the same job as me,
said Hasegawa, the Angels busiest reliever a year ago. ``But we
have a lot of good pitchers like (Mark) Petkovsek, (Mike) Magnante,
Toby (Borland), (Mike) Fyhrie. Those guys are all good.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa said he doesn't think his role will change this season
and expects to continue putting in plenty of work as a middle
reliever or set-up man for closer Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can be a long reliever, short reliever, it doesn't
matter, Hasegawa said. ``I can do everything.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) In Wednesday night's exhibition, Angel regulars who
started were left fielder Darrin Erstad, first baseman Mo Vaughn,
designated hitter Todd Greene and center fielder Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn played only the first inning and grounded out to second
in his only at-bat. Greene was scheduled to play several innings,
but those plans had to be altered.
</P>
<P>
   In his first plate appearance, Greene was struck in the chest on
a pitch by former Bonita High standout Matt Wise. Greene stayed in
the game and actually ended up scoring a run later in the inning,
but did not return. The extent of his injury was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels major league club defeated a team of its minor league
all stars, 4-2 as Petkovsek pitched one-hit ball over the first
three innings and struck out four before being replaced by
Hasegawa, who pitched the next two, allowing a run on two hits.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Coach Rod Carew, who served as acting manager Wednesday,
said Collins is still toiling with the decision of who will be the
everyday shortstop until DiSarcina returns sometime after the
all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Angels acquired two candidates through
trades, Andy Sheets from San Diego and Tomas Perez from Toronto.
Sheets appears to be the front runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't made up his mind yet, Carew said of Collins. ``We're
just going to have to play (Sheets) as much as possible and see
where he is. (Coach) Larry (Bowa) is going to work with him the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) The Angels next game comes Friday night at Edison Field
against the Dodgers in what will be the only meeting in the
traditional Freeway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Before the spring, the Dodgers asked out of the final two games
so they could play host to the New York Yankees on those days.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds didn't seem too fazed by the snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care anything about the Dodgers right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Former Angel Carney Lansford served as the minor league
team's manager Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lansford, who played for the Angels from 1978-80, will manage
the organization's Triple-A team in Edmonton this season.

CELTICS SPUTTER, FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Gaston watched the Celtics lose a game at the
FleetCenter Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. He was probably as agitated as the
16,915 people who observed with him. But at least he didn't boo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that opens up an interesting debate: Should Gaston
have been howling with the others during the Celtics' 87-72 loss to
the Pistons? If he had, no one would have said that his
dissatisfaction had anything to do with his position as chairman of
the board. No, it wasn't the type of game that irritated
millionaires who own basketball teams. It was a game that offended
basketball fans, regardless of their economic status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, we'll take the end result,'' Grant Hill
said when the drab game was over.
</P>
<P>
   That was easy for Hill to say. He plays for the Pistons, a group
that has won 19 games this season. The Celtics? They have lost 19
games. They have lost four consecutive games at home. In three of
those games, they have walked off the court accompanied by two
sounds: music booming from big speakers and boos booming from
people with big lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night they scored 15 points in the first quarter and
33 for the entire first half. And they had to struggle for that 33,
needing a Paul Pierce runner with five-10ths of a second remaining
to get them there. Red Auerbach watched all of this from a seat
near Gaston's. He certainly didn't need to dig through his ``Red on
Roundball'' archives to see what the problem was in this one. It
seemed to be obvious, although the Celtics would provide a
different explanation later. The Celtics couldn't shoot. They
missed several layups and mid-range jumpers. They had scored 34
points in the first quarter during their win in Charlotte one night
earlier, but there were no signs of that game.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce (20 points) and Ron Mercer (16) were the only starters
who made at least half their shots. Antoine Walker was 5 of 15 from
the field, but did have 10 rebounds and 18 points. The team's
captain also was harrassed most of the night by injured Pistons
swingman Jerry Stackhouse. When Walker put up a shot, Stackhouse
would yell from the bench, ``Shoot it _ that's what we want you to
do.'' Walker also seemed to have trouble with the defense of Jerome
Williams, although he said afterward, ``To be honest with you, I
don't even think about him.''
</P>
<P>
   So after hearing about the Celtics' 15-point first quarter,
their 10-point halftime deficit, their 41 percent shooting, and
their three quarters of scoring in the teens, you are convinced
that offense was the problem, correct?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Offense was a problem, but not the problem. It was
not The Problem because the Pistons weren't shooting so well
themselves. When that happens, defense becomes the story. The
Celtics didn't do a good job on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we did not put a great effort forward,'' Pierce said.
``We were outhustled. They beat us to all the loose balls. We were
not able to get the little things done tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Take their defense of Hill. Everyone knows that the
6-foot-8-inch forward must be double-teamed. The Celtics did that
and limited Hill to one first-half field goal. What they did not do
was rotate on defense once Hill made his move. What that means,
simply, is that Hill's teammates moved when he moved. So everybody
was moving except the Celtics. And when they decided to move, they
moved too late.
</P>
<P>
   That became obvious in the fourth quarter, when the game was
still winnable, despite Boston's poor offense. It was 70-62 with
just over six minutes left. Jud Buechler had the ball. He was wide
open for a 3-pointer. He made it. Less than a minute later, he
stole the ball from Walker and got open for a 3. He made it. In
between those hoops, Pierce made a short jumper. But offense was
not the problem when the Celtics were defending like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This basketball team has to have a common denominator,''
Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ``It has to be defense. You can't
deflate because your shot may not go in or your layup doesn't go
in. You have to keep your spirits high at the defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he was disappointed with the team's performance.
Kenny Anderson mentioned that the Celtics were outrun the entire
night. Pistons coach Alvin Gentry beamed about Lindsey Hunter,
whose 17 points and six assists inspired the coach to say, ``He's
playing so good it's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are not stunned. They have seen some strange things
happen to them this season. So strange that on a night when they
score a meager 72 points, they complain about their defense.

<P>
   For years the Kosovars confined their opposition to Serb rule to
nonviolent protests. When the Croat president Franjo Tudjman urged
them to rise in 1991, at the height of Croatia's war with
Yugoslavia, the Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova refused. ``We would be
massacred,'' he told me in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But after Croatia and then Bosnia broke away, the Kosovars
frustration with Rugova's tactics boiled over and so the KLA was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the Kosovo Liberation Army early last year were
dismissed at first as Serbian propaganda, aimed at justifying
Belgrade's worsening repression of the province's 2 million
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But in spring the new rebel army burst onto the world stage,
rapidly overrunning large tracts of the province and even
attempting to take over the large central town of Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``army'' still seemed an exaggeration for the ragtag
groups of farmers and school teachers with rusty rifles and
mismatched uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But they did have some money, funnelled back into Kosovo from
the huge Albanian diaspora based in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs decided to let the KLA overextend itself, in order to
have the excuse to crush both the KLA and the villages and towns
where they were strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive assault last summer, Orahovac and many other
villages were smashed to pieces and thousands of civilians driven
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Serb offensive, which is vastly bigger in scale and
scope, appears to have thrown the KLA completely onto the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told to make no offensive attacks on the
Serbs,'' said Isa Zymberi, a Kosovar representative in London.
``They don't want it to look as if they are taking advantage of air
strikes. All the units still inside Kosovo are engaged in helping
the civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Zymberi said the KLA was still operating but was crippled by a
lack of weapons. Neighboring Albania, Europe's poorest state, is
unable to do much to help. Tirana is also wary of openly flouting
the international arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, which covers
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of arms is the main problem,'' Zymberi said. ``The
KLA enjoys widespread support. Every Albanian supports them. They
would have 200,000 fighters today if they had the arms, but they
have none and have to turn people down as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want is covert arms supplies but they don't seem to
have received any yet,'' says Tim Judah, a Balkan expert who has
studied the KLA in detail.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions against writing off the organization, just because
they are not confronting the Serb tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer they melted away when the Serbs arrived. But after
they had swept through, the KLA soon reappeared behind them,'' he
said. ``The Serbs simply don't have enough men to be everywhere in
Kosovo all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And one KLA source, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the
organization was ``euphoric'' about the support they were starting
to receive from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Once dismissed in the West as ``terrorists,'' they now seem the
West's best alternative to putting in ground troops. ``We are
practically part of NATO now,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ When Ceca began to sing, the crowd around me swayed
with emotion. They cried. They danced with three fingers in the
air, the Serb sign of eternal victory in tribute to the beautiful
young woman on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Ceca's hair was long and brown and she flounced in her perfectly
cut white trouser suit from one end of the stage to the other in
Republic Square, her pearls flashing in the arc lamps.
</P>
<P>
   And around us, her husband's loyal ``Tigers'' _ massive, beefy
men with short-cropped hair dressed in dark blue uniforms _ stood
gazing impassively at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Tigers'' it need hardly be said, are Arkan's boys.
</P>
<P>
   For Ceca, the 24-year old pop-idol Svetlana Raznotovic, is the
third wife of Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as ``Arkan'' and
reintroduced to the great British public on Sunday by Defense
Secretary George Robertson as ``that obnoxious thug.''
</P>
<P>
   The football club owner indicted for war crimes in Bosnia was
said to be among the crowd of 5,000 around us _ he never leaves his
young wife _ but Ceca's presence was what the Serbs of Belgrade
sought. When she raised the microphone to her lips, the crowd fell
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Znam za jedan Grad
</P>
<P>
   Zove se Beograd...'' she crooned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a town, it's name is Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   I know a man who lives there,
</P>
<P>
   But he is a cheat _ he lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as her voice dipped with emotion, Ceca ran her left hand
back through her curls of brown hair and the crowd joined in the
words of her chorus:
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I kissed your lips and they tasted of poison,
</P>
<P>
   I did it just once and you betrayed me...''
</P>
<P>
   This was too much for the crowd. They shouted their delight,
punching their three-fingered salute into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the bronze statue of old Prince Mihaelo Obranovic, a young
man in blue denims set afire a German flag and let the orange, red
and black banner float to the ground, cowled in flames.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of young men in the crowd to approve of such a
gesture, perhaps the very same gentlemen who'd trashed their way
through the French cultural center and the Air France office just
down the pedestrian precinct from Trg Republika.
</P>
<P>
   Through the crowd went several women, handing out small squares
of paper marked as targets, each with a question mark in the
bulls-eye. They all wore them on their lapels. ``Target?'' it said
at the bottom. Were they to be NATO's targets?
</P>
<P>
   The terrible stories coming out of Kosovo had no place in this
square _ indeed, in Belgrade _ Monday. Atrocities against Albanians
were more than incredible _ they were unreal, mythical, part of the
great western plot that had driven the enraged young men to smash
up the American Cultural Center as well and smear its walls with
swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was a moment for Serb pride as Ceca, the mother of
Arkan's latest two children (there were two previous wives) and the
manager of his football team _ Arkan having a little problem of
travelling abroad _ began her second song.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice, magnified to impossible decibels, haunted the
rooftops and flaking walls of downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends have gone and I am here,'' she sang.
</P>
<P>
   The North Star doesn't shine any more
</P>
<P>
   And she used to be my companion.
</P>
<P>
   It's St. George's Day
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not with the one I love.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new, of course, about love songs in war. And if
this is to be Serbia's Vera Lynn, so be it. But Serbia's forces'
sweetheart is a heroine to the lads in blue who stood around us and
paraded behind her on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   They are the very ``Tigers'' who made Arkan's name a byword for
fear along the Drina Valley, the shock troops of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Slavonia in 1991 before moving on to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Are they heading, then, for Kosovo as Robertson claims?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Arkan. Chatting to Serb journalists in a
Belgrade nightclub on Sunday night, he insisted that he would only
take his ``Tigers'' down to fight the British if they crossed over
from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   He said it with a smile _ though not as broad a smile as Ceca
gave us in Republic Square Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Children were hoisted onto fathers' shoulders to watch Serbia's
most popular rock singer while a young woman wandered the crowd
with a poster claiming: ``I am not Monica Lewinski.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange mixture of joy, forgetfulness and fearful abnegation
_ for as usual only the Serbs are victims of this war _ brought
about some odd scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the little yellow car which drove out of the vegetable
market a few minutes later with two cardboard antiaircraft guns
taped to the roof. Or the young man who swooned on the Obranovic
statue while holding Vojislav Seselj's black flag with its skull
emblem. For Seselj's ``White Eagles'' were also represented Monday,
those whose claws proved every bit as cruel as Arkan's Tigers along
the valley of the Drina.
</P>
<P>
   ``In God we Trust, in King and Fatherland,'' it said below the
skull. Old Mihaelo Obranovic would have enjoyed that. Indeed, he
seemed quite at home in the square atop his bronze steed.
</P>
<P>
   When Milutin Garasanin annoyed him back in the 1840s, Mihaelo
was quite happy to see Milutin beheaded and his head impaled on a
spike. These may be long-forgotten conflicts outside the Balkans;
but not for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of the square, someone had stuck up an obituary
notice on the wall although close inspection showed its political
content.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the name of the deceased appears on a white sheet of
paper with a cross at the top. On this particular document, the
name was Clinton and the symbol above his head was a swastika.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Serbs were fighting their dark past, in conflict
with Nazis, Turks, the West, anyone who dared betray them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends have gone and I am here,'' Ceca cried again. She
sang of so much poison and so much betrayal. No wonder the Serbs
loved her. &QL;

   They are the very ``Tigers'' who made Arkan's name a byword for
fear along the Drina Valley, the shock troops of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Slavonia in 1991 before moving on to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Are they heading, then, for Kosovo as Robertson claims?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Arkan. Chatting to Serb journalists in a
Belgrade nightclub on Sunday night, he insisted that he would only
take his ``Tigers'' down to fight the British if they crossed over
from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   He said it with a smile _ though not as broad a smile as Ceca
gave us in Republic Square Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Children were hoisted onto fathers' shoulders to watch Serbia's
most popular rock singer while a young woman wandered the crowd
with a poster claiming: ``I am not Monica Lewinski.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange mixture of joy, forgetfulness and fearful abnegation
_ for as usual only the Serbs are victims of this war _ brought
about some odd scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the little yellow car which drove out of the vegetable
market a few minutes later with two cardboard antiaircraft guns
taped to the roof. Or the young man who swooned on the Obranovic
statue while holding Vojislav Seselj's black flag with its skull
emblem. For Seselj's ``White Eagles'' were also represented Monday,
those whose claws proved every bit as cruel as Arkan's Tigers along
the valley of the Drina.
</P>
<P>
   ``In God we Trust, in King and Fatherland,'' it said below the
skull. Old Mihaelo Obranovic would have enjoyed that. Indeed, he
seemed quite at home in the square atop his bronze steed.
</P>
<P>
   When Milutin Garasanin annoyed him back in the 1840s, Mihaelo
was quite happy to see Milutin beheaded and his head impaled on a
spike. These may be long-forgotten conflicts outside the Balkans;
but not for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of the square, someone had stuck up an obituary
notice on the wall although close inspection showed its political
content.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the name of the deceased appears on a white sheet of
paper with a cross at the top. On this particular document, the
name was Clinton and the symbol above his head was a swastika.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Serbs were fighting their dark past, in conflict
with Nazis, Turks, the West, anyone who dared betray them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends have gone and I am here,'' Ceca cried again. She
sang of so much poison and so much betrayal. No wonder the Serbs
loved her. &QL;

<P>
   There is a sense of deja vu about the ongoing mission of Yevgeny
Primakov, the Russian prime minister, to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Gulf war Primakov visited his ``old friend'' Saddam
Hussein to broker a peace deal with Iraq. Then as now, it would be
impossible for the Western Allies to accept the aggressor's offer
of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   With Saddam it would have meant accepting his seizure of Kuwait.
With Slobodan Milosevic, President of Yugoslavia, it would mean
rewarding his ethnic terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is no reason to denigrate Russian efforts to find
peace. For not the least casualty of the air strikes is the
cooperation on foreign policy and military matters which the West
and the Russians have developed since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A Pan-Slav campaign to defend the Serbs is unlikely. But the
West should not ignore Russia's sense of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia accepted the eastward expansion of NATO and military
cooperation with the West on the grounds that NATO was a defense
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The West is in danger of teaching a generation of Russians to
distrust international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the West to be sympathetic to Russian's sense of
hurt is strengthened by its partial responsibility for Russia's
economic predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to guide Russia from a command to a market economy
was correct. But the means chosen were far too theoretical and the
pace was far too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists neglected to wait for Russia to develop the
legal and social infrastructure that prevents capitalism from
degenerating into gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the West can afford to listen to Russia's
roars with equanimity. Despite its geographic size and large
population, Russia's economy is smaller than Holland's. It needs
its IMF loans too much to fight for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer term, Russia's sense of betrayal could be
dangerous to the West.
</P>
<P>
   It will increase the appeal of nationalist politicians, such as
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and those people within and close to the army
who regret Russia's loss of status. Both groups will make the task
of developing a liberal and democratic politics in Russia much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A desire to build up the power of Russia could encourage the
meddling in neighboring states and arms trading which the West has
tried to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Small countries with restive Muslim minorities _ Armenia and
Georgia, for instance _ might become fearful of U.S. intervention
and want to tighten their borders with Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage of the Russian people will die down once the Kosovo
campaign is over. The man in the Moscow underground has only the
vaguest idea about Milosevic and the issues at the heart of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the West will have to struggle to reintegrate
Russia in international institutions. The IMF could begin that
process today by providing Russia with a generous loan. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Just after NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia began
last week, Belgrade state television entertained its viewers with
the film, ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a genius to show at such short notice a perfect copy _
equally perfectly subtitled into Serbian _ of Hollywood's fantasy
about an American president who manufactures a totally artificial
war in Albania to escape from private scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer do the people of Yugoslavia have to turn to
Hollywood. For to live in Belgrade just now is to see the Balkan
war through a looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   While BBC World, Sky TV and CNN show a war in which Kosovo
Albanians suffer, Belgrade television portrays NATO's attacks as an
act of international aggression against an innocent nation _ Serbia
_ which is fighting for its life against KLA ``terrorism'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fleeing Albanian refugees, it shows bombed-out Serb
homes in Kosovo, wounded children _ Albanian and gypsy as well as
Serb _ in a damaged Pristina hospital, and a massive haul of arms
captured from Kosovo Albania guerrillas by young Yugoslav soldiers,
one of whom eagerly passes on his love for his mother in Subotica
the moment a microphone is waved in front of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Even the military briefings are a mirror-image of NATO press
conferences. While RAF officers turn up to talk to journalists in
Brussels, Yugoslav Air Defense Commander General Spasoje
Smiljanovic invited us for a Yugoslav armed forces military
assessment in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive room dripping with ornate chandeliers and decorated
with two gold twin-headed eagles of Serbia and Yugoslavia, the
general was even equipped with a slide projector and screen to
illustrate NATO air strikes and those countries involved in the
``aggression'' against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A map showed guilty nations colored in purple, the innocent _
and Russia, of course, is a very big innocent _ in white.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic reels off the code-names of NATO jets
involved in the air bombardment with all the panache of a NATO
commander: F-15s, F-16s, F-18s, EAGD ``Prowlers,'' A-10s, E3-Awacs,
Mirages, Tornados, Harriers and B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   When America's downed F-117A ``Stealth'' fighter comes up on the
big screen, the general is in top form. ``It flew from New Mexico
to come to rest on Serb territory,'' he says sarcastically. ``Such
a pity! If it had come as a friend, it would still be flying.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists that Yugoslavia has sustained ``minimal losses''
among its air raid personnel _ just seven soldiers killed and 17
wounded (a lower figure than the weekend's) _ while admitting
``severe damage to stationary facilities and infrastructure''
costing US$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   And while Western television viewers were watching exhausted
Kosovo Albanian refugees talking of Serb executions and ``ethnic
cleansing,'' their Serb counterparts were seeing a badly damaged
hospital in Pristina reported to have been bombed by NATO aircraft
and a damaged maternity ward in which 51 babies were reportedly
rescued from incubators as the air attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   Film at a different clinic showed older children _ said to be
Albanian as well as Serb _ with serious stomach wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Third item on the national news here in the past 48 hours was a
dramatic report of a Yugoslav interception of Albanian
``terrorists'' carrying weapons into Kosovo, 13 of whom had been
killed, the remainder having fled back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The film report _ and the arms _ appeared to be new; they
included a large number of anti-armor weapons, apparently of
Austrian manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo town of Djakovica had been attacked by NATO forces,
viewers were told, and dozens of civilian houses damaged along with
the town's Catholic church and monastery in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs were outraged to be told that the Serb village of
Gracanica had been almost totally destroyed by NATO bombs. Other
reports said that KLA ``terrorists'' had attacked military
positions immediately they had been targeted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been Serb civilian casualties. Monday, for
example, CARE Australia reported that nine Serb refugees from
Krajina _ captured by Croatian forces more than four years ago _
had been killed in the town of Cacak, 85 miles from Belgrade, where
they had been living in an abandoned military barracks attacked by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic, a gruff, grey-haired no-nonsense figure in
smart camouflage fatigues, insisted that Yugoslav air defense
forces had shot down 7 NATO aircraft _ NATO says it has lost only
one _ along with 3 helicopters, over 30 cruise missiles and three
pilotless NATO drone reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies the helicopters although it has made no comment
about lost drones or missiles destroyed by ground fire. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The general went out of his way to praise his Mig-29 pilots. And
indeed, Monday's issue of ``Soldier'' magazine _ the house journal
of the Yugoslav armed forces _ shows that Serb and Montenegrin
pilots are praised as much here as NATO's warriors of the air are
on BBC World.
</P>
<P>
   Mig pilots Nebojsa Nikolic, Predrag Milutinovic, Slobodan Peric
and Ilja Arizanov were all promoted to major by President Slobodan
Milosevic, who also promoted Pilot Zoran Radosavljevic to Captain
First Class.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav medal of honour went to Artillery Colonel Sreo
Malinovic and to Air Force Major General Nikola Grujina for
defending ``the Fatherland's airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the gongs. In reality, Yugoslavia has shrewdly
maintained most of its mobile antiaircraft missile defenses intact,
keeping them deactivated and moving them around the country to
avoid NATO target positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever air raid alerts suggest a threat to Mig airfields,
Yugoslav jets are scrambled, either returning to their air bases
after the alert or _ if their airfields are damaged _ landing on
the great highways that Tito built for just such a purpose more
than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite all the NATO bombing, the Yugoslav armed
forces are far from down and out. Just who, one wonders here these
days, is wagging the dog? &QL;

rescued from incubators as the air attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   Film at a different clinic showed older children _ said to be
Albanian as well as Serb _ with serious stomach wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Third item on the national news here in the past 48 hours was a
dramatic report of a Yugoslav interception of Albanian
``terrorists'' carrying weapons into Kosovo, 13 of whom had been
killed, the remainder having fled back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The film report _ and the arms _ appeared to be new; they
included a large number of anti-armor weapons, apparently of
Austrian manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo town of Djakovica had been attacked by NATO forces,
viewers were told, and dozens of civilian houses damaged along with
the town's Catholic church and monastery in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs were outraged to be told that the Serb village of
Gracanica had been almost totally destroyed by NATO bombs. Other
reports said that KLA ``terrorists'' had attacked military
positions immediately they had been targeted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been Serb civilian casualties. Monday, for
example, CARE Australia reported that nine Serb refugees from
Krajina _ captured by Croatian forces more than four years ago _
had been killed in the town of Cacak, 85 miles from Belgrade, where
they had been living in an abandoned military barracks attacked by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic, a gruff, grey-haired no-nonsense figure in
smart camouflage fatigues, insisted that Yugoslav air defense
forces had shot down 7 NATO aircraft _ NATO says it has lost only
one _ along with 3 helicopters, over 30 cruise missiles and three
pilotless NATO drone reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies the helicopters although it has made no comment
about lost drones or missiles destroyed by ground fire. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The general went out of his way to praise his Mig-29 pilots. And
indeed, Monday's issue of ``Soldier'' magazine _ the house journal
of the Yugoslav armed forces _ shows that Serb and Montenegrin
pilots are praised as much here as NATO's warriors of the air are
on BBC World.
</P>
<P>
   Mig pilots Nebojsa Nikolic, Predrag Milutinovic, Slobodan Peric
and Ilja Arizanov were all promoted to major by President Slobodan
Milosevic, who also promoted Pilot Zoran Radosavljevic to Captain
First Class.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav medal of honour went to Artillery Colonel Sreo
Malinovic and to Air Force Major General Nikola Grujina for
defending ``the Fatherland's airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the gongs. In reality, Yugoslavia has shrewdly
maintained most of its mobile antiaircraft missile defenses intact,
keeping them deactivated and moving them around the country to
avoid NATO target positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever air raid alerts suggest a threat to Mig airfields,
Yugoslav jets are scrambled, either returning to their air bases
after the alert or _ if their airfields are damaged _ landing on
the great highways that Tito built for just such a purpose more
than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite all the NATO bombing, the Yugoslav armed
forces are far from down and out. Just who, one wonders here these
days, is wagging the dog? &QL;

<P>
   In less than a week, the war in Yugoslavia has escalated beyond
NATO's initial aims. The evidence that women and children _ and
worryingly few men _ are fleeing from Kosovo to Albania proves that
the war has become a potentially genocidal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for this falls on Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia. He has exploited Allied air attacks to
step up his policy of eviction and slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to blame NATO for this. But Milosevic's campaign of
terror was heating up while negotiations were still under way with
the Allies and the Kosovo Liberation Army. And there is evidence
that the assault on the Kosovo Albanians began when the
international observers were pulled out, before the war started.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent murder of moderates, including Fehmi Agani, the
main adviser to Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar Albanians' voice of
peace, NATO members must accept that Milosevic has decided to keep
Kosovo as part of Serbia _ without its Albanian-speaking majority.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, NATO's policy must move beyond
attempting to force Milosevic to implement the Rambouillet terms.
Indeed, these are already moribund.
</P>
<P>
   From punishing Serbian aggression in Kosovo, NATO must now act
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   This could be accomplished in two stages. First, NATO must
change tactics. As well as diminishing the Serbian army's potential
to fight, NATO must, in particular, stop the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will have to concentrate its force on the Serbian infantry,
tanks and armored personnel vehicles in the province. High-altitude
hit-and-run bombing missions will have to be supplemented by
lower-altitude attacks on infantry and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan war showed how vulnerable aircraft are at such
heights. Inevitably, therefore, NATO and Western public opinion
must be prepared for the sight of body bags.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO will need to decide how this campaign is to end. It
has already gone on long enough without a focused picture of the
status quo post bellum.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should send in ground troops to establish a protectorate
over Kosovo. This would not only defend the lives of the province's
Albanian-speaking majority but also secure the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, so as to prevent the spread of the
conflict into neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   There is already a partial precedent for this step in the shape
of NATO's presence in Bosnia. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a protectorate is a painful decision for which
there is little political consensus. So far, only Britain's Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have given it their backing.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, the British prime minister, announced in the House
of Commons last week that British soldiers would move into Kosovo
only with the consent of both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a House of Commons exchange with Ashdown, Blair
moved towards this position, pointedly refusing to rule out the
idea of a protectorate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a protectorate will entail casualties, and not a
little cost. Nonetheless, there is no other way, short of an
invasion of Yugoslavia, that NATO can prevent the pogroms that
occurred in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A protectorate would also ease the pressure on Mediterranean
NATO states, including Italy and Greece. Italy's support for NATO
is becoming strained with the arrival of boatloads of refugees on
its shores.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of vacation resorts full of Kosovar refugees, and
beaches filled with antiaircraft batteries, is nightmarish for both
the country's politicians and its tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   NATO must not dither, but resolve this crisis quickly _ not
least to prevent civilian casualties in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is leading all the citizens of Yugoslavia into a dark
and frightening place; for all of their sakes NATO must swiftly
bring the war to a stable conclusion. &QL;

MANY SUCCESS STORIES AT SILVERWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESTLINE, Calif. _ If you believe the doomsayers, the
largemouth bass are all but gone at Silverwood Lake, the Western
San Bernardino Mountains reservoir that has seen major turmoil in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no fish in it. It's one of the worst fisheries in
the state,'' said Pat Marley, an attorney from neighboring
Cedarpines Park who has taken the state to court to make amends for
bass lost in a controversial draining of lake.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality in regard to the size of the fish has definitely
gotten better,'' said Jeff Lee, a Murrieta angling guide and
tournament director for the WON BASS Inland Empire region. ``I
wouldn't put Silverwood on the (tournament) schedule if I wasn't
absolutely convinced it was a good, exciting fishery.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who manage the lake's game fish, hearing such extremes
has become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of perspective and your ability as an
angler,'' said Mike Giusti, a Department of Fish and Game biologist
and one of six members of a court-appointed committee expected to
make recommendations this month on how to return the lake's fishery
to its pre-drawdown condition.
</P>
<P>
   Court battles, misinformation _ one big, confusing mess. ``It's
a soap opera,'' said Silverwood's project manager Charles Keene of
the Department of Water Resources' Southern District in Glendale,
who is embroiled in the legal wranglings requiring the DWR to
return the lake's fishery to full health.
</P>
<P>
   From the scientific end, what is known is that the fishery is
not recovering at the rate anticipated once the DWR's 18-month
drawdown for earthquake retrofitting to the reservoir's outtake
tower was completed in March 1997. That's a big concern to
biologists and anglers alike; fortunately, the San Bernardino
County Superior Court is sorting it out and will require the DWR to
make amends.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is positive, according to Giusti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silverwood has a silver lining, and that is that right now you
can go up there and catch quality bass,'' the biologist noted.
``You are not going to catch a lot, but there are fish in the 2- to
5-pound range available, and there is always a potential to catch
big fish, to 8 pounds plus.''
</P>
<P>
   And fishing is really what it's all about, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I recently pulled into Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area _
about 11 miles of seriously winding Highway 138 blacktop east of
Cajon Junction off the 15 freeway _ on an unseasonably warm Monday
not knowing what to expect. Some folks think the lake was drained
to a salt flat, killing everything in site, and that it's still
drawn down.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the lake is every bit back up to its nearly 1,000
surface acres at an elevation of 3,352 feet; DFG surveys show that
more than 65 percent of the largemouth population was lost to the
drawdown, plunging from an estimated 13,500 bass to about 4,200.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's survey put the count at about 5,500 bass, well below
50 percent recovery and suggesting there is no way the DWR's goal
of reaching 100 percent by March 2002 would be met without help.
</P>
<P>
   At the reservoir's boat ramp I met angling guide Manny Freire of
Spring Valley Lake in Victorville. He was to show me the ins and
outs of early spring bass fishing at Silverwood.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament angler himself, Freire is convinced the fishing is
every bit as good as it was before the drawdown. He hasn't had to
change his technique, favoring a rubber-skirted jig with a brined
pork-rind trailer on a 4/0 hook _ a classic jig 'n' pig setup. And
now he's got more elbowroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the best-kept bass secrets there is,''
said Freire, who uses 12-pound line with ]-ounce jigs and 15-pound
line on {-ounce jigs. ``After the drawdown, people weren't coming
up here because, they said, `They killed off all the bass.' But I
don't see any fish on the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Using my efforts as a gauge, you'd have to side with the
pessimists, for I caught nothing on the day. During this picky bite
punctuated by afternoon winds topping out at about 30 mph, even
Freire managed just a couple of small bass.
</P>
<P>
   But he points to a 13-pound whopper caught two weeks earlier and
the results of a WON BASS tournament held the day before as
evidence many quality bass swim in the lake. Six bass weighing more
than 6 pounds were brought to the scales by the 37 two-angler teams
during the event; the big fish was an 8.38-pounder. There were six
five-fish limits registered, the winners boasting a total weight of
22\ pounds, or 4.45 pounds per bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minds were blown after this last tournament,'' Lee said.
``It just never stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Giusti, who served as weighmaster for the contest, was
encouraged to see there were a lot of big fish. ``But I'm
discouraged to see fewer small fish,'' he said. ``I would rather
have guys say, `I had to catch 50 10-inch fish to get a limit of
five keeper fish.' But there weren't any small fish. You need to
see fish from 2 inches to 12 inches. In most populations, your
largest number of fish are going to be small, below the legal size
limit (12 inches).''
</P>
<P>
   That means the bass are either having unsuccessful spawns or the
young are being preyed upon by the lake's non-game residents _
goldfish, Sacramento blackfish, hitch and carp, which make up more
than 80 percent of the population. Giusti estimates that before the
drawdown the lake enjoyed a 50-50 split of game fish to non-game
species.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations offered in court by Marley and his
petitioners _ including the Southern California Bass Council and
the 53 bass clubs and related organizations it represents _ is to
commercially harvest non-game fish, stock largemouths and install
better artificial habitat for the bass.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed committee will take the suggestions and come
up with a resolution by mid-April, Giusti said. The next court date
to confer on the DWR mitigation process is June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role will be implementing whatever the court says we have
to do,'' said Keene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DWR will cover the cost. It's our responsibility to do
that, and we will meet our responsibilities. That is part of our
mitigation. The intent of the DWR is to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Step back from the legalese for a moment, listen to Freire's
assessment of 27-year-old Silverwood Lake and you'd think it's a
plumber's paradise. It's like a toilet bowl, being constantly
flushed by the California Aqueduct. Sometimes you need everything,
including the kitchen sink, to fool some of these wily
bucketmouths. And there's a nearshore section of the impoundment
called the washing machine, which attracts big bass chasing
windswept baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just hope all the controversy, innuendo and mitigation
comes out in the washing machine. &QL;

<P>
   But Ms. Rothe is involved, because her son is one of 3,000
German soldiers awaiting orders in Macedonia. So she is against the
war in the Balkans, against NATO air strikes, and bitterly opposed
to German participation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe is the founder of ``Mothers Against the War,'' a
movement only a week old but already enjoying national fame.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a heartrending proclamation in the form of a
reader's letter addressed to a Berlin newspaper, accompanied with
her telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has received more than 1,000 calls, appeared on
television talk shows, and there is now talk of sending her to sort
it all out with Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have touched a nerve in Germany,'' she says. ``I hear the
women crying on the telephone for their beloved, their sons or
their husbands. They tell me about their suffering, and sometimes
about the medical treatment they are receiving for their anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Balkans, no country in Europe has felt the trauma of
war as acutely as Germany. A nation of pacifists for two
generations, Germans now find themselves striding into the quagmire
of Yugoslavia, with soldiers and their relatives at home mentally
unprepared for shedding blood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe's 24-year-old son _ she will not give his first name
because ``I've already caused him enough trouble'' _ signed up for
the Bundeswehr four years ago, expecting little travel and even
less action.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, they have all been waiting in
Macedonia for an order that up to recently would have been
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lie awake at night, get up at half-past five in the
morning, and the first thing they do is listen to the news,'' Ms.
Rothe says. ``All sorts of questions are swirling in their heads:
`What happened last night? What if they fired a rocket at us? We
would be the perfect target.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe's son bears a weapon but he is a maintenance man for
the tank crews. He will not ride inside the tanks, if they ever set
off for Kosovo, and his gun is for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he and his comrades have done nothing more violent than
polishing the barrels, but the Luftwaffe is busy dropping bombs
Yugoslavia every day, and the possibility of using ground troops is
no longer excluded with as much vehemence as it was only a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe, who in peacetime ran a removals firm in the east
German town of Erfurt, is trying to prevent that by giving peace a
chance. ``I heard an interview with a Serbian mother, in which she
said: `I want my son, I don't care about Milosevic.' That's how I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Her group proposes that ``all weapons fall silent immediately,''
and representatives from all sides uncompromised by past actions
gather around the negotiating table. Also in attendance should be
human-rights experts and an international womens' group.
</P>
<P>
   No, she does not think she is being naive. Naive were the
Western politicians ``who had eaten and drunk with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what kind of a guy he is,'' she says. ``They have
given him one line: `This way or we bomb you.' And what have they
achieved? Did they not force the Serbs to close ranks? Are we not
risking a Third World War here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit in front of the television in the evenings, and see
these wonderful computer simulations,'' she continues. ``And they
report that things are getting worse for the Serbs. And that one
atrocity is worse than the other atrocity. Somehow I just don't
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers. But German public opinion, despite
the traditional misgivings, is slowly coming around to the
``something must be done'' view.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest polls, 28 percent reject the use of
ground troops, but 47 percent think the Bundeswehr should not stay
out if NATO soldiers were to cross into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But faced by the pictures of fleeing Albanians, support for air
strikes has increased, with 62 percent of Germans now in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the east, where a few days ago less than half of those
polled approved of the bombing, there is now a narrow majority in
favor. Three-quarters of west Germans approve.
</P>
<P>
   While German newspapers remain at best skeptical, and
politicians on the left campaign for a cease-fire, one group of
Germans have undergone a spectacular metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are pacifists no longer. According to the latest
polls, 72 percent of Green supporters say the air strikes are
justified.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yugoslav government wanted to destroy NATO's resolve by
engineering a humanitarian catastrophe, the gambit has clearly
failed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The images of civilians in flight from organized brutality are
painfully familiar here, triggering knee-jerk reactions that
Germans thought they had purged long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, when I look at Milosevic, he reminds me of
Hitler,'' Ms. Rothe says. If her son were not in the firing line,
maybe even she could be persuaded to support bombing the Serbian
leader to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't somebody poison him?'' she asks, only half in jest. &QL;

<P>
   The Balkans have a long history of bitter wars, but this is the
first one to be fought out in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies may not be prepared, as yet, to commit ground forces,
but they had no hesitation in sending in the Internet against
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Websites set up by NATO and the British government were
pronounced a great success in the propaganda campaign, with
thousands of calls from Serbian surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack was swift, sneaky and showed the ruthlessness
of the Yugoslav leader, who has already been compared to Pol Pot by
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   His regime unleashed ``germ warfare'' against the NATO website,
sending in a wave of macro viruses. Then came phase two of the
operation, a specially manufactured program which carpet bombed the
site.
</P>
<P>
   This week the British site, set up by the Ministry of Defense,
with help from the Foreign Office, was reportedly safe from the
``mad hackers'' of the ``Butcher of Belgrade,'' as the tabloids may
put it, and attracting ever-increasing number of callers from
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The site, led by a team under Richard Davies of the Defense
Information Department, was originally set up last October. From
the March 1 to 20 it received 1,024 calls. After air strikes began
the number climbed to 8,600.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours since it was translated into Serbo-Croat, 1,500
``hits'' came in, 1,400 from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the damage to NATO, service spokesman Jamie Shea said
in Brussels: ``Since the 28th of March the service from our
Internet home page has been erratic to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at this very carefully and it seems that we
have been dealing with some hackers in Belgrade who have hacked
into our website and caused line saturation of the server by using
`ping' bombardment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has also been saturated by one individual who is currently
sending us 2,000 e-mails a day and we are dealing with macro
viruses from Yugoslavia into our e-mail system.''
</P>
<P>
   The information superhighway has emerged as one of the key
weapon in the propaganda war. One of the major Serbian sites is the
home page of the Serbian Ministry of Information, which, among
other things, contains reports on ``Albanian terrorist activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Network has become a rallying point against Western
figures such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, who are
photographed with the caption ``Wanted: War Criminal'' underneath.
</P>
<P>
   British Defense Secretary George Robertson said: ``They tell
lies about us. We will go on telling the truth about them and
making sure that the unfortunate people of Yugoslavia have access
to the truth...about Milosevic and his brutal repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Jones, group editor of news for AOL, one of the world's
largest online service providers, said this was the first major war
in which the Internet had played such a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``It is pretty spectacular. There are so many
eyewitness reports and people are clambering over each other with
their websites, desperate to get them out. There is so much
information that, at worst, it may be confusing, but at best it is
the ultimate freedom of information.'' &QL;

PICK A LIVELY BAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY BRIGHTENBURG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With its cold, nutrient-rich ocean currents
sustaining a broad ecosystem, Southern California is world famous
for its live-bait fisheries. Selecting an active bait is the best
to way to put barracuda, yellowtail, tuna, calico bass, halibut and
white seabass on a party boat.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest bait to capture out of the bait tank _ that is, the
liveliest specimen _ is the one to use because it looks most
natural to the predator and triggers the attack instinct.
</P>
<P>
   Make the task easier by slowly sliding your hand into the bait
tank's hand well and cradling the fish under its belly; trying to
grab the bait from above _ like a seagull swooping in from the sky
_ will only panic it. Or use a small dip net, available at tackle
stores and pet shops. Also look for a bait that is colored slightly
different than the others; it might stand out more in the water and
solicit a strike reaction from the target fish. Avoid exhausted or
damaged baits by not picking those with blood spots, bloody noses
or missing scales.
</P>
<P>
   Now get the bait hooked quickly and into the water, being
careful to ensure it remains as lively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies are hooked sideways through the nostrils or through
the collar _ a bone inside the gill plate _ with a hook ranging in
size from a No. 8 to a No. 1. Sardines (size 1/0 to 5/0 hook) and
mackerel (size 3/0 to 8/0 hook) are hooked through the nose, or
near the anal fin to swim deeper; since an anal-hooked bait tends
to fall off the line more frequently when cast, toss the line
underhand, which is not as forceful as an overhand cast.Mackerel
also can be back-hooked, between the dorsal fin and the head, for
deeper applications. A squid (size 3/0 to 8/0 hook) is hooked
through the mantle, the pointy end away from the head and
tentacles; pin the hook through the tail several times to better
secure the bait.
</P>
<P>
   When fly-lining _ fishing top- and mid-water with little or no
weight on the line _ let the bait swim as free as possible by
peeling line off the reel for it, instead of having the bait pull
line directly off the reel.
</P>
<P>
   Since bait comes with the price of the fishing ticket, change it
frequently, unless otherwise directed by the crew. The smaller the
bait, the quicker the change: anchovies, every 1 to 2 minutes;
sardines, 3 to 5 minutes (or, on anal-hooked baits, until they stop
taking out line); and mackerel, 5 to 10 minutes or longer. Squid,
often tougher to acquire but considered candy by forage fish
whether live or dead, can be soaked until the skipper calls it
quits for the day. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing could have prepared us for the horror of Slobodan
Milosevic's attempt to drive out Kosovo's entire non-Serb
population.
</P>
<P>
   He had done it before, to the Muslims in those parts of Bosnia
claimed as Greater Serbia, but the whole point of NATO's bombing
was to deter him from doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   The first aim of Western policy, therefore, has failed. But that
does not mean the policy was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to threatening military action was to acquiesce
in the slow ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo over a number of years.
This way, the process is crushed into a few weeks, creating a
refugee crisis on a scale not seen since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Yes it is a disaster, but at the same time there is now more
hope that the Albanian-speaking people of Kosovo will ultimately
obtain protection, and that Milosevic and his fellow war criminals
will be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the systematic campaign of terror waged by the
Serbian forces are chilling. Accounts of the terrible suffering of
the refugees on the border between Kosovo and Macedonia should be
enough to convict the Serbian leadership of crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate policy of ``identity elimination,'' in which
Kosovar refugees are stripped of their papers while public records
in the towns they have left are destroyed, is frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Kosovars have fled, of course, the difficulty of justly
restoring the preexisting state is multiplied several-fold.
</P>
<P>
   If a guaranteed peace can be brought to Kosovo _ it could take
months or years _ the returning refugees will face all the problems
of recovering property from crooks and impostors with which postwar
Europe was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, it is the scale of the immediate disaster
that should command our attention. The refugees who are lining the
roads out of Kosovo or camped above the snow-line in Macedonia or
huddled in camps and villages in Albania and Montenegro, urgently
need food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Our moral obligation is even more pressing than in the case of
natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch; it was the British (and
American) government's attempt to protect these people that
provoked their enemies and forced them to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   We have to feed, clothe and house them, by the roadsides and on
the hillsides to start with. And that is why the government has to
open Britain's doors to our share of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Our duty to the people of Kosovo extends much further than
bombing their tormentors by remote control. &QL;

it were legal. That crop is hemp, banned in the United States as
part of the war on drugs. As farmers from Hawaii to North Dakota to

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man in a hurry, Sir John Browne is, by all appearances,
remarkably composed.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, the chief executive of BP Amoco PLC, is a soft-spoken
and charming man who rarely appears ruffled. He is fond of ballet
and pre-Columbian art and often listens to Puccini operas at BP
Amoco's Edwardian headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   For an oil executive, he is unusually sensitive to environmental
concerns and has even had dinner with the leaders of Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sir John, 50, is also known for a relentless drive as he
pushes BP Amoco to take on the behemoths in the industry, Mobil,
Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
   In turning around British Petroleum and acquiring Amoco, he has
cut tens of thousands of jobs and shaped an organization where
there is almost no layer of middle management and constant pressure
to do better.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three months after the Amoco acquisition, he is poised
to pursue another rapid overhaul now that his company is acquiring
the Atlantic Richfield Co. for more than $27 billion. ARCO's board
approved the deal Wednesday night, an executive close to the talks
said. BP Amoco's board approved the deal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO stockholders are expected to receive 0.82 American
depositary receipt of BP Amoco for each of their shares. The
companies are expected to make an announcement Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John declined requests for an interview. Still, based on his
past speeches and interviews and on conversations with other
industry executives, it is clear that Sir John's strategy is to
transform BP Amoco into a company that is at much at home in
Silicon Valley as in the Oil Belt. He has already shaped an
organization where there is almost no layer of middle management
and constant pressure to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hands-on oil man who has mastered what was going in
Silicon Valley,'' said a manager at BP Amoco who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``He adopted American ways and the American work
ethic. He's not someone who came up through the English system.''
</P>
<P>
   The new BP Amoco being constructed looks like no other oil
company. In contrast to the elaborate, centralized structure of
most oil companies, BP Amoco is managed by a about a dozen
executives. They ride herd over more than 140 units, some of which
are still in the process of being set up.
</P>
<P>
   The units are intended to be small enough that managers and
their staffs get to know each other and what is expected of them.
And each unit's performance is reviewed quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a genius for devising motivational structures to get
people to do what he wants them to do,'' said Fergus McLeod, an
analyst with BT Alex. Brown in London.
</P>
<P>
   It was while pursuing a master's degree in business at Stanford
University in the 1970s that Sir John got to know Andrew S. Grove,
one of the founders of the Intel Corp., the world's dominant chip
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, BP Amoco executives say, made the young BP executive
aware of the vast changes coming in information technology and its
implications for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chief executive of British Petroleum in 1995, Sir
John has pushed to knit together the far-flung operations of BP
Amoco by means of thousands of personal computers into what he
describes as a ``virtual team network.'' The system allows widely
scattered employees to work together closely and provides them with
up-to-date information on other units.
</P>
<P>
   He has also encouraged employees to set up home pages on the
World Wide Web, where they describe the skills they have to offer
and share information about technical details such as ways to
better use lubricants for drilling. The goal is to give managers
and employees immediate access to skills and experience that they
can apply to their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an emphasis on information technology, BP Amoco
has sought to emulate the entrepreneurial ethos of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit manager has a performance contract in which financial
and other goals are spelled out and which are closely monitored by
the top executives, who will intervene if problems come up.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Yale School of Management in September, Sir
John, noting that British Petroleum's pending merger with Amoco
would make it one of the 10 largest industrial companies in the
world, said that organization in small units was the key to making
a global company work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned over time that people like to work in relatively
small units, where they can equate effort and results,'' he said.
``Where they can see what they're achieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the units has ``operational freedom,'' he said. ``They
are running their own businesses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But his unflinching cost-cutting has left some executives
bewildered and bitter at methods that leave little room for the
compromise. So far, the reorganization at the newly acquired Amoco
has borne mixed results. Sir John has signaled that he is impatient
with speed of integrating Amoco and has stepped up the pace of job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John is described by executives and analysts as being
obsessed with accountability. Many managers have felt his steady
gaze and deep knowledge of the oil business when he wants to know
why a unit is not meeting his standards or, conversely, is doing so
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong, they can quickly find out before the
end of each quarter,'' McLeod said. ``If something goes right,
there is a structure where it can be shared with everybody very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, the son of an English executive of British Petroleum
and a Romanian mother, spent part of his childhood in Iran, where
he had an intimate look at the oil industry. After leaving
Cambridge University in 1966 with degree in physics, he joined
British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   The company sent him to Alaska as part of the team in Anchorage
that helped bring the vast fields in Prudhoe Bay into production.
He spent most his early career in the the United States, serving as
executive vice president and chief financial officer of the
Standard Oil Co. of Ohio in Cleveland, in which British Petroleum
had acquired a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   At the American company, Sir John reined in big spending on
exploration and cut the staff. He returned to London in 1989 to
revamp British Petroleum's exploration arm.
</P>
<P>
   He scaled back exploration to 10 countries from 30 and cut the
work force by half. His strategy was to focus on a few big fields
and then try to cut the cost of extracting the oil.
</P>
<P>
   His success as head of the exploration arm helped British
Petroleum recover from a huge debt burden and underperforming
businesses like refining.
</P>
<P>
   When he became chief executive, he surprised many in the
industry by forming a joint venture with Mobil to improve refining
and marketing in Europe. He again stunned the industry in August,
with the announcement of the Amoco bid.
</P>
<P>
   For his work in helping turn around British Petroleum, he was
knighted last year by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that we are too focused on immediate results,'' Sir
John said recently. ``I say to you there are 40 quarters between me
and retirement and everyone of them matters.''

   WASHINGTON _ Three American infantrymen patrolling Macedonia's
border with the Yugoslav province of Kosovo were missing Wednesday
after reporting by radio that they had been surrounded and were
under fire, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers might have been captured, presumably by Serbian
forces or paramilitary units, officials said, but they cautioned
that they had no direct evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   ((At 1:50 a.m. Eastern time Thursday, CNN broadcast videotape
from Serbian television showing what the Serbs identified as the
three Americans who were reported missing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ((Their names were not immediately available.))
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers are part of the United States 1st Infantry
Division, which has had about 350 members in Macedonia for years, a
remnant of a United Nations force that is being withdrawn now that
thousands of NATO troops are stationed near the border. &UR;  &LR;  Kenneth
Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Wednesday night that the three
soldiers came under fire about 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET). They had
split off in their Humvee from the rest of the patrol along a road
near Kumanovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came under small-arms fire,'' Bacon said. ``They reported
over the radio that they were surrounded. No more was heard from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that American and other NATO forces, along with
Macedonian police, immediately began a search on the ground. A
helicopter was deployed along with a plane equipped with an
infrared heat-detecting sensors. The team could not be located. The
search was still continuing twelve hours after the incident, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While it was not the first time that there has been scattered
shooting along the tense border since the NATO bombing of Serbia
began, this was the most serious incident to date, threatening to
spill the crisis into one of Yugoslavia's neighboring states and
tempting Allied forces to drive across the border.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilot of an F-117 Stealth fighter plane went down in
Serbian controlled territory last weekend, NATO sent in rescue
helicopters. But that pilot's location was far from where his plane
landed, unknown to the enemy, and disclosed to his rescuers by a
special electronic beacon. Infantrymen do not routinely carry such
devices, especially when they are not expecting to be engaged in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman said the three soldiers, all enlisted
men, were on a patrol in a Humvee, which are heavily armored and
often well-armed all-purpose infantry vehicles. They were traveling
in a group with a small number of other vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were in uniform and were not wearing the blue helmets of
U.N. peacekeepers but their standard military gear, a military
official said.
</P>
<P>
   During the patrol, the vehicles separated from one another as
part of a training exercise, he said. It was then that the
occupants of one vehicle reported to the others that they were
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the three tried to get away, the other vehicles raced back
to find them, but could not, Bacon said. He did not know whether
the soldiers ever returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the soldiers reported to a U.S. task force known
as Able Sentry, which is part of the U.N. force in Macedonia, and
the task force launched a Blackhawk helicopter to search.
Meanwhile, NATO units that are part of the Allied Rapid Reaction
Corps, a 7,500-man group run by the British in preparation for an
eventual peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, put their own helicopters
into the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty to 90 American ground troops deployed to the area from
Task Force Able Sentry, joined by a number of allied ground troops
and several helicopters,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather in the area was ``lousy,'' he said, restricting
visibility for the search parties.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have ``substantial armored forces along the
border,'' he said..
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has maintained a small peacekeeping force in
Macedonia since the former Yugoslav republic declared its
independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, amid growing fears that fighting in the Balkans would
spread, the U.N. Security Council renewed the force's mission and
increased the troop strength to more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has contributed about 350 soldiers since the
peacekeeping mission &UR;  &LR; began, and American officials have said they
have no plans to send more. Bacon said the American unit was
scheduled to leave the country soon.

   In a report published in the journal Science earlier this month,
Thatcher and his colleagues found that for 125 miles or so, the
crust in the western part of the Basin and Range abutting the
Sierra is being steadily squeezed at a rate of 21/2 inches a year
northwestward against the more stable crustal block of the Sierra.
That's an inexorable crunch easily powerful enough to fracture the
deep crusts into seismic faults.

 CALIF. GOV. GRAY DAVIS JOINS SUIT OVER NAZI SLAVERY  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Gov. Gray Davis has joined a private
lawsuit seeking what could be millions of dollars in damages from
Ford, General Motors and five German companies for allegedly
profiting from Nazi slave labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Besides alleging forced labor, the suit also claims that the
companies seized or took over the assets of German Jews during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is involved in the suit as a private citizen, not as
governor, said Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman in the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he feels very strongly about,'' she said. ``He
wants to lend moral support.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court,
alleges that those actions are unfair competition under California
law. It calls on the court to order the companies to provide
restitution for the victims and divest themselves of those assets
and any profits those assets may have generated in California over
more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and General Motors were named because of the wartime
actions of their subsidiaries in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that use slave labor should not be allowed to keep
the profits of the atrocities they committed in pursuit of business
profits,'' said Morris Ratner, a partner at Lieff, Cabraser,
Heimann and Bernstein, one of the law firms that filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Also named as plaintiffs in the suit are the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, a Holocaust studies organization in Los Angeles, and a
handful of Holocaust survivors living in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am joining this important lawsuit to maximize the just
compensation due to victims of the Nazi war machine,'' Davis said
in a statement. ``Common decency demands that those who were made
slaves ... should be compensated for the labor stolen from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of suits seeking compensation from German
companies for their wartime actions have been filed both in the
United States and abroad, Davis' name on the San Francisco action
is designed to raise the profile of the suit, McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead attorneys in the suit is William Lerach, a San
Diego lawyer who was one of Davis' biggest donors in last year's
governor's race. Lerach personally gave $120,000 to the Davis
campaign, while his law firm donated $80,000 more. In additional,
Lerach raised hundreds of thousands more from California personal
injury lawyers, both for Davis and for other Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Davis became involved in the legal action at the request of the
Wiesenthal center, which he has worked with for more than 20 years,
McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Suits under the state's wide-ranging unfair competition law have
been criticized for allowing lawyers to collect large fees without
necessarily compensating the alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I applaud the attorneys who have taken up this just
cause on behalf of victims of the Nazis, I urge them to minimize
their fees and other costs relating to this litigation,'' Davis
said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Castro wins again, by being Castro
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, April 4, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It wasn't a good week for Cuban dissidents or exiles. It
was a week when Fidel Castro again basked in a world spotlight,
sandwiched between the commissioner of Major League Baseball and
the owner of the Baltimore Orioles. It was a week when American
entertainers such as Jimmy Buffett came to Havana to jam with Cuban
artists; it was a week when a Vermont senator, while in Havana,
called for an end to the travel ban to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   I found Sen. Patrick Leahy's proposal almost amusing, as anyone
who wants to go to Cuba already goes to Cuba, including Sen.
Patrick Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that segments of the American population and
political structure are seeking warmer ties with Cuba, and that's
because Fidel Castro, like the snake-oil salesman he is, has
charmed them. He charms everyone, even the pope.
</P>
<P>
   (Anyone read anything lately about the pope calling Fidel to get
him to abandon the sentence of a firing squad for a Salvadoran
terrorist who set bombs in Havana hotels? It seems the pope calls
the U.S. weekly trying to head off executions.)
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, said the game was all
about continuing U.S. efforts to broaden cultural exchanges with
the communist island, and I'd like to know when that became a
policy. I thought our position on Cuba was to isolate, to enforce
Helms-Burton -- which is not being enforced -- and to run Fidel out
of power.
</P>
<P>
   I never have believed the embargo was functioning anyway,
despite all those photos of antique automobiles in the streets of
Havana. It's the United States that has been isolated by its
embargo. Everyone trades with Cuba. Foreign investors build hotels,
receive land from the Marxist government that was taken from Cuban
and American investors in 1959 and 1960, create plush resorts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ton of money coming into Cuba despite our obsolete
embargo, yet you don't see the people thriving, you don't see 1998
Toyotas instead of 1957 Chevrolets, you don't see restored
buildings -- only shambles of what once was.
</P>
<P>
   For all those decades of the embargo, Castro has used it to
unify his people; told them they were downtrodden because of the
Americans. So where has all that money gone that is borne in on a
wave of tourism, of construction, of investment?
</P>
<P>
   Castro keeps telling his people to tighten their belts because
of the U.S. embargo, but his seems to be getting looser and looser.
</P>
<P>
   Do not talk with him about the ongoing trial of four dissidents
who dared to say what they thought. That is not allowed in Cuba.
But listen to him brag that again this year a religious procession
has been allowed to pass through the streets of Havana to
commemorate Good Friday. In the U.S. and most everywhere else in
the world, that is a right, not a special permission.
</P>
<P>
   The American baseball commissioner and the owner of the
Baltimore Orioles may have thought the game last weekend was about
sports, but it wasn't. It was pure politics -- or Fidel wouldn't
have been there. He knew the American TV cameras were on him, that
dozens of American reporters were there to quote his every
utterance, observe his banter with the Orioles players.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the world, we take harsh action against dictators
who keep their boots on the throats of their people. We do it with
bombs, missiles, troops, embargoes that hold.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is a different story. His inexplicably attained world
prestige seems to grow with the tenure of his dictatorship. He is
an ardent revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Americans and Cuban exiles talk in terms of how
things will change once Fidel dies -- like the exiles from Miami
will parade into Havana and make everything whole again.
</P>
<P>
   There is an impression among those gullibles that Castro is the
only Marxist holding things together in Havana. Think harder.
Castro could drop dead tomorrow; there will be thousands of
hard-line communists remaining to carry on his work.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A good judge of judges
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ State District Judge Gerald Goodwin, who holds
forth as court jester most mornings at Firehouse Charlie's Cafe
downtown, was telling about the years he studied under Houston's
Judge Jimmy Duncan, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that back then, in the early 1970s, Judge Duncan of
the county court at law was annually named worst judge by vote of
the Houston Bar Association. ``That was only because they were all
scared of him,'' Gerald said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gerald seemed attracted to one another. So it was that he
named Gerald ``Pine Knot,'' a semi-term of endearment reflecting
Gerald's upbringing in deep dark East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, as a newly minted attorney fresh out of law
school, Gerald took off for Houston, a U-Haul in tow, to start his
career as an assistant D.A. in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   He counts it as time well invested, thanks to the tutelage of
Judge Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   They got crossed up right off, Gerald says. The judge referred
to Gerald's performance in his court as stupid, and Gerald said as
much in open court concerning the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that he made my life hell for months,'' Gerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Duncan was a past master of such devilment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember how many times the judge would be calling the
docket ... `Jenny Jones, charged with DWI, are you represented by
counsel?' ... `No sir,' the young woman would answer, her voice
trembling. `My lawyer said if my case was in your court, I was on
my own.'''
</P>
<P>
   But try as the judge might, he couldn't run off Gerald. That's
when he took to calling him Pine Knot. Pine knots, in case you've
never tried to saw through one, are hard and tough.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Gerald may have reminded him of himself at an earlier
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried a .45 stuck in his belt there on the bench,''
Gerald said. ``He'd go to r'ar back in his chair, you'd hear this
heavy thud of something hitting the floor, and you'd know Judge
Duncan's pistol had come loose again.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge had a particular way of handling objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't say, `Your honor, I object to his leading the
witness,''' Gerald said. ``He'd growl at you, `Son, you don't have
to tell me he's leading the witness. I know what you're objecting
to. Or do you think I'm stupid?'''
</P>
<P>
   So all a lawyer could say was, ``Your honor, I object.'' Which
made a problem if you were the one doing the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask a question,'' Gerald said, ``the defense lawyer would
say, `I object,' and the judge would say, `Sustained.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'd try to change up the question and ask it again. The
other lawyer would object again, and the judge sustained it again.
This time he pointed to me and added, `You do that one more time
and you're going to jail for contempt.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My next question would be something like, `Mr. Jones, what do
you remember about the weather that day?'''
</P>
<P>
   A lady once called Gerald after serving on a jury in a case he
was prosecuting before Judge Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you spend most every day like that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes ma'am, that's my job,'' Gerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You poor, poor man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald stayed in Houston six years. That's how long, he says, it
took him to save the money to rent the same U-Haul to move back
home to Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, Judge Duncan had come to appreciate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be walking into his courtroom, and there'd be a bunch of
other lawyers gathered around the door and in the aisle,'' Gerald
said. ``The judge would bellow from the bench, `Stand back, boys!
Make way for a real lawyer!'''
</P>
<P>
   Good story. Good breakfast. Good judges.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Looks like war
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're at war in the Balkans _ you, me, our country. America. I
mention this because, while everyone knows it is so, no one seems
actually to have noticed, much less to care. There is an eerie
detachment, as if our war were _ what? _ say, a balloon, floating
out there somewhere but tethered to us only by a thin string, no
burden but after a while not much of an entertainment either. Just
sort of _ around.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the thing is all over the TV network news. It leads every
program. Newspapers spill it over full pages. There are ritual
briefings at NATO headquarters, the Pentagon, the State Department.
Screens fill with serious visages speaking somberly.
</P>
<P>
   But the war enters common conversation, if at all, only in
shallow dips at the margins. It seems to be on almost no one's
mind. ``How about Kosovo?'' is more a conversation killer than
starter, at first usually evoking only confusion and then
indifferent recognition.
</P>
<P>
   We are shooting up Serbia and, to a lesser degree, other parts
of what is left of Yugoslavia. Pouring explosives on the bomb
sites, and the political tinder, in a very modern version of
dumping boiling oil from the battlements _ that is to say, at least
for now, at relatively safe remove from most rejoinders and distant
from the horrors where the oil strips off skin and washes away
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt who the malefactors are in this matter.
Serbia and its awful Slobodan Milosevic first provoked a guerrilla
resistance _ itself a nasty business _ by ending the traditional
autonomy of Albanian-majority Kosovo and then used that resistance
as an excuse for another of their eager ``ethnic cleansings.''
</P>
<P>
   However this matter ends, it will have been the special
contribution of the Serbs, just as the century was running out, to
have added a new horror to the thick catalog of human torments this
century will pass on to the next. Is genocide a wee bit much for
you? The Serbs offer, as a slightly lesser alternative, ethnic
cleansing, in which citizens are murdered wholesale and whole towns
are cindered by way of forcing the larger number of survivors to
flee to other countries, all in a calculated application of tragedy
as an instrument of policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear that NATO's bombing isn't exacerbating
the very problem it is meant to blunt, or that more of it will be
any more effective, or that it won't set off the region's
firecracker mini-states. We'll see. Military and policy planners
ask for time. All right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's this weird disconnect. The war plays as if it
were a video game. Some thousands of miles away, and thousands of
feet below us, or so it seems, there is another puff of silent
explosion. These are hits, not kills. We bomb, not people, but
targets. Refugees are churned up, but our attention drifts. Video
games are not much as spectator sports. There's no engagement when
you don't have the joy stick.
</P>
<P>
   But our virtual war is another people's bloody hell. Even in a
good cause, we owe ground zero the courtesy of caring.

 &HT;    Suitcases end up scattered there and yonder

   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Tony Bennett left his heart in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I left my luggage in Orlando, Fla. And Atlanta. And points in
between.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on the road most of the past two weeks, attending
company meetings twice in Florida. Tough duty, I know. It's hard to
come back with a Florida tan and say with a straight face what a
long half-month it's been out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But God is a practical joker, and getting there and back, then
there and back again, was no picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by air to Orlando during spring break should qualify
one for the loony bin. The plane was completely full, populated
primarily with young parents and their impatient children headed
for Disney World. I was not going to Disney World. By the time the
plane landed, the children wailed incessantly, and I was ready to
slug Mickey and mug Goofy.
</P>
<P>
   I have a pet peeve. Actually, I have several, being increasingly
curmudgeonly as time passes me by, but this one is relevant to our
conversation. My airline peeve is people who insist on trying to
carry all their luggage on board and stuff it in the overhead bins
rather than check it. The flight to Orlando was scheduled to last
two hours. One hour was spent loading people and unloading people.
At least 50 minutes of that hour was spent standing in the narrow
aisles as passengers attempted to stick suitcases the size of sides
of beef into the overhead compartments, just so they wouldn't have
to head down to baggage claim when the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   This irritates me. It irritates the airlines too, which have
tried to crack down with little success. I am a good toad, checking
everything except my briefcase even if technically I could fit it
into the overhead bins. I feel morally superior and have been known
to exchange snide comments with other rule-obeyers as we watch some
poor lug try to wrestle his life's belongings out without beaning a
blue-haired lady sitting below.
</P>
<P>
   As Roberto Duran said when Sugar Ray Leonard whupped him in a
classic prize fight some years back, ``No mas.'' No more. If my
luggage is in the bin above me, one of two things are going to
happen. The luggage will depart the plane at the same time I do, or
the plane will crash, and it won't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode really wasn't the airline's fault. My golf
clubs got lost somewhere between the course and the hotel, and I
had to reluctantly leave without them. No big deal. The hotel
assured me they would find and ship them, and besides, they have
insurance. A week later, the clubs showed up on the big brown
truck.
</P>
<P>
   I returned home for two days and then flew to Palm Beach for
another meeting. Again, the cattle car was full, the flight
attendants harried, and the plane late. On the trip home, I had to
fly to Atlanta and switch planes to get to Shreveport, with a
one-and-a-half-hour layover in Georgia. Plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderboomers hit Atlanta, and we sat on the runway in Palm
Beach for an hour. My window of opportunity was lessening. When we
hit Atlanta, aka the Airport From Hell, we spent another half hour
taxiing to the terminal. I had two minutes to spare before my next
flight. I made the flight, jubilant that I wasn't stuck in Atlanta
for the night, since this was the last flight to Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   My luggage wasn't so lucky. And that's where stupidity came into
play. I had tossed my car keys in my small bag before I left
Shreveport four days earlier, intending to get them out before I
got back on the plane. I returned to Shreveport at 9 p.m. with no
luggage and no car keys, since I had checked the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The baggage clerk said there was an outside chance my luggage
would make it on a flight from Jackson, Miss., so I hung around the
airport until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   No luck. I could tell he thought I was an idiot for putting my
keys in my luggage. I couldn't argue the point. The airline sprung
for a hotel room down the street and gave me a toiletry kit and a
voucher for a free breakfast. I spent the night in Shreveport,
resisting the temptation to go to a casino and play blackjack all
night long. Mainly, I was worried they wouldn't let me in, since by
then I had been in the same clothes for nearly 24 hours and smelled
a tad ripe.
</P>
<P>
   I was back in the airport at nine the next morning, awaiting the
red-eye from Atlanta. Funk artist Rick James got off the plane,
resplendent in a green silk outfit, accompanied by a lot of large
people wearing sunglasses and black clothes. He got into a waiting
limo while I sat in the corner fearful that my stinky clothes would
brand me as a vagrant. The cops kept eyeing me, and I just smiled
and tried to keep my eyes focused.
</P>
<P>
   My luggage showed up on the same flight with Rick James, along
with my car keys. I drove home with the window down, vowing to find
a set of collapsible golf clubs and a tiny suitcase before the next
trip.

 &HT;    Can anything destroy the old-fashioned pleasure of comic books?
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Christian Holmes is a nice, normal
fellow. Has a good job designing home video games, makes decent
money, lives in a comfortable home outside Orlando. At 30 years
old, the future looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   And he really enjoys dressing up like a superhero.
</P>
<P>
   Not Superman or Batman. He's got a thing for a comic-book hero
known as The Thing.
</P>
<P>
   For special occasions, Holmes dons an orange ski mask, orange
socks and a pair of orange longjohns covered with orange sponges
and made modest by the addition of a skimpy blue Speedo. The Thing,
you see, was damaged by gamma rays in a horrific accident years ago
that made his skin look like a portable rock slide. Holmes couldn't
glue rocks to his longjohns. Sponges had to suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove here like this in my convertible,'' he says, his voice
tinged with pride. ``Got a few honks.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often he gets to show off this getup. But he did break
it out for one of his favorite events, the MegaCon comic book and
science fiction convention in Orlando this month.
</P>
<P>
   Standing straight, a bemused smirk on his face, he strolled
through the aisles of booths, drawing the oohs and ahhs of
Spider-Man worshipers and Star Trek fanatics who respected his
commitment to the character. A few booths away, a 6-foot alien even
turned his head for a look.
</P>
<P>
   Why would an otherwise normal guy pull such a stunt?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one place where it's acceptable to do this,'' he
said. ``You can get into character and lose yourself for a little
bit and have a little vacation from who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a woman with a toddler taps him on an arm sponge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son wonders why you have a lumpy tushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the indignities of the modern crime fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Unique environment is right. During the three-day event, the
MegaCon (that's comics lingo for mega-convention _ ``The Con'' for
short, if you're really into it) attracts thousands of avid fans
who come to buy and sell their mountains of comic books, meet the
artists and writers of their favorite titles and buy collectible
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Some go as far as Holmes and don the apparel of their favorite
characters. Some go further.
</P>
<P>
   One Con-goer, dressed head to toe in blue suit, tie and fedora,
insisted his birth name was The Shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The name on his driver license? ``The Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does he live? ``Only The Shadow knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at the Cons can sometimes be a little strange, but
they're really nice and polite, and they have a great time.'' said
Karl Story, an Atlanta-based artist who helps draw the Nightwing
series based on Batman's sidekick, Robin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of these people, it's their one chance out of the
year other than Halloween to dress up and be the people they want
to be. I've seen people wearing barbarian chain mail and bikinis.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventions like the one in Orlando _ which is among more than a
dozen huge gatherings around the country each year _ draw people
from hundreds of miles away. Distance is not a factor when you're
crazy about Captain America.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is changing. The Internet is quickly becoming
the new home for traders, with thousands of titles being bought and
sold each day. The comics business is coming out of a five-year
recession, the demographics are shifting away from kids to an
older, more affluent customer who can afford comics that are $3
each off the shelf, and the Internet has pumped new life into the
collectibles segment.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves comics fans who enjoy the mingling as much as the
haggling wondering whether these kinds of shows will be around in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the energy here,'' said Kim Floyd, a 52-year-old
salesman from Thomasville, Ga., who collects ``golden age comics''
from the '40s and '50s. ``Everyone is extremely focused on their
books and charged up. That doesn't happen online. The Internet is
clinical and cold and commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be overstating it, but this kind of convention is
like a living, breathing beast with its own momentum. I'd hate to
see that lost because of the almighty dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   If the money is getting in the way of comic collectors'
enjoyment, you couldn't tell by looking on line. At eBay, the
largest online auctioneer, thousands of comic books _ including
over 27,000 rare titles _ are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The site built its business on the collectibles market: Beanie
Babies, Barbies, coins, sports memorabilia, antiques and comics.
</P>
<P>
   The company brought a huge contingent to the MegaCon, opening a
flashy booth complete with laptops and sales reps who offered
convention-goers immediate access to their site.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should be worried by Internet encroachment, you'd
think it would be James Breitbeil, MegaCon's organizer and
publisher of Frank Frazetta Fantasy Illustrated. He's seen
attendance increase about 20 percent each year, reaching 14,000
during the three days this year. The convention has diversified to
include science fiction, fantasy game tournaments and animation
exhibits, along with the occasional Playboy Playmate and one-time
TV stars from such shows as ``The Munsters'' and ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that by signing eBay as the Con's major sponsor this
year, he's inviting the enemy into his camp. But Breitbeil said he
isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely crosses the line a little bit, but the Internet
is here to stay. And regardless, we're likely to keep growing. A
convention is an interactive thing, and you can't really replace
being with your peers. EBay can do some of what we do, but they
can't really capitalize on the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience has a human face. His name is Trent Swift.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old from Palm Beach is sitting on the floor, back
against the Orlando Expo Centre's walls, waiting in line to see his
favorite comic-book artist, J. Scott Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Swift _ normal teen-age boy that he is _ is crazy about
Campbell's Danger Girl. Along with a flashy drawing style and a
shiny cover, the book's main draw is the weapon-wielding title
character, who makes Pamela Lee look downright sylph-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting here about an hour,'' he says. His mom,
Lisa, who drove Trent to Orlando to see Campbell, is sitting on the
floor with him. He's 20th in line at the moment. Another 100 people
are behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip was about more than Danger Girl or meeting
Campbell or getting a good price for the 1942 Human Torch comic he
owns that probably is worth $400. Trent's father, Joe, died in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Trent's desire to come here,'' Lisa said. ``Going to
shows was something he and his father used to do together. I wanted
to carry that tradition on. My kids are my life right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people file past the line on their way to other
booths. The topic drifts to the guy in the orange sponge suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would dress up in 6 feet of sponge has got to have
something wrong with him,'' Trent jokes. His mother laughs with
him.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of laugh you get when you've been sitting for an
hour on a hard floor. It's the kind of moment you just can't buy on
a Web site.

 &HT;    The Balkans and a time warp
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - If you were a newspaper reader in 1914, you'd be
reading a lot about events in a far away city named Sarajevo. You'd
be reading about the war consuming Europe because a Serbian patriot
assassinated the archduke of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a newspaper reader in Texas in 1914, you'd be
reading about how a lopsided distribution of wealth coupled with
cancerous government corruption sparked a civil war in Mexico. That
civil war, in turn, caused a wave of immigration that was as
massive as it was unprecedented from that country to this.
</P>
<P>
   We live the consequences of those events today.
</P>
<P>
   I've been reading the newspapers for the past couple of weeks
wondering whether I'm in some kind of time warp. As a history
major, I concentrated on the Mexican revolution of 1910 and U.S.
history from the 1920s. The latter involved the events that led to
World War I. You really can't understand the developments in the
'20s and beyond without having a working knowledge of what was then
known as the Great War and its impact on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's why events in the Balkans strike me as proof of Harry
Truman's definition of news: It's history we haven't read yet. I
can appreciate the quandary in which the president, the joint
chiefs and the NATO alliance find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I'm blessed with access to all kinds of experts
(recognized and not) who are generous with the benefit of their
knowledge and insight into what could or should happen in the
Balkans. I was in the room when a guy who wears a lot of stars on
his collar briefed a relatively small group of Austinites on the
military situation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people believe that letting the situation in the
Balkans go unchecked threatens the stability of Europe. People who
are just as reasonable believe we are playing with the matches that
could start World War III.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most cockeyed optimists believe we can achieve ``our
goals'' _ whatever they are _ with air strikes alone. Whatever
technological advances we've made since World War I, it still takes
ground forces to win wars. Today's infantry soldier may carry some
very high-tech gear, but he's still a trooper with a rifle who has
to fight to get from Point A to Point B.
</P>
<P>
   I get paid to ponder, so I started pondering about the prospect
of a long, drawn-out war in the Balkans. How much will could the
American people muster once the body bags started coming home? How
long before the arguments would begin over the impact of a retreat
from our resolve? Even if we somehow stop the genocide through
force (``Stop those massacres, or we'll kill you''), we would have
to maintain a ``presence'' in the Balkans as we've had to do most
places where U.S. troops have seen battle.
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception, of course, was Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Very roughly speaking, the U.S. share of the Vietnam War lasted
from 1964 through 1974, with the six-year period between 1966 and
1972 exacting the heaviest casualties.
</P>
<P>
   So, a boy who was 12 when American involvement started had a
pretty good chance of getting involved in it one way or another
before the war finally ended with that ignominious withdrawal from
the embassy roof in Saigon. You've seen those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I direct your attention to another young man. He is my
12-year-old son, Teodoro C. Garcia, or Teo to those who know him.
He is a very determined, very serious young man with a plan. His
plan is to earn a place in the U.S. Naval Academy in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring his perspective was just as valid _ maybe even more so
_ than many of the experts I talk to, I asked him what he thought
of the air strike launch.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me a rundown of the players, the stakes and even a
little about the terrain. We talked about the possibility of an
extended involvement and his chances of participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it depends on my career path,'' he replied in earnest.
``If I go into aviation, I'll be flying air strikes against them.
If I go into the SEALs, I'll be doing black ops. If I go into
submarines, I'll be firing missiles at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Mr. Garcia, the future ensign, did not display a shred of
a notion of doubt about his future. Like any other young person, he
didn't give the risk so much as a nod.
</P>
<P>
   Risk is not something he thinks about. That's something I think
about.
</P>
<P>
   Teo may change his mind about the military, but he's pretty sold
on it and has been for two or three years now. He would be the
third generation of our family to serve, and I will be proud of
him. If he changes his mind about the Navy, that's OK with me, too.
</P>
<P>
   As this Balkans business progresses, I will be looking at it
with an eye toward 1914 and my young man's future. I will be
looking at the wire stories from both an intellectual and emotional
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a son or daughter involved in this conflict, God
bless them.
</P>
<P>
   And may God bless you.

 &HT;    `10 Things' zings teens, with nod to Shakespeare
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you can search all 37 of
William Shakespeare's plays and not find a scene with a guy drawing
male genitals on another guy's face.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the early clues that ``10 Things I Hate About
You'' is a very loose version of ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' The
opening minutes cram in plenty of sex jokes, including a porn novel
the school counselor is secretly writing, which gives characters a
chance to say ``engorged,'' ``bratwurst'' and other snicker-trigger
words for its targeted teen crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts terribly. Director Gil Junger, a sitcom veteran
making his feature debut, lets scenes linger five seconds too long;
the wind leaks out of them. A few early shots are downright ugly.
So you sit there thinking, ``There goes another 90 minutes of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, unexpectedly, the movie starts to percolate with wit and
charm, thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat
(Julia Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). She's the elder of the
Stratford sisters (groan), one of those ``question authority''
girls who reads ``The Bell Jar'' and dismisses Ernest Hemingway as
an ``abusive alcoholic misogynist.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she's unpopular, while her kid sis, Bianca (Larisa
Oleynik), is being cruised by teen lothario Joey (Andrew Keegan).
Problem is, their overprotective single dad (Larry Miller) won't
let Bianca date until her sister does. And that's about as likely
as a drought in their hometown, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But when newcomer Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls for
Bianca, he schemes with pal Michael (David Krumholtz) to arrange a
date for Kat. Their man for the job: Patrick, a longhaired transfer
student shadowed by rumors of a reckless past. Paid for the job,
Patrick starts to woo Kat.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens next, whether you've seen ``Shrew'' or the
recent teen flick ``She's All That.'' The movies share the same
climax: our heroine's transformation, her trip to the prom and then
the crisis when she learns her new beau's actions have ulterior
motives. The difference here is that Stiles and Ledger are
captivating (unlike the attractive stiffs in ``She's All That'').
Stiles nails her feminazi, bound-for-Sarah Lawrence shtick, but
just as easily melts into giggles or pulls off a slapstick drunk
scene. Ledger is just as comfortable playing a dangerous loner or
doing a goofy song and dance to impress Kat.
</P>
<P>
   The script (by Karen McCullah-Lutz and Kirsten Smith) can't go
too far wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
They throw in references to the original that verge on precious
(Kat and Bianca are the Stratford sisters, and they go to Padua
High). But the writers come up with their own nutty touches,
including dad Stratford's obsession that his girls will end up
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know what I mean when you see ``the Belly,'' one of the
better sight gags of the spring.

 &HT;    Eye-popping `Matrix' takes high-tech joy ride powered by nonstop
action
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Get ready to plug in. A dynamite science fiction flick
opened Wednesday, and it's not George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' prequel.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Matrix,'' writer-directors Andy and Larry Wachowski,
the brothers who updated film noir with 1996's teasingly sexy
``Bound,'' bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
a new genre. Balancing intelligence with knockout special effects
and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high kicks and
cascades of spent bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Keanu Reeves plays Thomas ``Neo'' Anderson, a computer
programmer living in what appears to be a medium-size American city
of the late 1990s. But his life has lately become a tangle of
reality and dreams. His computer seems to be talking to him. A
black-leather babe named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) slinks by
whispering news of a legendary hacker named Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne). Then there's a clutch of men in black, led by Agent
Smith (Hugo Weaving), who take Neo into custody and jam a literal
electronic bug up his navel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Matrix'' slows down to explain what's going on,
we're hooked. Awakened to a reality far different (and darker) from
the life he thought he was living, Neo finds he's been chosen by
Morpheus and a band of rebels to free mankind from a gruesome
enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   The movie presents a frightening variation of our plugged-in
world of Internet access and video games: What if what we believed
to be real life was actually a complex virtual-reality program
designed by computers? The movie borrows the dystopian future from
``The Terminator,'' Goth fashions from ``The Crow,'' a prophesied
messiah straight out of ``Dune,'' the live-or-Memorex conundrums of
``Total Recall'' and the jittery paranoia of last year's cultish
mind-blower ``Dark City.'' But these secondhand parts are fused
into an adventure that should please both comic-book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers _ at least those with attention spans
resilient enough to follow the twisty plot.
</P>
<P>
   The Wachowskis take a risk midway through by slowing down and
taking time to explain the rules of the game. (Congratulations to
Warner Bros. for not trying to trim the film and wreck its logic.)
The movie treads through Joseph Campbell and Jungian territory,
creating a mythic plot line that leads Neo from naivete to a
mystical discovery of his own heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may be cliche by the time Lucas' ``The Phantom
Menace'' does debut, the special effects are fresh and bracing _
whether we watch someone run up a wall to avoid bullets, or stop in
midair to deliver a karate kick. The movie's digitally manipulated
fight scenes play like a high-tech version of the surreal action
ballets you find in Hong Kong movies; gravity is a minor obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the action and FX, ``The Matrix'' offers smart, off-kilter
details. One example: a character known as the Oracle, a psychic
prophetess played by Gloria Foster as a matter-of-fact matron
living in a faded high-rise apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For all its sexy, nihilistic glamour, the movie doesn't take
itself too seriously. The Wachowskis throw in a wry, Old West
homage in the climactic showdown and get laughs from a character's
ability to mentally download complex computer programs in a matter
of seconds. The flick also has some unintentional giggles due to
Reeves. He's solid, but when he strikes a kung fu position, you
expect him to shout ``Dude!'' It's like being told the messiah is
the guy who delivers your pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Fishburne's mentor figure gives the movie the dramatic
heft it needs. Australian actor Weaving as the chief baddy turns in
a drily arch performance, delivering his lines in the plummy tones
of a Sunday news commentator. The movie's real find is leather-clad
Moss, powerful and sexy in equal measure (the movie kicks off with
her making mincemeat of some cops).
</P>
<P>
   A smartly calibrated mix of thrills and thoughtfulness, ``The
Matrix'' sends you out of the theater looking forward to the
sequel. When was the last time you felt that way about a movie?

 &HT;    10, well 9, things I like about you
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ten things I sort of like about ``10 Things I
Hate About You'':
</P>
<P>
   1. The shiny teen comedy is loosely based on Shakespeare's ``The
Taming of the Shrew,'' and that can't be all bad. (Plot: Guy wants
to take out girl, but girl isn't allowed to date unless her older
sister chooses to date. Guy is paid to take out older sister so
young girl can go out. Problem is, older sister is a shrew and her
male peers repulse her. She finally gives in. All's well that ends
well.) Like ``Clueless,'' a contemporary spin on Jane Austen's
``Emma,'' the movie trafficks in high school social satire. But the
superior ``Clueless'' was pointed and hilarious and had Paul Rudd.
``10 Things'' is only half as inventive.
</P>
<P>
   2. The likable and talented young actors are relative unknowns,
not part of the pre-fab, WB and Fox TV brat pack. None of them are
very cute, and that's good. A plain but intriguing Julia Stiles
plays the Bard's shrewish Kate, here named Kat Stratford. A leonine
Heath Ledger, who looks like Val Kilmer doing Jim Morrison, fills
the Petruchio part. In Shakespeare's play, Petruchio is ``a
gentleman of Verona.'' Here he is named Patrick Verona, and so we
have another thread in the movie's tenuous Shakespeare connection.
There are others: the gorgeous Seattle high school where the movie
is set is called Padua High. Padua, Italy, is the setting of
``Shrew.'' Find the Shakespeare allusions, win a prize.
</P>
<P>
   3. Neat-o title; love its pucker of postmodern vinegar. Alas,
the movie isn't very sassy and this postfeminist Kat is hardly a
shrew. She's just desperately aloof, a trifle snarky and in dire
need of lipstick. She wears grungy clothes, doesn't date and reads
Simone de Beauvoir and ``The Bell Jar.'' And, no, we are informed,
she doesn't listen to k.d. lang.
</P>
<P>
   4. Young actor David Krumholtz is hilarious. He brings wit and a
big heart to campus goober Michael Eckman, fulfilling the promise
he showed as the lumpy older brother in ``The Slums of Beverly
Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   5. A lively alt-rock soundtrack that doesn't chafe. Songs are by
Barenaked Ladies, Salt 'N' Pepper and George Clinton, and there's a
passable Cheap Trick cover. (On another note, the music in teen
films is beginning to take the place of editing as a scene-changing
device. Ever so slightly, teen films are turning a visual medium
into a sonic one.)
</P>
<P>
   6. Smoking is portrayed as the putrid habit it is and drinkers
are shown doing dumb drinking things, like puking.
</P>
<P>
   7. Kat's line: ``Remove head from sphincter, and then drive.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Gratuitous frog dissection.
</P>
<P>
   9. It's only 94 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
   10. I can't think up a 10th. That's why the movie is getting two
stars.

 &HT;    Party's obit premature, Democratic leaders say
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Woe for Texas Democrats. In a dozen years,
they've gone from holding 25 of the 27 statewide elective positions
to holding none. They've lost their majority in the Texas Senate
and are four votes from losing it in the Texas House.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have a single statewide officeholder to head up the
2000 Democratic presidential campaign, which presumably will star
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And if Gov. George W. Bush is the Republican nominee for
president next year, he will have more money and clout than God,
will be so popular they'll be stamping his image on coins, and even
usually Democratic Hispanics will be holding adoring pachangas and
naming babies after him.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who will be
seeking re-election to the Senate next year, will be right below
Bush's name on the ballot. Between her campaign and Bush's _ and
the soft money that can be funneled through the Republican Party of
Texas _ the GOP will have enough money to conduct a house-to-house
search for voters.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Republicans take over the Texas House, increase
their 16-15 margin in the Texas Senate and pick up a couple
congressional seats now held by Democrats. That would set the stage
for redistricting in 2001, when Republicans could draw political
districts to undo the 17-13 margin the Democrats now hold, plus
capture the two new seats Texas will get.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, heed Willie Nelson: ``Turn out the lights; the
party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold up, says Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth
Malcolm. Bush may have gotten nearly 70 percent of the vote in
1998, but fellow Republicans Rick Perry and Carole Keeton Rylander
barely won their races for lieutenant governor and comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Democrats still kept the House, we kept every one of
our congressional seats, and we took back a Senate seat from an
incumbent.'' So, if Bush gets the GOP nomination, Malcolm added,
``it is not going to make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Gallego (D-Alpine), who chairs the Democratic Caucus
in the state House, said 1998 was the GOP's watershed year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high tide, and it's passed,'' Gallego said, adding that
he does not believe a Bush nomination would influence other Texas
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Warren Chisum, a Pampa Democrat-turned-Republican who
is part of Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney's leadership team,
said he doesn't think Bush's presence would have a significant
effect on legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that voters have become more informed and willing
to split their tickets,'' Chisum said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats haven't thrown in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate Democratic Caucuses have become more
active, staking claim to Democratic causes and issues. State Sen.
David Cain (D-Dallas) said the Senate Democratic Caucus has hired
seasoned Democratic political operative Doug Zabel ``to make sure
there is a Democratic message.'' The House Democratic Caucus met
earlier this week with Speaker Laney about the Children's Health
Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said he thinks insurance for kids will be one of the
issues that separates Democrats from Republicans. Education and
teacher pay will be others, he said. Malcolm says the state party
is building its grass-roots infrastructure so that it won't matter
if there's an elected official heading the Texas presidential
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But how much can be accomplished without the money-raising
leverage and voter appeal top elected officials generate will be a
major question for the Democrats _ particularly with no heavyweight
yet considering taking on Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Democrats are trying to undo years of neglect. Democratic
presidential candidates wrote off Texas from 1980 to 1992, because
Texan George Bush was on the ballot for vice president and then
president. Bill Clinton won without Texas in 1992, so he didn't
compete in the state in 1996. The 2000 Democratic nominee will
probably pass up Texas too, if Bush is the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaigns' meager Texas investment in TV ads
and get-out-the-vote efforts have left down-ballot Democrats to
fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glen Maxey (D-Austin), who has overseen get-out-the-vote
efforts in Travis County in several recent elections, says he's far
less concerned about Bush's political impact in 2000 than his
policy impact in the 1999 legislative session on issues like
children's health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the governor to move on what's good for
families and working Texans,'' Maxey said.

 &HT;    New energy for an old Jewish tale
 &HT;    EDs: This is a AUS free-lancer; not for use by NYT clients
 &HT;    By Jeanne Claire van Ryzin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Take an age-old Jewish legend, refashion it to
take place during the Nazi occupation of Prague, then stage it as
late-20th-century hard-core theater _ that's the formula for
``Golem,'' Austin playwright and director Josh Frank's latest
production.
</P>
<P>
   And giving an old Jewish story new energy is precisely what
Frank hopes will be the appeal of his play. ``Young Jewish people
are so often detached artistically from Judaism because there isn't
a lot of `alternative' Jewish art,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golem'' is based on the legend of a humanlike creature formed
of clay. The best-known version of the golem story takes place in
Prague in the late 1500s during a time when the king threatens the
existence of the city's Jewish community and a rabbi creates a
golem for protection. Yet because it is made by man, the golem
possesses no soul and ultimately becomes a dangerous creature.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also places his play in Prague; yet this time it's 1942
during the Nazi occupation when Jews were forced to live in the
Jewish Quarter before being sent to concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a modern adaptation of the golem story, and
I also wanted to talk about a situation and a time that people in
my generation are wary of talking about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Frank's play, Zfeck the Rabbi decides to make a golem to seek
revenge on the Nazis. Yet Zfeck doesn't realize that a golem cannot
be created for the purpose of evil. Having no soul, any sin the
golem commits is a sin of the creator.
</P>
<P>
   Frank designed his play to be staged in the alley behind the
Dougherty Arts Center where two intersecting drives meet amid a
cluster of outbuildings and back entrances _ a visually arresting
space. The site is enveloped by the sound of passing trains during
the play, an effect Frank sought to intensify the threatening
Holocaust mood. Frank also enlisted musician Jake Zuckerman, of the
klezmer band Rubinchiks Orkestyr, to compose an original score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create a spectacle,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 23, moved to Austin a little more than a year ago and
started his Theaterless Theater Corps, advertising auditions for
his original script ``Night of the Werewolf.'' That play took off
when it debuted in June, drawing enthusiastic crowds with an encore
performance staged a few months later. Since then, Frank co-founded
the M.O.M. (Mind Over Money) Fest, a 10-evening theater showcase
that ran last November, and presented his play ``The Last
Immigrant.'' When he started work on ``Golem'' late last year,
Frank immersed himself in first-person accounts of the Jewish
Quarter in Nazi-occupied Prague. During a research visit to the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, Frank poured over more materials on
wartime experiences. This May, Frank plans his first trip to
Prague, where he hopes to explore opportunities to produce
``Golem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a playwright, I really want to touch my generation of Jews
and non-Jews,'' Frank said. ``This story has to be told and
retold.''

 &HT;    Elmore Leonard breaks pattern with `Get Shorty' sequal
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elmore Leonard doesn't ordinarily write sequels to his
best-selling novels. I can't think of a single one over the years I
have been an ardent fan of the man I hear is called ``Dutch'' by
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard's ``Get Shorty'' was such an extraordinary hit, as a
book but especially as a movie starring John Travolta, that he
broke a pattern and came up with a sequel to ``Get Shorty'' called
``Be Cool'' (Delacorte Press, $24.95) .
</P>
<P>
   In this one Leonard picks up ``Get Shorty'' hero, Chili Palmer
(aka Travolta), shortly after his second movie ``Get Lost'' has
bombed. ``Get Lost'' was the sequel to Chili's hit, ``Get Leo.''
But in Hollywood you're only as big as your latest movie, so Chili
is in danger of crashing as a Hollywood big shot producer.
Naturally, Chili doesn't give up easily. He plans to make a big
comeback with a new film about a pop singer. He is writing the
script by following the life and career of Linda Moon, a singer
with dreams of rising above her current gig as one of the group,
Chicks International, who do covers of Spice Girls songs.
</P>
<P>
   As he does time and again, year after year, Leonard moves his
story along as much with dialogue as with narrative. And his
dialogue is famously real and invigorating for the reader. There's
even more dialogue than usual in this Leonard story, and some may
feel it is too much of a good thing, but it certainly does move the
story along at a rapid clip and keep the reader (kept me, anyhow)
turning pages through the night.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't my favorite Elmore Leonard book, but it's not my
least favorite either. I'd put it somewhere in the middle probably,
which means it's more fun to read than most pop fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Chili must deal with Russian mafia hit men as
well as the usual Hollywood hustlers. But he keeps on keeping on in
the entertaining Chili Palmer manner pulling together his new movie
by following Linda Moon around and doing what needs to be done to
save her life and keep her leading him toward a new movie that will
fuel his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Chili also must deal with the devious and often dangerous
presence of Linda's manager, a former pimp named Raji.
</P>
<P>
   What can I say about an Elmore Leonard novel at this point that
I haven't said, or read, before?
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Leonard fan, you'll enjoy this one. As I implied,
it might not be your favorite Leonard book, but it won't offend
you. And the movie might be better than the book, if Travolta
agrees to play Chili again and he's aided and abetted by actors of
the quality of Gene Hackman as he was in ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Hollywood seemed to be unable to transfer an Elmore
Leonard novel to the screen with real success. That's not the case
in recent years. I'm not sure why, but it's nice that we ardent
Elmore fans can lately look forward to seeing the movie as well as
reading the book.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has published 35 books now and seems to be rolling right
along, since his books are automatic best sellers and, it seems
lately, automatic movies. ``Out of Sight'' and ``Get Shorty'' and
even the made-for-TV ``Maximum Bob'' have been transferred to the
screen without losing the Elmore Leonard ambiance, or touch, or
however you say it when the movie has a satisfying amount of the
same flavor as the book.
</P>

``Confessions of a Maddog.''

 &HT;    Curious about George: Stephanopoulos a draw
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He scribbled flawless Greek in one woman's book with
nary a complaint nor need for a spelling prompt. Someone else got
four separate autographs and a grin for her disposable camera.
</P>
<P>
   Ask President Bill Clinton's former right-hand man to drink
carryout coffee from a rain-soddened cardboard cup? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caffeine,'' George Stephanopoulos said gratefully in an
interview Wednesday night, just before starting to sign copies of
his memoir, ``All Too Human,'' at the Ansley Mall Chapter 11
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But mention _ as many critics have _ that the book might be
considered a betrayal and he will politely, but firmly, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been clear ever since O.J., that there always has to be a
story that TV and cable latches onto for a week,'' said
Stephanopoulos, 39, who's been accused of violating White House
confidences in a book that only intermittently addresses the Monica
Lewinsky situation. ``There's also a lot of sublimated emotion from
the last year. People did want it to go away. But that's not the
same as not having deep feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes these days for Stephanopoulos, who's changed
everything from jobs to zip codes _ he's an ABC news analyst and
teaches at Columbia University in New York _ but still can't seem
to make anyone forget who he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's trying very hard, mind you. ``All Too Human''
(Little, Brown, $27.95), the lively account of his five years with
Clinton, is No. 1 on best-seller lists, in part because
Stephanopoulos pushes it with the same enthusiasm he once pushed
candidate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign came to Atlanta on Wednesday. First, there was a
reading sponsored by Georgia Tech's bookstore, where about 250
people _ many of them students _ got a chance to fire a few
questions at the former high-ranking White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked about saving Social Security, or even Kosovo. But
they did ask about Dick Morris, the one-time Clinton adviser who
resigned following a sex scandal, and about Joan, the girlfriend
who gave Stephanopoulos his walking papers not very long into the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Dick Morris,'' Stephanopoulos said. ``I do like
Joan.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to Chapter 11, where hundreds of people waited
outside in the rain to obtain his abbreviated autograph on their
books.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means `Many Good Years','' said Eva Georgeson, pointing
at his message and beaming at him like a proud mother. ``I like
him. Not because he's Greek. But that helped!''
</P>
<P>
   They liked him at Tech, too _ within limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who Pearl Jam is,'' said Rich Shertenlieb, a Marietta
junior. Then Shertenlieb put things in proper perspective. ``Of
course, when Jerry Springer came, there were probably three times
as many people here.''

   GOODFRIDAY-GARDENS _ Thousands across the country today will
flock to garden centers to scarf up tender little plants, roll up
their sleeves to till cold packed soil and rip open colorful seed
packs to pour out the promise of hope _ all because it's Good
Friday, the traditional spring planting day. Yet serious gardeners
have been at it all year in one form or another, with some 72
million contributing to a $76 billion industry. In the South's mild
climate, it's serious business. (Flanders, Atlanta

   GARDENERS _ What is it with these people who can't keep their
nails clean _ who would rather plunge their bare hands into
40-pound bags of composted cow manure than plug in the Dirt Devil
or do a load of wash. People who don head lamps at 3 in the morning
in search of slimy slugs that in minutes will turn a perfect hosta
leaf into a block of Swiss cheese. People like Margie Archer who
swears every March she won't work with such vengeance to cultivate
a glorious garden, and already she's going at it gangbusters.
``Nowhere on earth do I feel more comfortable with no makeup on,
hair matted to my head, dirty old torn clothes, beat up shoes than
in a garden,'' the Duluth resident said. ``No one ever told me that
the sweat, aches and tears of battling mosquitoes, worms, bugs,
snakes and even spiders could be so much fun!'' Yet for Archer and
most of the other 2,630 readers who responded to the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's spring survey of gardening habits, the hobby
is about far more than just growing the brightest jonquil or
juiciest tomato. It's about a passion, an addiction _ even a
lifestyle. Hundreds wrote of the therapeutic benefits reaped from
outdoors. Their gardens are outdoor gyms for those who despise
exercise, brightly-lit bars for drowning their work-day stress,
psychologist's lounge chairs for coming to grips with a spouse's
death. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50. WITH PHOTOS

   TRAVEL-MONTREAL _ MONTREAL _ They wore bulky sweaters and clunky
boots, some clutching strollers with babies swaddled like mini
Eskimos, as they quietly lingered in front of Monet's lush
landscapes at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The Montrealers
could be excused for stealing extra moments to savor the ``Monet at
Giverny'' exhibit, for outside on this late March afternoon it
didn't look anything like the French artist's famed garden. Still,
even at winter's ugly en worst, Montreal had plenty to recommend it
_ and to make an Atlantan more than a tad envious. Culture and
multiculturalism. A safe subway system that gets everywhere you
want to go. Beggars with shockingly good manners (``Sir, if I may
ask you seriously for some monetary assistance,'' one pitched me on
the Metro). Neighborhoods that invite a healthy walk. Historic
architecture that demands a gaze. Cool restaurants, bars and coffee
joints. Open-24-hours haunts (Monsieur Falafel's neon lights are
glowing when you need that 3 a.m. Middle Eastern fix). Endless
shops and boutiques to test the favorable exchange rate. Youthful
spirit. New York sophistication without the attitude. Hometown
pride. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

filtering through them all still won't be easy. The surest way to
greet the next fall/winter season in style is to first decide which

The students call their commemoration a Service of Reflection and
Gratitude, and about 10 years ago they asked John Stone,
cardiologist by training, poet by nature, to write a few lines for
the occasion. ``It's hard to write a commissioned poem,'' Stone was

   TRAVEL-MONTREAL _ MONTREAL _ They wore bulky sweaters and clunky
boots, some clutching strollers with babies swaddled like mini
Eskimos, as they quietly lingered in front of Monet's lush
landscapes at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The Montrealers
could be excused for stealing extra moments to savor the ``Monet at
Giverny'' exhibit, for outside on this late March afternoon it
didn't look anything like the French artist's famed garden. Still,
even at winter's ugly en worst, Montreal had plenty to recommend it
_ and to make an Atlantan more than a tad envious. Culture and
multiculturalism. A safe subway system that gets everywhere you
want to go. Beggars with shockingly good manners (``Sir, if I may
ask you seriously for some monetary assistance,'' one pitched me on
the Metro). Neighborhoods that invite a healthy walk. Historic
architecture that demands a gaze. Cool restaurants, bars and coffee
joints. Open-24-hours haunts (Monsieur Falafel's neon lights are
glowing when you need that 3 a.m. Middle Eastern fix). Endless
shops and boutiques to test the favorable exchange rate. Youthful
spirit. New York sophistication without the attitude. Hometown
pride. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE MEDIA'S HURRY-UP WAR
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever wonder what newscasts might have been like
following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor if they had followed
the approach we're seeing and hearing about today's conflict in the
Balkans? Here's one notion:
</P>
<P>
   ``This ... is Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already been 72 hours since Japanese warplanes left the
pride of the U.S. Pacific Fleet ablaze in Honolulu. Now CBS has
learned that twin-engine Japanese Mitsubishi G3M bombers, operating
off the Malayan coast, have sunk the new British battleships
Repulse and Prince of Wales, each one longer than two football
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an analysis of what this all means, we turn to CBS'
military commentator, retired U.S. Army General John J. Pershing,
who commanded the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during
World War I. Your thoughts, general?
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this action was a fluke. We know that land-based
torpedo planes cannot operate effectively against capital ships on
a sustained basis. At the same time, we must face the fact that the
British will pull all their forces out of Asia to prepare for the
coming German assault on their home islands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, general. And now for a look at the dark mood in the
Oval Office as World War II enters its third full day we turn to
CBS' chief White House correspondent, Eric Sevareid. Eric?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Ed, it's been quite a wrenching period for the Roosevelt
administration. Our CBS microphones have picked up the dispirited
voices of the president's most senior advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, surveying the dismal scene, the president
wheeled his chair into the Oval Office and, propped up on his heavy
steel leg braces by the secretaries of the Army and the Navy,
delivered a pep talk to his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``FDR said, 'Guys, let's not lose sight of why Tokyo and Berlin
have done this to us. Let's not forget what prompted the savage
Japanese attack and who is responsible. While we don't have plan as
yet for winning this war, I'm sure that, in a few more weeks, we'll
have the victory the American people expect. But we must have the
patience to stay the course, even it means carrying the fight into
April of 1942.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Eric, for that exclusive report. But a new CBS poll
this evening reflects grave doubts by the American people over
waging a prolonged war. What can you tell us, Charles Collingwood?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed, I can tell you that there's a lot of second-guessing going
on. And that's prompted an increasingly sullen attitude by White
House officials. They are complaining that Roosevelt is being held
by commentators and political opponents to an impossible standard
that's continually shifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't cut off Japanese access to oil in the Dutch
East Indies, FDR aides say, the administration would have been
defying public opinion both here and in other Allied nations. While
that might have avoided the current military debacle, it would have
also allowed the militarists in Tokyo to create a humanitarian
tragedy in China. Back to you, Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Charles. I'll be back with a wrapup of the day's
other news after these commercial messages.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY Workers at this city's Botanical Garden get a
special bonus every day.
</P>
<P>
   They pluck the leaves of a nondescript native plant and brew a
stimulating tea that combats anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you strong!'' said gardener Jesus Rebollo, flexing
his muscles like Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   Rebollo's faith in plants is echoed by countless Mexicans who
use medicinal herbs that are sold fresh, dried or crushed in almost
every market.
</P>
<P>
   At the Botanical Garden, researchers from Mexico's National
Autonomous University, or UNAM, are dedicated to spreading the
Mexican tradition of using native edible plants as medicines and
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   At times in Mexican history, the use of native plants has been
threatened because their consumption was seen as backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes back to the Spanish,'' said Robert Bye, an American
botanist who came to Mexico nearly 20 years ago from the University
of Colorado and now is director of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cortes and his men talked about suffering for months because
they had to eat weeds' while they conquered Mexico,'' Bye said.
</P>
<P>
   One of garden's main activities today is the evaluation of
native medicinal plants -- not just to use as teas or poultices,
but for commercially produced drugs to treat illnesses as
life-threatening as AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as other
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Bye and other botanists at the UNAM are participating in an
international plant-gathering and drug-discovery project started by
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. The project
was made possible by a treaty signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers work with traditional herbal healers in rural and
Indian communities to gather and conserve valuable plants. Then
they team up with chemists at the UNAM and abroad to refine plant
extracts and evaluate their potential.
</P>
<P>
   The garden, on the UNAM campus, is working with the G.W.L.
Hansen's Disease Center of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services in Louisiana and commercial laboratories in the United
States, including that of American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioprospecting'' in developing nations is controversial, with
native communities complaining they should receive profits from
medicines that are developed from their knowledge and plants
foraged on their land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. treaty calls for native groups to share in those
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bye's project requires researchers to receive permission from
the government and local communities to gather plants, and to help
the communities with infrastructure projects and conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAM will set up a trust to divide royalties from products
that are produced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, like many other countries, is still developing laws to
determine who owns the fruits of plant research.
</P>
<P>
   It is at the center of bioprospecting because it is one most
biologically diverse countries in the world, with climates that
range from that of an alpine forest to desert to the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But because Mexico also has one of the world's highest
deforestation rates, the search for new medicinal plants is a race
against destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more plant species yet to be discovered in
Mexico, said Tom Wendt, a University of Texas at Austin botanist
who has studied Mexican forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has an advantage because it has great plant diversity
and extremely old cultures, all of which have been studying
medicinal plants for thousands of years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bye and his wife, botanist Edelmira Linares, work regularly with
traditional healers who have learned about plants from their
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   As they walk through the Botanical Garden, the couple point out
herbs that many low-income Mexicans grow at home because they can't
afford modern pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Muitle, pronounced MWEET-lay, is brewed into a tea that fights
anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drink it instead of coffee in the morning,'' Linares
said. ``That's what the workers here do.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaves of the Mexican laurel serve as a condiment or as a
tea to ease digestive problems. The herb estafiate calms stomach
cramps, as well as labor pains.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mexican arnica plant, which has tiny yellow blooms, is
brewed into a tea for ulcers or made into a poultice to soothe
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Bye said botanists at the garden also debunk rumors that run
rampant in Mexico about so-called magic herbal cures.
</P>
<P>
   A popular substance called ``miracle tea,'' for example,
appeared to reduce stomach pains but could cause liver cancer if
drunk in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The Botanical Garden is open to the public. Besides a section
devoted to medicinal herbs, there also is a large collection of
desert plants and two greenhouses, one crawling with tropical vines
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the other greenhouse, researchers are studying native
plants that use less water and are more resistant to air pollution
than house plants commonly found in Mexico City today.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY Workers at this city's Botanical Garden get a
special bonus every day.
</P>
<P>
   They pluck the leaves of a nondescript native plant and brew a
stimulating tea that combats anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you strong!'' said gardener Jesus Rebollo, flexing
his muscles like Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   Rebollo's faith in plants is echoed by countless Mexicans who
use medicinal herbs that are sold fresh, dried or crushed in almost
every market.
</P>
<P>
   At the Botanical Garden, researchers from Mexico's National
Autonomous University, or UNAM, are dedicated to spreading the
Mexican tradition of using native edible plants as medicines and
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   At times in Mexican history, the use of native plants has been
threatened because their consumption was seen as backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes back to the Spanish,'' said Robert Bye, an American
botanist who came to Mexico nearly 20 years ago from the University
of Colorado and now is director of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cortes and his men talked about suffering for months because
they had to eat weeds' while they conquered Mexico,'' Bye said.
</P>
<P>
   One of garden's main activities today is the evaluation of
native medicinal plants -- not just to use as teas or poultices,
but for commercially produced drugs to treat illnesses as
life-threatening as AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as other
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Bye and other botanists at the UNAM are participating in an
international plant-gathering and drug-discovery project started by
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. The project
was made possible by a treaty signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers work with traditional herbal healers in rural and
Indian communities to gather and conserve valuable plants. Then
they team up with chemists at the UNAM and abroad to refine plant
extracts and evaluate their potential.
</P>
<P>
   The garden, on the UNAM campus, is working with the G.W.L.
Hansen's Disease Center of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services in Louisiana and commercial laboratories in the United
States, including that of American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioprospecting'' in developing nations is controversial, with
native communities complaining they should receive profits from
medicines that are developed from their knowledge and plants
foraged on their land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. treaty calls for native groups to share in those
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bye's project requires researchers to receive permission from
the government and local communities to gather plants, and to help
the communities with infrastructure projects and conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAM will set up a trust to divide royalties from products
that are produced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, like many other countries, is still developing laws to
determine who owns the fruits of plant research.
</P>
<P>
   It is at the center of bioprospecting because it is one most
biologically diverse countries in the world, with climates that
range from that of an alpine forest to desert to the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But because Mexico also has one of the world's highest
deforestation rates, the search for new medicinal plants is a race
against destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more plant species yet to be discovered in
Mexico, said Tom Wendt, a University of Texas at Austin botanist
who has studied Mexican forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has an advantage because it has great plant diversity
and extremely old cultures, all of which have been studying
medicinal plants for thousands of years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bye and his wife, botanist Edelmira Linares, work regularly with
traditional healers who have learned about plants from their
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   As they walk through the Botanical Garden, the couple point out
herbs that many low-income Mexicans grow at home because they can't
afford modern pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Muitle, pronounced MWEET-lay, is brewed into a tea that fights
anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drink it instead of coffee in the morning,'' Linares
said. ``That's what the workers here do.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaves of the Mexican laurel serve as a condiment or as a
tea to ease digestive problems. The herb estafiate calms stomach
cramps, as well as labor pains.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mexican arnica plant, which has tiny yellow blooms, is
brewed into a tea for ulcers or made into a poultice to soothe
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Bye said botanists at the garden also debunk rumors that run
rampant in Mexico about so-called magic herbal cures.
</P>
<P>
   A popular substance called ``miracle tea,'' for example,
appeared to reduce stomach pains but could cause liver cancer if
drunk in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The Botanical Garden is open to the public. Besides a section
devoted to medicinal herbs, there also is a large collection of
desert plants and two greenhouses, one crawling with tropical vines
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the other greenhouse, researchers are studying native
plants that use less water and are more resistant to air pollution
than house plants commonly found in Mexico City today.

BABY BOOMER CONSUMERS WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED, CONSULTANT ADVISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Show business can be big business _ even for companies that make
a living outside of the Hollywood spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message delivered by an entertainment industry
consultant in a new book called ``The Entertainment Economy: How
Mega-Media Forces are Transforming our Lives'' (Times Books, $25,
336 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Author Michael Wolf, who has dispensed advice to such media
giants as NBC and MTV, asserts that increasingly varied industries
will need to become skilled at incorporating entertainment elements
into their product offerings if they want to capture the attention
of today's most sought-after consumers _ the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   As boomers age _ and their kids get ready to leave the nest over
the next few years _ they will have more disposable income than
ever before to shower on themselves and on the manufacturers and
retailers that know how to show them a good time, Wolf says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say that people are not going to continue to
buy cars, couches, dishwashers and homes in record numbers,'' he
writes. ``The point is that these are more or less purchases that
the boomer generation has already made. Real growth is going to
come not so much in the purchase of real physical goods, or at
least durable goods, as it will in the purchase of services that
make life feel fuller and more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, watch out for an explosion in
entertainment-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that entertainment-related spending already accounts
for 8.4 percent of overall spending in the American economy, while
savings wallow at a level of 2.1 percent of our nation's total
consumer budget. Any significant increase in entertainment spending
will translate into large structural shifts in what types of goods
and services are most highly valued in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As social, political, and technological change has opened up
new opportunities, entertainment has found itself at the forefront
of economic growth and cultural evolution,'' Wolf writes.
</P>
<P>
   As the founder and senior vice president of the media and
entertainment practice at the Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton consulting
firm, Wolf can draw on volumes of case studies and entertainment
industry stories that help make the book lively and fun to read.
</P>
<P>
   But he ultimately falls short of the mark for business readers
looking for insight into changing their business. He starts strong
in the first third of the book, writing expansively about the broad
impact that the entertainment industry is going to have on business
in general.
</P>
<P>
   But like a movie that seemingly loses its direction midway, Wolf
unfortunately returns to his comfort zone in later chapters,
writing internal industry accounts of why The Walt Disney Co. and
(his own client) MTV are effective stewards of their brand images.
It makes for good reading; it's just not very applicable to what
you do in your everyday job _ unless you just happen to run a movie
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf does serve up an interesting analysis of the impact the
Internet will have on the entertainment industry, asserting that
traditional industries moving online will need to incorporate
entertainment into their Web sites to stand out with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, take the forecast with a grain of salt. Even Wolf
acknowledges that the world of the Web is mostly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   What Wolf can say with more certainty is that the integration of
entertainment components into other industries will change the
product and business cycles in those industries. Like a hit movie
or song that fades after a couple of weeks, businesses that drive
differentiation from entertaining a consumer will be subject to
fickle turns in consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain, which
continues to spiral after early success based on its entertainment
eatery theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to see new restaurant chains like
McDonald's with a 30-year viability as a category leader,'' Wolf
writes. ``Businesses will grow more quickly. They will die more
quickly, too.''

</P>
<P>
   Investment banker Goldman Sachs is profiled here by one of its

   Random House, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   Half of the new-car sales today are minivans and other light
trucks. The U.S. market is shrinking, though, as its population
matures. Those and other trends, including the once-undisclosed
pricing information now found on the Internet, have made car buying
and leasing an even more complex decision. This book, now in its
second edition, seeks to unravel car-buying business tactics and
give you tips on how to make an informed decision.

   The Four Elements of Successful Management
</P>
<P>
   By Don R. Marshall
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned consultant Don Marshall shows how to become a
successful manager by focusing on how to select, evaluate, direct
and reward employees. If you as a manager are constantly asking
yourself, ``What's wrong with these people?,'' then Marshall
suggests you instead ask ``What's wrong with the way I'm managing
these people who are working for me?'' Marshall provides a good
framework for managers to evaluate and improve their skills.

COMPANY MAKES TRADITIONAL RECIPES GOOD FOR HEART AND SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Williams photo available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HECTOR SALDANA  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Is canned and frozen food good for the soul? Billy
Williams, the chief executive of Glory Foods, is sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams heads a Columbus, Ohio-based food manufacturing company
specializing in African-American cuisine. That's the fancy name;
many folks in the South still call it soul food.
</P>
<P>
   But that's really too antiquated a term, said the man who
pioneered the food line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did approach it that way from the beginning because
of the negative connotation of soul food. The negative image is in
the majority community. They simply want to think that it's all hog
fat and salt. That's just built in to their heads,'' said Williams,
who aims to change minds across the country.
</P>
<P>
   His healthful, ready-to-go, easy-to-fix soul food line includes
black-eyed and pinto beans, field peas, collard and mustard greens,
kale, sweet potatoes, okra and cornbread mix.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience value alone makes Glory Foods' concept appealing
(anyone who has ever prepared time-consuming greens, knows soul
food isn't always fun to cook), but Williams said his brand of
convenience foods was almost as good as mama's.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, such authentic, hunger-inducing aromas wafting from
the stove, oven or microwave could fool many a soul-food gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   And some might argue Glory Foods is better than homemade since
it's healthier than the old-style recipes. The product is lower in
fat and salt content than traditionally prepared dishes and
contains no preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Williams started Glory Foods in 1989 with four partners and
$20,000, armed with favorite Southern recipes and inspired by a
market study they commissioned that discovered African-Americans
consume 600 million servings of greens annually, almost none of it
from cans or in heat-and-eat form.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Foods stepped in to fill the void in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with the idea that the African-American market was
not being served, and that has been our focus. We want to be good
at marketing to African-Americans first,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But a cross-marketing approach was needed almost from the start.
Soul food had gone mainstream, much to Williams' surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from Ohio, so we really didn't know Southern whites ate
this product like they do, so that was a plus market. We didn't
know Hispanics ate peas and beans like they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing nothing different than, say, when Mexican foods
were marketed to wider markets, and other groups liked the flavor
and the taste,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Foods prides itself on being authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much an ethnic, authentic food company. The real
spices are in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Foods is now distributed in 32 states with annual sales of
$14 million. Collard greens are the company's biggest seller
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal favorites are the beans, the black-eyed peas and
the butter beans,'' said Williams, 54, who employs 20 people at his
Ohio plant and jokes that he's a hands-on sort of boss who lives
and breathes a 70-hour-a-week work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a community-based operation. Our strength is that we
understand our community,'' said Williams, whose company is
involved with black farming cooperatives, effectively taking
quality control from the field to the store shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we strengthen our community, then we strengthen ourselves.
At the same time, it's the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Foods took its first steps into the frozen food market
last year. Those products will be in stores in mid-April. Williams
also foresees an institutional line of products in the near future.

TWO TEXAS AUTHORS SPIN ROMANTIC TALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Two tales with Texas ties and a romantic bent
would make for lively springtime reading for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Diane Gonzales Bertrand's young-adult novel,
``Lessons of the Game'' (Pinata Books/Arte Publico Press, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand, who teaches at St. Mary's University in San Antonio
and has written two other young adult novels and a bilingual
picture book, stresses strong role models in her fiction for young
women.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to readers 11 and older, ``Lessons of the Game'' opens
with a realistic fight scene between two girls in the hallway of
Leon Creek High School. Student teacher Kaylene Morales has the
presence of mind to throw cold water, literally, on the skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   But the mop water from the janitor's bucket also hits Alex
Garrison, coach and instructor at the school. Kaylene knows Alex
from a previous life _ 10 years ago, to be exact _ when she was
just a kid and he was her older brother's best friend. Of course,
she always had a crush on him; and of course, he never noticed her.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has.
</P>
<P>
   Alex is a dedicated coach whose personal life takes second
billing, and Kaylene must struggle with her feelings about that as
their relationship blossoms, then dies on the vine. Bertrand uses
plenty of details from firsthand experience teaching in high school
to bring credibility to the romantic tale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers and adults will understand and ponder the
no-easy-answers plot of Yorktown novelist Cindy Bonner's fourth
novel, ``Right From Wrong'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill,
$21.95).
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Lily'' and other Texas-set tales, Bonner places
this one in McDade before, during and after World War I. Florida
Faye ``Sunny'' DeLony and her cousin, Gil Dailey, have always been
pals; but the summer that she's 12 and he's 14, things change.
</P>
<P>
   Her family senses what's happening and tries to separate them,
and Gil tries to avoid her when he realizes that he should resist
temptation, but their love for each other is a like a runaway
train.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gil goes off to war and Sunny seeks comfort in the
company of men who are bad for her, their passion endures despite
family strife and heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of sheer joy juxtaposed against those of
tragedy and lost dreams.
</P>
<P>
   As she has in her other novels, Bonner carefully weaves in
historical details and includes the mood of the time, an almost
Puritanical hatred for those who cross the lines of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right From Wrong'' is a tale with a moral, but it also has
some juicy love scenes.

GRUELING TRAINING PREPARES PARAJUMPERS FOR PILOT RESCUES

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force special operations troops that stand
by to rescue pilots in Yugoslavia and other hot spots are a small
but elite team, enduring grueling training to prepare themselves
for risky work.
</P>
<P>
   When Air Force personnel rescued a downed F-117A stealth fighter
pilot Saturday, Airman 1st Class Fernando Riordan understood why
his training at Lackland Air Force Base is so hard.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a tough person to become a parajumper, or ``PJ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the individual we're looking for, people who won't
quit,'' said Staff Sgt. Kevin Kirby, an instructor at the Air Force
special operations school in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   PJs, known also as pararescuers, begin their training at
Lackland. They handle risky assignments such as extracting downed
pilots and stranded mountain climbers, and they are trained to
rescue crews of the space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   There are 470 pararescuers are among 359,222 active-duty Air
Force personnel. In all, 90 serve in the Air National Guard and 100
are in the Air Force Reserve, said Lt. Denise Kerr, a base
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   All Air Force pararescuers are men. Women are excluded because
the duty requires proficiency in hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   The rigors and glories of PJ duty draw recruits like Riordan and
Senior Airman Kirby Cole to Lackland. But the school's
superintendent, Master Sgt. Rod Alne, advised that only a few will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, around 80 students start 10 weeks of training. On
average, 65 students will wash out, one-third of them after the
first week.
</P>
<P>
   From Lackland, students must undergo 52 more weeks of grueling
training that includes airborne school at Fort Benning, Ga., and
survival training at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Just making it through the first day at Lackland will strain
many recruits, who must swim 75 feet under water, run 1.5 miles in
10:30 minutes and do 50 situps and 50 pushups in 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they graduate, the recruits must run 6 miles in 45
minutes, swim 2.5 miles in 80 minutes and swim six, 75-foot laps
under water.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their second week, Airman Salem Simon and Riordan, 19, of
Concord, Calif., know they won't make it if they fail any test. But
both like their intense training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much the baddest guys walking,'' Simon, 19, of
Buffalo, N.Y., said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary motto is, `That others may live,' and the other
motto that we live by, and the motto that most special operations
forces live by, is `the silent professional,''' Alne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to beat our chests or boast about what we've
done as long as inside we know what we are and what we can do,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has declined to discuss details of the downed
F-117A and the rescue of the American pilot in Yugoslavia, saying
that to do so could reveal sensitive information about the
radar-evading warplane.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Lackland school, the rescue is seen as a success of
the rigorous training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited,'' said Kirby, 29, who made an aborted
pilot rescue mission during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they've been through this training, I know all the
training they've been through, I know the stress level they were
probably thinking, I know the adrenaline rush that's probably going
through them, and sometimes I even wish I was there with them,'' he
added.

WHAT TO DO WITH ALL LEFTOVER EASTER EGGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   What do you do with all those Easter eggs when you've had your
fill of deviled eggs and egg salad? Go beyond mayonnaise and
mustard and add in other ingredients that complement eggs such as
curry powder, cheddar, mushrooms and beet juice.
</P>
<P>
   Beet juice? Yes, beet juice. It's the secret ingredient in those
gallon jars of purple pickled eggs you used to see on truck stop
diner counters. And pickled eggs, sliced up with some red onion and
pickled beets are a classic Polish dish, according to ``Betty
Crocker's New International Cookbook'' (Prentice Hall, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   To make them, combine 3 cups water from cooking beets with 1 cup
red-wine vinegar, 8 black peppercorns, 4 whole allspice, 4 whole
cloves and 1 bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over 6
peeled, hard-cooked eggs. Refrigerate for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Curried eggs from the ``Virginia Hospitality'' cookbook (Junior
League of Hampton Roads, 1975) is another fine use of 8 hard-cooked
eggs. Begin by making them as you would deviled eggs, mashing the
yolks with 1/3 cup mayonnaise but add 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2
teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon dry
mustard to the mix. Spoon the yolk mixture back into the whites and
place in a 7-by-11-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan and add 2
tablespoons flour, 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 1
soup can of milk. Cook and stir until bubbly then add 1/2 cup
shredded cheddar cheese and stir until cheese is melted. Pour over
eggs, dust top with bread crumbs and bake at 350 degrees for 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on curried eggs is deviled eggs and shrimp
casserole. Simply add 1 pound of cooked, peeled shrimp to the
casserole before pouring on the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you want to do something with your leftover Easter
ham as well, try creamed eggs and ham. Sure beats creamed chipped
beef.

<P>
   CREAMED EGGS AND HAM
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   From ``Holiday Eggs,'' by Georgeanne Brennan (Smithmark,
$14.98).
</P>
<P>
   Bechamel sauce: 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons all-purpose
flour, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1/8 teaspoon
cayenne pepper, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup milk.
</P>
<P>
   Main dish: 1 tablespoon butter, 8 ounces mushrooms, cut into
thick slices; 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 pound smoked ham, diced 2
tablespoons minced parsley, 5 hard-cooked eggs, cut crosswise into
thick slices, 6 slices toast, 1 teaspoon paprika.
</P>
<P>
   Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
When the butter foams, remove the pan from heat and whisk in the
flour, nutmeg, pepper, cayenne and salt until a thick paste forms.
Return the pan to medium heat and gradually whisk in the milk in a
steady stream. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce
heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce
thickens, 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Main dish: In a small skillet, melt the 1 tablespoon butter over
medium heat. When it foams, add the mushrooms and sprinkle with the
salt. Saute until lightly golden. Drain the mushrooms and stir them
into the sauce, along with the ham and parsley. Reserving 4
attractive slices for garnishes, gently stir in the eggs. Cook for
about 2 minutes, or just enough to thoroughly heat the ham and
eggs. Place 1 slice of toast on each of 4 plates. Divide the
creamed eggs evenly among the plates, spooning them over the toast.
Cut the remaining 2 slices of toast diagonally into 4 triangles
each. Place 2 triangles on each plate and garnish with the
remaining sliced eggs and paprika.

LIV TYLER   UNAFFECTED BY HER OWN CELEBITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Liv Tyler is a study in contrasts. She arrives for
an interview wearing a full-length, off-white velvet coat over
black capri pants and midriff-baring top. Her feet are slipped into
rhinestone-lined flip-flops. She's ready for both a cold front or a
heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   The outfit is indicative of the 21-year-old actress'
still-forming persona. Or, perhaps, of her versatility. So far,
Tyler has effortlessly made the transition from model and rock
video princess to respected movie star, and from no-budget indies
(``Heavy'') to money-churning mega-productions (``Armageddon'').
</P>
<P>
   She's even literally gone from cold to hot in her last pair of
movies, the Mississippi-set ``Cookie's Fortune,'' which opens
today, and an adaptation of Pushkin's classic Russian verse novel
``Eugene Onegin,'' which was shot first but is being saved for a
fall release.
</P>
<P>
   The most appealing contrast of all, though, is how Tyler seems
to have come through a lifetime of both reflected and earned
celebrity more or less unaffected. She's accessible and
unpretentious _ ``Pop a squat'' is how she offers a reporter a seat
_ and equal parts bemused by and willfully ignorant of the media
stirs she's caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, every day there's gonna be somebody new,'' she says in a
breathy, girlish voice that _ again, contradicting the expected
effect _ has a thoughtful ring to it. ``Especially with media now,
anybody new is just splashed on the front covers of magazines.
They're in the wind for that moment, and that's always going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel particularly a part of all that. Maybe when
`Stealing Beauty' (her first star vehicle, directed by Bernardo
Bertolucci and released in 1996) came out, that happened a little
bit. I don't really remember because it wasn't any of my doing. But
the point is, really, to not let that affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler was a pretty big story, not just because of her classic
dark Calabrian beauty, but because her tale was a little more
compelling than that of most starlets. She'd been born to model
Bebe Buell, who had dated a number of rock 'n' roll personalities,
and Todd Rundgren, a pioneer in the art and electronic rock music
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Or so Liv thought for the first decade of her life. Rundgren
raised her like a daughter, but then she discovered that her
biological father was really Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than indulging recriminations, Liv reached out to Tyler,
who was overjoyed to acknowledge and accept her (she maintains warm
relations with Rundgren, too). Of course, the rock world being what
it is, one of the ways the elder Tyler expressed his fatherly
affection was by giving his daughter her first show-biz break _ as
a tube-topped nymphet (along with a budding Alicia Silverstone) in
Aerosmith's ultra-popular music video ``Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler already had a thriving modeling career at that point;
supermodel Paulina Porizkova, a family friend, took the pictures
that landed the adolescent girl an agent. She made an impressive
acting debut opposite Richard Dreyfuss in the 1994 feature ``Silent
Fall,'' and was soon drawing the attention of an impressive array
of filmmakers ranging from Italian auteur Bertolucci to
``Armageddon's'' Michael Bay to Tom Hanks (``That Thing You Do!'').
</P>
<P>
   To, now, the legendary ``actors director'' Robert Altman, the
Hollywood iconoclast responsible for such indelible works as
``MASH,'' ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ``Nashville'' and ``The
Player.'' In ``Cookie's Fortune,'' Tyler plays the independent but
easygoing grand-niece of a Mississippi matriarch (Patricia Neal)
whose suicide throws her small, close-knit town into as much of a
frenzy as the laid-back hamlet can whip up.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler worked with an impressive ensemble that included Glenn
Close, Julianne Moore, Charles S. Dutton and Chris O'Donnell in the
out-of-the-way Delta burg of Holly Springs. Despite the
high-powered cast, the working situation was as relaxed as it could
be.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just so liberating for me and such a free experience,''
she says. ``I learned so much from the whole process. I'd been in
England making `Eugene Onegin' in all these wigs and corsets, and
five days later I was in Mississippi with no hair and with this
amazing cast. Everybody was so welcoming and warm; Bob creates this
amazing environment, and we all just sort of morphed into our
characters. I was so excited to work every day _ not an ounce of
fear in me at all. It was just serious pretend.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Dutton describes working with Tyler in rapturous tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a young actress who hits upon so many things
accidentally, and you see it coming even before she does,'' the
Yale Drama School alum says with a big smile. ``You just know she's
going to be brilliant at this because there's no premeditation
about it. It makes you remember those days, in college and all that
stuff. Instinctively, she's got it going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler agrees that her strength lies in her instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because of all of the influences I had as a child, I
always had a sense of myself,'' she explains. ``I've always been
very comfortable being me and never was made to feel ashamed for
being that way. So, in that, I'm confident in the decisions that I
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm open to everything and everyone. But to be
around all of these creative people and seeing it work for them,
and for them to be following their own way and their own passion,
was definitely very inspiring to me. That's the only way I know,
and it would feel so bad in my soul to go any way that wasn't my
own. I wouldn't know how to do that, so therefore I just try to
keep that feeling inside and do things that I'm proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until she'd made a few movies that Tyler realized her
creative needs were best satisfied by acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the middle of `Heavy' when I really went, `This is
great, I love this! Finally, I've found something I can get all
this energy out doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The awful, though hardly surprising truth is, though, that Tyler
loves music even more than acting. Although she has a nice singing
voice _ she helpfully broke into a few stanzas of an old Sam Cooke
soul song during the interview _ Tyler is frustrated that she's
never had the time to learn an instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to sing, but I don't want to pursue it
professionally,'' she explains. ``Certainly not right now; I'm very
happy doing what I do. But I'm happy singing all day long and
listening to music. It's definitely something that's inside of me
somewhere, but I wouldn't know where to go with it other than as a
hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is making a lot of beautiful music at home these days.
Since the recent breakup of her three-year relationship with the
actor Joaquin Phoenix, she has been seeing Royston Langdon, who
plays bass for the band Spacehog.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, however, Tyler's heart still belongs to daddy.
Indeed, nothing was a bigger thrill than making joint first
appearances on the Academy Awards show with Steven last month, when
Liv introduced Aerosmith's performance of ``Armageddon's''
nominated song, ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love him so much,'' she says of Steven. ``It's been so
amazing to get to know him as an adult, and we have such a
beautiful friendship. It's incredible to be going through all of
this right now, becoming successful together. It's such a
coincidence, but being at the Oscars together in the same year for
the same film was not only beautiful, but I think there was some
kind of reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning from each other in a lot of ways. I just think
that's really great.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's playtime, girls.
</P>
<P>
   While the fashion police weren't looking, designers went on a
joy ride.
</P>
<P>
   Taking creative detours and speeding down memory lane, designers
such as Anna Sui, Gucci, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, and Prada have brought
back rock-glam, hippie chicks and funky femmes. And along the way
they've resurrected two major fashion icons _ Cher and Elsa
Schiaparelli for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know all about Cher. Back in the '60s and '70s, the
taller half of ``Sonny and Cher'' recording fame dressed up in
feathers and fringe, as well as those fool-the-eye ensembles by Bob
Mackie that featured nude linings and lots of sequins. It was
fantasy dressing to the max, limited only by budget constraints and
school dress codes ... and one's sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   But Schiaparelli had women wearing lamb chops and shoes on their
hats long before Cher was creating youthquakes in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schiaparelli was a designer during that surrealistic art
movement of the late '30s, and she created spoofs on serious
fashion that became known as fashion satire,'' says Maggie Murray,
the gallery director of the Fashion Institute of Design and
Merchandising in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray, Schiaparelli was influenced by the work of
Spanish artist Salvador Dali, and her designs appealed to women who
had self-confidence and didn't mind showing a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Schiaparelli may have led the fashion movement, but others
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Carolyn Gluckman, curator of costumes for Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, says, ``It was Adrian (yes, just Adrian) in
the late '40s and early '50s who first made clothing from fabric
featuring photographic images of surreal items, like a loaf of
bread. Although many people might have thought it silly, it
definitely wasn't silly in principle. These types of fashions were
simply tweaking our perceptions of how things are supposed to
look.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent examples of fashion satire, cites Murray, are
Christian Dior's dresses worn backward (And you thought Celine
Dion's suit was a fresh idea?) in the late '40s, and Yves Saint
Laurent's famous X-ray dress of the mid-'60s that featured a
silhouette of a woman's nude body on the front of a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Popping up every 10 or 20 years, Murray says fashion satires are
just one of the cycles in fashion. And it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a long stretch of severely serious clothes
and Plain Jane looks ... and simple and tasteful gets boring if you
do it long enough. However, I don't think Happy Face purses will
stay long. They simply open the door to a more creative era,'' she
observes.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue fashion director Kelly Bevan Spirer calls
fashion's new direction the cookie cutter rebellion, commenting,
``How many pairs of black loafers and khaki pants can you have?''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that designers and the public are hungry for items
that are special, whether it's the Bohemian look of feathers and
beads, a dress with a message on the front, or a purse with photo
imagery. And, like Murray, Bevan Spirer believes the current trends
are simply a taste of things to come in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, trendies may have trouble locating the latest
looks. Although Gucci's torn and feather-trimmed jeans are in
numerous fashion magazines, a recent search through several
department stores showed none on the racks. Gucci's feather-trimmed
mules, however, were spotted at both Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth
Avenue. Perhaps it's because retailers know there are very few who
are not only brave enough to wear the clothes _ but also brave
enough to fork over several hundred dollars per item.
</P>
<P>
   For those on a budget, torn jeans, poncho tops, Happy Face
buttons and plastic purses can be bought on the cheap at thrift
stores and fast-fashion outposts such as Claire's Accessories and
Rampage. Other sources for making your own fashion satire are craft
stores, where you can buy marabou by the yard and realistic silk
butterflies, as well as funky fashion locales such as the Silver
Lake district or Venice Beach boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where you shop, use a little restraint, say
fashion experts.
</P>
<P>
   Bevan Spirer says it's an item-driven season _ one humorous item
is all you need to jump-start your wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckman says to pay attention to quality, especially when
looking at clothes with photo images or appliques. ``Be sure to try
the clothes on and take note where the objects fall on the body.
Then judge for yourself whether it's humorous or insulting,'' she
advises.
</P>
<P>
   TV stylist Jane Mannfolk stresses the importance of playing down
your clothes with monochromatic color statements or simple lines to
showcase a pair of feathered sandals or a novelty purse, and warns,
``If you overdo it, you'll ruin the effect, and people will laugh
(START ITALICS)at(END ITALICS) you instead of (START
ITALICS)with(END ITALICS) you.''

and Plain Jane looks ... and simple and tasteful gets boring if you
do it long enough. However, I don't think Happy Face purses will
stay long. They simply open the door to a more creative era,'' she
observes.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue fashion director Kelly Bevan Spirer calls
fashion's new direction the cookie cutter rebellion, commenting,
``How many pairs of black loafers and khaki pants can you have?''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that designers and the public are hungry for items
that are special, whether it's the Bohemian look of feathers and
beads, a dress with a message on the front, or a purse with photo
imagery. And, like Murray, Bevan Spirer believes the current trends
are simply a taste of things to come in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, trendies may have trouble locating the latest
looks. Although Gucci's torn and feather-trimmed jeans are in
numerous fashion magazines, a recent search through several
department stores showed none on the racks. Gucci's feather-trimmed
mules, however, were spotted at both Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth
Avenue. Perhaps it's because retailers know there are very few who
are not only brave enough to wear the clothes _ but also brave
enough to fork over several hundred dollars per item.
</P>
<P>
   For those on a budget, torn jeans, poncho tops, Happy Face
buttons and plastic purses can be bought on the cheap at thrift
stores and fast-fashion outposts such as Claire's Accessories and
Rampage. Other sources for making your own fashion satire are craft
stores, where you can buy marabou by the yard and realistic silk
butterflies, as well as funky fashion locales such as the Silver
Lake district or Venice Beach boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where you shop, use a little restraint, say
fashion experts.
</P>
<P>
   Bevan Spirer says it's an item-driven season _ one humorous item
is all you need to jump-start your wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckman says to pay attention to quality, especially when
looking at clothes with photo images or appliques. ``Be sure to try
the clothes on and take note where the objects fall on the body.
Then judge for yourself whether it's humorous or insulting,'' she
advises.
</P>
<P>
   TV stylist Jane Mannfolk stresses the importance of playing down
your clothes with monochromatic color statements or simple lines to
showcase a pair of feathered sandals or a novelty purse, and warns,
``If you overdo it, you'll ruin the effect, and people will laugh
(START ITALICS)at(END ITALICS) you instead of (START
ITALICS)with(END ITALICS) you.''

THE COLOR OF AN EGG IS ALL IN THE FEATHERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Why are some eggs brown and some white? Other than the
color, is there a difference between the two?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Brown and white eggs have the same nutritional value and
quality, says ``Cookwise'' author Shirley O. Corriher. The color
difference, however, is all in the ears. The hen's ears, that is.
The type of chicken actually determines the egg's color. Want to
know what color egg the hen is going to lay? Corriher says, push
back the feathers on the sides of the hen's head. White ears mean
she'll lay white eggs; reddish brown ears mean brown eggs. Looking
for something in a lovely pale shade of green or blue? Check out
the ears of Araucana hens.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the fall crocus is the source of saffron for cooking.
But are spring crocus stamens harvested and used in the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: The saffron crocus looks like its ordinary spring-blooming
relatives, but it always blooms in the fall, says Laurence Sombke,
author of ``Beautiful Easy Herbs.'' The others are poisonous.
Inside each flower of the saffron crocus are three thin red
stigmata, or threads. These are what are harvested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Food Lover's Companion'' by Sharon Tyler Herbst tells
us saffron is the world's most expensive spice. Each saffron crocus
produces only three threads, which must be carefully hand-picked
and then dried. It takes more than 14,000 of them for each ounce of
saffron. That explains the spice's price. The spice is sold in
threads and in powder form. The powered saffron loses its flavor
more quickly than the threads. The threads should be crushed before
using. Saffron, which can be stored for up to six months, should be
placed in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.

CASHMERE DOES BETTER WHEN WASHED BY HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cashmere is a low-maintenance material.
</P>
<P>
   You can take care of it yourself for few pennies and you will
wear it more often because you can wash it. Hand-washing only makes
cashmere better and better, softer and softer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure, it's been on a goat in the Himalayas,'' says
Stephanie Todd, manager of N. Peal, a cashmere boutique in San
Francisco, ``it can take just about anything.'' Except
dry-cleaning, which really doesn't add to the life or luster of a
cashmere sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Simple rules for cashmere care:
</P>
<P>
   Before washing, turn sweater inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Hand wash in any clear, lightweight liquid. Baby shampoo is
actually the best because cashmere is a hair. Make sure you get all
the soap out by rinsing it in cold water. (You can even throw it in
the washing machine on a delicate cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're hand-washing, blot out the extra water by wrapping the
sweater in a towel and pressing gently.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-block the sweater back to its original shape on a towel on
a flat surface _ but make sure you dry it away from direct
sunlight. White cashmere will oxidize and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   When it's dry, you can press a cashmere with a steam iron on
medium heat. Be sure to use steam because the cashmere yarn will
singe.
</P>
<P>
   Store your cashmeres in plastic bags in the bottom half of your
closet or in a lower drawer (heat rises, and so do moths).
</P>
<P>
   Never hang a cashmere sweater.
</P>
<P>
   If you're good to your cashmere, it'll be good to you _ for
years and years and years.

`PINK PANTHER' BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SELLERS, EDWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You may have forgotten, but before he became
Oscar's lovable Furby, Roberto Benigni tried to fill the shoes of
the British comic actor Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards' ``Son of
the Pink Panther'' (1993). But playing the illegitimate offspring
of Inspector Clouseau (Sellers) left even the usually irrepressible
Benigni flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   The film's failure can be put down to it simply being a bad
idea. As hard as he tried, Benigni was too often over the top, with
the gags being more goofy slapstick than rising out of Clouseau's
particular bumbling dim-wittedness.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Sellers were the two men most responsible for the
success of ``The Pink Panther'' series, but the pair reportedly had
an uneasy relationship at best, and a rivalry developed over who
should get the most credit for the films' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' continuation of the series with ``Son'' was seen by
some as an attempt _ a failed one _ to show that he was the comic
genius behind the films. The film illustrates that the two of them
probably needed each other more than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven ``Panther'' films altogether, including ``Son''
and ``The Trail of the Pink Panther,'' which was essentially a
hodgepodge of outtakes strung together as a film. It was released
in 1983, three years after Sellers' death from a heart attack at
the age of 54. Now four of the best of the series _ ``The Pink
Panther'' (1963), ``A Shot in Dark'' (1965) ``The Pink Panther
Strikes Again'' (1976) and the last real collaboration of Sellers
and Edwards, ``The Revenge of the Pink Panther'' (1978) _ are out
on DVD (MGM Home Entertainment; $24.95 each).
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years later (30 in some cases), the ``Panther''
movies hold up _ hilariously. Of course, neither Sellers or Edwards
probably realized what they had on their hands when they started
making ``The Pink Panther,'' which was a comedy-caper movie
starring David Niven, Robert Wagner, Cappucine and Claudia
Cardinale. The inept Clouseau character was meant to supply most of
the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Niven played a sophisticated jewel thief (Sir Charles Lytton),
who the poor inspector is on the trail of but never close to
catching. The Pink Panther? Well, that's actually a priceless gem
that Lytton is out to steal. But the real stealing in this picture
was done by Sellers, who stole the show with his impeccable comic
despite having less screen time than other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   In the next film, ``A Shot in the Dark,'' Inspector Clouseau and
Sellers' comic genius were brought to the forefront. Edwards, who
produced and directed the film, also co-wrote the screenplay with a
comedy writer who would later come up with some head-spinning
ideas, William Peter Blatty, author of ``The Exorcist.'' The film
is filled with one sight gag after another (Clouseau at a nudist
camp is priceless). It also introduced the character of Chief
Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), the inspector's nervous
superior. Dreyfus would find himself frustrated by Clouseau in
subsequent films.
</P>
<P>
   When Sellers returned to play Clouseau more than 10 years later,
his numerous disguises were often the highlights of his films. This
was a trademark of the actor, who played three roles in Stanley
Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove,'' including the title role and the
president of the United States. In ``Revenge'' alone he plays the
vertically challenge Toulouse-Lautrec, a rickshaw driver and a
Swedish herring fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sellers often wasted his talents on turkeys like ``The
Blockhouse'' (1974), where he played six roles, or ``The Great
McGonagall'' (1974), where he played Queen Victoria. Remember
either film? No, probably better for your brain cells. Bad choices
were often the case in Sellers' later career.
</P>
<P>
   He had made his mark in the '50s on the legendary BBC radio
series ``The Goon Show,'' and then starred in a number of terrific
comedies such as ``I'm All Right Jack'' and ``The Mouse That
Roared.'' Besides ``Strangelove,'' in the '60s and early '70s he
was known for those swinging comedies like ``What's New Pussycat?''
``After the Fox,'' ``Casino Royale'' and ``I Love you Alice B.
Toklas.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the success of ``Pink Panther'' series, most of
Sellers' '70s films are forgettable with one notable exception _
the satirical ``Being There'' (1979), for which he received a best
actor Oscar nomination. &UR;

WEST SAYS CRIMES TRIBUNAL MORE PREPARED THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Captain Wayne Hennessy-Barrett wishes
otherwise, but he can't forget the time four years ago when he and
other British soldiers were digging for bodies in a suspected mass
grave in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up a shovelful of earth and found the remains of a
4-year-old boy, one of a group of civilians killed by Bosnian Serb
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those times when your body goes hot and cold at
the same moment,'' the Dublin-born soldier recalled. ``And I
remember thinking, I want to help get the people who did this. We
didn't get as many as we'd have liked in Bosnia, but things will be
different this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be one soldier's idle boast. The conflict in Kosovo
is expected to lead to more war-crimes prosecutions than took place
over the Bosnian turmoil, not necessarily because there will be
more such crimes but because the mechanisms to detect and build
such cases are more sophisticated now.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and analysts say the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague, is much
better organized and more professional than it was during the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   When the tribunal was formed in 1993, it had an annual budget of
$276,000 and a skeleton staff. By 1995, when the Bosnian war ended,
its budget was $25 million. Today, under the leadership of an
American judge, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, it has a budget of $94
million and a staff of 625 from 57 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, say diplomats and analysts, the tribunal gets
strong backing from the Western powers, including the United
States, Britain, and France.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, Britain's defense secretary, has warned
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that after NATO finishes its
military mission against Serb forces, it intends to prosecute some
Serb political and military leaders for war crimes. ``We are
meticulously collecting evidence,'' Robertson said. ``These people
will face justice at The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Milosevic thinks he can cut a deal in which he will pull
back his forces in Kosovo in exchange for an amnesty on war crimes,
he's likely to be sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from The Hague, Christian Chartier, the
tribunal's chief spokesman, said there will be no amnesties for any
war crimes carried out against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo.
``We have come a long way in five years,'' said Chartier. ``We have
established our credibility, and diplomats and politicians have
realized that there will be no lasting peace without justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western powers's backing of the tribunal marks a shift from
1995, when many diplomats suggested that the threat of prosecution
was hindering a settlement to the Bosnian war. ``It's night and day
since Bosnia,'' said Christopher Bennett, a Balkans analyst and
former director of the International Crisis Group in Sarajevo, who
has long lobbied for the tribunal to be at the forefront of
international efforts to stabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that the Bush administration had labeled Milosevic
a war criminal as far back as 1992, but that the Clinton
administration saw Milosevic as someone it had to do business with
to keep the Balkans warfare from spreading. Now, however,
Milosevic's defiance of the West has led the Americans to conclude
that Milosevic is central to the problem. ``This is a trial of
strength. And the West _ and especially the Americans _ are not
going to back down,'' said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   In this conflict, NATO is using sophisticated satellite imaging
to gather evidence of forced marches, and the burning and looting
of villages. ``NATO has good intelligence, and they say they're
going to hand it over to the tribunal,'' said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The British government also once viewed the tribunal as an
impediment to diplomatic settlements, but that changed when Tony
Blair was elected prime minister in 1997 with a massive
parliamentary majority. The British government last year paid for
the construction of the tribunal's third and newest courtroom.
``That huge majority gives Blair the ability to take risks, and to
stand on principle, which John Major's government could not,'' said
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he says, the Americans under US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright now regard the tribunal as a potent weapon in
the campaign to depose Milosevic and stabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, whose jurisdiction allows it to prosecute crimes
committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991, has indicted 83
people so far. Six were convicted, one was acquitted, and charges
were dropped against 18. Some of the most notorious alleged war
criminals, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his military chief Ratko Mladic, remain fugitives, and critics
say the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia have not done enough to
capture them.
</P>
<P>
   Western authorities say that the conflict in Kosovo will lead to
more prosecutions, and that the conviction rate will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees fleeing Kosovo have told of summary executions of
civilians by Serb forces, as they empty and burn villages inhabited
by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population.
While none of these stories has been independently corroborated,
few international observers doubt that war crimes have been
committed as Serb forces conduct a ``scorched earth'' policy in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, has
said she believes war crimes have been committed. Serb authorities
refused to allow Arbour to enter Kosovo in January after 45 ethnic
Albanian civilians were allegedly killed by Serb forces in the
village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Arbour disclosed a secret 1997 indictment issued by
the tribunal against a Serb paramilitary leader, Zeljko Raznatovic,
for alleged crimes during the Bosnian conflict, urging that he be
brought to justice quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, such indictments are kept secret until after an
arrest. But Arbour said that publicizing it would ``put on notice
those who might be inclined to retain his services or to obey his
orders that they, too, will be tainted by their association with an
indicted war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Milosevic could face indictment ``if evidence is
forthcoming that he personally ordered, instigated, or in any other
way participated in offenses within the jurisdiction of the
tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Blythe, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, said members of his group's human rights
staff have begun taking statements from refugees who claim to have
witnessed massacres. Tribunal investigators will do the same, and
seek corroborating physical evidence. But to do that, the bombing
will first have to end, and the Serbs will have to allow
investigators into Kosovo. Neither prospect appears imminent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO soldiers who hope eventually to enter Kosovo to implement a
peace plan say they are prepared to assist in detecting war crimes.
Some of them, like Hennessy-Barrett, the British soldier still
haunted by the image of a little boy's body, have experience that
will prove valuable, both in finding evidence, and in arresting
indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' said Hennessy-Barrett, ``we'll get more of them.
That I can promise.''

POWER MOTIVATES SERB LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charming yet bullying. Confrontational yet evasive. Beloved
Serbian leader whose policies have destroyed his own country. These
are the contradictions posed by Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power a decade ago, Milosevic has drawn on these
complexities to confound Western efforts to bring him to heel. Even
as NATO bombs him, Milosevic spurs his troops onward brutally to
oust ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, to the West's horror and
embarrassment. Now NATO leaders face the dilemma of indicting him
for genocide or negotiating with him, aware of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder his foreign minister once described the 57-year-old
Milosevic to US envoy Richard Holbrooke this way: ``The master will
pull all the strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo ushered Milosevic from obscurity into the political
limelight, and Milosevic has made his toughest stand on the Serbian
province. Milosevic will continue to defy the NATO bombing campaign
while driving as many ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo as he can. He
is likely to hold on to the north and center of Kosovo, rich with
mineral deposits and home to many significant Serbian religious
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan analysts say he will halt the killing only when he senses
he is losing grip on his government, or in full martyrdom, when he
decides it is more convenient to give up in Kosovo and blame the
West for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a megalomaniac, modern-day Balkan despot,'' said
Jack Scanlon, the US ambassador in Belgrade from 1985 to 1989.
``All he cares about is political power.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the Serb province of Kosovo in 1987, Milosevic
first realized the popular appeal of Serb nationalism and tasted
the success of his own demagoguery. Crowds chanted ``Slobo!
Slobo!'' as Milosevic pledged to Kosovo's Serbs: ``No one will dare
beat you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Milosevic returned to Kosovo, riding a wave of
cult-like popularity in a campaign that would make him Serbia's
first democratically elected president. Addressing a rally of 1
million Serbs on Kosovo Polje, the famous battlefield where the
Serbs lost to the Turks in 1389, Milosevic exhorted the crowds to
revel in their Serbdom, which has been suppressed under communist
leader Josip Broz Tito.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brave and dignified and one of the few who went into
battle undefeated,'' he told the cheering Serb crowds. Then, in a
hint of what was to come, Milosevic said: ``Six centuries later we
are again in battles and quarrels. They are not armed battles,
though such things should not be excluded yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected as president of Serbia in 1989, Milosevic went on to
strip Kosovo of its autonomy and its Albanians of their basic
rights, planting the seeds of today's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is the power that invoking Kosovo gives Milosevic _ not
Kosovo itself _ that he cares about. Like many Serbs, he cares
little for the reality of the shabby province, a place where
industrial complexes scar the landscape and trash litters even that
most sacred battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   It is the symbolism of Kosovo that matters, and by now it has
taken on the aura of Custer's last stand. Negotiators who have
raised Kosovo with him say it is where Milosevic always draws the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was singularly opposed to any talk of autonomy there,''
said one State Department diplomat who has met with Milosevic. ``He
went off on a long harangue about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's tragic childhood may provide some clues to his
political ruthlessness. He was born into poverty in the dusty,
unremarkable town of Pozarevac southwest of Belgrade, where he grew
up in a household marked by loss. His father, a Serbian Orthodox
priest, abandoned the family and later killed himself. Milosevic's
mother also committed suicide a decade later, as did his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   In Pozarevac Milosevic met the one person who would shape him
most: his wife, Mirjana Markovic, who has become a significant
player in Belgrade politics after launching her own communist
party. The couple have two children, a daughter who helps shape her
father's image in her job on state-run television and a
free-wheeling tycoon son who is now building a Disney-style theme
park in Pozarevac called ``Bambiland.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has kept his family's humble white house with a red
tile roof and visits it on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Milosevic studied law at Belgrade University and
went on to work as a banker, even spending time in New York. His
genius lies in neither field, however, but in his ability to grasp
issues that resonate with his fellow Serbs and to maintain an iron
grip on the country's media. Even those who oppose him admire his
skillful use of propaganda in the country he has reduced to a
veritable police state.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dr. Goebbels produced was nothing compared to what you
can see on Serbian television,'' commented Milos Vasic, of the
independent weekly Vreme, in a 1994 interview.
</P>
<P>
   With his beady eyes, jutting chin, and distinctive bristling
hair, Milosevic himself rarely appears in public, knowing a
leader's allure and power lie in his lack of accessibility.
Instead, he relies on his propaganda machine in Belgrade to spin
out the vision of Serbs as noble warriors yet historic victims
misunderstood by the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heroic people have demonstrated that we cannot be subdued
by forces of arms,'' said Milosevic in a typically defiant
statement issued Tuesday after his meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``Yugoslavia will never accept giving up
its freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this message of Serb glory, manipulated by Milosevic, that
has allowed him to stay in power even as he has torn Yugoslavia to
pieces. A decade ago, Yugoslavia had six republics, a high standard
of living and was considered the most Western and progressive of
all the countries in the communist world. Today, four of the
republics have seceded and the country has been battered by two
wars. Its citizens live in poverty, their currency all but
meaningless and their economy a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic became president of the rump Yugoslavia, which
consists of Serbia and Montenegro, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With each war, Milosevic would exhort the Serbs to greater glory
and then turn his back on the forces he had unleashed when they
threatened to undermine his own position. Milosevic encouraged
Serbs in a section of Croatia, known as the Krajina, to revolt and
claim the area as their own. But when Croatian troops, aided by US
military advisers, drove the Serbs out of the Krajina in 1995,
Milosevic was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Milosevic imported war to Bosnia, aiding Bosnian Serbs
in 1992 as they joined his call for a ``greater Serbia.'' Yugoslav
army forces aided Bosnian Serb soldiers in ethnically cleansing
huge swaths of northwest Bosnia. Milosevic made no secret of his
frequent consultations with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his top general, Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   But when the tide of history began to turn against the Bosnian
Serbs, Milosevic abandoned them, too. In 1994, Belgrade announced
an embargo against Bosnian Serb leaders. Serb media began to depict
Karadzic as a war profiteer. Milosevic condemned the Bosnian Serbs
when they refused to adopt the Contact Group peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he would emerge as one of the chief peacemakers
in Dayton, when a peace plan was hammered out that would end the
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no beliefs,'' said Peter Galbraith, the former US
Ambassador to Croatia, who was present at Dayton. ``He cares only
about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO members now realize that Milosevic has done a far better
job of manipulating the West than they have him. Instead of
propping up Milosevic as the chief power broker, they say, the
allies should try to reach out to others in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Montenegro, with its feisty leader, Milo Djukanovic,
is one alternative; Milosevic, who purged his Cabinet last fall of
some of his closest allies, also created a pool of malcontents for
the West to tap.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the future of Milosevic and the Balkans will be just
as it has been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken our measure,'' said Galbraith, ``I predict he
will do whatever it takes to ensure he remains on top.''

PERIL SEEN IN SUPPORTING KOSOVO INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ NATO's escalating war against Yugoslavia is
leading policy makers in the United States and Europe to
contemplate backing the Kosovars' quest for independence.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of attempting to turn back the tide of ethnic
separatism around the globe, a decision to support the
secessionists would raise a difficult dilemma: If Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians can have their own state, why can't others?
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say the US-led intervention in the Balkans, while
perhaps morally defensible, has set a dangerous precedent that may
embolden other independence-minded peoples to press for statehood.
It also has prompted other brutalized ethnic minorities to complain
that the United States is practicing a double standard. ``We feel
like the orphans of history,'' said Bakhtiar Amin, an ethnic Kurd
and human rights advocate for what has been described as the
world's largest stateless ethnic group. ``No nation is willing to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ample examples of ethnic minorities enduring even
crueler treatment than the Kosovars for aspiring to create their
own states.
</P>
<P>
   And brutal ethnic cleansing campaigns from Turkey to Rwanda,
where more than half a million were murdered by the former
government in 1994, have failed to trigger foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency is not always a necessary requirement to project
power,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a specialist on the Middle East at
American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the world's only superpower saying, `I, the United
States, am the leader of the world'' on the one hand, ``but I'm not
the global policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   The political calculus used to make that distinction is often
influenced by matters of race, power politics, and a need to
preserve American credibility, specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, where mass killings are taking place from Sierra
Leone to the Congo, the United States has steered clear of military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, Russia faced little official criticism from the
United States as its troops killed tens of thousands of rebels and
civilians in an effort to quash their drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, a member of the military alliance bombing Serbs, has
killed tens of thousands of Kurds and burned more than 3,000
Kurdish villages over the last decade without serious political
repercussions in Washington, according to human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Serbs, the villains of the current Balkan crisis, have
been victims of ethnic cleansing. In 1995, Croatian forces drove
more than 150,000 Serbs from the province of Krajina.
</P>
<P>
   While former US ambassador Peter Galbraith protested the action
at the time by climbing a tractor ferrying refugees to the border,
NATO airplanes were never called in to save the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't devise hard and fast rules; it is the sum of
circumstances,'' said Galbraith. ``We don't intervene in Chechnya
because Russia has nuclear weapons and it's a major power. And NATO
won't intervene in Kashmir or East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith challenged the notion that NATO's support for the
Kosovar Albanians would spur other independence movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a European issue and the possibility of further
Balkanization is finite,'' he said. ``The Basques and the Flemings
and the Walloons are not going to secede.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pakistan mission to the United Nations,
Salman Abbasy, said NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia was sure ``to
promote'' similar action by other powerful countries. When the
Pakistani government sought to put down a secessionist movement by
a breakaway province of East Pakistan in 1971, India invaded on the
grounds that it was seeking to prevent the flow of refugees and
halt a humanitarian crisis. Before they left, they had created a
new state: Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kosovo, US officials said they have been driven
to war by a mix of humanitarian concerns and a desire to prevent
the war from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington maintains that it opposes Kosovo's
independence, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin has hinted
that it may be inevitable, given the diminishing prospect that the
Serbs and Kosovars ``can begin to live together.''
</P>
<P>
   David Phillips, a political analyst at Columbia University, said
that international law contains a built-in tension pitting the
rights of sovereign states against self-determination movements.
And it has dogged American presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, Washington's position was colored by
broader strategic concerns. The United States continued to provide
military and political support to its Cold War ally, Indonesia,
despite its brutal suppression of independence seekers in East
Timor. With the end of the Cold War, Washington has changed its
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips cautioned that ``other groups should not take heart
from NATO intervention and presume support from the international
community for self determination movements. We are not backing
independence movements; we are using force to back diplomacy.''

<P>
   For his follow-up to the enchanting worldwide smash ``Romanza,''
blind tenor Bocelli offers a selection of makeout songs embracing
traditional and contemporary Italian pop, plus his duet with Celine
Dion on ``The Prayer,'' performed at the Academy Awards. Bocelli
boasts a beautiful voice and the romantic orchestrations of numbers
such as ``Cantico,'' and the title track will continue to seduce

BLACKSTREET/``FINALLY'' (Lil' Man/Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   New Jack swing king Teddy Riley and his r&AMP;b harmony quartet
Blackstreet scored three years ago with the delightful
Grammy-winning chart-topper ``No Diggity.'' Now comes the uneven
sequel, which shows even the savviest studio mavens can miss the
boat but not the beat. The disc starts off with ``Can You Feel
Me,'' which builds off a sampled Jacksons bass riff. Next up is the
Janet Jackson showcase, ``Girlfriend/Boyfriend,'' also powered by
memorable bass. Already, though, you're getting a feel for this
album's biggest drawback _ beats and sound effects are taking the
lead over melody. Riley has proven he's a master of rhythm. It's
too bad he didn't cut back on the ballads and focus on tunes. 2 1/2

Blending Vatican Radio broadcasts in five languages with drippy
strings, synth drums, choirs and a female soprano, ``Abba Pater''
isn't going to replace Jay-Z or the Backstreet Boys on the Top 40
anytime soon. But Bingo Night may have gotten a new soundtrack. 1

Sanborn goes for spontaneity and feel over steely perfection.
Dropping by for cameos are such top jazz players as Bill Frisell,
Michael Brecker and Wallace Roney, while Dr. John's ``I Walk on
Guilded Splinters'' is sampled for the funky Miller original
``Trance.'' Another winning track is ``Brother Ray,'' in which
Sanborn's searing alto is pushed by a driving three-piece horn
section. Aimed straight for radio is a Sting vocal on ``Ain't No

likes of the Meters, the Neville Brothers, the Wild Tchoupitoulas
and the Wild Magnolias, whose first two mid-'70s albums are
classics of the genre. Featuring the street-smart singing of Big
Chief Bo Dollis and stellar guests Dr. John, Cyril Neville, Robbie
Robertson and Allen Toussaint, this disc is a party waiting to
break out. Exuberant material such as ``Pocket Change,''
``Pock-A-Nae'' and Robertson's title track fuse the Indians'
call-and-response chants with the Crescent City's patented rhythms
for an infectious good time. 3 1/2 stars

   Sigh. It's difficult not to fall for Evora's wonderfully
delicate Cape Verdean ballads. Her warm, gently mournful mornas
feel like the ocean waves washing over you on the last day of an
island vacation, sweet memories and imminent loss mixed together in
a sensual, sad brew. The voice is in fine form here, with
delightful backing spiced with a muted trumpet and a hint of
harmonica. And the lyrics are translated in the liner notes, so you
can finally figure out what's making her so sad. 3 stars

HOUNDOG/``HOUNDOG'' (Legacy/Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe a new Los Lobos albums is due shortly,
given the near-avalanche of side projects that have hit stores
lately. This one features lone wolf David Hidalgo with Mike Halby,
best known for his work with boogie-blues outfit Canned Heat. Here,
the blues get slowed down to about 25 rpm, with loping, spare stuff
as sad as Ol' Blue moping out on the front porch. The vocals sound
a bit like Ol' Blue too, but the baying fits the instrumentation

VARIOUS/``THE GYPSY ROAD'' (Alula)
</P>
<P>
   The Roma people have roamed indeed. Coming out northern India
hundreds of years ago and slowly moving westward into Europe, they
never quite alighted anywhere, even as they acquired a new name _
the Gypsies. This compilation attempts to give some sense of the
musical migration of the Roma, with Gypsy artists spotlighted from
India to Spain. Those traditions have been quite durable _ and
influential, too. The compilation suffers a bit from the breadth of
selections it brings together, and while there's little coherence
to the selections, the disc does provide a useful entry point for
those interested in exploring a wide-ranging thousand-year-old
musical tradition. 2 1/2 stars

 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Charlee Chhay was only 17 years old when he lost his
parents in Cambodia's killing fields a quarter century ago. He was
an orphan, but he was also the oldest of three brothers. And the
choice he faced was terrifying: He could either hide his family in
the war-torn countryside or try to ferry his brothers to the
relative safety of a refugee camp over the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
   He chose flight.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying no food or water, Chhay strapped Vuthy, who was 12, on
the back of his bicycle for the two-day ride to the Thai border.
Once Vuthy found protection with a friend in the camp, Chhay
slipped back through the mountains, dodging bullets and landmines
meant for the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists to retrieve
his younger brother, Kiravuth, 7.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the refugee camp, the boys endured near-starvation
and the ache of feeling they were alone in the world. Their loss
was cushioned _ but not erased _ once the trio made it to the
safety of a Plymouth, Mass., foster home in 1981 with the help of a
church group.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers found a new life, they lost contact with
their extended family, many of whom were among the 1 million to 2
million Cambodians killed in the fighting between 1975 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, however, Chhay and his brothers, who now live in
Lynn, will be reunited _ on a video hookup _ with an aunt, uncle
and cousins they thought were lost to the past. The story of their
reunion is testimony to an aunt's persistence in a quest to find
her brother's children and the doggedness of the International Red
Cross on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Sopheap Chhay Sok, who had left Cambodia with
her children in 1982 after she learned her husband was living in
France, asked the Red Cross in Paris to help locate the nephews she
had last seen in Phnom Penh in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The scant information Sok supplied made its way last summer to
the desk of Regina Szwadzka, an international social services
coordinator at the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay. Armed
with immigration papers from the Red Cross in Bangkok and pictures
of the boys taken in the refugee camp, Szwadzka started asking
questions. She visited members of the Lutheran church agency in
Newton that had sponsored the brothers; she also placed ads in
local Cambodian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing relatives dislocated by war _ from the Holocaust to the
Rwandan genocide _ has become a key role of the International Red
Cross. In August, the organization will celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Geneva Convention, which granted the relief
agency the authority to look for refugees scattered over the globe.
The searches can last from several months to several years.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where the Cambodian population is estimated at
50,000, the Red Cross traces about 50 cases of Cambodian refugees a
year, second only to the caseload in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Chhay case was complicated because neither family is living
in their native country. To Szwadzka, progress felt glacial. ``We
would make calls, leave messages and wait; it was very
frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Chhay learned the Red Cross was looking for him,
he did not respond. That pattern, Szwadzka said, is a familiar one
among Cambodian refugees. After being traumatized by genocide and
uprooted repeatedly since the mid-1970s, many Cambodians are afraid
to accept or reply to an official message _ even one from the Red
Cross _ for fear that it could somehow harm a relative in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the reactions are visceral. For Chhay, the nightmares
of being chased by Pol Pot's henchmen came rushing back after he
heard the Red Cross was trying to find him.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Szwadzka persisted. ``I knew if he could only meet
me, it would be OK,'' she said. Szwadzka could only reach Chhay
through friends, because he insisted on keeping his telephone
number and address secret. So she sent him a letter through
intermediaries, promising to keep his whereabouts secret from
anyone she could not be sure was a relative.
</P>
<P>
   To Szwadzka's relief, Chhay phoned her after he received her
Feb. 19 letter. Chhay, she said, was incredulous that his relatives
were alive and living in France.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after showing him documents that listed his relatives'
address in France and details Sok had supplied, she convinced him
that some members of his family had indeed survived. Within 24
hours, he was on the phone with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' said Chhay, whose eyes brimmed with tears as
he recalled the terror of running from the soldiers. ``I didn't
think I had any more family. We came here just the three of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chhay, who is now a technician for a Wakefield laser company
where Vuthy is an assembler, was the only one of the brothers who
remembered his relatives; he was especially fond of Sok, who used
to serve him bowls of sweet sticky rice and juicy Asian pears.
Through the years, Chhay said he had never tried to track down any
family members, in part because he recalled only nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Chhay has learned that 60 relatives perished in
the conflict in his homeland. But he also has found out that
several other family members survived, including a few who are
still living in Cambodia. Sok and her husband, who had been a
Cambodian air force instructor who did not return to the country
when war broke out, and other cousins are safe in France.
</P>
<P>
   After Chhay accepted the idea that he had family, albeit an
ocean away, it was a relief. ``It was like he (Chhay) took some
very heavy bags from his shoulders,'' Szwadzka said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four weeks, Chhay and his brothers have had long
conversations with their relatives in France, trying to recapture
some of the lost 25 years. But Chhay said he really won't believe
his aunt is alive until he sees her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many years I've been thinking of this aunt, who looks like
my grandmother,'' Chhay said. ``I saw her in my dreams, but in my
head I'm not sure she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the money on either side of the Atlantic to pay for
travel, the families may have to settle for the teleconference,
which is being sponsored by Sullivan and Cogliano, a computer
networking company in Waltham. The firm responded to an appeal by
the Red Cross to defray the cost of a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for the video reunion have taken place during
the ``ethnic cleansing'' and NATO bombing in Kosovo, when refugee
issues are resonating everywhere. ``I can feel how the refugees
feel right now,'' Chhay said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the news that some members of his family survived,
he is comforted. ``I don't feel like I'm alone anymore.'' Chhay
said.

MICROSOFT JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Here's an idea: Let's have one of our bombers drop federal
prosecutor David Boies on Belgrade. Maybe he can pound some sense
into this Milosevic fellow. He certainly did the job on Microsoft
Corp., which is finally engaged in serious discussions to end its
public humiliation at the hands of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to feel much sympathy for Microsoft, a company that is
doing today what it should have done 18 months ago. Back then,
Gates' crew could probably have averted the antitrust suit by
providing a version of their Windows operating system shorn of its
Internet browser. Big deal _ nobody would have used it anyway.
Instead Gates and his people chose to fight. Now they find
themselves squatting in rubble of their own making, wondering what
went wrong and hoping the conquerors will toss them a few chocolate
bars.
</P>
<P>
   As in any war, there are folks on the home front who want no
mercy for the vanquished, while others, thinking they've suffered
enough, want to offer generous terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is no doubt dreaming of getting off with another
consent decree, similar to the one the company signed off on in
1995 to settle an earlier antitrust case. This new decree would
surely be tougher and more sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Microsoft might pledge to sell its operating
system software to all comers at the same price and allow computer
makers to provide a version stripped of the Internet Explorer
browser. Surely it would ban those cozy deals with Internet
providers that Microsoft used to freeze out the rival Netscape
Internet browser. The decree might even require Microsoft to
provide companies with a look at the crown jewels _ the actual
source code for Windows. That would mollify competing software
makers who say that Microsoft includes ``secret'' features in
Windows to make sure that other firms' Windows programs don't work
as well as Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Justice Department settles for this, cries of
``sellout'' will fill the air. Microsoft will certainly try to
wriggle through every available loophole, as they did with the 1995
decree. Besides, many despise Gates and want to see him hanging by
the heels. Short of that, they want a corporate equivalent of the
death penalty _ the dismantling of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   This radical surgery might involve simply dividing Microsoft's
operating systems business, its other software activities and its
Internet operations into three separate firms. An even tougher
concept, the ``Baby Bill'' approach, would set up several
mini-Microsofts. Each would have the right to produce all of
Microsoft's current products. But because each would compete with
the others, none would have a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of Microsoft's skill at making enemies that the
Baby Bill plan has won the support of Robert Bork, a jurist
renowned for his hostility to antitrust lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A breakup will certainly make life easier for Microsoft's
competitors. But it seems a rather harsh penalty for a company that
has at worst been shown up as arrogant and thuggish. To justify
such rough handling, one surely ought to set out the case that
Microsoft has actually harmed the public in some fashion. And on
that point, the government has had virtually nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   There are practical problems with a Microsoft breakup as well.
If you chop Microsoft into three firms, at least two of them will
still hold monopolies, in operating systems and office suites. And
what's to stop the operating system company from adding, say, word
processing and spreadsheets to its product?
</P>
<P>
   As for the Baby Bill plan, say you've got three different
companies selling Windows. What do you suppose they'll do to win
market share from one another? You guessed it _ they'll each create
their own unique versions of Windows, each with different features.
Sounds nice until you realize that soon one version of Windows will
no longer be compatible with the others. And there goes Windows'
biggest advantage for consumers _ the fact that every Windows
computer works the same way. Kosovo's bad enough without
balkanizing the software market.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a stiff consent decree and vigorous enforcement lacks
the satisfying simplicity of putting Bill Gates' head in a trophy
case. But it's probably better for computer users like you and me.

LABEL TROUBLES DON'T GET TONY JOE WHITE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When we got swamp rocker Tony Joe White on the
phone a few months ago, things were looking up.
</P>
<P>
   He had just completed a terrific new album for Mercury Records,
due to be issued shortly afterward. But weeks later, news broke
that the label was about to be devoured _ and dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, six months after advance cassettes of ``One Hot July''
were mailed out to critics across the country, White's 11th album
is still on hold and may not be issued by the label in the U.S. at
all.
</P>
<P>
   A Mercury spokesperson said the record was too good to toss away
and would eventually be released by the label or another imprint
this summer. ``One Hot July'' is in stores, however, in Australia,
where White has maintained a large fan base for decades.
</P>
<P>
   White _ known for his 1969 Top 10 bayou-rock hit ``Polk Salad
Annie'' (covered by Elvis Presley) and for writing Brook Benton's
chart-topping r&AMP;b smash ``Rainy Night in Georgia'' _ takes such
setbacks with a laid-back shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never cared much about show business,'' he says. ``I haven't
changed a whole lot; I'm almost like a lone wolf out there. I just
play my guitar and don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born 55 years ago on a cotton farm in Oak Grove, La., White is a
true son of the Deep South. With a husky, smoldering voice and an
eloquent guitar style finger-picked on his 1961 Stratocaster, White
draws upon an earthy voodoo folklore of alligators, hoot owls and
all manner of swamp life.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and fans include Eric Clapton, J.J. Cale and occasional
jam partner Mark Knopfler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four of us get a lot of flak because we sometimes sound
the same,'' White said. ``It's because we all listened to Delta
guys like Lightnin' Hopkins and John Lee Hooker growing up. If
anything, I don't think anyone can touch Knopfler on guitar. He
hits some kind of thing that just kills me. He comes to my house,
and we hang out, build a fire, get a couple of acoustic guitars and
you can't believe the licks falling around the campfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Although White's vinyl albums are collector's items, and CDs cut
for his own Swamp Fox label are distributed only in Europe, a fine
single-disc retrospective called ``Polk Salad Annie: The Best of
Tony Joe White'' was issued in 1994 on Warner Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think if they can't hear or see you, you've
quit,'' said White, who worked with Tina Turner on her 1989
``Foreign Affair'' album, writing four songs and playing guitar and
harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   But while success has eluded him at home, he draws huge crowds
in France and Australia, often accompanied only by a drummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rhythm section isn't a necessity,'' said White, a father of
three, grandfather of one and husband to wife Leann for 35 years.
``It's almost a luxury to play 30 or 40 minutes alone. The crowd is
shouting out every swamp tune I ever wrote, and by then it's
rocking so hard you don't need anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hopefully forthcoming ``One Hot July'' continues White's
earthy mix of Mississippi blues, r&AMP;b and deep-fried soul with such
standouts as ``Across From Midnight'' and the moody ``Cold
Fingers,'' featuring some of the most plain sanctified Strat work
since Dire Straits' debut album or the last Cale effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you leave out is what's really important,'' White
explained. ``We cut it in the swamp, in this studio on 40 acres of
woods complete with alligators and everything. The realness of the
thing is what does it. There's a lot of breathing room in the
music, and it gives the listener space to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a lot of those songs are one-takes _ just turn on the
tape recorder and let it roll.'' &QL;

FOR BOTH PARTIES, SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To some who watch the way Washington wages war, the
Capitol Hill vote on NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia seemed upside
down. Legions of liberal Democrats, including Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, backed the military intervention, while many of the usual
Republican hawks opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators voted the other way in 1991, when Congress
authorized the use of force in the Gulf War. This has led to
widespread suggestions that the parties are simply following the
wishes of whichever leader is in the White House, rather than
acting on principle.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who voted in 1991 against the Gulf War,
on the grounds that diplomacy should be given more time to work,
disagreed with Republicans who had made a similar argument on the
Kosovo vote. Kerry backs the NATO air assault, and has chided
Republicans who opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote was 58-41 in favor of backing the NATO air
campaign, with 38 of 55 Republicans opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has taken over foreign policy in a way that in the
past we managed to avoid,'' Kerry said. Those who supported
intervention ``in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, and Desert Storm are
suddenly opposed to the very same kind of intervention on greater
foundation. It is called politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics plays a major role, but members of Congress and foreign
policy experts say another trend is at work as well, perhaps
indicating a shift in the way two parties view war. Simply put, the
end of the Cold War has changed the way many politicians look at
military action.
</P>
<P>
   For many Republicans, especially those who supported the Gulf
War, the vote on Kosovo has reopened one of the oldest debates for
the party: whether the United States should be internationalist and
should police world affairs, or whether it should be isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   For many Democrats, including some of the most liberal
legislators, the vote last week was cast not just on the question
of foreign policy, but also on humanitarian policy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senator Paul David Wellstone, the Minnesota
Democrat and one of the most liberal members of Congress, peppered
a news release defending his support of air attacks with references
to his concern about the unfolding ``humanitarian disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   William Hyland, a former national security official in the Nixon
and Reagan administrations and former editor of Foreign Policy
magazine, said the Kosovo vote indicates a fundamental shift for
the two political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much who has the power in the White House, as the
end of the Cold War,'' Hyland said. ``The end of the Cold War has
changed the whole strategic calculation. It is now legitimate to be
for intervention, to say we should go into Bosnia, into Kosovo, to
defend values. In the Cold War that would have immediately have
resulted in someone who said, `Yeah, you want a nuclear war?' So we
didn't intervene in Hungary or Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Cold War is over, the risks of intervention are
suddenly quite different. That allows liberals or Democrats to say,
`OK, we have to stand up for things, if necessary use military
power.' And Republicans are lapsing kind of back to, `We might be
able to defeat these guys, but we're not the world's policeman,' ''
Hyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who voted against the Gulf War, and for the
Kosovo intervention, said last week that the two situations are
different, and that no trends are at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf War resolution was rushed through Congress at a time
when many of us felt that ongoing diplomatic initiatives had not
yet been exhausted,'' Kennedy said. ``Kosovo is entirely different.
It was clear beyond any doubt that the only language President
Milosevic understands is force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, who also initially
opposed the Gulf War, said: ``I think in this case we have
exhausted every single diplomatic option available.'' He also
asserted that NATO had requested US participation.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats, meanwhile, say the party initially was too
quick to say that Clinton could act without congressional
authority. Representative Barney Frank of Newton, while supporting
the air attacks, said he was disappointed that most Democrats
initially were willing to let Clinton act without explicit
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Reagan and Bush, Democrats generally argued the
president needs congressional authorization to put our troops in
potential combat, and Republicans said it was a matter of
presidential prerogative,'' Frank said. ``A very large percent have
switched.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, the House voted mostly along party lines to back
the deployment of 4,000 US troops as part of a NATO effort in
Kosovo. After the air raids were launched last week, the House
voted Wednesday 424-1, with Democrat Barbara Lee of California the
lone dissenter, to express support for the troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of whether Democrats have dropped
concerns about whether the War Powers Act should be invoked. It
requires the president to notify Congress within 90 days that he
has placed US troops ``into hostilities or into situations where
imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The act also requires the president to withdraw those troops
unless Congress declares war or specifically authorizes the use of
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, when Clinton notified Congress of the Kosovo
action, Kerry said the act had not become an issue because the
Kosovo action, technically, is not a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not yet war,'' Kerry said in an interview. ``We
haven't declared war. If this went on for a period of time, it
would then be under the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate of last week, the question of whether senators
were switching their view on intervention became central. Senator
Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, questioned why Senator Joseph R.
Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, was supporting the Kosovo
intervention when he had opposed the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf War debate, Biden argued that President Bush was
unconstitutionally trying to wage war without congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the difference between that situation'' in the Persian
Gulf ``and this threat the senator is describing in Serbia and in
Kosovo now?'' Stevens asked Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference,'' Biden replied. ``The difference
is it is in the center of Europe, number one. Number two, if Europe
in fact becomes destabilized, we are deeply involved in matters far
beyond what is existing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden then tried a novel argument, saying Republicans had been
right in the Gulf War debate and so should support Clinton on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out it made sense to move in the Gulf, and I argue it
makes sense for us to take this action now in the Balkans,'' Biden
said.

WHAT THE US MUST DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Failed nation-states fall into three rough categories. First and
foremost are mega-states like Russia and China. They're too big
(and nuclear) to be allowed to fail, even though they have failed
or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   It is US policy to provide the maximum possible assistance to
these nation-states as they convert from command economies to
market economies. The goal is to integrate them gradually into the
consortium of developed nations and thus diminish, step-by-step,
their incentives for military adventurism.
</P>
<P>
   The second category is comprised of failed nation-states that
are insane.
</P>
<P>
   These include North Korea and Iraq, to mention just two. The
signal characteristic of this group is that they are fully capable
of insane acts, like deploying nuclear weapons for no apparent
reason or engaging in chemical and biological warfare against real
or imagined enemies. It is US policy to contain these countries, by
force when necessary, so that their ability to wreak wider havoc is
minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The third category is comprised of failed nation-states that
don't matter, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   These include countries like Rwanda and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Their governments have failed, their economies have collapsed,
their people suffer terribly, but there are otherwise no serious
consequences. It is unstated US policy to ignore these countries
for as long as possible unless and until they become such a
nuisance that something has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has, for most of the 1990s, shuttled back and forth
between the ``insane'' category and the ``doesn't matter''
category. Yugoslavia contributes nothing to the global economy. It
isn't territorially significant. It ``matters'' only to the degree
that it threatens to engage the Balkans in wider conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It matters now. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
genocidal campaign against Kosovo has vaulted his country into the
uppermost ranks of failed-and-insane nation-states. The inability
of US and NATO air-power to contain Milosevic's havoc now requires
a much greater US commitment to expelling Serbian forces from
Kosovo and an expanded diplomatic campaign to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, the United States must now declare the
equivalent of war on the Milosevic regime and use all acceptable
means to destroy his military and para-military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Those means include the deployment of US troops in large
numbers. Indeed, the crisis in Yugoslavia calls for full
implementation of the Powell Doctrine, which states that the US
commit overwhelming force in overwhelming numbers to crush military
forces that are hostile to US interests.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of not doing so are simply unacceptable. The
problem with failed-and-insane nation-states is that there are,
potentially, a lot of them. Because of telecommunications, each
knows what the other is getting away with at any given moment. If
it becomes apparent that genocide is tolerable, then other
failed-and-insane nation-states will conclude, correctly, that
anything goes so long as it doesn't move too far afield.
</P>
<P>
   And they will act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the United States is currently involved in two
``police'' actions against failed-and-insane nation-states. There's
the ongoing air-war in Iraq and there's the 9-day-old air-war over
Yugoslavia. It is possible that the United States soon may have to
engage in a third police action, against North Korea, which is
teetering on the brink of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And there may well be more ``police actions'' needed if the
United States does not use overwhelming force somewhere. At some
point, our ability to execute such actions is overwhelmed by their
number.
</P>
<P>
   Military planners would not have chosen Yugoslavia as the ideal
place to deploy overwhelming force, but at this point the United
States has little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Either we commit ourselves to the destruction of Milosovec's
forces or we lay waste to the credibility of our threat to every
failed-and-insane nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Yugoslavia could not come at a worse time for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's credibility has been destroyed by his
ceaseless mendacity. The military officers who report to him have
the gravest doubts about his willingness to stay any course. He has
surrounded himself with what most experts agree is the weakest
national security advisory team of the post-World War II era. And
little has been done to prepare Americans for what may well become
a protracted military engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we're stuck with these people for the next 22
months. Their decisions will either make the world a safer or more
dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the president should do is retract his promise
to never commit ground troops to the conflict. The second thing he
should do is intensify the air war by a factor of five. The third
thing he should do is initiate commmando raids into Kosovo to
intercept Serbian death squads and kill them. And the fourth thing
he should do is reduce Belgrade's infrastructure to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Milosovec will respond to is overwhelming force.
The sooner the United States applies such force, the sooner the
insanity will abate.

DESIGNERS GET INSPIRATION FROM THE STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The street'' is more and more the source.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers get a lesson in what people are really
wearing, and they translate accordingly: Tommy Hilfiger sells his
preppie khakis (albeit three sizes too big) to hip-hop kids. Anna
Sui borrows the look for her spring runway in a pair of acid green
holographic-treated cotton Home Boy jeans. Hooded sweatshirts are
the uniform of the street _ and now nearly every designer, from
Michael Kors to Bill Blass, has adapted it in cashmere, cotton,
silk or wool.
</P>
<P>
   Women's designers are claiming street looks and tweaking them to
cross the gender line _ note the appropriation of military cargo
pants by no less a ``classics'' designer than Ralph Lauren. For
spring, there isn't a major American designer who hasn't done
cargos _ from the most expensive (Ralph Lauren's Easter egg silks
in pink, blue, green and yellow ran $1,150) to the most practical
(Banana Republic's khaki/chino collection).
</P>
<P>
   And to go with them: the ubiquitous cashmere undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   Cashmere T's are definitely in for spring and summer. Cashmere
has been refined and thinned down for the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Usually one-ply, summer T's fit closely, just like underwear,
and require racer-back or no-seam bra styles, or for the very
intrepid, no bra at all.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirt dressing isn't just relegated to cargos and chinos; with
Banana Republic's short shorts, a great new pair of Levis or Gap
jeans, or trim white trousers, they're a go-anywhere item.
</P>
<P>
   The casual pleasure of slipping into something very, very
comfortable for nighttime finds the cashmere T quite at home with
silks, satins, tuxedos and pricey, European couture, too: Like
Michael Kors' hand-sewn rock crystal skirt for Celine and Giorgio
Armani's slinky pull of embroidered fuchsia with the thigh-high
slit. (Keri Russell wore the orange version to the Golden Globes
with a strapless hankie top).
</P>
<P>
   Allison Speer, West Coast public relations chief for Giorgio
Armani, declares cashmere T's to be ``chic.'' (When Speer showed up
for the fashion shoot, she was wearing a black cashmere undershirt
T with a cardigan over, from Banana Republic.) ``I'm addicted to
cashmere,'' she giggled. ``I sleep in a cashmere Ralph Lauren Aran
Isle blanket each night; I'm traveling to Italy this weekend and
I'll wrap myself in a cashmere shawl. It's such a comfortable way
to dress. So modern, so '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   At Banana Republic, you can buy a cashmere T for under $100; at
Saks, a private-label undershirt goes for $225, about $20 under
Emporio Armani's fluffy, cloud-like one-ply T's in shades of gray,
cream and lavender (which is quite a bargain considering that all
of Emporio's cashmeres are milled at Italy's Loro Piana, which
makes some of the finest cashmere in the world).
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this sweater and these pants,'' squealed Planet
Hollywood's energetic Lori Puccinelli. ``I'm definitely getting
this. It's soooo comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And then someone informed Puccinelli that her cargo pants topped
$1,100, to which she immediately rejoined, ``and I won't be getting
them any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cecilia de Quesada, modeling Banana Republic was not a great
stretch. ``I live in Banana,'' said the slender and stunning
daughter of Urannia Ristow. ``I love the shorts. They're a good
length, not too long, not too short. And the tanks are neat; I like
layering them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always loved that look _ of casual cashmere with a
knock-out skirt,'' said Kimberly Bakker who dresses up almost every
night. ``I loooove this; I feel much more comfortable
underdressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The point? Fashion's rules are bending since the young
fashionables spend so much time not dressed up. They're in the gym;
they're digging in the back yard; they've dressed down on Fridays
and aren't about to dress up on Friday night unless they can take
some of that casual comfort with them.
</P>
<P>
   Call it luxurious comfort clothing; it's what people want to
wear. In taking it off the street, these designers are on the right
track.

A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I saw death at work, right before my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing by my kitchen window, half dreaming, watching the
birds at my feeder, when suddenly there was a swoop of feathers and
all but one of the birds took flight. Despite the snow falling
outside, I'd been reflecting on their easy life _ the protective
shelter of the rhododendron, the warm fluff of their feathers, a
feeding station full of seeds and suet _ but now something fierce
and frightening was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   I could make out a hawk the size of a pigeon on the ground under
the feeder. I identified it immediately by its curved beak and long
talons though I'd never seen one up close before. It looked as if
the hawk was trying to fly, despite the small black bundle in its
claws dragging it down. It took several leaps into the air before
falling back, but in moments the creature in its grasp ceased its
struggling, and I understood this was the hawk's pattern for
killing. Had it strangled the bird? Broken its neck? I couldn't
tell.
</P>
<P>
   With all those black feathers, the victim had to be a starling,
but with both wings tightly pinned to its sides, it seemed to have
shrunk. Its body was so compressed, it looked like a narrow black
umbrella with a yellow beak handle. I wondered briefly whether I
ought to do something, but by the time I'd made sense of the event,
it was too late to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   I settled in to watch the proceedings. The hawk began plucking
feathers with its beak, tossing them into the snow. When it had
cleared an area near the stomach, it broke through into organs that
must have still been warm. I watched it swallow strings of
intestine, as if it were slurping up pasta in marinara sauce. It
tossed the craw aside. When it had emptied the central cavity, it
denuded the wings and chewed on some substance it discovered there.
Between every bite, it flicked its head left and then right, slowly
circling the body as it ate in order to extend its angle of vision.
It seemed hyper-aware of its vulnerability on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   By now there was a small circle of pale red snow under the body,
as if someone had tinted the background with a splash of
watercolor. There was little left of the starling but the head, two
feet, and one long feather at each wingtip. The outside membrane
attaching these parts to one another had been scooped as clean as a
lobster shell, except for a gleaming red tube running from front to
middle, which, when I examined it later, turned out to be the neck.
Finished at last, the hawk took a step back and hopped to a nearby
fence. It strutted back and forth several times before flying into
the upper branches of a nearby maple. In minutes, it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Marblehead, the most densely populated town in Massachusetts,
has little space for wildlife. I suppose that's why this hawk left
its natural habitat and suddenly dropped from the sky into my yard
at 3 o'clock on a Monday afternoon. The whole thing can't have
taken more than a half-hour, but a week later, I still feel the
lingering effects of horror.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the idea of birds eating birds that takes getting
used to. I'm comfortable with the idea of owls eating mice, but it
was a shock to see one winged creature feed upon another. Part of
the surprise was seeing a hawk prey upon birds I've come to think
of as nearly tame because they're used to my feeding them. These
were suburban birds, for goodness' sake. I hadn't known the world
they inhabited was red in beak and claw. Yet perhaps the scene made
such a powerful impression for still another reason. As soon as the
hawk was gone, I went looking for a book to soothe my jangled
nerves. When I selected Carlos Castaneda's book ``Journey to
Ixtlan,'' it fell open to the page where Castaneda is recalling a
time he'd awakened from a nap to find a falcon he'd been pursuing
perched in a tree above his head. He tells Don Juan that although
he'd planned to kill it, he was strangely reluctant to shoot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is our eternal companion,'' Don Juan tells him. ``It is
always to our left, at arm's length. It was watching you when you
were watching the white falcon.'' I read that last sentence twice.
Is that why I felt so chilled by the sudden appearance outside my
window of a bird of prey? Is that the reason I felt unnerved by how
swiftly and surely it went about its deadly business? Is that why I
felt such pity for an ordinary starling, selected at random to end
its unremarkable life?
</P>
<P>
   A week has passed. The birds are slowly returning. I hope
they're keeping one eye cocked to the sky. As for me, every time I
leave the house, I carefully search our maple for the telltale
outline of a hawk.

CHEMICAL IN GREEN TEA MAY INHIBIT TUMORS  
 FOLLOW-UPS FOR CANCER FALL SHORT, DOCTORS SAY  
 AID CUTS HIT MOTHERS WITH ILL CHILD AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

Chemical in green tea may inhibit tumors 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Green tea contains a chemical that chokes off the new blood
vessel supply that cancerous tumors need to grow, a research team
in Sweden reports. The report, based on mouse and test-tube
experiments, may be the first solid evidence for a blood vessel
growth blocker in a natural plant substance, one US researcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This observation sounds fascinating and is probably very
important,'' said Dr. Peter Polverini of the University of
Michigan. ``It's the first of many likely to emerge in the next few
years as people look for these compounds in plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Boston's Dr. Judah Folkman, scientists around the world
are investigating drugs that block or promote blood vessel growth,
both of which have tantalizing potential to treat cancer, heart
disease, and diabetes. But no one knows whether such drugs will be
effective and safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, scientists have accumulated data
suggesting that consumption of green tea is associated with lower
rates of some cancers in large human populations (in China) and in
laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   The new report, which appears in this week's Nature, brings the
two lines of research together. Yihai Cao and Renhai Cao of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that a component of green
tea called EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) inhibited the growth
of new blood vessels in the test tube.
</P>
<P>
   Lab mice raised on a weak solution of green tea had sharply
reduced new blood vessel growth in their corneas, compared to mice
that drank only water, after scientists injected the eyes of both
groups with a substance that stimulates vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this hits the street, there probably won't be any green
tea on the shelf,'' Polverini said, althought he won't be adding it
to his diet just yet. ``This field has had many bumps in the road,
and we have to understand the mechanisms,'' the Michigan scientist
cautioned. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Follow-ups for cancer fall short, doctors say &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 Americans will undergo surgery for colon and
rectal cancer this year, but for 31,000 the disease will return
within five years. So doctors must be on the lookout for
recurrences in this high-risk group. However, most of the follow-up
tests doctors now perform for colorectal cancer are worthless, a
leading group of cancer doctors says in a statement released this
week.
</P>
<P>
   An expert panel of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
reviewed all the studies they could find on 10 different follow-up
tests and concluded that only two are useful: a regular physical
exam, and a colonoscopy every three to five years, in which doctors
insert a fiber-optic device to examine the length of the large
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the panel estimated, about 75 percent of doctors who
do follow-up care for colorectal cancer perform colonoscopies every
six to 12 months after surgery, but there's no evidence such
frequency does any good. A blood test for CEA (carcinoembryonic
antigen) can sometimes pick up a recurrence, but 30 percent of
these cancers do not produce CEA and the test misses some that do.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended against relying on liver function tests,
tests for blood in the stool, computed tomography scans, blood
counts, and chest X-rays to screen for colorectal cancer
recurrence. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Aid cuts hit mothers with ill child at home &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's a mom to do when work interferes with caring for a sick
child? It's a dilemma for millions, but a study published this week
in the American Journal of Public Health shows the problem is
especially severe for millions of women and children who have lost
public assistance since federal welfare reform in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those reforms ``assumed that parents leaving welfare for work
would face conditions similar to those faced by parents already in
the work force,'' said Dr. S. Jody Heymann of the Harvard School of
Public Health and Alison Earle of Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they found, welfare-to-work moms are more likely to be
caring for at least one child with a chronic health condition. But
36 percent lacked any sick-leave time, compared to 20 percent among
employed women who never were on welfare.

COURT JUSTICES BASED DECISION ON CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Justices text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ They are five white men, the cream of their
profession, and the choice of a string of conservative governors.
They have led Army platoons, tussled in politics, or earned
reputations as spellbinding storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   They work in a building on a bluff on the Merrimack River. They
choose their cases by pulling slips of paper from a handsome silver
pitcher. And 15 months ago they issued a decision that landed with
seismic force in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The state's method of paying for its schools was illegal, the
court ruled. And, in an order that has yet to be fulfilled by
Thursday's deadline, it told state policymakers to find a new way
to fund education.
</P>
<P>
   In a state known for its conservatism, the court demanded
radical change, reshaping the political terrain of the Granite
State.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision touched off fiery talk of placing term
limits on the court's justices and efforts to diminish the court's
oversight of educational funding.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Republican lawmakers, led by 27-year-old
freshman David Corbin of Stratham, are still arguing that the
Claremont decision, named for one of the poor towns in the original
lawsuit, was an unconstitutional power grab by the Supreme Court.
They want the Legislature to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, court observers said, the far-reaching
school-finance decision seemed jarringly incongruous coming from a
court shaped by GOP governors from Meldrim Thomson Jr. to Stephen
E. Merrill. But some law professors and veteran attorneys said
careful students of the court should not have been startled by its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody,'' said Fred
Upton, 80, a Concord lawyer who has practiced law in the state for
a half century. ``I know some people have claimed the decision was
social engineering. But they did their duty despite the political
winds of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the court found that the right to public education is a
fundamental right akin to the right to free speech or assembly, and
that New Hampshire is one state and not a collection of towns and
school districts, the old district-by-district system to pay for
schools was doomed. In essence, the court's dramatic decision was
wrought by the simple language of the state Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a word that describes this court, it's
independent,'' said James Duggan, interim dean of the Franklin
Pierce Law School. ``They take their responsibility as equal branch
of the government very seriously. It's a practical court that is
very conscious of the impact their decisions have on the trial
court, on police, and on citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court is led by Chief Justice David A.
Brock, a 62-year-old former Dartmouth College hockey goalie, who
was Richard Nixon's choice for US attorney in New Hampshire in
1969. Brock, a native of Stoneham, Mass., the father of six, and a
former Army intelligence officer, is well-known in legal circles
for a 1985 ruling that roadblocks to stem drunken driving amount to
unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   But he also authored the 4-1 schools funding decision, and has
publicly defended it in the face of a conservative outcry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision's lone dissenter, Justice Sherman D. Horton Jr.,
was the former law partner of Governor Hugh Gregg _ an avuncular
yarn-spinner who replaced David Souter on the court when Souter
joined the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston before his
appointment to the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   When Horton was appointed in 1990, he was the first high court
nominee in 44 years never to have served as a justice in a lower
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that real social policy ought to be set
by the Legislature,'' Horton said when he was nominated.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what some critics of the school finance decision
said the Supreme Court did when it threw out the existing local
property tax system of paying for public classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise to me because I did not see our court in New
Hampshire as being one that typically ventured into areas that have
been traditionally reserved for resolution by the political
branches of government,'' said Manchester lawyer Eugene Van Loan
III.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Hesse, a constitutional law professor at Franklin
Pierce Law School who was part of the plaintiffs' legal team in the
schools funding case, insisted that the court has been restrained
and mainstream, a body that has been reluctant to make radical
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no way they could have arrived at any other
conclusion but that the (local property) tax is not proportional
and reasonable,'' Hesse said. ``These are five guys who are up
there, trying to do the best job that they can. They're not
infallible.''

   The court decision that has had the state in turmoil for 15
months came down to just five people. One justice, William F.
Batchelder, retired from the high court in 1995 but was named a
special justice in the case to replace Justice W. Stephen Thayer
III, who had recused himself because his wife had chaired the state
board of education. The vote, in December 1997, was 4 to 1, with
Justice Sherman D. Horton Jr. dissenting.

FOR BOTH PARTIES, SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To some who watch the way Washington wages war, the
Capitol Hill vote on NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia seemed upside
down. Legions of liberal Democrats, including Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, backed the military intervention, while many of the usual
Republican hawks opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators voted the other way in 1991, when Congress
authorized the use of force in the Gulf War. This has led to
widespread suggestions that the parties are simply following the
wishes of whichever leader is in the White House, rather than
acting on principle.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who voted in 1991 against the Gulf War,
on the grounds that diplomacy should be given more time to work,
disagreed with Republicans who had made a similar argument on the
Kosovo vote. Kerry backs the NATO air assault, and has chided
Republicans who opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote was 58-41 in favor of backing the NATO air
campaign, with 38 of 55 Republicans opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has taken over foreign policy in a way that in the
past we managed to avoid,'' Kerry said. Those who supported
intervention ``in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, and Desert Storm are
suddenly opposed to the very same kind of intervention on greater
foundation. It is called politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics plays a major role, but members of Congress and foreign
policy experts say another trend is at work as well, perhaps
indicating a shift in the way two parties view war. Simply put, the
end of the Cold War has changed the way many politicians look at
military action.
</P>
<P>
   For many Republicans, especially those who supported the Gulf
War, the vote on Kosovo has reopened one of the oldest debates for
the party: whether the United States should be internationalist and
should police world affairs, or whether it should be isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   For many Democrats, including some of the most liberal
legislators, the vote last week was cast not just on the question
of foreign policy, but also on humanitarian policy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senator Paul David Wellstone, the Minnesota
Democrat and one of the most liberal members of Congress, peppered
a news release defending his support of air attacks with references
to his concern about the unfolding ``humanitarian disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   William Hyland, a former national security official in the Nixon
and Reagan administrations and former editor of Foreign Policy
magazine, said the Kosovo vote indicates a fundamental shift for
the two political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much who has the power in the White House, as the
end of the Cold War,'' Hyland said. ``The end of the Cold War has
changed the whole strategic calculation. It is now legitimate to be
for intervention, to say we should go into Bosnia, into Kosovo, to
defend values. In the Cold War that would have immediately have
resulted in someone who said, `Yeah, you want a nuclear war?' So we
didn't intervene in Hungary or Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Cold War is over, the risks of intervention are
suddenly quite different. That allows liberals or Democrats to say,
`OK, we have to stand up for things, if necessary use military
power.' And Republicans are lapsing kind of back to, `We might be
able to defeat these guys, but we're not the world's policeman,' ''
Hyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who voted against the Gulf War, and for the
Kosovo intervention, said last week that the two situations are
different, and that no trends are at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf War resolution was rushed through Congress at a time
when many of us felt that ongoing diplomatic initiatives had not
yet been exhausted,'' Kennedy said. ``Kosovo is entirely different.
It was clear beyond any doubt that the only language President
Milosevic understands is force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, who also initially
opposed the Gulf War, said: ``I think in this case we have
exhausted every single diplomatic option available.'' He also
asserted that NATO had requested US participation.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats, meanwhile, say the party initially was too
quick to say that Clinton could act without congressional
authority. Representative Barney Frank of Newton, while supporting
the air attacks, said he was disappointed that most Democrats
initially were willing to let Clinton act without explicit
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Reagan and Bush, Democrats generally argued the
president needs congressional authorization to put our troops in
potential combat, and Republicans said it was a matter of
presidential prerogative,'' Frank said. ``A very large percent have
switched.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, the House voted mostly along party lines to back
the deployment of 4,000 US troops as part of a NATO effort in
Kosovo. After the air raids were launched last week, the House
voted Wednesday 424-1, with Democrat Barbara Lee of California the
lone dissenter, to express support for the troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of whether Democrats have dropped
concerns about whether the War Powers Act should be invoked. It
requires the president to notify Congress within 90 days that he
has placed US troops ``into hostilities or into situations where
imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The act also requires the president to withdraw those troops
unless Congress declares war or specifically authorizes the use of
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, when Clinton notified Congress of the Kosovo
action, Kerry said the act had not become an issue because the
Kosovo action, technically, is not a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not yet war,'' Kerry said in an interview. ``We
haven't declared war. If this went on for a period of time, it
would then be under the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate of last week, the question of whether senators
were switching their view on intervention became central. Senator
Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, questioned why Senator Joseph R.
Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, was supporting the Kosovo
intervention when he had opposed the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf War debate, Biden argued that President Bush was
unconstitutionally trying to wage war without congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the difference between that situation'' in the Persian
Gulf ``and this threat the senator is describing in Serbia and in
Kosovo now?'' Stevens asked Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference,'' Biden replied. ``The difference
is it is in the center of Europe, number one. Number two, if Europe
in fact becomes destabilized, we are deeply involved in matters far
beyond what is existing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden then tried a novel argument, saying Republicans had been
right in the Gulf War debate and so should support Clinton on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out it made sense to move in the Gulf, and I argue it
makes sense for us to take this action now in the Balkans,'' Biden
said.

 (Eds.: Charlee Chhay is cq; a and i coding))   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Charlee Chhay was only 17 years old when he lost his
parents in Cambodia's killing fields a quarter century ago. He was
an orphan, but he was also the oldest of three brothers. And the
choice he faced was terrifying: He could either hide his family in
the war-torn countryside or try to ferry his brothers to the
relative safety of a refugee camp over the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
   He chose flight.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying no food or water, Chhay strapped Vuthy, who was 12, on
the back of his bicycle for the two-day ride to the Thai border.
Once Vuthy found protection with a friend in the camp, Chhay
slipped back through the mountains, dodging bullets and landmines
meant for the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists to retrieve
his younger brother, Kiravuth, 7.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the refugee camp, the boys endured near-starvation
and the ache of feeling they were alone in the world. Their loss
was cushioned _ but not erased _ once the trio made it to the
safety of a Plymouth, Mass., foster home in 1981 with the help of a
church group.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers found a new life, they lost contact with
their extended family, many of whom were among the 1 million to 2
million Cambodians killed in the fighting between 1975 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, however, Chhay and his brothers, who now live in
Lynn, will be reunited _ on a video hookup _ with an aunt, uncle
and cousins they thought were lost to the past. The story of their
reunion is testimony to an aunt's persistence in a quest to find
her brother's children and the doggedness of the International Red
Cross on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Sopheap Chhay Sok, who had left Cambodia with
her children in 1982 after she learned her husband was living in
France, asked the Red Cross in Paris to help locate the nephews she
had last seen in Phnom Penh in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The scant information Sok supplied made its way last summer to
the desk of Regina Szwadzka, an international social services
coordinator at the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay. Armed
with immigration papers from the Red Cross in Bangkok and pictures
of the boys taken in the refugee camp, Szwadzka started asking
questions. She visited members of the Lutheran church agency in
Newton that had sponsored the brothers; she also placed ads in
local Cambodian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing relatives dislocated by war _ from the Holocaust to the
Rwandan genocide _ has become a key role of the International Red
Cross. In August, the organization will celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Geneva Convention, which granted the relief
agency the authority to look for refugees scattered over the globe.
The searches can last from several months to several years.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where the Cambodian population is estimated at
50,000, the Red Cross traces about 50 cases of Cambodian refugees a
year, second only to the caseload in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Chhay case was complicated because neither family is living
in their native country. To Szwadzka, progress felt glacial. ``We
would make calls, leave messages and wait; it was very
frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Chhay learned the Red Cross was looking for him,
he did not respond. That pattern, Szwadzka said, is a familiar one
among Cambodian refugees. After being traumatized by genocide and
uprooted repeatedly since the mid-1970s, many Cambodians are afraid
to accept or reply to an official message _ even one from the Red
Cross _ for fear that it could somehow harm a relative in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the reactions are visceral. For Chhay, the nightmares
of being chased by Pol Pot's henchmen came rushing back after he
heard the Red Cross was trying to find him.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Szwadzka persisted. ``I knew if he could only meet
me, it would be OK,'' she said. Szwadzka could only reach Chhay
through friends, because he insisted on keeping his telephone
number and address secret. So she sent him a letter through
intermediaries, promising to keep his whereabouts secret from
anyone she could not be sure was a relative.
</P>
<P>
   To Szwadzka's relief, Chhay phoned her after he received her
Feb. 19 letter. Chhay, she said, was incredulous that his relatives
were alive and living in France.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after showing him documents that listed his relatives'
address in France and details Sok had supplied, she convinced him
that some members of his family had indeed survived. Within 24
hours, he was on the phone with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' said Chhay, whose eyes brimmed with tears as
he recalled the terror of running from the soldiers. ``I didn't
think I had any more family. We came here just the three of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chhay, who is now a technician for a Wakefield laser company
where Vuthy is an assembler, was the only one of the brothers who
remembered his relatives; he was especially fond of Sok, who used
to serve him bowls of sweet sticky rice and juicy Asian pears.
Through the years, Chhay said he had never tried to track down any
family members, in part because he recalled only nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Chhay has learned that 60 relatives perished in
the conflict in his homeland. But he also has found out that
several other family members survived, including a few who are
still living in Cambodia. Sok and her husband, who had been a
Cambodian air force instructor who did not return to the country
when war broke out, and other cousins are safe in France.
</P>
<P>
   After Chhay accepted the idea that he had family, albeit an
ocean away, it was a relief. ``It was like he (Chhay) took some
very heavy bags from his shoulders,'' Szwadzka said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four weeks, Chhay and his brothers have had long
conversations with their relatives in France, trying to recapture
some of the lost 25 years. But Chhay said he really won't believe
his aunt is alive until he sees her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many years I've been thinking of this aunt, who looks like
my grandmother,'' Chhay said. ``I saw her in my dreams, but in my
head I'm not sure she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the money on either side of the Atlantic to pay for
travel, the families may have to settle for the teleconference,
which is being sponsored by Sullivan and Cogliano, a computer
networking company in Waltham. The firm responded to an appeal by
the Red Cross to defray the cost of a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for the video reunion have taken place during
the ``ethnic cleansing'' and NATO bombing in Kosovo, when refugee
issues are resonating everywhere. ``I can feel how the refugees
feel right now,'' Chhay said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the news that some members of his family survived,
he is comforted. ``I don't feel like I'm alone anymore.'' Chhay
said.

MUSEUM PLUGS IN TO INTERACTIVE COMPUTER ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ Our mission today is to heed the advice of
new-media artist Jennifer Hall. That means we have to shut down our
computer, turn off our modem. We have to stop, breathe, think. Sip
a cup of coffee, the real stuff, not the virtual kind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might expect someone like Hall to take a certain smug
pleasure in the current technology craze or even enjoy a little ``I
told you so'' glee as she observes a society racing to keep pace
with the Information Age. She is, after all, a local guru of art
and new media, with a master's in visual studies from MIT and 15
years of experience as the visionary leader of the Do While Studio,
a sort of high-tech atelier.
</P>
<P>
   You would think all this would make Hall a happy preacher who
has seen her cause move from the fringes to the masses. You would
think it was payback time. Think again. ``In the '70s, we were the
people on the edge, the intellects and the wackos,'' she says. ``In
some ways I should be thrilled. Our mission came true. More artists
are into new media. But we're all on this treadmill. We're all
running around looking for the next new gizmo without stopping to
ask, `Why?' This culture doesn't ask those questions. We just
upgrade to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   We upgrade. We download. We plug in. We freak out. And even
though Hall has been championing technology for two decades, she's
worried about the consequences of our mad dash to get wired. She
even questions the terminology, as new phrases are coined to
capitalize on the fad of the moment. Take the word ``cyberart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a term that cropped up so quickly, but we've been doing
it for quite a while,'' Hall says. ``People put a label on it to
give it identity, clarity, and perhaps style and glamour. Everyone
is grabbing onto it hook, line, and sinker because it's suddenly
prestigious and glorious and glamorous. I worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries about a world in which everyone is racing to beat
the next guy at the best way to simulate reality in cyberspace.
Nobody is interested in a pure experience anymore: We want a
simulation of a simulation, brought to us ``live'' on the Internet.
Hall suspected there was something odd about ``virtual reality'' a
long time ago. Her mother was a producer for early television and
Hall performed in commercials for products like Crest. One day, she
accompanied her mother to the set of a commercial for Cascade, a
dishwashing soap. ``One of the talents said, `It's virtually
spotless,' and I said, `Mom, what does virtually spotless mean?'
She said, `Sshhh, it means it has spots!' They couldn't say it was
spotless because of the liability, so the lawyers came in and said
to use the word `virtual.' That makes it meaningless. That's
amusing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, the medium had the potential to
bring information to the masses in a positive way, but as anyone
with a remote control knows, the medium is all about money and
commercial, prepackaged pablum. Hall worries that the new
technology is destined to lose its potential as well. ``There's
still time, though,'' she says. ``What happens if we all stop,
breathe, have a cup of coffee? What happens if we take a moment to
stop and ask, `Why?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The artists are the ones who ought to be asking those questions,
and the exhibit aims to do just that. In addition to Hall's work,
the show features Chris Dodge's ``What Will Remain of These?,'' an
installation that records human activity on a vast data network in
the DeCordova gallery. It also showcases Karl Sims's ``Galapagos,''
an interactive installation that mimics Darwinian evolution. (See
related story.) Hall's work is the ``$12.99 special'' of the show,
an ``odd science-fair-type project'' called ``Acupuncture for
Temporal Fruit,'' created with engineer Marc LoCascio.
</P>
<P>
   It's a series of 12 domes equipped with robotic devices that
operate acupuncture needles. As visitors move through the gallery,
the needles are activated to punch holes in tomatoes inside the
dome. OK. Let's take a moment and ask, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of pieces converge: the health industry, Western
medicine and Eastern medicine, the organic form surrounded by
technology,'' Hall says. ``The technology pokes holes in this
thing, and every time you poke at it, the biological form
disintegrates.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hall was building the piece at the Do While Studio, other
artists at the center followed its progression with rapt attention.
``Some people called it cruel and I find that interesting. It's
such an intense word for a tomato. When we see technology up
against an organic form, it blows our mind. It either terrifies us
or thrills us, but it's something we have to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain cachet now for art that brushes up against
technology. But for Hall, there's nothing new in that at all.
``Science and art were together for most of humankind: Think about
the development of pigment, of casting techniques. The technologies
of the day were first scribed by artists. It's only in this
bizarre, postmodern goo that we have made artists separate from
technology. What's happening now is a re-fusion.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing. Or is it? ``The immersion in technology
can be a very bad thing for artists,'' says Hall. ``You have to
figure it out, but you have to be both inside of it and outside of
it.'' She spends half her time running Do While and teaching new
media at Massachusetts College of Art. The rest of the time, she
lives in a technology-free cabin in the woods in New Hampshire. (It
has electricity and a phone, but no computers.)
</P>
<P>
   She's been plugging away all these years, but now that everyone
else is plugged in, she's urging folks to plug out _ at least for a
cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in danger of becoming a feudalistic society,'' she says.
``There is a chasm between the knowing and the not-knowing.
Everyone feels behind. Everyone feels like they're not as smart as
the next guy. The train is out of control and there ain't nobody at
the wheel. How can we slow the train? We can't see the scenery. And
if the journey is what we're here to do, why are we going so
fast?''

PROGRAM HAS YOUTH BOILING OVER WITH IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Corey Wallerson, 20, stands in front of a half-dozen
steaming, sizzling pans, casually stirring the kohlrabi sauce,
searing the scallops, and simmering the cippolini onions.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he was headed nowhere, when he happened into
Reesa Levy's home-economics class at John Dewey High School in
Brooklyn. Now, he's a cook, in charge of the fish station at JUdson
Grill, a top-flight restaurant in midtown Manhattan, with ambitions
of opening his own place one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that program weren't around,'' Wallerson said of his school
days, ``I'd probably be in the streets right now. I wouldn't have
had any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallerson is one of several thousand young people _ most of them
from the rougher neighborhoods of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles _ now manning grills, knives,
broilers, steamers, mixers, and basters in some of the nation's
finest eating establishments.
</P>
<P>
   They got there with the help of Richard Grausman, a 61-year-old
former chef from the Cordon Bleu, who found himself in a funk one
day a little more than 10 years ago and decided to do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Grausman's revelation came in Boston, at a cooking conference in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone from Campbell Soup gave a speech predicting the future
of American cooking,'' Grausman recalled, sitting in his office, a
converted studio apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ``He
said the future was the microwave and the fact that no one will be
sitting down at the table for a family meal. Well, this was very
depressing for a culinary educator.''
</P>
<P>
   Grausman had just written a cookbook called ``At Home with the
French Classics,'' and on his publicity tour, at various department
stores, he found that by ages 25 to 45, most people had made up
their minds what they liked or disliked in food.
</P>
<P>
   These two discoveries about the state of food in America _ a
static present and a hopeless future _ set in motion a new train of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized,'' Grausman said, ``that, if there was anything
that I could do to change that forecast I heard in Boston, the
answer was to get into the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1990, he toured a dozen home-economics classes in
the New York public school system and was shocked by what he saw _
bare cupboards, no supplies, lackluster support. ``Home Ec had been
turned into a dumping ground for kids who didn't succeed
academically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Grausman started calling food companies and cookware
manufacturers, convincing them that it was in their own long-term
interest to cultivate the tastes and talents of this next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Reesa Levy at John Dewey was one of the teachers Grausman
visited. ``Richard asked me, `What do you need?' '' she recalled.
``I said, `I have nothing.' So he gave me a catalog. I made out 18
pages of orders. My husband says, `Whaddayou, nuts? You're not
going to get anything.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks later,'' Levy said, ``I get a delivery. It's 20
boxes of food, equipment, supplies. Everything changed in those two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   She waved her arm across the classroom. A couple dozen
apron-clad sophomores, working in several small groups, were making
chicken-curry crepes, delicately chopping meat, dicing scallions,
stirring white sauce. The shelves were filled with everything a
chef would need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Richard,'' Levy said, ``I doubt there'd be any Home Ec
teaching in the city. So many schools were shutting down their
programs. Now, they're opening up kitchens like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grausman's program _ known as C-CAP, for Careers through
Culinary Arts Program _ has spread to 200 teachers in 190 urban
public high schools, 32 of them in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, he sponsors a cooking contest, where some of the
nation's top chefs serve as judges. Each teacher picks the two top
students to compete. All the finalists _ usually between 100 to 140
students _ receive scholarships to cooking colleges, several of the
prizes paying full tuition of up to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   C-CAP has raised $5.3 million in scholarship money during the
past decade _ $1 million of it in the past year. More than 10,000
pupils have joined the program, and 525 have received scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Wallerson won a full-tuition scholarship to the Culinary
Institute of America in June 1996. Kirk Johnson, another C-CAP
beneficiary, won a scholarship that year at the French Culinary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who grew up in Jamaica before moving to Brooklyn at age
12, had always helped his mother cook. ``But then in C-CAP,'' he
recalled, ``I read these French recipes and thought, `Wow! I'd like
to do stuff like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the front lines of Manhattan's upscale restaurants are
rarely staffed by people having this sort of background _ poor,
black, barely out of their teens.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Telepan, executive chef at JUdson Grill, said Grausman's
program ``gives kids opportunities _ it evens the score a little.''
</P>
<P>
   One morning at Park West High School, near the Hudson River in
midtown Manhattan, Alex Askew, head of the Black Culinary Alliance,
a restaurant-consulting firm in Harlem, spoke to 500 students in a
big auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you want to be chefs?'' Askew asked, and about 300
raised a hand. ``This is a very successful career,'' he went on.
``If you're good, you can go anywhere in the world and get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   When one student asked him how much money he makes, Askew paused
and replied, ``More than $50,000,'' eliciting gasps. An assistant
chef, with a few years' experience, in a good New York restaurant,
can easily make that much; a head chef, much more.
</P>
<P>
   Latisha Anderson and Christopher Rivas, two students at Park
West, work after school as interns at Windows on the World, atop
the World Trade Center _ Anderson cooking cold dishes, Rivas hot
dishes. They make long commutes, from Bedford-Stuyvesant and
Prospect Heights, to attend class here. Both plan to enter the
C-CAP cooking contest next month, and both know what they want to
do with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing this program does, besides provide these kids with a
good career option, is it brings them to school,'' said Wayne
Berning, director of the culinary program at Park West High School.
``It gives them a hook. So then we get a chance to teach them
English and math and history and science. A lot of these kids
wouldn't show up without this.''

LESSONS FROM MELISSA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Melissa virus hit last Friday it had all of the
markings of an impending electronic plague. Within an hour and a
half, I received two copies of the virus: one from a public
relations firm in California and one from a company specializing in
computer security. The following day I received my third copy of
the virus, from somebody else at the public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Internet, things were bad and getting worse. Melissa
was shutting down e-mail systems all over the United States. Even
worse, Melissa was revealing potential confidential information _
e-mail addresses and business contacts _ every time it ran on an
unsuspecting victim's computer. Worst of all, perhaps, the virus
could be copied by others to produce even more dangerous viruses
and attack programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster did not get as bad as some predicted. Articles
in the newspaper, on radio, television, and of course, on the
Internet, effectively mobilized the computer-using public. People
were warned that if they received an e-mail message from somebody
that they knew, with the words ``Important Message From'' in the
``Subject:'' line, they should not, under any circumstances, open
the accompanying Microsoft Word document called ``list.doc.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two important lessons from the Melissa experience. The
first is that computer users can generally do a good job protecting
themselves when they are informed about the risks and perils of
computing.
</P>
<P>
   But the second is that many businesses don't spend the time and
resources to properly train their employees before a major incident
_ and a result, they frequently pay more when there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies wouldn't think of letting an employee drive a
forklift or service an elevator unless that person had been first
properly trained. That's because property can be damaged, and
people can be injured or killed, if heavy machinery is improperly
used. But these same companies don't see the equal need to train
somebody before that person is set down at a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as the Melissa virus demonstrated, improperly
trained computer users can be fairly costly to an organization. And
even in the absence of an electronic menace such as Melissa, people
who don't have sufficient training just aren't as productive as
people who understand the software that they're expected to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are missing the boat,'' says Jennifer
Launier, marketing manager at New Horizons Computer Learning
Centers of Boston, a major player in the computer training market.
``They don't realize the return on their training investment.
Training can increase a person's productivity by up to 6 times,''
she says, citing a Gartner Group study on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider basic word processing. Thanks to Melissa, many users of
Microsoft Word now know that it's somewhat risky to run the
Microsoft Word macros that might be included in an e-mail
attachment that they receive. There's nothing new here: Word Macro
viruses have been endemic ever since Microsoft released Word '95,
the first word processor which had the capability of storing macros
in standard word processor documents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the majority of Microsoft Word users still have
very little clue how to effectively use their word processor. Few
Word users, for example, know how to set tab stops. Instead, they
just pound the space bar or repeatedly hit the tab key to line text
up in columns.
</P>
<P>
   Another important feature that gets unused are ``styles'' _ the
ability to define different fonts, margins and line spacing to
different paragraph types. One of the great advantages of styles is
that they make it easy to change formatting throughout a whole
document at once. Another nifty feature is automatic numbering:
Word can automatically keep track of chapter and section numbers,
then automatically renumber the sections in your contract or book
when you make changes.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think that learning how to use those
``advanced'' features like tabs, styles, and even macros just takes
more time than it is worth. After all, it does take time to learn
these features. But just as learning to type is time spent
well-spent, so is time spent learning how to use a sophisticated
application program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to learn a computer program is by
reading the manual. Computer manuals certainly aren't great works
of literature, but they usually do a good job explaining how to use
a program. Manuals also can point out features in a program that
aren't immediately obvious. The computer industry even has a quick
retort for those pesky users who ask questions without first
reading the supplied manual. That expression is
</P>
<P>
   RTFM, short for ``Read the Fabulous Manual'' (or something like
that).
</P>
<P>
   Another way to learn about new software is to sit down and
systematically go through all of the menus and options panels. This
can take a lot of time and rarely looks to a manager or a boss like
time well spent, but it can make an inquisitive person dramatically
more productive when using the program. Sadly, many computer users
are afraid to exercise all of the features of their programs, for
fear that they might break something.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools and universities offer some level of training for
their students and employees. Sometimes these classes are free;
other times there is a nominal charge. Many companies operate
classrooms where every student gets his or her own computer and a
workbook.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are a growing number of self-employed training
consultants who will come to a company, large or small, and teach
people on their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly I explain that the Help F1 or Help tutorial
will have most of the answers when running the application,'' says
John Leonard, a local training consultant. ``Don't get frustrated
with what is happening _ use F1 to see what should be done. It's
amazing how few users relate to the
</P>
<P>
   importance of (built-in) Help functions.''

CITIZENS: QUIRKY BANK IN A BIG POND

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For years, it has flourished as an oddity.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked on one side by New England's two big banks and on the
other by community institutions, Citizens Financial Group Inc. is a
small, foreign-owned bank in a world increasingly divided between
publicly traded giants and pint-sized players.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief executive, Lawrence K. Fish, is surely one of the
hidebound banking industry's only leaders to have spent time in an
ashram in India. Even the company's annual report is offbeat,
listing how many lollipops and dog biscuits branches passed out to
customers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its quirkiness, Citizens may hold some important keys to
the future of banking in New England, already in the throes of
change as Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp., the
region's top players, prepare to merge into the nation's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   That combination is producing the largest branch and deposits
divestiture in US history. Citizens, once a sleepy mutual savings
outfit but now New England's third-largest bank, is viewed as a top
contender for a good chunk of those assets.
</P>
<P>
   But as Citizens ponders new growth, industry observers are
wondering how the company can maintain its devoted focus on
customer service, a feature more typical of smaller banks. And they
are quietly debating whether Citizens' sole owner, The Royal Bank
of Scotland, isn't preparing to bankroll acquisitions for its
favorite child as a prelude to selling off the company _ a move
that could usher a new competitor into New England.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding its awe-shucks homilies about being a big
community bank, Citizens ``is trying to be a bigger factor in New
England banking,'' said James Moynihan, a senior vice president at
Advest Inc., a stock brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As their franchise grows, it becomes very attractive to a
bidder outside the region,'' Moynihan added. ``And the bigger
Citizens is, the bigger the premium it can fetch for Royal Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said Fish, the 54-year-old son of Chicago social
workers. ``If the divestitures present opportunities for us, we'll
look at them seriously,'' Fish said in interview earlier this week.
``With us, it's not about absolute size. But you can potentially be
a better bank for your customers with more branches and more
conveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Citizens has a rich uncle, able and willing to help
its ward grow. The Royal, as it is known, quadrupled Citizens' size
this decade to $18.2 billion in assets and 280 branches by
bankrolling local acquisitions. (In contrast, a merged
Fleet-BankBoston will have $178 billion in assets.)
</P>
<P>
   While lacking the hundreds of millions of dollars in cash needed
to buy the 270 or so branches and $13.6 billion in deposits that
Fleet Boston Corp. will sell later this year, Scotland's largest
publicly traded company could easily raise the money on capital
markets, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Royal would be very keen indeed to acquire some of
those branches for Citizens,'' said Robin Down, a UK banks analyst
at ABN-Amro Holding in London. ``These opportunities don't come up
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Citizens and its owner are acting coyly about the
soon-to-be divested branches, which Fleet and BankBoston must sell
to satisfy antitrust regulators. When asked earlier this week
whether Citizens would buy any of the outlets, a Royal spokesman
said, ``We don't know what's on the table yet. Citizens will be
watching that very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview several weeks before Fleet announced it was
acquiring BankBoston, Royal Bank chief executive Sir George
Mathewson said he couldn't see Citizens getting much bigger than
$25 billion in assets _ a still-hefty increase of nearly $7
billion, or 40 percent. He brushed aside questions of whether
Citizens would be sold, saying the Royal currently had no such
plans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far bigger than a savings and loan but dwarfed by Fleet and
BankBoston, Providence-headquartered Citizens sits smack in the
middle of an increasingly barren space in American banking. Mergers
and consolidations are creating a bipolar world populated by giant
banks with hundreds of billions in assets and by Lilliputian
outposts, some with less than $50 million in deposits. Banks of
Citizens' size are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   But with no publicly traded stock, Citizens faces fewer of the
do-or-die pressures its listed competitors confront each quarter.
While many banking analysts say it is conventional wisdom that the
Royal will eventually sell Citizens for a sweet profit, Fish
ignores such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never operated in the shadow that we're going to be
taken over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fish _ the former head of the failed Bank of New England and an
ex-Bank of Boston executive who once worked for the US government
in Brazil _ said Citizens had in the past considered issuing stock
and going public. But it has no plans now to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its odd niche, 183-year-old Citizens has won plaudits by
combining the hand-holding typical of community banks with some of
the broader services typical of larger banks. The company, which
operates in Massachusetts and other New England states as Citizens
Bank, is New England's largest automobile lender. It provides
service in 42 languages, including Tagalog and Croatian, and even
sends out Good Humor ice cream trucks to branches in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the formula has kept the Royal pleased indeed. Citizens,
with record net income last year of $244.2 million, a third more
than in 1997, accounted for a hefty one-fifth of its owner's pretax
profits in 1998. In a landscape full of UK banks buying American
banks but failing to make a profitable go of it, the Royal's
Citizens investment is a rare success.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 1.2 million customers, most of them middle income,
Citizens is tethered to a business with increasingly slower growth
opportunities. While it has double-digit market share for deposits
in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, it has less than 4 percent of
the larger Massachusetts market.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the bank has quietly branched out into
asset-based lending and leasing through offices in Pittsburgh,
Atlanta, and New York _ sophisticated operations more typical of
Fleet. And it is trying to sell itself to customers as a one-stop
financial services house with mutual funds and insurance. This
month, Citizens will even add on-line banking _ a feature shunned
by community banks, which prefer the human touch.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, the moves appear to be pulling Citizens away
from its community bank-style approach. Even at its present size,
the company is laboring to iron out inconsistencies in branch
service. Getting bigger would probably mean less of the personal
touch Citizens prides itself on (including what Fish calls ``phone
hugs'' _ morale-boosting calls to staffers). But buying more
branches may be necessary and desirable. While Citizens says it has
moved into a phase of ``organic,'' or internal, growth after buying
15 local banks since 1992, some see its ability to increase profits
without more branches as limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing earnings at Citizens is hampered by a lack of
opportunity to cut costs,'' said Matthew Charlton, a banking
analyst at Schroder Securities in London. ``Such an opportunity
would mostly come from acquiring branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish has sore memories of 1996, when Citizens got locked out of
the area's most recent big divestiture as Bank of Boston acquired
BayBanks Inc. and sold most of the divested branches to UST Corp.,
a smaller bank that competes with Citizens. This time he may push
hard to pick up assets.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Citizens will come out on top is unclear. From small
regional players like Portland, Maine-based People's Heritage
Financial Group Inc. to giant BankAmerica Corp., the nation's
second largest bank, a brace of competitors is rumored to be
jockeying for the assets. Regulators will not decide for several
months whether a sale to local, national, or a combination of banks
will best preserve competition. But many politicians, including the
members of the state's congressional delegation and Governor Paul
Cellucci, have urged officials to give smaller, local banks an edge
in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, by bulking up on the remains of Fleet-BankBoston,
the quirky company that calls itself ``Not Your Typical Bank''
could become your typical takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' ABN-Amro's Down said, ``we expect the Royal to
opportunistically grow Citizens while it can, and then sell it
off.''

HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH BELL'S DESCENDANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to any living relatives of Alexander Graham
Bell?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.T., Kingston, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bell has two surviving grandchildren: Mabel H. Grosvenor, 94,
and Elsie ``Carol'' Myers, 88.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact them in care of another descendant, Edwin
Grosvenor, at 4600 N. Park Ave., Suite 200, Chevy Chase, MD 20815.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Grosvenor is the author of ``Alexander Graham Bell,'' a
1997 biography. Another descendant, great-grandson Gil Grosvenor,
is the chairman of the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was president of the society from 1898 until 1899, when he
hired future son-in-law Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor to replace him. The
society was founded by Bell's father-in-law, Gardiner Greene
Hubbard, and 32 other members in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Greta Van Susteren is married to somebody who
works in the White House. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   _ I.T., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Van Susteren is married to John Coale, who is also her
partner in a Washington law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Coale, who participated in lawsuits against tobacco companies,
was one of the first to file suit last year against gun makers
alleging that they contribute to urban crime.
</P>
<P>
   Coale does not work in the White House but did contribute
$25,000 to national Democratic groups in 1998, including $10,000 to
the Democratic National Committee, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent profile of Coale in The Economist, he described
himself as a ``frequent visitor'' to the White House. The magazine
reports that his office has pictures of him with President Clinton,
Hillary Clinton and ``in the ultimate triumph of insiderism, with
Socks, the Clintons' cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does Anne Geddes find all those adorable babies, and
where can I write to her?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.M., Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Geddes in care of Geddes Group Licensing, 9200
Sunset Blvd., Suite 706, Los Angeles, CA 90069.
</P>
<P>
   Geddes, who primarily photographs newborns and 6-month-olds,
lives and works in New Zealand. The parents of many subjects find
her, but she does sometimes advertise, depending on the project she
is undertaking, a representative of the Geddes Group said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Geddes came to the United States and advertised for
photographic subjects, but she has no current plans to return.
</P>
<P>
   She has an official World Wide Web site at www.annegeddes.com.

FIDELITY MANAGERS STIR MEMORIES OF A DYING BREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe there's hope for the mutual fund cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers free to buy whatever kinds of stocks they please
in the hunt for big returns are a dying breed, boxed in by the
style restrictions of a clientele investing for retirement and
demanding consistency. Managing within categories like small value
stocks or large growth stocks is a mandate in fund companies across
America.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, once famous for its stable of unfettered
fund managers, changed with the times a few years ago. Columns like
ours declared the death of the cowboy culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fast forward and take a look at the hottest general stock
funds in Fidelity's lineup in these first months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Fifty, invigorated by a new manager in January, has
shot the lights out with a year-to-date return of 27.1 percent
earlier this week. Close behind, New Millenium had advanced by 24.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Together they were the two best funds managing at least $10
million anywhere in their general category of capital appreciation
so far in 1999, according to fund tracker Lipper Inc. They are the
hottest funds in town at the moment (excluding some invested in
specific sectors or regions) and each ranks among the top 1 percent
of all general stock funds through last week.
</P>
<P>
   What's their mandate? Fidelity Fifty is supposed to be a
collection of 50 or 60 good ideas, just like its name suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity describes the New Millenium objective as finding
``future beneficiaries of social and economic change.'' Good luck
nailing that one down.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one of the funds seems likely to accumulate big holdings
of government bonds or peso-denominated debt. It would be a stretch
to call them cowbodys, but both are remarkably free to buy
investments of almost any kind.
</P>
<P>
   John Muresianu took over Fidelity Fifty on Jan. 4 and clearly
turned the portfolio upside down. But it's impossible to say
exactly what he bought because the most recent public information
on Fifty's top holdings dates back to Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The clear consensus opinion among Fidelity watchers and others:
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity Fifty became an Internet play shortly after he took
over,'' said Eric Kobren, publisher of Fidelity Insight, an
independent newsletter. ``We noticed in January that it was very
highly correlated to Internet stocks and obviously remains so.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresianu, a Harvard PhD who once worked as an assistant
professor of history at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., was
putting up big numbers in relative obscurity before he took over
Fidelity Fifty. He had managed Fidelity's utility fund for five
years before moving to take over Fidelity American Trust Portfolio,
an offshore stock fund that earned 85.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   That portfolio jammed 42.6 percent of assets into its 10 biggest
holdings as of Jan. 1, according to Fidelity reports. At the very
top: Amazon.com Inc. and America Online Inc., each accounting for
9.1 percent of the portfolio, followed by Yahoo Inc, which amounted
to 6.3 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same kind of strategy manager Neal Miller is likely
following at his New Millenium fund, though not with as much
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The fund counted CMGI Inc., the Internet investing firm based in
Andover, Yahoo and retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. as its three largest
positions at the end of last year. Technology investments accounted
for 40 percent of assets at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fifty, New Millenium owned 249 stocks in its year-end
portfolio. The roster was dominated by smaller and medium-sized
stocks, but also included giants like Intel Corp. and Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Muresianu and Miller are hardly the only Internet investors at
Fidelity, one of the largest institutional investors when it comes
to Web stocks. Fidelity was the top institutional owner of variety
of Net stocks including America Online, At Home Corp., E(star)Trade
Group Inc., CMGI and Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But they are by far the most aggressive of Fidelity's Internet
buyers. That raises lots of serious questions, like how they will
get out of many of their big Internet positions when the bubble
bursts and what they will do next.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, for now. This has been a spectacular time to relish
the freedom of the old fund cowboys, with a minimum of questions
asked about style and diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Surely customers have noticed. New Millenium, which manages $2.1
billion, has been closed to most new investors. But the much
smaller Fifty counted $411.8 million in assets under management by
the close of business Wednesday, more than double its $178.9
million at the end of last year and much more than even the $239
million of a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   It probably makes sense that most mutual funds are held to some
kind of style discipline month after month. But it would be nice to
keep a few of the cowboys around.

GOOD REASONS FOR INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long caravans of tired, terrified, desperate Kosovars fleeing
the savage onslaughts of Serbian soldiers and police provide
heart-wrenching testimony of a human catastrophe of enormous
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident that the Serbs are executing a genocidal plan in
Kosovo reminiscent of the Khmer Rouge infamy in Cambodia. Still,
there are those who question the need for and the humanitarian
motivation of the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization
airstrikes against the rampaging Serbian military machine.
</P>
<P>
   They pose the rhetorical question: Why Kosovo and not a number
of other places in the world where people are being slaughtered,
cast out of their homes and sent on the refugee roads?
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't we intervene in Rwanda? Far more people were killed
there. Why not Sierra Leone, Congo, Uganda? Why not Sri Lanka or
even Afghanistan?
</P>
<P>
   The question is disingenuous because for the most part those who
are asking it are doing so for partisan political purposes, and
they know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   They know that the United States does not possess the capability
to intervene everywhere on the globe where atrocities are being
committed. Perhaps they are suggesting that if we can't do it
everywhere, we shouldn't do it anywhere unless there is a direct,
indisputable threat to our national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Another inference that can be drawn from the rhetorical question
is that this country has no well-defined criteria for selecting
places to intervene. That's just not true. Perhaps those criteria
have not been spelled out in two-syllable words for the slow. But
two of them are readily discernible.
</P>
<P>
   The first appears to be that the United States now chooses only
to insert itself militarily into situations where it can use its
technological superiority to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this country tries to avoid unilateral interventions,
choosing instead to act wherever possible with other nations
seeking the same humanitarian and geopolitical objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle in Somalia taught us a bitter lesson about the
perils of good-intentioned introduction of American ground forces
into politically chaotic morasses with indiscernible battle lines.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the triumphant Desert Storm campaign underscored
the importance of acting in concert with others to stop aggression.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military intervention in any of the current conflicts in
Africa would risk a repetition of the Somalia nightmare. Air power
would be virtually useless there, and U.S. ground troops in some
instances would be viewed as neo-colonialist intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian troops, for example, who have been sent into Sierra
Leone to try to restore peace have been subjected to the same kind
of horrors that have been visited upon unarmed civilians by the
rebel forces. Many have been killed or mutilated, and they want
out.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of a situation where America's edge in
high-tech weaponry would not enable it to prevail without the use
of ground forces and taking substantial numbers of casualties. And
it is doubtful that the American public would be willing to pay
that price.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, however, is a different story. Granted, the Serbs
have formidable military forces. But those forces are vulnerable to
air and sea power. The conventional wisdom that bombing alone will
not force a regime like that of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to capitulate may be anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   Our weaponry today is much more precise and effective than it
was during the Vietnam War. A sustained effort could yield the
desired results, if the isolationists who are asking the rhetorical
questions don't weaken the nation's will to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   However, if ground forces ultimately must be used to halt the
carnage, at least the United States will not be going it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The case for staying the course in the Kosovo conflict is
overwhelming. There is a growing human tragedy there. If unchecked,
the aggression could threaten European security and stability.
Besides that, it is a place suited to the kind of warfare that we
and our NATO allies wage best.

PLUG FOUNDATION LEAK WITH HYDRAULIC CEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I get a few water leaks in my poured concrete foundation
where the form bolts were installed. They are not big leaks, but
are a nuisance. How can I plug them?
</P>
<P>
   S.J., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here is one place that a plug of hydraulic cement should work
on the inside. Chip out a hole at the location of the bolt (it is
really a wire and not very thick). Make the hole wider at its deep
end, forming a reverse cone. Fill it with hydraulic cement, which
expands as it sets to fit tightly in the hole. The cone shape will
hold the cement in place, and if any water tries to come through,
it will make the plug even tighter. If the form wire is showing in
the hole, cut it off as close to the bottom of the hole as
possible. Left in place, such a wire could act as a duct for more
water to come in. If the wire is copper, it will corrode the
concrete, making it prone to leaks. That's another reason to cut it
off.
</P>
<P>
   If this does not work, do the same thing on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I removed the vinyl paper from a wall made of some kind of
pressed board. Can I wash it to get all the paste off before I
paint the wall? There is also some mildew on the wall. How can I
remove that?
</P>
<P>
   TRUDY GATELY, Wrentham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That pressed board could be a hardboard, which can be washed
with water, especially if it is tempered. But whatever it is, it
can be washed. Even plasterboard can be washed with water; you have
to anyway to get off the glue. To remove the mildew (technically,
it's mold), make a mix of 1 part bleach and 3 parts water and just
paint it on. If it is mold, it will disappear. If it does not
disappear, it is dirt, which can be painted over. Be sure to rinse
off the bleach solution; it is incompatible with paint.
</P>
<P>
   If you find the water is softening the pressed board or ruining
the paper of any plasterboard, stop. Let it dry and sand the wall
with fine sandpaper to try to remove the rest of the glue or at
least smooth it out; latex paint should cover the glue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 14-year-old house has Texture 1-11 on the outside walls.
It is in good shape and not delaminating, but I don't like it, and
I don't like aluminum or vinyl, either. Can I install shingles over
it?
</P>
<P>
   TIM WILLIAMS, Thornton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. You certainly can, but there are a couple of things to be
alert to. T 1-11 was probably used as sheathing and siding, which
means there is ony one layer of wood on the wall. So far so good.
In some construction, window frames are set directly on the
sheathing, and are sticking out 3/4 inch from the sheathing. If
that is so, you can shingle right over the sheathing, and the
shingles will butt up nicely against the frame, more correctly
called casing.
</P>
<P>
   In other construction, if vinyl-clad windows were used, the
vinyl nailing flange of the window was nailed directly to the studs
surrounding the rough opening of each window. Then the T 1-11 was
nailed to the studs, covering the nailing flange. In this case,
too, you can shingle right over the sheathing, butting them up
closely to the vinyl casing of the windows.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other possibility. Sometimes the windows, if they
have wood casings, are installed first, against the rough opening,
then the sheathing butts up against the casing, making the casing
flush with the T 1-11. It's not a good construction technique, but
you can handle it in one of two ways. To bring the casing out from
the sheathing, nail a new set of casing onto the old. That will
also allow the shingles to butt against the casing, which they must
do. If you don't do this, the shingles will end in midair _ not a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Apply Tyvek or other house wrap-type covering on the sheathing
before shingling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I own a wood ladder that I have to keep outdoors. Can I put
linseed oil on it to keep it in good shape?
</P>
<P>
   DAN DANIELS, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but it would be better if you stored the ladder away
from the weather. Could you put a tarp over it? Even that would
keep it dry. The oil is a good idea because a ladder should never
be painted. Paint, while protecting the ladder, will hide any
defects or damage that might show up. Use boiled linseed oil;
slather it liberally on all surfaces, wait 15 minutes, then wipe it
all off with a dry cloth. If you don't, it will stay sticky
forever. Dispose of oily cloths carefully by burning them. Do not
store them or wash them; there is too much of a hazard of
spontaneous combustion.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, the handyman had a lucky accident years
ago with his wood ladder, which he left outdoors, untreated. One
spring day, he got the ladder out, set it properly against the
wall, and stepped on the first rung. Twang! The rung broke off at
both ends. The drop was only 8 or 10 inches, but it was enough to
make the handyman cut that ladder up for firewood right on the
spot. As he was cutting, the handyman could only think, what if it
had been the top rung?

 VUKOVAR, Croatia: for leadership.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He said, too, that the Croatian government has found it
politically impossible to devote much money to rebuilding the
damaged houses of Serbs. Nearly all of that money, indeed much of
the reconstruction in Vukovar, has benefited Croats, not Serbs. The
European Union and individual European nations have tried to alter
that formula and, in return, are accused by Croatian leaders of
being pro-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite considerable investment by the Croatian government,
Vukovar and its surrounding villages have not become especially
attractive to Croats. Of the 80,000 who fled the area, Western
diplomats estimate, only about 15,000 or so have returned. Those
who do return are mostly older people without children.
</P>
<P>
   Stana Dakonca, 30, a married physical therapist with two young
children, is an exception. A Croat, she came back to Vukovar last
year after nearly seven years of living as a refugee in a hotel on
the Adriatic. She returned, she said, because the government
promised her and her husband jobs and promised to help rebuild her
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed after coming back to this place,'' Mrs.
Dakonca said. ``The state promised many things. But I cannot find a
job. My husband works for an electrical company that has not paid
his salary for six months. The state said it would help with fixing
the house, but it hasn't given us any money yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for reintegrating with her Serbian neighbors, Mrs. Dakonca
called that a dream of the West. ``Croats and Serbs have virtually
no contact, as far as I can see,'' she said. ``We avoid each other,
especially now that NATO is attacking Serbia. No normal life will
ever return here, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring officials and representatives of the European
countries that are spending millions to rebuild Vukovar say such
pessimism will fade if the economy improves before all the Serbs
move out.
</P>
<P>
   But, ominously, these officials are much more pessimistic about
post-war prospects for a multiethnic future in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumbered Serbs nine-to-one before the exodus of
refugees began last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a mixed society before the war and that is not the
case in Kosovo,'' Ratsiborinsky said. ``Serbs will not be able to
stay in Kosovo after the war. It will be much worse than here.''

THE GREEKS HELD CAPTIVE IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS &UR;  &LR;  _ 1821. Greeks are fighting for their independence. In
Athens, they besiege the Acropolis, a stronghold of the Turkish
occupiers. As the siege grinds on, the Turks' ammunition runs
short. They begin to dismantle sections of the Parthenon, prying
out the 2,300-year-old lead clamps and melting them down for
bullets. The Greek fighters, horrified at this defacement of their
patrimony, send the Turks a supply of bullets. Better to arm their
foes, they decide, than to let the ancient temple come to harm.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinary and unexampled gesture of self-sacrifice.
But then, the Parthenon is an extraordinary and unexampled
masterpiece of Western culture. Constructed in the 5th century B.C.
as a shrine to Athena, goddess of war and patron of Athens, it is
the acme of classical Greek architecture and sculpture, the
greatest monument of the Age of Pericles. There is no more storied
building in all of Europe. No Greek could see it vandalized and
fail to protest.
</P>
<P>
   And yet by 1821 just such a slander _ that the ransacking of the
Parthenon would leave Greeks unfazed _ is already in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier and 2,000 miles away, a committee of the
British Parliament had conducted hearings on the huge collection of
sculptures and bas-reliefs that Robert Bruce, the seventh Earl of
Elgin, had removed from the Parthenon and shipped to England. These
Elgin Marbles, so called, were being offered for sale to the
British Museum, and there were questions about how Elgin _ the
former British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire _ had acquired
them.
</P>
<P>
   When the marbles were carried off, one committee member asked
Elgin's deputy, Philip Hunt, ``was any opposition shown by any
class of the natives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' Hunt replied, and for 180 years that lie has endured.
In taking what he took, the argument goes, Elgin performed a great
service _ he saved the sculptures from indifferent Greeks and
primitive Turks who didn't appreciate them and wouldn't have given
them the care they required.
</P>
<P>
   But no Greek or Turk _ or Roman or Crusader, for that matter _
ever treated the Parthenon as brutally as Elgin and his minions
did. The travel writer Edward Daniel Clarke happened to be on the
Acropolis one day in September 1802, when Elgin's men detached a
large sculpted slab (called a metope) from the temple's outer
frieze.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the workmen came to inform Don Battista'' _ Giovanni
Battista Lusieri, the painter Elgin had hired to oversee the
plundering of the sculptures _ ``that they were then going to lower
one of the metopes. We saw this fine piece of sculpture raised from
its station between the triglyphs; but . . . a part of the
adjoining masonry was loosened by the machinery; and down came the
fine masses of Pentelican marble, scattering their white fragments
with thundering noise among the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish military governor, Clarke noted, ``beheld the
mischief done to the building, took his pipe from his mouth,
dropped a tear, and in a supplicating tone of voice said to
Lusieri, `Telos.' (`It is finished.)''
</P>
<P>
   Lusieri himself recalled the scene with something less than
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, my Lord,'' he wrote to Elgin, ``the pleasure of
announcing to you the possession of the 8th metope, that one where
there is the Centaur carrying off the woman. This piece has caused
much trouble in all respects, and I have even been obliged to be a
little barbarous.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbarous indeed. Elgin's assault on the Parthenon was driven
not by a desire to preserve great art, but by greed: He originally
intended the marbles to decorate his estate in Scotland. His men
used hacksaws to chop dozens of metopes and sculptures from the
edifice they had adorned for 23 centuries. For close to two
centuries Elgin's booty has been locked in a London museum; for
nearly all that time, conscientious Britons have lamented his
theft. Lord Byron, a passionate philhellene, raged against Elgin.
The ambassador's crime, he fumed in ``Childe Harold,'' was
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spar'd:
</P>
<P>
   Cold as the crags upon his native coast,
</P>
<P>
   His mind as barren and his heart as hard,
</P>
<P>
   Is he whose head conceiv'd, whose hand prepar'd,
</P>
<P>
   Aught to displace Athena's poor remains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous, Byron thought, for the Parthenon's sculptures to be
imprisoned so far from the site for which they were created. The
British people, if not their government, have gradually come around
to Byron's view. In April 1996, a program on Britain's Channel 4
asked viewers whether the Parthenon Marbles should be returned. Of
99,340 people who took part in the poll, 92.5 percent voted in
favor of the proposal. Last fall, a MORI poll found Britons
supporting a return of the marbles by better than 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to set right an old wrong and return these works to
their birthplace. ``Understand what the Parthenon Marbles mean to
us,'' the late Melina Mercouri, the renowned actress and Greek
minister of culture, pleaded in 1986. ``They are our pride. They
are our sacrifice. They are our noblest symbol of excellence. They
are a tribute to the democratic philosophy . . . . They are the
essence of Greekness.''

THE SECRETS OF SLEEP IN PRESCHOOLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mostly as a way to get a conversation going, preschool teacher
Cate Fleming recently asked the children in her group, ``How many
of you spend the whole night sleeping by yourself in your own
bed?''
</P>
<P>
   Out of 11, six did not.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was flabbergasted. ``I knew one was having sleep
problems,'' she says, ``and I figured maybe there were one or two
more I didn't know about. But six! That blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   These weren't just children at the young age of the preschool
spectrum, either. In Fleming's mixed-age group of 3- to 5-year-olds
at the Lexington Playcare Center there were as many 5's with sleep
issues as there were 3's. That worried her. As a parent who
sometimes struggles with her 18-month-old's sleep patterns, Fleming
likes to think things will get better as he gets older, not worse.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the nights of the preschool years can be hard
even for children who slept perfectly as babies and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly due to a more mature level of cognition. ``At 3
and 4, they're more aware they are separate from a parent,'' says
psychologist Joyce Walsleben, director of the New York University
Sleep Disorder Center. This causes a worry: `` `If I'm on my own
(when I'm in bed), where is everybody? Who will take care of me?
Who will protect me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep disturbance is also typically due to a change in a child's
life: moving from crib to bed, giving up naps, a new baby. But it
doesn't play out the way parents imagine. Pediatric sleep
researcher Marc Weissbluth offers an example:
</P>
<P>
   Mom goes back to work. The first night, she doesn't get home
until 6 p.m. Dinner is late, so bedtime gets pushed up. The next
night, things are still crazy, and the next night, too. When she
finally wants her almost 4-year-old to go to bed at the old time,
there's a struggle. Mom assumes he's upset because she is working;
her guilt prompts her to do things she never did before, like
giving in to requests for one more book and staying with him until
he falls asleep. Now when she wants to disengage, the battle is
even more fierce.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says Weissbluth, is not an emotional reaction to
Mom working but to being up late for many nights and then having
routines changed again and then again. A pediatrician in Chicago,
Weissbluth is author of ``Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child''
(Ballantine). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pitfalls for parents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency in limit-setting, whether it's from parent to
parent, night to night, or bedtime to the middle of the night, is
what most often gets us into trouble, says pediatric neurologist
Richard Ferber, the nation's leading pediatric sleep researcher.
</P>

   ``Some parents are firm at bedtime and don't give in to `curtain
calls,' those various requests for water or juice. But in the
middle of the night, anything goes: `Fine, come into our bed.' Or
maybe it's the other way around,'' he says: ``Strict at 2 a.m.,
loosey-goosey at bedtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a child is getting a mixed message _ ``Your job is
to sleep in your own bed, uh, well, sometimes it's OK for you to
sleep in our bed'' _ and also is expected to figure out which rules
apply when. In other words, ``Parents abdicate control,'' says
Ferber. He is clinical director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep
Disorders at Children's Hospital and author of ``Solve Your Child's
Sleep Problems'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two major changes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two changes that most commonly trigger sleep
disturbances. The first is the move from crib to bed, typically at
about age 3. The combination of freedom, poor impulse control, and
a new awareness that fun things may be happening in the house
without him makes it hard for a child to stay put. If we are
inconsistent in our response, one night getting angry, the next
letting him climb in our lap for some TV, we add to the problem,
says Ferber.
</P>
<P>
   The other change involves naps. Preschool teacher Fleming gets
countless requests each year from parents wanting teachers to keep
a child awake during naptime. That's because parents understandably
but incorrectly think that if a child doesn't nap or naps less,
he'll be so exhausted that he'll fall asleep easily and sleep like
a rock. In fact, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   Weissbluth, who researches naps, says, ``When preschoolers don't
get the daytime sleep they need, the body produces stimulating
hormones to fight the fatigue.'' A child becomes more wired than
tired, prompting parents to think he isn't ready for bed. But the
later he stays up, the more sleep-deprived he is.
</P>
<P>
   Again contrary to common sense, when he finally falls asleep, it
is not a sound sleep and he has more, not fewer, nighttime
awakenings, says psychologist Jodi Mindell, pediatric director of
the Center for Sleep Medicine in Philadelphia. She is author of
``Sleeping Through the Night'' (HarperPerennial).
</P>
<P>
   Whether the first sign of sleep disruption is at 7 p.m. or 2
a.m., parents tend to move into crisis mode. ``They come up with a
new solution, try it for two nights, say it doesn't work and try
something else,'' says Mindell. ``That's a mistake. Go back to what
worked before,'' she says: ``Old rules, old routines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferber says 3-year-olds still need naps. Even at 4, if a child
still naps on the weekend, she still needs her nap on the weekday.
``A guide for how much sleep a youngster needs is when he wakes up
spontaneously,'' he says. ``If you never have to wake him in the
morning, he's getting the sleep he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled by weekends when he wakes early to watch TV,
however. ``They rouse themselves to see cartoons, then go on
autopilot in front of the TV,'' says Ferber. ``They aren't really
awake, but they aren't asleep either.'' Similarly, a 4-year-old
will force himself to stay awake to watch TV at night, fooling us
into thinking he isn't tired, when he's overtired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Questions to ask &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the first sign sleep is out of hand, ask some questions:
</P>
<P>
   --Is there a peaceful bedtime routine? Mindell recommends a
picture chart with all the bedtime rituals, not just things like
brushing teeth but also all her stalling tactics, like kissing the
dog goodnight. ``When she says, `Oh, but I have to . . .' you can
look at the chart and say, `See? You already had two glasses of
water.' '' If you set up new routines, talk about them first, says
Ferber: ``Here's what we're going to do at bedtime . . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Do you leave your child before she falls asleep? Staying with
her until she's asleep can fuel mid-night wakings because she
relies on you for the transition from wakefulness to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   --Are there bedtime rules? The most important one often never
gets stated, says Ferber: `` `Once you're in bed, your job is to
stay there.' '' Because a preschooler may feel lonely as well as
left out, have a corollary to that: ``And I will come back to kiss
you again in 10 minutes.'' Adds Mindell: ``Don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   --Are there rules for mid-night wakings? If you don't mind
having her in your bed, this is not an issue. If you do, you need a
family rule: ``Everyone sleeps in their own bed.'' When she comes
into yours, return her to her bed quickly, quietly, and
consistently. ``If she needs to go to the bathroom, don't talk,
don't turn on bright lights. Keep it boring,'' says Mindell. ``No
snuggling, no snack, no side trips to the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child falls asleep on her own at bedtime but still wakes
you at 2 saying she needs you, the reason could be a developmental
fear of being on her own. She may be satisfied to bring blanket and
pillow to the floor by your bed, just to be near you. ``She may not
even need to wake you,'' Walsleben says.
</P>
<P>
   Because nightmares typically surface in the preschool years,
Ferber offers this clue for recognizing a real fright: A child who
wakes up scared usually screams and races to your room. If he comes
in calmly, taps you on the shoulder, and says, ``I had a bad
dream,'' it may be less than genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The first child needs soothing, the second needs limit-setting.
Talk to him during the day about how you can help him at night:
``When it's very bad, I can come and tuck you back in, but for some
scares, is it enough to see that we're in our bed in the next room
and to go back to your bed? Or maybe just to have me call to you
from our room, so you know you're safe?''
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers in Fleming's class have a variety of coping
techniques for bad sleep nights. Some wouldn't be endorsed by
researchers _ ``I go get a cookie'' _ but others would be
applauded: ``My mom has a timer at her bed. I can stay for five
minutes.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Recommended bedtime for a preschooler is 7 to 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   --When a child stops napping, adjust the bedtime earlier to
compensate for loss of daytime sleep. A preschooler may give up
naps for several months and then need them again.
</P>
<P>
   --The first step to solving a mid-night wakening is to make sure
bedtime is appropriate and consistent.
</P>
<P>
   --Naps late in the day are not a good idea unless you want a
late bedtime, for instance, in families where working parents get
home late. When the time comes for an earlier bedtime, however, be
prepared to change it gradually, over many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   --Sticker charts can reward a child for staying in bed. If that
doesn't work, try a gate: ``Your job is to stay in bed. If you
can't, we can help you by putting a gate at the doorway.''
</P>
<P>
   --A typical preschooler might have a nightmare once a week. If
she suddenly has three in a row and you think they are genuine,
they may be linked to a stress or scare in her life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Children who spend fewer hours eating meals with
their parents are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior,
according to a University of Michigan study. One theory is that
mealtime is when parents and children can share thoughts and
feelings. The study is summarized in the Brown University Child and
Adolescent Behavior Letter.

FICKLE FINGER OF FATE FLINGS A RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wedding ring is missing and I'm suprised at my reaction, i.e.
superstitious panic. This is totally irrational, I know.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an expensive ring, but price is not the point. After a
thorough search failed to turn it up I found myself thinking: This
is it. The marriage is doomed. It's an omen.
</P>
<P>
   My rational side knows it's nothing of the sort. Here's what
happened. I was sick for a week. I lost weight. Wouldn't you know,
the only place I experienced a dramatic loss was in my fingers. The
ring slipped off and vanished. I need a new ring.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple. Some mysterious atavistic impulse
tells me losing a wedding ring is serious bad luck. Where does this
come from?
</P>
<P>
   I consulted a dictionary of superstitions where I learned,
``Your wedding ring is a source of omens throughout your married
life.'' There were several ominous situations listed, among them,
``Taking off, losing or breaking your wedding ring.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Ladies, don't do it!''(unitals) the dictionary advised,
in urgent italics. Why only ``ladies''? It's not unlucky if a man
loses his wedding ring? Maybe it depends on who he's married to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose your wedding ring it is a sign of coming
misfortune,'' the dictionary warns. ``Avert the omen by getting
your husband to replace the ring with another as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband tells me to forget it, I don't need another ring,
it's just a meaningless symbol. He's terribly enlightened, not
superstitious at all, except when it comes to horseshoes, which, he
says, are lucky only if they've been used and thrown off by a
horse, preferably a thoroughbred, and then nailed to the wall with
the points up. I put no stock in this one, but then I've seen how
he does at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ring has been lost I've realized I harbor other
superstitions. I won't walk under a ladder. I try to tell myself
this is just common sense, but it's superstition. I would never
open an umbrella inside the house. I get nervous when I see someone
put shoes on a table. If I spill salt, I always throw a pinch over
my left shoulder to counteract bad luck. My grandmother was very
superstitious. Maybe these little rituals are a way to keep her
alive in my memory.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I'm just nuts. If so, I have a lot of company.
Superstition thrives. Look at the fortune in coins people toss into
fountains in parks, shopping malls and other public places. They
may tell themselves the coin-tossing is a charitable impulse but at
some level they're buying good luck, or warding off bad.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tells me that for months she's been wanting to leave an
old mirror with the trash, but she's afraid to do it in case it
breaks and brings her seven years of bad luck. A neighbor keeps a
little effigy of a deity she calls the parking goddess on her
dashboard to help her find a parking place. A relative hides folded
dollar bills near her front door to attract money.
</P>
<P>
   Just now someone has sent me a chain e-mail in the form of
something called a Nepali Good Luck Tantra Totem: ``You will
receive good luck within four days of relaying this tantra totem.
Send copies to people you think need good luck. Don't send money as
fate has no price.'' Superstition in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Here I am, as the dawn of the 21st century approaches, receiving
lucky chain e-mail, throwing salt over my shoulder and wondering if
my marriage will survive the loss of my wedding ring. I know it's
foolish, but there it is. My husband says if I want a new ring I'll
have to buy it myself. That seems like another bad omen, or just
bad luck. Maybe there really is something to this superstition
business.

   KOSOVO-CNN _ ATLANTA _ Behind the scenes at CNN for coverage of
Kosovo. We concentrate on the International Desk, sort of the air

   VIDALIA-ILLEGALWORKERS _ The spring harvest of south Georgia's
famed sweet Vidalia onions -- scheduled to begin in about two weeks
-- may dodge the bitter conflicts that erupted in the fields last
year when government agents swooped down to round up workers they
suspected of being illegal aliens. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
workers fled and part of the $90 million crop died in the dirt.
Now, growers are taking steps to hire only legal workers this year,
experts say. (Davis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

   GALOTTO-RECORD _ Tonight's giant jackpot, the largest ever in
Georgia, will join the growing trove of state lottery lore. Among
the fascinating tales: the woman who sent a copy of her winning
ticket to her ex-hubby; the man who waited six months to collect
because he had spent his money too quickly the first time he won;
the woman who won $8.5 million, but still bought her wardrobe at
Dollar General because ``I just don't see spending any more money
than you have to''; and the worst odds in the history of the Big
Game _ tonight's. (Steiden, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

`PINK PANTHER' BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SELLERS, EDWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Corrects spelling of Capucine sted Cappucine in graf six; minor
editing throughout)  
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You may have forgotten, but before he became
Oscar's lovable Furby, Roberto Benigni tried to fill the shoes of
the British comic actor Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards' ``Son of
the Pink Panther'' (1993). But playing the illegitimate offspring
of Inspector Clouseau (Sellers) left even the usually irrepressible
Benigni flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   The film's failure can be put down to it simply being a bad
idea. As hard as he tried, Benigni was too often over the top, with
the gags being more goofy slapstick than rising out of Clouseau's
particular bumbling dim-wittedness.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Sellers were the two men most responsible for the
success of ``The Pink Panther'' series, but the pair reportedly had
an uneasy relationship at best, and a rivalry developed over who
should get the most credit for the films' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' continuation of the series with ``Son'' was seen by
some as an attempt _ a failed one _ to show that he was the comic
genius behind the films. The film illustrates that the two of them
probably needed each other more than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven ``Panther'' films altogether, including ``Son''
and ``The Trail of the Pink Panther,'' which was essentially a
hodgepodge of outtakes strung together as a film. It was released
in 1983, three years after Sellers' death from a heart attack at
the age of 54. Now four of the best of the series _ ``The Pink
Panther'' (1963), ``A Shot in Dark'' (1965) ``The Pink Panther
Strikes Again'' (1976) and the last real collaboration of Sellers
and Edwards, ``The Revenge of the Pink Panther'' (1978) _ are out
on DVD (MGM Home Entertainment; $24.95 each).
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years later (30 in some cases), the ``Panther''
movies hold up _ hilariously. Of course, neither Sellers or Edwards
probably realized what they had on their hands when they started
making ``The Pink Panther,'' which was a comedy-caper movie
starring David Niven, Robert Wagner, Cappucine and Claudia
Cardinale. The inept Clouseau character was meant to supply most of
the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Niven played a sophisticated jewel thief (Sir Charles Lytton),
who the poor inspector is on the trail of but never close to
catching. The Pink Panther? Well, that's actually a priceless gem
that Lytton is out to steal. But the real stealing in this picture
was done by Sellers, who stole the show with his impeccable comic
despite having less screen time than other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   In the next film, ``A Shot in the Dark,'' Inspector Clouseau and
Sellers' comic genius were brought to the forefront. Edwards, who
produced and directed the film, also co-wrote the screenplay with a
comedy writer who would later come up with some head-spinning
ideas, William Peter Blatty, author of ``The Exorcist.'' The film
is filled with one sight gag after another (Clouseau at a nudist
camp is priceless). It also introduced the character of Chief
Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), the inspector's nervous
superior. Dreyfus would find himself frustrated by Clouseau in
subsequent films.
</P>
<P>
   When Sellers returned to play Clouseau more than 10 years later,
his numerous disguises were often the highlights of his films. This
was a trademark of the actor, who played three roles in Stanley
Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove,'' including the title role and the
president of the United States. In ``Revenge'' alone he plays the
vertically challenge Toulouse-Lautrec, a rickshaw driver and a
Swedish herring fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sellers often wasted his talents on turkeys like ``The
Blockhouse'' (1974), where he played six roles, or ``The Great
McGonagall'' (1974), where he played Queen Victoria. Remember
either film? No, probably better for your brain cells. Bad choices
were often the case in Sellers' later career.
</P>
<P>
   He had made his mark in the '50s on the legendary BBC radio
series ``The Goon Show,'' and then starred in a number of terrific
comedies such as ``I'm All Right Jack'' and ``The Mouse That
Roared.'' Besides ``Strangelove,'' in the '60s and early '70s he
was known for those swinging comedies like ``What's New Pussycat?''
``After the Fox,'' ``Casino Royale'' and ``I Love you Alice B.
Toklas.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the success of ``Pink Panther'' series, most of
Sellers' '70s films are forgettable with one notable exception _
the satirical ``Being There'' (1979), for which he received a best
actor Oscar nomination. &UR;

`OUT-OF-TOWNERS' SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn teamed up it was for
the smart, genuinely witty and highly original 1992 screwball
comedy, ``Housesitter.'' Unfortunately, despite mostly positive
reviews, the film was a legendary flop at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   So this time, thinking they've learned from their mistake of
overestimating the moviegoing public, they've given us a farce
that's the polar opposite of that first outing. This follow-up
teaming is broad, crass and so colossally stupid it's often
numbing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy-of-frustration,
``The Out-of-Towners,'' in which Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play
a stubborn Midwestern businessman and his whining wife who are
brought to their knees by a malevolent New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the couple are a recently fired ad man (Martin) and his
dense wife (Hawn) who leave Ohio for a job interview in the Big
Apple and are at war less with the city (it's no longer hip to hate
New York, Martin's character says early on) than with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everything goes wrong. The New York airport is fogged in,
their bags are lost when they arrive in Boston, they miss the train
to New York, the only rental car they can find is cranky, and the
wife gives the husband the wrong directions.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Haven't we already seen this Martin movie before?
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. But ``Trains, Planes and Automobiles'' _ as well as the
original ``Out-of-Towners'' _ were comedies of frustration that
worked because the characters were arrogant and it was fun to see
them terrorized by the malfunctions of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   This pair are nice folks, desperate for a job. What fun is it to
see them chased by a mastiff, abused by a hotel manager (John
Cleese), mugged and kidnapped by various stick-up men, and brought
to the edge of prostitution to get some food and a shower? It's not
funny, it's painful.
</P>
<P>
   The original was certainly no masterpiece, but it at least had a
clever Simon script and humor grounded in New York realities. This
un-Simonized remake is so clumsy, slapstick-laden and agonizingly
witless it plays like fingernails on a blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Out-of-Towners. Directed by Sam Weisman. Screenplay by Marc
Lawrence, based on a screenplay by Neil Simon. Cast: Steve Martin,
Goldie Hawn, John Cleese. Paramount. 91 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
sex jokes.

 `WALK ON THE MOON' RECALLS '60s WITH SENSITIVITY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thing that makes first-time director Tony Goldwyn's ``A Walk
On the Moon'' unique is that it's the first high-profile movie in
ages that dares to view the great consciousness revolution of the
'60s in a somewhat positive light.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from totally successful, and it fails in its effort to
be an absorbing family-relationship drama. Its characters never
seem interesting enough to warrant too much investment of sympathy,
and the script moves relentlessly toward a highly contrived ending.
</P>
<P>
   But it's well-acted by its three stars, and its whole '60s
subtext is believable and seductive. By not trying too hard (and by
using '60s music that hasn't been overexposed to death in the
movies of later decades), it skillfully catches the mood and feel
of the Woodstock Summer of '69.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a lower-middle class New York Jewish family summering
at a tacky Catskills resort: Pearl (Diane Lane), the mid-thirtyish
mother and housewife; Marty (Liev Schreiber), her uncommunicative
TV repairman husband; and Alison (Anna Paquin), their 14-year-old
daughter, on the verge of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the movie, the '60s hits each of them hard.
Pearl, who more or less missed her adolescence, falls for a
handsome hippie (Viggo Mortensen); Marty feels unfulfilled by his
life and betrayed by his wife; and Alison wants to go to the big
Woodstock Music and Arts Fair just up the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is not really about the destruction of this family
unit so much as it's about how the '60s aura of unlimited
possibility _ as represented by both Woodstock and the titular Moon
landing _ allows these characters to re-examine their lives and
relationships, abandon the false assumptions of the '50s, and start
over.
</P>
<P>
   The (partially autobiographical) script by Pamala Gray is quite
good at chronicling the internal stresses on the family unit _
Pearl's sense of having missed her girlhood because of a teenage
pregnancy, Marty's agony at having missed out on a career as a
scientist, and Alison's resentment of her mother's belated sexual
awakening.
</P>
<P>
   The script is also good at dramatizing how these stresses
explode in the summer of Woodstock, and at suggesting how each of
these characters might come out of the experience a better person.
But the script has its share of false beats, its dramatic arc
depends on one gigantic coincidence, and its tag-on-happy ending
seems glaringly dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has it's share of false and annoying supporting
performances, especially Mortensen's one-note hippie lover, who
seems to have stepped out of a bad romance novel; and Tovah
Feldshuh's busy-body mother-in-law, who rides the script's least
engaging subplot and would have served the movie better on the
cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the three lead performances are quite solid. Lane proves
once again that she may be the best of Hollywood's thirtysomething
actresses; Schreiber makes his character's pain and bitterness so
palpable that it's often painful to watch; and Oscar-winner Paquin
(``The Piano'') personifies the agony and ecstasy of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   And though its third act is weak and unconvincing, ``A Walk On
the Moon'' also manages, in its sum total, to make a very
persuasive case that no one really ``missed'' the '60s, that
everybody who lived through that revolutionary era incorporated
something of its sensibility into their lives, even if they never
realized it.
</P>
<P>
   A Walk On the Moon. Directed by Tony Goldwyn. Produced by Tony
Goldwyn, Dustin Hoffman and Murray Schisgal. Written by Pamela
Gray. Cast: Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Anna
Paquin. Miramax. 107 minutes. Rated R for sexual situations.

FAMILY MEMBER PENS GRANT GREEN'S BIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Journalist-author Sharony Andrews Green had never
heard of Grant Green when she married the late jazz guitarist's son
and namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Research into the life of Green, who recorded as session leader
and sideman on nearly 100 albums for the Blue Note label from the
early '60s to the late '70s, eventually led to the breakup of that
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Her newly published ``Grant Green: Rediscovering the Forgotten
Genius of Jazz Guitar'' (Miller Freeman, $22.95) is a heartfelt and
entertaining biography of the severely underrated guitarist whose
rhythmic approach and sweetly soulful tone fueled beloved hard-bop
records by Herbie Hancock, Lee Morgan and others.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a subtle musician and unsung master of groove who drew on
bop, blues, gospel, Latin and funk, also cut a series of stellar
and frequently sampled solo albums, including ``Idle Moments,''
``Nigeria'' and ``Street of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his output was huge, the St. Louis-born Green was
overshadowed by more high-profile guitarists, such as Wes
Montgomery and, later, George Benson.
</P>
<P>
   The result of six years of work, ``Grant Green'' paints a
revealing portrait of the guitarist's struggles that led to his
death in 1979 at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley Turrentine was the most protective of Grant,'' author
Green, 32, admits. ``He put me on the spot as a black journalist by
asking, `Why do we always talk about the dark side when we talk
about jazz musicians?' I met a lot of people who knew Grant, but
there were also a lot of unreturned phone calls. You could feel
there was some reluctance to talk for many reasons. There were bad
feelings over money.''
</P>
<P>
   A former journalist for the Detroit Free Press and the Miami
Herald, Sharony Andrews Green met Grant Green Jr. when he ran a
sandwich shop in Miami. They married and moved to the onetime jazz
haven Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we went, people would respond to my ex-husband's
name,'' Green recalls. ``When we'd rent videos, when we went to
adopt a cat, when we'd buy concert tickets _ people behind the
counter would say, `I remember a guitarist named Grant Green.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated, she began researching the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be a journalist first and a wife second, which
wasn't always easy,'' she said. ``It contributed to the demise of
my marriage because I knew more about my husband's father than he
did.'' &QL;

 &HT;    ACOG account: Millions still left to spend
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _The last time the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games reported publicly on its finances, it said there would be
nothing left for local youth sports programs after a huge debt was
paid off to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two years ago, when the committee still had $65
million in the bank. Since then, tens of millions have changed
hands among ACOG, its top officers, its stadium construction team,
its lawyers and the tiny Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation.
Nearly $11 million remains in its account.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surprised to learn ACOG has not closed its books and
continues to write checks are some of its own board of directors.
``I find that to be truly astonishing,'' attorney Michael Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not still on the board, am I?'' asked Sam Massell,
president of the Buckhead (Business) Coalition. ``I thought they
closed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG officials said the committee will wind down this summer
when all accounts are settled, including a few legal disputes over
such matters as private property rights and a missing painting.
They intend to use any leftover funds to pay off a $22 million loan
from the USOC in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stogner, the financial director who still works part
time in ACOG's small office at the Inforum, said about half the
debt has been repaid and he hopes to use any remaining funds in
ACOG's account to eliminate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave youth sports out in the cold. Under an early
agreement with the International Olympic Committee and the USOC, 20
percent of any ACOG surplus would have gone to a foundation to
benefit athletics for youngsters in Atlanta. At one time, ACOG was
forecasting a $150 million surplus; today it maintains there will
be none, although the USOC plans to launch a $1 million Community
Olympic Development Program in Atlanta that would provide seed
money for some Olympic-type sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   During the six-year buildup to the Atlanta Games, ACOG's books
were monitored by the state's Olympic watchdog authority, known as
MAOGA. That check and balance ceased in June 1996, and there is no
longer independent financial oversight to let the public know what
is happening with ACOG's millions.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors last met in the summer of 1997 to review
ACOG'S last independent financial audit and approve a dissolution
plan. The plan authorized the committee's officers _ President
Billy Payne, Chief Operating Officer A.D. Frazier Jr. and managing
directors Ginger Watkins and Patrick Glisson _ to ``wind up and
liquidate ACOG's business and affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no communication since then with the board,
leading some directors to the conclusion that ACOG had dissolved.
``Since the Games, I've had no contact with anybody regarding ACOG,
which I assumed was either out of business or effectively going out
of business,'' said former Gov. Carl Sanders, a board member.
``This is news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of accountability, Glisson, the former chief
financial officer, said the public can rest easy. The USOC reviews
ACOG's books quarterly and annual returns are filed with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal concern is we get the amount they are carrying
as a contingent liability,'' said John Samuelson, the USOC's chief
financial officer. ``But we're not counting on the money until we
have it in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG had released quarterly financial updates before the Games,
even though the committee maintained it was a private organization
and under no legal obligation to share its finances. Its officials
had hoped to complete their business out of the spotlight. Stogner
now is hesitant to talk about how much money ACOG is sitting on for
fear new litigants will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But with mounting public pressure on Olympic organizations
worldwide to open their books, ACOG officials might have difficulty
doling out their remaining millions with only themselves and the
USOC to answer to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stewart Acuff, president of the Atlanta Labor Council who
served on the ACOG board audit committee, said of the
organization's activities: ``What I saw was as transparent and
clean as can be.'' Yet, he added, ``I do think it is important for
Atlanta's Olympic legacy and the legacy for the leadership of ACOG
to have a final accounting of where the money went.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said he expects the board to receive ``courtesy
information'' once business is concluded. ACOG's federal tax
returns for 1997 _ the most recent financial information available
_ provide a partial accounting of where the money went.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spent more than $38 million in 1997, mostly to finish
converting the Olympic stadium to baseball and demolishing
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. And though operating with a skeleton
staff, the committee paid its officers and employees more than $5
million and its King &AMP; Spalding lawyers more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, ACOG gave several million dollars to the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, the nonprofit organization created by
Payne in 1987 to bid for the Games and foster amateur sports in
Georgia. The two organizations, both headed by Payne, are closely
aligned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ACOG transferred ownership of its archives and Olympic
memorabilia to the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and gave it
a check for $1.15 million, presumably for storage and archiving
expenses. ACOG gave GAAF an additional $1.3 million, which tax
records indicate was repayment of a loan from 1991.
</P>

   Once GAAF received the money from ACOG, the suddenly flush
foundation gave Payne $975,000 for his personal memorabilia
collection. Before its windfall from ACOG, the foundation had less
than $7,000 on hand. The Payne transaction, purposely conducted out
of the public eye, has raised questions about how ACOG is spending
its cash reserves. Indeed, the USOC's Samuelson said he was not
aware of the payment to GAAF even though he is monitoring ACOG's

   However, they didn't tell the public or the board about a $1
million ``extended resource availability program,'' which provided
a way to funnel money to 25 key employees after the Games. Glisson
said he created the program to ``ensure the people we needed were
available for the critical period of the shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said seven managing directors, including himself, were
in the program. Some people were paid as much as half a year's
salary to be on call, he said. ``In contrast to a bonus, this was a
very appropriate, rational business decision,'' Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
   Glisson, for example, was paid $410,811 in 1997, although he had
taken a full-time position as chief financial officer at The Emory
Clinic in September.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Frazier were not included in the program. ``I
recognized that would be impolitic,'' Glisson said. ``They were
specifically exempted because that could be misperceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both officers were handsomely compensated the year of the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was paid $806,608 in 1996, a 41 percent increase from
the year before, according to ACOG's tax returns. He received
nothing in 1997, having taken a job as president and chief
executive of Invesco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Payne received a 17 percent raise to $766,833 in 1996 and
another $69,000 in 1997, although he had gone to work as a vice
chairman of NationsBank in February. Later that year, he received
the payment from GAAF for his memorabilia. All told, in the final
two years of Payne's reign as Atlanta's Olympic chief, he took in
$1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very surprising,'' said Coleman. ``There have been a
lot of expenditures of money that would have been appropriate for
the board to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Massell, a former Atlanta mayor, said he expects
ACOG to give the public a final accounting. ``I think it would be
improper to keep anything confidential as matters are brought to a
close,'' he said. ``But I do not fault the team for keeping records
close to the vest for the moment.

 &HT;    ACOG account: Millions still left to spend
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _The last time the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games reported publicly on its finances, it said there would be
nothing left for local youth sports programs after a huge debt was
paid off to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two years ago, when the committee still had $65
million in the bank. Since then, tens of millions have changed
hands among ACOG, its top officers, its stadium construction team,
its lawyers and the tiny Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation.
Nearly $11 million remains in its account.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surprised to learn ACOG has not closed its books and
continues to write checks are some of its own board of directors.
``I find that to be truly astonishing,'' attorney Michael Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not still on the board, am I?'' asked Sam Massell,
president of the Buckhead (Business) Coalition. ``I thought they
closed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG officials said the committee will wind down this summer
when all accounts are settled, including a few legal disputes over
such matters as private property rights and a missing painting.
They intend to use any leftover funds to pay off a $22 million loan
from the USOC in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stogner, the financial director who still works part
time in ACOG's small office at the Inforum, said about half the
debt has been repaid and he hopes to use any remaining funds in
ACOG's account to eliminate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave youth sports out in the cold. Under an early
agreement with the International Olympic Committee and the USOC, 20
percent of any ACOG surplus would have gone to a foundation to
benefit athletics for youngsters in Atlanta. At one time, ACOG was
forecasting a $150 million surplus; today it maintains there will
be none, although the USOC plans to launch a $1 million Community
Olympic Development Program in Atlanta that would provide seed
money for some Olympic-type sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   During the six-year buildup to the Atlanta Games, ACOG's books
were monitored by the state's Olympic watchdog authority, known as
MAOGA. That check and balance ceased in June 1996, and there is no
longer independent financial oversight to let the public know what
is happening with ACOG's millions.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors last met in the summer of 1997 to review
ACOG'S last independent financial audit and approve a dissolution
plan. The plan authorized the committee's officers _ President
Billy Payne, Chief Operating Officer A.D. Frazier Jr. and managing
directors Ginger Watkins and Patrick Glisson _ to ``wind up and
liquidate ACOG's business and affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no communication since then with the board,
leading some directors to the conclusion that ACOG had dissolved.
``Since the Games, I've had no contact with anybody regarding ACOG,
which I assumed was either out of business or effectively going out
of business,'' said former Gov. Carl Sanders, a board member.
``This is news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of accountability, Glisson, the former chief
financial officer, said the public can rest easy. The USOC reviews
ACOG's books quarterly and annual returns are filed with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal concern is we get the amount they are carrying
as a contingent liability,'' said John Samuelson, the USOC's chief
financial officer. ``But we're not counting on the money until we
have it in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG had released quarterly financial updates before the Games,
even though the committee maintained it was a private organization
and under no legal obligation to share its finances. Its officials
had hoped to complete their business out of the spotlight. Stogner
now is hesitant to talk about how much money ACOG is sitting on for
fear new litigants will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But with mounting public pressure on Olympic organizations
worldwide to open their books, ACOG officials might have difficulty
doling out their remaining millions with only themselves and the
USOC to answer to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stewart Acuff, president of the Atlanta Labor Council who
served on the ACOG board audit committee, said of the
organization's activities: ``What I saw was as transparent and
clean as can be.'' Yet, he added, ``I do think it is important for
Atlanta's Olympic legacy and the legacy for the leadership of ACOG
to have a final accounting of where the money went.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said he expects the board to receive ``courtesy
information'' once business is concluded. ACOG's federal tax
returns for 1997 _ the most recent financial information available
_ provide a partial accounting of where the money went.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spent more than $38 million in 1997, mostly to finish
converting the Olympic stadium to baseball and demolishing
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. And though operating with a skeleton
staff, the committee paid its officers and employees more than $5
million and its King &AMP; Spalding lawyers more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, ACOG gave several million dollars to the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, the nonprofit organization created by
Payne in 1987 to bid for the Games and foster amateur sports in
Georgia. The two organizations, both headed by Payne, are closely
aligned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ACOG transferred ownership of its archives and Olympic
memorabilia to the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and gave it
a check for $1.15 million, presumably for storage and archiving
expenses. ACOG gave GAAF an additional $1.3 million, which tax
records indicate was repayment of a loan from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Once GAAF received the money from ACOG, the suddenly flush
foundation gave Payne $975,000 for his personal memorabilia
collection. Before its windfall from ACOG, the foundation had less
than $7,000 on hand. The Payne transaction, purposely conducted out

URANIUM BULLETS LIKELY TO BE USED IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. Air Force attack jets poised to blast
Yugoslav armor are armed with depleted uranium bullets, a
radioactive ammunition prized for its ability to pierce tanks but
deplored as a threat to human health.
</P>
<P>
   The use of depleted uranium in combat is a troubling prospect to
some veterans groups, which worry that the Pentagon will fail to
issue warnings about the danger posed by the hazardous dust and
debris created by the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its behavior during the Gulf War, the United States has
established a precedent: Don't protect your own troops from
depleted uranium, don't warn civilian populations about it, and
don't take any responsibility for cleanup or restoring the
environment when you're done,'' said Dan Fahey, a staff member at
Swords to Plowshares, a veterans' rights group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that wouldn't happen again,'' said Fahey, author
of ``Case Narrative: Depleted Uranium Exposures,'' a 1998 report on
Gulf War health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted uranium ammunition is made from a radioactive and toxic
metal that is twice as dense as lead. It rips through tanks, the
Pentagon says, ``like a hot knife through butter.''
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition was used for the first time in combat in the
Persian Gulf war, but soldiers were not warned that inhaling,
ingesting or absorbing its hazardous residue could cause cancer, or
respiratory, kidney and skin disorders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Gulf War, 630,000 pounds of depleted uranium
dust, fragments and penetrators _ the ammunition's spear-shaped
projectile _ were scattered in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, the
Pentagon has said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Pentagon said exposure to depleted uranium was not
the cause of Gulf War illnesses, the undiagnosed ailments
afflicting 100,000 veterans. However, in 1999, the Pentagon
corrected that statement, saying the statement was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1998 federal law, the National Academy of Sciences will
investigate the causes of veterans' illnesses to determine if they
are linked to battlefield exposure to depleted uranium and other
toxic substances used in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   NATO plans to intensify its air raids in Yugoslavia, targeting
tanks and armored vehicles with the armor-piercing ammunition. The
Air Force A-10, nicknamed ``Warthog,'' is a low-flying plane
designed to destroy tanks and armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a cease-fire in the immediate future, the
likelihood of the imminent use of depleted uranium ammunition is
high,'' said Paul Sullivan, executive director of the National Gulf
War Resource Center, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group for
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say the Air Force A-10s have been hampered by
thick clouds and rain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to depleted uranium bullets, which are fired from
the plane's Gatling guns, Warthogs can also fire Maverick missiles
at Yugoslav armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon declined Wednesday to answer
questions about when or how A-10s will be used in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he hoped the Pentagon would provide medical
screenings to U.S. soldiers who may be exposed to battlefields in
Yugoslavia contaminated with depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Army regulations required medical screenings for soldiers
exposed to radioactive substances, but the military failed to
provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also warned of the environmental hazards posed by
depleted uranium, which has a half-life of 4.5 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Yugoslavia, it's expected that depleted uranium will be
fired in agricultural areas, places where livestock graze and where
crops are grown, thereby introducing the specter of possible
contamination of the food chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Iraqi doctors said they feared a disturbing rise in
leukemia and stomach cancer among civilians who live near the war
zone may be linked to depleted uranium contamination.

mind-numbing hooks, the song drills its way into your brain like a
shouted nursery rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think pop is coming back in America,'' says Sinead
O'Carroll. At 20, the blonde is the oldest member of the all-female
BWitched, which opens for 98 Degrees on Monday night at the
Celebrity Theatre. ``I think we're part of that generation. It's
like they like our music, they like the way we dress. We give a
very positive and happy feel to our music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dublin group's gimmick, if you could call it that, is its
sheer Irishness. The songs on the group's self-titled debut are as
fizzy as a fresh can of Sprite, but they are spiced with definite
Celtic touches. The ballad ``To You I Belong'' _ written for the
girls' mums _ gains emotional heft with the help of a lonely tin
whistle and some evocative fiddle work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically have to do something to have your difference,''
O'Carroll says, dashing between appointments in Los Angeles.
``That's why the Irish influence was something we could do. We do
have our own sound. When people asked who influenced our sound,
it's really no one, because we try not to sound like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, O'Carroll, Lindsay Armaou and twins Edele and Keavy
Lynch don't really sound like other pop acts _ not even Scary,
Baby, Sporty and Posh, to whom they're constantly linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the comparison we always get,'' O'Carroll says in her
chipper brogue. ``We don't mind at all. They've been so successful
and they've done so well. We kind of mirror that because of the
success we've had in England. But once people see us and hear us,
they know we're completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're definitely younger, both in terms of age
and lyrical content. These girls impatiently wait by the mailbox
for the mailman and breathlessly coo about riding a roller coaster
of love. The Backstreet Boys sound like a streetwise Snoop Dogg by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of Irish hip-hop pop,'' O'Carroll cheerfully says _
actually, she says everything cheerfully. ``It's a bit of
everything. That's why we wanted to write it all ourselves. The
music that we like is happy. It makes you want to get up and have a
dance, to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the group seems on the verge of cracking it so big
in America while other British Isles phenoms such as Boyzone, Peter
Andre and Louise have failed to click is something that keeps
O'Carroll and her bandmates wide-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being big in America is something we never really thought
about,'' she insists. ``It was one of those things that just
happened. The record company reps saw us and liked us. And they
(begin ital) really (end ital) liked us. We just took it from
there. We're blown away by the fact that we're coming to America as
quick as we have. It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally fantastic, at least to American ears, is the charming
lilt of a young Irish brogue. Maureen O'Hara in her prime couldn't
have sounded any sweeter than O'Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny,'' she says, giggling. ``Here, they tend to
really like our accents. But the English people find our voices
really boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, in LA, everyone is like, `Oh my gosh, you're really like
pale-skinned,'' she continues, doing a not-bad approximation of an
American accent. ``Everyone in LA is so leathery, so I think it's
nice for them to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, c'est la vie. &QL;

THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One thing about the current crop of boy bands. They
don't want to be known as boy bands.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nick Lachey, one-fourth of the platinum-selling 98 Degrees.
So what if the group consists of a gang of photogenic young guys?
Who cares if the band's official Web site includes such newsy
tidbits as astrological signs (Nick's a Scorpio) and favorite
drinks (he's a Yoo-Hoo man _ yeah, sure). This is a real band, darn
it!
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some negative stereotypes with that term,'' Lachey
says, carefully avoiding the dreaded BB phrase. ``We don't feel
that any of those apply to this group. Once people actually hear
our music, they walk away knowing we're talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure, there's no denying that. In fact, as far as these
things go, 98 Degrees is on pretty solid ground. The group sounds
more like a secular,hairy-chested variation of Take 6 than a
fifth-generation New Kids. That's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The harmonies of Justin Jeffre, Jeff Timmons, Drew Lachey and
his big bro' Nick are pretty snazzy. And the group's best songs,
such as ``True to Your Heart,'' a thumping retro jam featured on
the ``Mulan'' soundtrack, are hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the image of the group, the age of the group, our
look, that causes people to sometimes put us in with other
groups,'' Lachey says, minutes after finishing an autograph session
for 1,200 fans in Winnipeg, Canada. ``We see ourselves as a pop
band.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio group was formed a few years back by Timmons (fave
colors are orange and blue) and Nick. The foursome did the
talent-show circuit before getting backstage at a Boyz II Men
concert, where they caught the attention of Montell Jordan's
manager. He signed them to a deal and hooked them up with Motown.
Two albums later, the group doesn't seem to have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``98 Degrees and Rising,'' the band's second disc,
recently passed a million copies in sales. The group is headlining
on its first genuine concert tour, unless one counts a
play-the-malls-to-backing-tracks thing it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   That mall tour seems like one of those marketing decisions that
is a little hard to fathom. Heavy exposure in teen-dream mags and
on the Disney Channel seems to nail the lid on the ``Tiger Beat''
coffin, something Nick and the guys don't exactly seem comfortable
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We control our marketing to a certain degree,'' Nick says,
choosing his words carefully. ``The record label really has the
responsibility. They kind of fit us where they can. . . . In that
respect, they make a lot of decisions we necessarily wouldn't agree
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of wind up in a lot of teen magazines with those
quote-unquote boy bands. That's kind of an inevitable thing. Our
music will set us apart from that whole movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they do follow the classic teen-idol rules. There are the
autograph sessions. The group's opening act in Phoenix is BWitched,
Ireland's bubbly bubblegum import. And Lachey is as polite as can
be, even doling out nice-but-evasive sound bites _ ``It's like
having (three) brothers'' is how he describes his bandmates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the short life span of being a teen idol is simply
something he doesn't want to dwell on. The group recently got to
perform as part of MTV's spring break programming and earned a
positive response from the cool college crowd. Maybe there is life
after high school for these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all college-age girls, and they were really
enthusiastic about the group,'' he says. ``That's what we want _ to
get women and even men in their 30s, 40s and maybe even 50s
listening to us. To make good music and to appeal to a variety of
people _ that's the goal.'' &QL;

CITIZEN KING _ OR COURT JESTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Milwaukee group Citizen King is big on the radio
right now with ``Better Days (And the Bottom Drops Out),'' a clever
blend of melodic rock, hip-hop and some alt-flavored sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Sims, who handles bass and vocals for the five-member band,
says the song has a deep meaning beneath the summery chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen when things are bad and we had to get over it,''
says Sims, sounding a bit groggy in his Portland, Ore., hotel room.
``We've had to pay our dues and stuff. You know that line in the
song, `My toes are busted?' Kristian Riley, our guitar player, got
a couple of his toes chopped off by a lawn mower. He's got a couple
of fakeys now.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, other than ripping Riley's shoes off during a concert
performance, it's going to be hard to prove the toe story. It's
that way with a lot of what Sims says. He's in a vaguely silly mood
today, three weeks to the day after the release of the band's
major-label debut, ``Mobile Estates. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night of the tour was in Milwaukee,'' he recounts.
``It was awesome. People threw all kinds of stuff onstage. They
were getting rowdy, flicking their lighters. Girls threw panties up
onstage. Well, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a positive buzz around the band. Early word on the
Beck-style disc was ecstatic. Part of that is due to co-producer
Eric Valentine, best-known for his work with such radio-friendly
types as Third Eye Blind and Smash Mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of producers we wanted to work with,'' Tims
says. ``We threw a bunch of names in a hat, and Eric's was the one
that came out. He does have a Midas touch, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1993, the group now is finally tasting national
success with its first cross-country tour and a deal with Warner
Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's way more champagne than we know what to do
with,'' Tims says. ``And there's always circus peanuts at our
shows. We put that in our rider (contract). A steady supply of
circus peanuts, socks, Raisin Bran, Skittles, a couple of pornos
and Miller brew.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it would be Miller _ that's what made Milwaukee
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all that people know about Milwaukee,'' Tims muses.
``Beer. And `Laverne &AMP; Shirley.' There's also a clown museum, so
it's kind of known for its unicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's tack wrestling. People get into the ring, except
the mat is covered with tacks. Tack wrestling is a big deal in
Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Citizen King. Hometown girls love them so much they throw
their panties at them.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. &QL;

AUDI AVANT SCOOTS, HANDLES, LOOKS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, APRIL 3)
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - OK, it's confession time. I need to get something off
my chest, something that some people might find strange and
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   I dig station wagons.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just a condition of middle age, though practicality
certain looms larger these days than it used to. No, I've always
liked station wagons, have owned several of them, and just think
they're kind of cool.
</P>
<P>
   Weird, huh?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about behemoth nine-passenger wagons of yore,
but trim, compact wagons. And these days, some of the best wagons
are being made in Europe, where square backs are enjoying a popular
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo long has been the king of station wagons, but sporty BMW
currently markets its Touring wagon for the horsy set, and Saab has
just added a wagon to its latest lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Audi, fresh on the upswing with its fine new trio of
sedans, A4, A6 and A8. This is a car company that has returned from
purgatory, shrugging off the bogus ``unintended acceleration''
fiasco of the '80s and a mediocre product line, and bringing out a
collection of vehicles of character and excellent road manners.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, driveable and even affordable A4 1.8 T Avant (e.g,
station wagon) was a road-test car that I really wanted to keep.
It's the kind of station wagon that makes me dig station wagons.
Audi calls it a sport wagon, which might seem like an oxymoron
until you get behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The little Avant drives and handles. Equipped with a five-speed
stick shift and a surprisingly strong 1.8-liter turbocharged four,
it scoots like a sports car. Sounds like one, too. Audi says it
will go zero to 60 mph in just 8.5 seconds, with the manual
gearbox, which is pretty quick for a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   This four is also smooth and quiet, with only a bit of
four-cylinder boominess evident under hard acceleration. It does
get a bit weak in the knees at low rpm, but not as bad as some
other turbos. Shifting is smooth and precise.
</P>
<P>
   The A4 Avant also is available with a 2.8-liter V-6, at a
slightly higher price. A five-speed also is available with the six,
a rarity in this market, especially in a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Handling and cornering have the kind of Germanic poise and
precision that driving enthusiasts crave. Steering response is
quick, the ride is firm and athletic, and the body feels stiff and
tight. A twisting back road becomes a romp.
</P>
<P>
   The test car also was equipped with Audi's famed Quattro system,
one of the first all-wheel-drive setups for passenger cars on
pavement. Electronically controlled to feed torque to whichever
wheels need it, while sensing and compensating for slips and
slides, Quattro provides finesse and security.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant has the kind of styling that accentuates its
station-wagon body rather than hiding it. The rear has a rounded,
modern shape that makes the Avant look like it wants to move.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of moving, you can load some boxes back there, too,
though the sloping roof and curving flanks take away some of the
utility. Really, this is not the kind of wagon space available from
Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, but should be enough for light duty.
</P>
<P>
   The A4 is a small car, and although the driver and front-seat
passenger have plenty of space, rear-seat folk had better not be
too big or too fussy. The interior in our test car was named terra
cotta for some unfathomable reason, but it was very handsome and
comfortable, with supportive seats and a good atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is simple and well-designed, with easy-to-read
gauges, but some of the switches and controls are hard to get used
to. The stereo system has lost some of its fussiness, but operating
it still involves a learning process. It's a good-sounding stereo
and well worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Audi's downstream sibling, Volkswagen, also has released some
sharp new wagons, notably the handsome Passat, this year. This is a
bigger car at a lesser price, but it doesn't have the level of trim
or performance of the A4.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an Audi A6 Avant wagon, a stylish craft at a
premium price, that's bigger and brawnier than the A4.
</P>
<P>
   The A4 Avant confirms my faith in station wagons. It's certainly
more handsome and pleasurable to drive than any minivan or
sport-utility vehicle out there. &QL;

 (ADV: RECIPES AT END, WITH BRUNCHSIDE-FOOD)

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Brunch is not just easy. Brunch is fun, relaxing
(begin ital) and (end ital) easy. The secret to brunch is that
breakfast is the favorite meal of so many people. Brunch has no set
definition, but it's basically glorified breakfast, served sometime
before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Hosting a brunch is much less intimidating than hosting a dinner
party. For one thing, some elements are standard. Coffee. You can
make coffee. Champagne is always appropriate, if you want to go the
alcohol route, and it's super simple to combine a little champagne
and OJ for mimosas.
</P>
<P>
   The options are numerous and attractive. You don't have to make
a big ``main dish.'' Think eggs and baked goods, sweet as well as
savory. Build a menu around a couple of items that you want to
prepare, and then plan to fill in with the rest from a bakery or
delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you might want to make the Dutch Baby recipe, an
eggy soufflelike oven pancake. You mix up the batter, pour it in a
heated pan and it puffs up high in the hot oven. Sprinkle on
powdered sugar just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   You could serve crispy thick-slice bacon, cold poached fish,
grilled skewered shrimp, maybe? Or keep it vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Add steamed vegetables, maybe something seasonal, such as
Lemon-Glazed Asparagus. For dessert, purchase a fruit tart,
assemble strawberry shortcake or bake our rich and delicious
Raspberry Cream Cheese Coffeecake.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit can serve multiple purposes for brunch. It can be a salad;
a dessert; a sauce; a filling for crepes; a topping or crown for
cheesecake, waffles or the Dutch Baby. Plan on fruit in some form,
even if it's a centerpiece. You can even do that
sour-cream-and-brown sugar thing with strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Or, make Lora Brody's White Wine Sangria: 3 cups sliced fresh
peaches, apricots, nectarines or sweet plums in a tall pitcher with
4 cups Riesling or other semisweet white wine and a half-cup of
brandy. Serve cold; spoon some fruit in the glass before you pour
in sangria.
</P>
<P>
   Several of our recipes would be appropriate for an Easter
brunch. You can glaze a ham with the Pepper Jelly, which you can
make either sweet or hot. Or melt the jelly to glaze a leg of lamb.
Serve a little Pepper Jelly with the lamb, too, instead of the
expected mint.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheese Blintzes recipe is not too sweet, with a wonderful
light filling of farmers cheese, topped with sour cream, berries
and lemon zest. Crepes are easy to make after a little bit of
practice, and they can be made and refrigerated ahead. Or freeze
some _ they're as handy as omelets for using up whatever bits of
filling you have on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Brunch Enchiladas are a little heartier and a good way to make
use of any leftover ham, turkey or chicken. Like many brunch
casseroles, you can make this one the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Brunches are easiest to serve buffet style. Set up coffee,
juices, other drinks and desserts in an area away from the buffet
table. Buffet service starts with plates, then cold dishes, hot
dishes and ends with carved meats.
</P>
<P>
   Like fruit, flowers are another must. What grows in your yard in
abundance?
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: When you invite people to brunch, you might want
to specify when it ends as well as when it begins. Champagne in the
middle of the day makes some people want to nap. Do you want them
sleeping away the afternoon on your sofa? &QL;

Dutch Baby &QL; 
 &QL; 
(From ``The Best of Waffles &AMP; Pancakes,'' by Jane Stacey)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar, for dusting
</P>
<P>
   Sliced fresh nectarines and blackberries, for topping
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Put the butter in a 9-inch pie
pan and place it in the oven to melt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar,
milk, eggs and salt. Using an electric mixer set at medium-high,
beat the mixture for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until smooth. Remove
the pan from the oven and carefully swirl to evenly coat the bottom

Basic Crepes &QL; 
 &QL; 
(From ``The Best of Waffles &AMP; Pancakes,'' by Jane Stacey)
</P>
<P>
   cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine all of
the ingredients and process for 10 to 15 seconds, or until smooth.
Scrape the sides of the bowl and process for 5 to 10 seconds more.
Transfer the batter to a medium-size bowl, cover with plastic wrap,
and chill for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a 6-inch crepe pan or small skillet over medium-high heat
until hot, or until a few drops of water sizzle on the surface.
Lightly grease the pan. Pour about 3 tablespoons batter into the
pan, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Cook for about 1 minute, or
until the edges look lacy and begin to pull away from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning the crepe, lift the edges to check that the
underside is lightly browned. Turn the crepe and cook for 15 to 30
seconds, or until the underside is lightly browned. Transfer the
crepe to a sheet of waxed paper. Repeat with the remaining batter,
greasing the pan as necessary.

THE SECRET OF A SUCCESSFUL BRUNCH: GREAT MUNCHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -
</P>
<P>
   - French toast with an orange sauce, or stuffed French toast
(sandwich two slices of bread together with cream cheese and
preserves). At the very least, add a teaspoon of vanilla and some
cinnamon and/or nutmeg to the egg and milk when you make your usual
French toast. Which, by the way, is the absolute best use of stale
French bread. &QL; 
- Lots of citrus in the back yard? Three oranges will yield about 8
ounces, or 1 cup of juice. To make 12 cups of juice, use 36
oranges. Or serve a half-and-half mixture of tea and lemonade or
orange juice over ice.
</P>
<P>
   - Hash: A sacred word. Really good hash made in a heavy skillet
from cold roast and cooked potatoes is food worthy of the gods.
Work on it. The secrets are in the skillet, preferably cast iron,
and your patience to let the food brown in the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   - Omelets are also easier with the right pan. Omelets are good
for exhibitionist tendencies, because the cook is on display while
standing there making the omelets. For a brunch, make larger ones
in a big non-stick pan, and divide them onto hot plates to serve.
Or get two small skillets going and make them to order. The host
who wants to relax should plan something else, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   - Fill omelets with any mixture that sizzles your gizzard:
mushrooms and roasted chile strips; shrimp, onion and fresh basil.
If you have an herb garden, do the French thing and gather the tips
of several kinds; chop and sprinkle over the omelet interior just
before you fold it.
</P>
<P>
   - Toast a few slivered almonds or other nuts until fragrant to
sprinkle over fruit salad or ambrosia, into green salads or to
garnish a curl of whipped cream atop a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   - To serve a large group, have sliced bagels and coffee ready
for guests when they arrive, at a station away from the table where
you'll be serving.
</P>
<P>
   - Buy a couple of different kinds of non-dairy-flavored creamers
for the coffee-loving crowd. They'll feel pampered.
</P>
<P>
   - Buttermilk biscuits, scones, muffins, English muffins,
raisin-bread toast spread with sour cream . . . the list of quick
breads suitable for brunch is endless. You can buy them or bake
your favorite.
</P>
<P>
   - Stir chopped fresh herbs into softened cream cheese for
spreading, but don't confine yourself to bagels. Stuff the fragrant
mixture into sugar snap peas that have been blanched for one minute
in boiling water, celery sticks, or even onto fingers of red bell
pepper. &QL;

GREEN PARTY VICTORY SHOCKS DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The election of Green Party candidate Audie
Bock to the California Assembly shocked the political establishment
because it showed how badly voters want change in Oakland, even at
the risk of eroding the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that there is a strong measure of dissatisfaction
with the status quo,'' said Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, the former
Democratic governor and now the independent leader of a new guard.
``I think it's more about people being fed up with what has been,
and they want something better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate in Tuesday's run-off election, former
Oakland mayor and state assemblyman Elihu Harris, was so confident
of victory that he had hired legislative staff members. He was
being talked about as the next Assembly speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Democrat was been rebuffed by Oakland, Alameda and
Piedmont voters in one of the biggest election surprises in years.
</P>
<P>
   Bock became the liberal Green Party's first elected state
official in the nation. She is a film distributor, community
college instructor and was a translator for the renowned Japanese
film director Akira Kurosawa before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Although the race was close _ Bock won about 50 percent to 49
percent for Harris _ the victory was considerable given that the
district is 65 percent Democratic and 1.2 percent Green.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman John McGraw issued a statement
Wednesday saying Bock's narrow victory in a lightly attended
election ``is a frightening prospect for Democrats, considering
(Harris) had previously held this seat for 12 years and 65 percent
of the district's voters are registered Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement since the election, Harris blamed
his loss on low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years in politics this is the first time that I've
suffered an election loss,'' Harris said. ``But obviously, if you
accept the will of the voters when you win, you must also accept it
when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   A confluence of events helped sink Harris, even as Democrats are
celebrating victories elsewhere in California. The most prominent
problem may have been the Jerry Brown factor _ a call for change in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 51, ran Oakland during the politically and fiscally
disastrous return of the Raiders football team, and during a time
when Oakland struggled to maintain itself. While Santa Clara County
and San Francisco boomed, Oakland stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reaction to Elihu,'' said Ed Blakely, former Oakland
mayoral candidate. ``I don't think this is about Democrats in
Oakland ... I think Ms. Bock should travel lightly. From what I've
heard, she's impressive. But she still has to win over the people
of Oakland. She got her voters out; Elihu didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland activist Ces Butner said, ``I still think there is a
public outcry for change. That's one of the reasons why Jerry did
so well back in June ... Elihu represented the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris appeared to coast through his campaign, assuming he would
win the way Democrats have won here year after year. He refused to
debate Bock.
</P>
<P>
   Bock, 53, got only 8.6 percent of the vote in the Feb. 2
primary. But that was enough to get her into the runoff race
because there was no Republican running and Harris failed to get
more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He remained stagnant, and it was difficult to find even Harris
campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of people here,'' said state Sen. Don
Perata, D-Oakland, speaking from Alameda. ``They said they never
saw him. He didn't campaign here. It's almost like he was taking it
for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bock will replace Perata, who was elected to the Senate last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Where Harris was virtually invisible, the Bock campaign seized
on the momentum of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   After the primary, a group of 50 to 80 Bock volunteers decided
there would be low voter turnout, and that they possibly could win
by not making mistakes and capitalizing on Harris' apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure that they (voted for Bock) to make a statement, sort
of like they did in voting for Jerry Brown,'' said Ellen Gilmore,
of Piedmont, who voted for Harris. ``I think people want to shake
things up, and I think people voted for Bock for that reason.''

</P>
<P>
   In a traditional Democratic ploy, the state party went to
largely minority areas before the primary and distributed 3,800
chicken-dinner coupons, at $5 each, in exchange for ballot stubs.
That was enough for Harris to get 48.7 percent of the vote, but not
enough to avoid a runoff with Bock, and face heated criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That chicken-dinner thing was a big mistake,'' said Bob Marsh,
treasurer for Bock's campaign. ``I heard about it from a lot of
voters when I was out in the neighborhoods. The Democrats did a
voter campaign (flyer) trying to put fear in African-American
voters that Harris would lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Registrar of Voters Bradley Clark blasted the
stunt, saying ``paying a person to cast a vote reduces our
electoral system to Third World standards ... This is the closest
thing to legal vote-buying I have experienced in my 17-year career
in election administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurt by the chicken fiasco because it became a symbol
of the politics of the past,'' Perata said. ``To have the
Democratic Party just sort of machine-mower voters, particularly in
East Oakland, and to bribe them with chicken, it's one of the
things I think liberals were offended by.''

   Ride the ranges _ the mountain ranges, that is. The Trail Riders
of the Canadian Rockies, based in Calgary, Alberta, is a nonprofit
riding club that offers back-country experiences to a limited
number of adventurers in Banff National Park each summer. There are
nine six-day rides going out each Sunday beginning July 4, ending
with the ninth ride returning Sept. 3. Three hearty meals are
served daily in camp and on the trail, and there's a campfire
sing-along each evening. The trip also includes horse and saddle
along with tepee or tent accommodation. The cost is about $650,
including 7 percent tax, which is rebated to non-Canadian riders.

   &QR;  The great escape: Talk about getting away from it all:
Canadian Mountain Holidays offers heli-hiking vacations at remote
lodges accessed by helicopter in British Columbia. After arriving
at the lodge, guests are flown each day to a different alpine
region for a day of hiking. When hikers return, it's time to kick
back: hors d'oeuvres await in the living room by a crackling fire,
the bar is open, a massage therapist is available, as are a
whirlpool and sauna. Dinner, which may include salmon or lamb and
freshly baked bread, is served family-style. Three-, four- and
six-night trips are available June through early September from
four lodges: Adamant, Bobbie Burns, Bugaboo and the newly opened
Valemont. Prices start at about $828 including ground transfers
from Banff, all helicopter flights, meals, accommodations, guide
service, special equipment and taxes. Information: 1-800-661-0252

   &QR;  On the rocks: If your fascination with ``Titanic'' has not
waned, you might want to visit ``Iceberg Alley'' off Newfoundland.
During the five-day ``Titanic Iceberg Tour'' offered by Maxxim
Vacations, you'll find yourself in the middle of a school of
breaching whales or gliding by the largest puffin colony in North
America. And you'll drift up close to icebergs that at five stories
high dwarf the tiny excursion boats. Prime time to witness this
procession of icebergs drifting southward is May, June and July.
Prices begin at $999 per person including round-trip airfare on Air

   &QR;  Speaking of Titanic: The Manitoba Museum of the Titanic will
open April 15 at the Portage Mall in Portage la Prairie. Among the
more than 150 Titanic-related artifacts on display: a deck chair
pulled from the North Atlantic, White Star Line china and
silverware, artifacts from the rescue ship Carpathia, a table made
from Titanic wreckwood, a section of carved oak from beneath the
handrail of Titanic's first-class aft grand staircase and set
pieces and props from James Cameron's Academy Award-winning film.
The museum also offers a number of interactive displays such as
``The Dive Machine,'' which simulates looking through a
submersible's window at the Titanic debris on the bottom of the
Atlantic. There is also a reading and research area outfitted with
early 20th-century furnishings to evoke the Titanic's shipboard
reading room. 1-204-857-7447.

   One of the best ways to experience Canada's spectacular vistas
is through the window of a train or bus. Here are four ways to
enjoy the view:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Springtime in the Rockies: Rocky Mountain Railtours celebrates
the return of warmer weather and longer days to western Canada and
the Canadian Rockies with a special Spring Savings program. For all

the return of native flora and fauna to the green valleys of
western Canada. Keen-eyed visitors may catch a glimpse of bears,
elk and eagles.

<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Purchase by Wednesday to get a $310 round-trip
fare for travel through Sept. 10 on Delta (two nonstops daily) or
via connecting service on American, Northwest, USAirways, Air
Canada and Continental. Restrictions apply. United has a $150
round-trip special through May 18 for Saturday departures and
Tuesday returns only, with a seven-day advance purchase. Code:
VE7WKNB
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family attractions: The Montreal Botanical Garden, in the
eastside Maisonneuve area, boasts a collection of 21,000 plant
species spread over 30 thematic outdoor gardens and 10 connected
exhibition greenhouses (the bonsai room is a knockout). Its
five-acre Chinese Garden features seven Ming Dynasty-style
pavilions surrounding Dream Lake. The Biodome, located nearby in
the converted '76 Olympics Velodrome, re-creates the flora and
fauna of four ecosystems _ the tropical forest, ``Polar World,''
the Laurentian Forest and the St. Lawrence Marine Ecosystem. Kids
especially like the cave with 350 bats flying overhead and the
underwater fish observatory. Nearby, it's fun to ride the cable car
up the world's tallest incline tower, rising 623 feet above Olympic
Stadium (known locally as the ``Big Owe,'' for its massive unpaid
mortgage). The observation deck provides a panoramic view of the
city. Surprisingly, exhibits at the base and deck give only
fleeting attention to the Olympic story.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Museums: Montreal's museums focus on history, art,
architecture, design, the Holocaust and even comedy. A Montreal
Museum Pass allows you to visit up to 14 museums with a one-day
pass (about $11) or three-day pass, which can be used any three
days over a three-week period (about $20). Call 1-800-363-7777. An
important stop is the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, located in
facing buildings on Rue Sherbrooke _ a stately, marble
classical-style 1912 edifice and an airy modern 1991 expansion
(where ``Monet at Giverny'' runs through May 9). An underground
passageway connecting the two offers a mini-tour of world art,
including African, Asian and Greek galleries. Don't miss the strong
collection of Inuit carvings in the older building. The Museum of
Archaeology and History at
</P>
<P>
   Pointe-a-Calliere in Old Montreal stands on the very site where
the city was founded in 1642. The museum mixes high-tech
razzle-dazzle, including holographic conversations with early
settlers, with interesting remains (pottery, stone tools and
cast-iron cannon balls) unearthed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: Sophistication, selection (3,560 restaurants in the
city proper) and diversity (80 cuisines) are points of pride. With
so many neighborhood places, it's a fun city to gamble based on the
menu outside. Recommended in Old Montreal is the seafood at
Restaurant du Vieux Port, 39 Rue St. Paul East, 514-866-3175; and
the mussels at the Belgian bistro Le Petit Moulinsart, 139 Rue St.
Paul West, 514-843-7432. Specializing in the freshest Quebecois
cuisine, Toque! seems to be the trendy spot of the moment: 3842 Rue
St. Denis, 514-499-2084. Open for 44 years and going strong is Le
Paris, 1812 Rue St. Catherine West, 514-937-4898.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lodging: Myriad options, from cozy B&AMP;Bs to the classy
(Ritz-Carlton, 1228 Sherbrooke St. West, 514-842-4212), and
virtually every kind of chain in between. Modestly priced choices
include the Holiday Inn Montreal Midtown, 420 Sherbrooke St. West

 &HT;    Montreal: Spirit of a City
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ They wore bulky sweaters and clunky boots, some
clutching strollers with babies swaddled like mini Eskimos, as they
quietly lingered in front of Monet's lush landscapes at the
Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The Montrealers could be excused for
stealing extra moments to savor the gorgeous green water lilies and
cascading wisteria blossoms of the ``Monet at Giverny'' exhibit,
for outside on this late March afternoon it didn't look anything
like the French artist's famed garden.
</P>
<P>
   It was tres froid, and winter was getting old. Spring was
officially but a day away, yet everyone who lives for warm weather
in this city knew it still would be a few more weeks of enduring.
It meant a while longer before the black ice edging the streets and
the frozen sheets covering the beloved sidewalk cafes would start
trickling away, and before the burlap swathing the shrubs and trees
could be unfurled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty awful in winter,'' says Rufus Wainwright, the
Montreal singer-songwriter whose self-titled debut album made it
onto a lot of critics' Top 10 lists last year. ``Everyone really
worships spring when it comes. Its like May Day in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't picked the best time of year to make my first visit to
this French-Canadian city of 3.5 million people, actually an island
in the St. Lawrence River. In fact, ice floes were rolling down the
river, which gives Montreal its shape and, at least at sunnier
times, some of its abundant romance. The Montreal Canadiens were
wrapping up a so-so season at the Molson Center, but they could
just as well have been slapping pucks at the Montreal Botanical
Garden, considered one of the world's best when not frozen over.
Downtown's streets, while hardly abandoned, were missing the
partying throngs that soon will be back for the series of outdoor
festivals that add so much to the city's joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even appearing its worst, Montreal had plenty to
recommend it _ and to make an Atlantan more than a tad envious.
Culture and multiculturalism. A safe subway system that gets
everywhere you want to go. Beggars with shockingly good manners
(``Sir, if I may ask you seriously for some monetary assistance,''
one pitched me on the Metro). Neighborhoods that invite a healthy
walk. Historic architecture that demands a gaze. Cool restaurants,
bars and coffee joints. Open-24-hours haunts (Monsieur Falafel's
neon lights are glowing when you need that 3 a.m. Middle Eastern
fix). Endless shops and boutiques to test the favorable exchange
rate. Youthful spirit (three universities in downtown alone). New
York sophistication without the attitude. Hometown pride.
</P>
<P>
   The most tangible example of the latter is a list of ``101
Things to Love About Montreal'' that the city's daily Gazette ran
late last year. The more I rambled around during my long-weekend
visit, the more I appreciated the readers' affection:
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans finding it's so American, Americans finding it's so
European.''_ No. 95
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I never imagined I was on the Left Bank, even when I
dined at a charming little bistro named Le Paris. The St. Catherine
Street restaurant boasts its share of French dishes and wines. But
my steak entree, Bavette Sauce a l'Echalotte, seemed more
stick-to-your-ribs French-Canadian than classic French. And my
dessert, Ile Flottante (``Floating Island''), a cruise-ship-sized
portion of meringue adrift in a sea of custard cream sauce and
almonds? That may betotally French, but my host's insistence that
it was ``light'' and that I should order it struck me as sweetly
French-Canadian, a culture that has no issues with indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Montreal is the only French-speaking metropolis in North
America, and the island is even shaped like a croissant. But even
the two-thirds majority of French speakers will take mercy on an
English-speaking visitor, especially one who offers up a feeble
bonjour. And lingering conflicts over the separatist movement only
obscure the fact that Canada's second-largest city has grown
culturally diversified in recent years. Now, 15 percent of the
population claims a language other than English or French as its
mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of evidence of that at ``Simply Montreal,'' an
entertaining exhibit at the McCord Museum of Canadian History,
including a gallery of photos of residents who've married outside
their culture. ``We're part of a very cosmopolitan circle,'' reads
the text under a couple identified only as Parjo and France. ``Our
friends and acquaintances come from 121 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself agreeing with T.J. and Ken Norris, a Pennsylvania
couple who spoke of Montreal as being interestingly
``international.'' The Norrises got married here five years ago,
and returned for another week when they decided they couldn't
budget the time or money for the European vacation they'd been
considering. Nursing second cups of breakfast coffee at the
downtown B&AMP;B Les Bons Matins, they said they planned to make a
tradition of returning every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time was beautiful because we were on our honeymoon,
and this time was just as nice,'' said Ken, 43, an editor. ``Now
we'll take some French lessons to go further in conversations on
our next visit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Europeans perceiving Montreal as American, I could
understand how they could reach that conclusion if they stuck too
close to St. Catherine, the main tourist drag where the Gap, Hugo
Boss, Burger King and the Hard Rock Cafe lend an Anywhere USA feel
(even if I did like the ice painted on the Golden Arches logo). But
there are shopping districts where nobody says McDonald's _ a
highly recommended one being Rue Saint-Denis in the Plateau
Mont-Royal neighborhood. Here, homes of limestone with exterior
ironwork staircases have been converted into beckoning boutiques,
bookstores and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The first exposed skin on jampacked St. Denis Street on a
beautiful Saturday after another endless winter.'' _ No. 40
</P>
<P>
   Montrealers, rather hotblooded for people who wear heavy winter
coats almost half the year, are not shy in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In June, more than 200,000 revelers per night will attend the
nine-night international musical fireworks competition over the St.
Lawrence. Forty-five thousand will participate in June's Tour de
l'Ile de Montreal, a 70K bicycle race. The Festival International
de Jazz de Montreal, which annually draws more than 1.5 million,
will present 400 concerts in July _ one of the 11 days of
</P>
<P>
   age to Louisiana's French-Canadian musical roots. Also in July,
comics and other performers from 14 countries will play more than
1,300 shows in the Just for Laughs Festival.
</P>
<P>
   While the warm weather lasts there are also festivals of dragon
boats, kites, beer tasting, gay and lesbian pride, world beat
music, French music, classical music, world film, hot-air balloons
and dance, as well as a speedboat regatta, and a new Cirque du
Soleil spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, John Archambault, said he can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel that you have to get out in it because it's part of
the life of the city,'' said the 41-year-old pharmaceutical
equipment technician. ``If you're at
</P>
<P>
   home, you wonder, `Why am I sitting here?' You want to be out in
the streets.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner,
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino) 94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohammad Amir
</P>
<P>
   Naji, Mir Farrokh Hashemian,
</P>
<P>
   Bahare Seddiqi.
</P>
<P>
   You can go see this movie intent on divining all sorts of hidden
messages in its tale of abject poverty, scary authority figures and
other aspects of Iranian life. But then you'd miss seeing a
simpler, much more delightful story about two little kids and their
quest for one pair of shoes. The ending is by turns touching,
heartbreaking and hilarious. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 27 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corruptor'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chow Yun-Fat
</P>
<P>
   and Mark Wahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg play Chinatown cops forging an
uneasy truce in this violent, densely plotted action flick. Fueled
with betrayals and gunfire, it's the closest thing yet to Chow's
Hong King collaborations with John Woo. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when your son turns up living two blocks away with
a man who has no idea his then-unbalanced, now-deceased wife
kidnapped him years ago? Well, in this movie you become Michelle
Pfeiffer and self-absorb your way to family bliss. They should post
a warning: the deep end of this ocean is filled with melodrama.
(Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour and 45 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's 1st Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Thomas
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, Fred Newman,
</P>
<P>
   Constance Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis)1 hour, 17 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity, sex-related
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM)

<P>
   2 hours, 3 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' R (strong perverse sexuality, violence,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new example of Morbidity Chic from the screenwriter of
``Seven.'' Nicolas Cage plays a private investigator pursuing the
possible death of a girl in a snuff flick. It's an unpleasant crawl
through the world of porn; you can tell the filmmakers think it's a
troubling exploration of moral ambiguity, but it's an exploitation
flick tricked out as art. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. (ERG) 2 hours,
4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated, but includes sexual themes and
brief nudity
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen
</P>
<P>
   and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957.
Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen, he's an isolated,
forgotten recluse who becomes interested in the hunky new gardener
(Brendan Fraser). (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I'' G
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Miranda Richardson and Martin Vidnovic.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first animated feature based on a work by Rodgers
and Hammerstein, but does this second-rate animated King of Siam
really need to high-five the paw of his pet black leopard? This
king has a hot-air balloon to fly around in and to swoop into
action when somebody's about to drown. Kids will probably be
charmed. For everybody else, it's a puzzlement. (Bob Longino) 1
hour and 26 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscars, including best actor. An Italian Jew shields his
son from the horrors of a concentration camp by pretending their
predicament is part of a big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. Subtitles. (ERG) 2 hours, 2 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy
Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and violence, but one
thing is clear: everyone involved had a fine time making this
movie. You'll have fun watching it. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne,
</P>
<P>
   Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic
book fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence
with stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns
its explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' R (profanity, violence, nudity, sexual
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look that matters. Not the plot involving drugs,
murder, good guys turned bad and a car wash. This ``Mod Squad'' _
with Claire Danes, Omar Epps and an occasionally inspired Giovanni
Ribisi _ is a fashion layout for ``Details'' magazine. All image.
All blurry visuals. All reds and blacks. All jazz riffs and retro
TV music with plenty of bongo drums and brass.
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour and 34 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels
</P>
<P>
   and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK
baby-sitter. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM)1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn and John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark
(Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to
redefine their lives now that the children are grown. They land in
New York and high jinks ensue. The only time the film hints at the
madcap success it could be is when John Cleese appears as the
secretly cross-dressing hotel manager.
</P>
<P>
   (Drew Jubera) 1 hour, 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' R (violence, gore, sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Bergl
</P>
<P>
   and Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Bergl plays a misunderstood, telekinetic teenager in this
cheap, dull horror flick. The sort-of sequel is so bad, you might
mistake it for self-parody. Amy Irving also stars as the first
film's survivor, but skulks through her scenes looking like she's
ready to kill her agent. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The School of Flesh'' R (profanity and strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Isabel Huppert and
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   A smart, cool-hot drama of sexual obsession. Isabel Huppert, the
grand sphinx of French cinema, plays Dominique, a wealthy, single
Parisian whose life changes when she steps into a bar one night and
locks eyes with a hustler. It is smartly edited, trusting us to
keep up with it, never delivering a scene that feels contrived. In
French with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour and 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love''R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscars, including best picture. Poor, overworked Will
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play ``Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand of
noblewoman Viola
</P>
<P>
   (Gwyneth Paltrow, who received an Oscar for best actress) in
this witty comedy that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot
devices. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing mothers _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). (ERG) At area
discount theaters. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Miguel Angel Sola, Mia Maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Sola plays Mario, a Buenos Aires
filmmaker-choreography shooting the definitive film about the
tango. As he falls for young dancer Elena (Mia Maestro), we wait
for inevitable retribution from her gangster lover. The plot is
almost secondary to the self-conscious but gorgeous theatricality
of the film's design, the steamy elegance of its dance numbers.
Subtitles. (SM) 1 hour and 55 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You'' PG-13 (sex-related dialogue,
alcohol/drug-related scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Stiles,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has
a few nutty touches of its own. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood
</P>
<P>
   and Isaiah Washington, James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Producer-director-star Clint Eastwood plays a hard-boiled
newspaper reporter trying to prove a death-row inmate's innocence.
It's so full of
</P>
<P>
   cliches, you'd think it was a self-parody. (SM) 2 hours, 7
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' R (sexual situations and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Lane,
</P>
<P>
   Liev Schreiber, Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts as a fondly observed look at upstate New York's
Jewish family resorts. But when housewife Pearl (Diane Lane) gets
an itch once her husband goes back to the city, her actions seem
both dumb and selfish. By the time she's making picturesque whoopee
under a waterfall with her lover, the movie has veered from
well-observed 1960s character study into silly soap opera. (SM) 1
hour, 46 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Mathew Lillard and Saffron Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   It's one loopy space lark, with pretty boy Freddie Prinze Jr.
and ``Scream's'' wonderfully woozy killer Matthew Lillard playing
fighter pilots in a galaxy at war. Earth is threatened by a
lumbering band of catlike creatures wrapped in armadillo armor. It
takes eons for ``Wing,'' based on the popular computer game, to get
to the first big dogfight. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 53 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Phil Kloer) 41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Remake uncertain of its destination
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news is that, at 91 minutes, this swiftly passing
remake of 1970's ``The Out-of-Towners'' is not a minute longer than
it needs to be. The bad news is that it was remade at all. It takes
the terrifically flawed original, starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy
Dennis, rubs out whatever was terrific and hatches all-new flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. The Marc Lawrence screenplay is
based on the Neil Simon original, but it feels staler the second it
starts to unreel. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark (Goldie
Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to redefine their
lives now that the children are grown. She wants to ``suck the
marrow out of life.'' He wants to ``catch up on my reading.'' But
their lives are jolted when Henry is fired from his advertising job
and lands an interview with an agency in New York.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, high jinks ensue: Plane to New York gets
routed to Boston, luggage is lost, money is stolen, hotel
reservation is forfeited. There's supposed to be weight to what's
madcap here. The calamaties are supposed to escalate and
accumulate, with New York representing all that is hard and scary
and unknown. By the end, you should feel both exhausted and
victorious. We beat this town!
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon was almost too determined to survive it all in the
original. He was the Everyman husband who was going to get where he
was going no matter what, never asking directions and always taking
down names. While it doesn't stand up so well today _ presumably
that's why we have this remake _ the 1970 version managed to
capture the oddly shifting angst of its time.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real danger or challenge in this remake's New York;
it's just a big stage for one obvious gag after another. Nothing
accumulates: We never feel exhausted. Even after jumping from a
speeding taxi, Henry's tie is still perfectly knotted.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Hawn try furiously to generate chemistry. Alas, in
vain _ though there is a certain chuckleheaded charm to their
unrelenting jokiness. Hawn doesn't know what she wants to do, but
you get the feeling that what she'd really like is to play the
whole thing with her eyes crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is a bigger disappointment. He just bides his time,
hoping you don't notice. He masks his disinterest with the flailing
arms and elastic facial gestures of a silent film star. Better
there wasn't any sound at all; he recites dialogue like a line
reader feeding words to a momentarily forgetful actor.
</P>
<P>
   The only time the film hints at the madcap success it could be
is when John Cleese appears as the secretly cross-dressing hotel
manager. Evil, petty and awful, he's ridiculous the way this movie
should be ridiculous, with a kind of over-the-top believability
that requires that you mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Cleese, you realize that they remade the wrong movie:
He'd be the perfect lead in the remake of ``The Cable Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese. Directed by
Sam Weisman. Rated PG-13. 1 hour, 31 minutes.

   MONTREAL: the streets.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Boasting to friends elsewhere that Montreal has the world's
highest proportion of good-looking people.'' _ No. 13
</P>
<P>
   ``Montreal has very cute French boys,'' says Rufus Wainwright,
adding almost as an afterthought, ``and very pretty girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to question the judgment on males of the
openly gay Wainwright. But the women . . . sexy enough to cause the
first-time visitor to lose focus and wander into oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I wondered was how they could walk in platform
shoes taller than anything Elton John wore in his wild days _ and
if it's a fashion trend or a practical way to avoid the slush and
ice. Oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Having the chutzpah to call a 250-meter mountain a
mountain.'' _ No. 50
</P>
<P>
   Mont-Royal, known simply as ``The Mountain'' among natives, is
really more of a hill, but it's considered rude to bring this up.
Instead, climb the 767-foot outcropping, via the winding steps off
Rue Peel (near McGill University).
</P>
<P>
   It will deliver you to Mont-Royal Park, designed in the 1870s by
Frederick Law Olmsted as a gathering space whose popularity
endures. The park was quiet the weekday I visited, though I was
assured that tobogganing kids would be tearing up the ice and snow
that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, you can get an outstanding southeastern view of
the St. Lawrence as it rolls past Old Montreal (the cobblestoned
17th-century historic district) and the port area. There's a reason
you feel you're looking down on creation: City law prohibits any
structure from being taller than the mountain. The tallest, a
51-story downtown office tower, is a mere three feet shorter.
Another worthy stop on the mountain is the majestic St. Joseph's
Oratory, topped by the world's second-largest dome, which attracts
more than 2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Coming back to Montreal after doing the career thing in
Toronto and realizing it wasn't worth it.'' _ No. 83
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens who don't have a clue what's happening in other parts
of Canada because, after all, who cares?'' _ No. 84
</P>
<P>
   It's the Canadian version of the healthy loathing between San
Francisco and Los Angeles. Montrealers consider people from
Toronto, Canada's banking center, ``more interested in money,''
said Gilles O. Bengle, a Montreal tourism bureau director. ``Here,
we're more interested in the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would Torontonians say about Montrealers?
</P>
<P>
   ``They would consider us too frivolous,'' Bengle said with a
hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Lucien Gobeil, who sells his hand-tinted photographs of the city
from a Place Jacques-Cartier sidewalk in Old Montreal, needs no
persuasion about the quality of life here. He came from the Quebec
countryside to attend three years of school and has stayed for
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a frigid breeze blew up from the river one night around dusk,
Gobeil, 52, explained why he's the only vendor who will set up shop
in Old Montreal on winter weekends. ``This place is alive with
people, so I think its important for (a vendor) to be here if they
need directions or want to know about restaurants. I don't ask
money for that. I think that's giving back to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   His sidewalk gallery includes handsome images of Old Montreal
street lights and Plateau Mont-Royal staircases dripping with
icicles. When I complimented him for finding the beauty in the
severe weather, he explained, ``We have six months of winter, so I
have to represent that.'' Then he added, ``And when people see a
cold picture in the summer, they like it. It's refreshing!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Tourtiere, sushi, pakoras, paella, nasi goreng, pierogis,
souvlaki, ris de veau, hush puppies, pad thai, manicotti, couscous,
smoked meat, baba ghanouj, dim sum, calamari, profiteroles and Key
lime pie.'' _ No. 79
</P>
<P>
   I came, I saw, I noshed. Maybe it was those nights when the
temperature dropped into the high teens, but the appetite really
revved. If someone had offered me a midnight snack of marinaded
whale blubber, I probably would've demanded seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, I devoured several meaty dishes I'd never touch back
home. At the art deco Atwater Market, I feasted at a bakery-cafe
called Premiere Moisson. Passing up the cheesecakes with their
fruit toppings arranged just so _ it was breakfast, mind you _ I
settled on a huge buttered baguette smeared with cretons (a pork
terrine cooked with onions in lard, which sounds horrible but was
yummy) and a tureen-sized serving of cafe au lait. But I had to
draw the line when offered a sample of caribou pate, one of more
than 20 available. I like 'em better on four legs, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner at the Fromagerie, which carries more than 450
cheeses, Gilles Jourdenais tempted me with samples of the latest
flavors from rural Quebec, including the mild semi-soft Sieur
Corbeau des Laurentides. I could have stuck around all day, but the
place was so powerfully pungent I was afraid they'd be wrapping me
in pretty foil before long.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite food experience came at Schwartz's, a
hole-in-the-wall Jewish deli legendary for smoked brisket that's
much like pastrami. As I waited in line for a seat at the counter,
I had to laugh at the waiters _ crustier than any rye _ as they
bantered. ``Tell your customers good night!'' one ordered another,
as the queue stretched out into the sidewalk. Yet another answered
a customer, ``No, we don't have soup. They haven't invented smoked
meat soup yet!''
</P>
<P>
   Even my ``small plate'' of the house specialty _ as rich, smoky
and satisfying as advertised _ turned out to be massively oversize,
as did the juice-squirting monster dill.
</P>
<P>
   So you could imagine my horror when a college-aged Asian guy
sitting on the stool next to me reported to our server, Bobby, that
he thought the meat could've been spicier. I half expected Bobby to
whack the kid over the head with a steaming brisket, since there
were a dozen sitting right there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bobby said with almost fatherly concern, ``Yeah, it's a
little red tonight for some reason. Every night it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   And as I was paying my bill at the register a few minutes later,
I caught him out of the corner of my eye slicing off a brisket end
piece and chomping down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Quality control, I assumed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A church on every corner and a pub on every block.'' _ No.
29
</P>
<P>
   Party-hearty reputation aside, Montreal was, after all, founded
by French missionaries intent on converting native Indians to
Christianity in 1642, and spirituality remains at the center of
many residents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   I had read that the Basilique Notre-Dame in Old Montreal was
perhaps the essential stop for visitors, but nothing quite prepared
me for the immense beauty behind the Gothic Revival facade that
dates to the 1820s. It's one of the biggest Roman Catholic churches
in North America (capacity of the main sanctuary and two balconies:
3,500), and no surface is left undecorated. Save for the
jewel-toned stained glass that depict episodes in Montreal's
history, it's made entirely of wood, either gilded or painted in
rich blues and burgundies. The frescoes rising over the baptistery
(angels at the very top) make you want to stare and stare. The
organ, with its 6,772 pipes, is an instrument of power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the basilica's ornateness, what touched me when I
attended one of the four Sunday Masses was an intimate moment at
the end of the service. The priest, in the words of a guide who
translated for me later, instructed the congregants ``to give peace
to each other.'' Everyone smiled and shook hands with their
neighbors, and mothers hugged their little ones close.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, I strolled back onto the plaza, buttoning
my coat against the chill wind blowing up from the St. Lawrence.
The basilica's bell towers began pealing with joyous pandemonium,
calling even more pilgrims to pray. I listened for a while, until
there was only one bell ringing . . . and finally none. The church
doors shut and there was, for a moment, absolute silence. That's
when I noticed the sun, bathing the sidewalk with welcoming warmth.

 &HT;    Puckish pupils have cross-cultural fun

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Thirty-eight eighth-grade French students from
Northwood Middle School in Taylors, S.C., a Greenville suburb, got
a crash course in French-Canadian culture on a recent three-night
visit to Montreal and Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 24 hours in Montreal, they managed to take in a
Canadiens hockey game (non-sports fans went to a laser-tag
attraction instead), visit the St. Joseph's Oratory, Basilique
Notre-Dame and Place Jacques-Cartier, ride to the top of the
Incline Tower over the Olympic Stadium and go shopping in the
underground mall. Oh, they also dined and slept a few winks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting for the kids to see business go on and life
conducted in a foreign language,'' said teacher Martha Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The students, many devouring Burger King hamburgers and slurping
Frappucinos at Dorval airport while waiting out a delay on their
return flight, shared their favorite Montreal things:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chris Williams, 14: ``I liked how the people talked. I said
bonjour and asked how they were doing. They replied, but the
conversation kinda ended there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lyle Parks, 13: ``The carvings at the (Notre-Dame) cathedral
were pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amy Harrison, 13: ``The snow, because we only get this much
(she holds two fingers a half-inch apart) in Greenville.'' Her only
complaint: ``Most of the people were nice, but I asked some of them
if they spoke English, and they'd say no even though they were
listening to American music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lisa Durham, 14: ``At the hockey game, everyone was screaming
(for the Canadiens). My friend and I decided to yell for Nashville
_ we were going for the Americans. And the fans around us would
scream even louder for Montreal. It was so much fun, but when
Nashville scored, the scoreboard flashed `Lucky Shot!' ''

 &HT;    Good gig: Wainwright is singing the praises of a colorful
metropolis
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Rufus Wainwright, who has lived in Montreal for 23 of
his 26 years, released a self-titled debut album last year that is
every bit as eclectic and sophisticated as his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montreal is a hands-on city where if you want to do something,
you do it _ not for the money or to be a part of a scene,'' says
the son of fellow singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate
McGarrigle. ``I used to do shows and invite people down. The only
requirement was that everything has to be very cheap, because a lot
of people are broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those early gigs were at Cafe Sarajevo, a club run by
and frequented by Eastern European emigres. While he's mostly on
the road these days, Wainwright enjoyed talking up some of his
other favorite Montreal haunts:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Places to see music: ``The Cabaret Music Hall. They have tons
of different shows. It's a really nice room. There's also the
Spectrum, where the big acts come through. And probably the most
famous thing is the Jazz Festival, where I've seen performers like
Henry Mancini and Nina Simone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dance clubs: ``There's a gay club, Unity, and another club
called Sky. Montreal has an interesting gay scene _ very risque. A
lot of people come up from New York to let loose.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coffee shops: ``Tons of them. Cinema Parallele is a coffee
place with a cinema in back. (The coffee shop recently moved a
block away to the new Ex-Centris Cinema Complex.) And Bistro 4 has
some shows _ poetry and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Breakfast: ``Dusty's. It's your standard grille, your sloppy
eggs and bacon. A couple of more high-end places: Eggspectations, a
chain but actually really good, and the Crepe Breton, which, as you
might guess, specializes in crepes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dinner: ``L'Express, which is French. And the Whitloff, which
is Belgian.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  People-watching: ``Mont-Royal Park on Sunday. (In warm
weather) they have `Tam-tam,' an event where people play drums for
hours.''

 &HT;    A doctor poet muses on living's debt to the dead
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.

   &QR;  Where Water Begins. By John Stone. Louisiana State University
Press. $12.95 paperback. 88 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, medical students at Emory University pay solemn
respects to those who have given their bodies to science.
Posthumous volunteers, theirs are the cadavers that anatomy
students live with _ so to speak _ in most intimate ways. Organs
can be held in the hand, parts without a purpose, and examined
minutely. The body's interior can be seen in all its intricacy,
from the wiring to the plumbing. No privilege, surely, is greater
than to open the chest cavity and to behold there the heart that
pumped blood from first breath to last, and now rests.
</P>
<P>
   The students call their commemoration a Service of Reflection
and Gratitude, and about 10 years ago they asked John Stone,
cardiologist by training, poet by nature, to write a few lines for
the occasion. ``It's hard to write a commissioned poem,'' Stone was
saying the other day. ``You can't be sure it's going to be worth a
damn.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem, collected in Stone's newest book, ``Where Water
Begins,'' is titled ``Elegy and Affirmation.'' The words, looking
both backward and forward, compress much into a short space, like
the poem itself:
</P>
<P>
   Together we are grateful, for we know
</P>
<P>
   the privilege it is to touch another,
</P>
<P>
   whether in the name of science or love.
</P>
<P>
   The touching here has been made up of both.
</P>
<P>
   By their extraordinary gifts
</P>
<P>
   these dead have taught the living how to touch.
</P>
<P>
   Through them we touch the body of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The poem is written in five-beat lines, a form used by
Shakespeare, and Stone hears ``extraordinary'' as two words. Poetry
works by the associations the ear will make, not all of them
immediate. Stone's many admirers know that one of his abiding
themes since the death of his wife, Lu, in 1991, has been the sense
of permanent loss. ``Death is one of the great preoccupations of
the poet,'' he says. But read his work closely and you will also
find a celebration of life _ of life quietly, often humorously
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   A friend had to point out for me the full extent of this. In a
poem titled ``Big Creek'' Stone writes the simple line, ``She will
not be coming back,'' which could be read as resignation, as
unwilling acceptance, even as despair. And then, in the next
stanza, he writes, ``We are of this world / and not of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In my friend's words, ``He makes a very clear distinction
between life and death, and it is our responsibility to live'' _ to
remember, and yet to carry on. For writers, and not just poets,
certain rhythms and tonalities register on the ear. A note is
struck just so and the ear scrambles to make a connection.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Elegy and Affirmation,'' Stone writes as usual in a minor
key. Musicians know there are things that can be better said in the
minor keys, not just night thoughts but intimations of the numinous
and the sublime. Without forced sentiment, Stone expresses in
``Elegy and Affirmation'' a gravity at once personal and
collective. ``These dead have taught the living'' _ the words are
deceptively simple, but they call up other words written once to
suit an occasion. (``A few appropriate remarks,'' the invitation
suggested, the greater interest being on a keynote address that
would last three hours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work. . . .'' We commemorate, that is, ``those who gave
the last full measure of devotion'' so that we might know our own
purposes better.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was, of course, different. But at Gettysburg the
most poetic of our presidents spoke less of the dead than of the
living, and did so in a language whose plainness is only apparent.
We owe the past not just homage but, even more, dedication anew.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who has taught at Emory's medical school since 1968,
affirms even as he remembers. He writes of common experience _ a
trip to the mountains with a pair of friends (``two Jacks and a
Jill''), gunning a car up a gravel incline, water gurgling from a
cabin's kitchen tap, pulling on ``clean socks and last night's
jeans'' _ because it is the experience of the living. If the deeper
part of that experience is love and loss, its hard ground is that
we lived them fully.

 &HT;    Getting an education about sex and power
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Book smarts can't help you graduate from ``The School of
Flesh.'' In this cool-hot French drama of sexual obsession, based
on a Yukio Mishima novel, Isabelle Huppert plays Dominique, a
wealthy, single Parisian whose life changes when she steps into a
bar one night and locks eyes with a hustler named Quentin (Vincent
Martinez).
</P>
<P>
   He services male and female customers, but as the frumpy
transvestite bar owner Chris (Vincent Lindon) tells Dominique,
Quentin likes women better. ``Paying can be fun,'' Chris assures
her. ``You can always swap roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique and Quentin do, many times, in a dance that becomes as
much about power as sex. When Dominique invites Quentin to live
with her, a friend kiddingly calls her a sugar daddy. But Dominique
loses the upper hand, developing an infatuation that reduces her to
helpless, raging tears. Quentin happily exploits her weakness, like
the spoiled kid he is.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin is an erotic vortex around which many people spin,
including an older male attorney who warns Dominique to ``count the
silver,'' and Chris, whose loyalty slowly shifts from the hustler
to the older woman. The cast also includes Marthe Keller as a
wealthy acquaintance of Dominique's, who plays a role instrumental
in Quentin's final, spectacular but somehow inevitable act of
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Benoit Jacquot (``A Single Girl''), ``School'' is
smartly edited, trusting us to keep up with it, never delivering a
scene that feels contrived or cliched. The movie's tone is the
epitome of French sophistication, refusing to be scandalized by
sexuality but never underestimating its irrational power.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert, that grand sphinx of French cinema, has sometimes
seemed too aloof in her films _ a radiant but chilly center. Here
her poise works beautifully as she plays a woman secure enough to
venture into dangerous new territory, but whose wealth and wisdom
can't help a bit when passion infects her.
</P>
<P>
   With his off-kilter looks and rude smile, Martinez makes an
object of desire who's as engaging as he is infuriating. To the
film's credit, the character is as complex as Dominique's, capable
of ridiculous jealous fits one moment and cruel calculations the
next. ``The School of Flesh'' reminds us that, in matters of the
heart (or the groin at least), growing up can be a process that
lasts a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The School of Flesh''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Isabelle Huppert and Vincent Martinez. Rated R for
language and strong sexuality. In French with subtitles. 1 hour, 41
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A smart, cool-hot drama of sexual obsession.

FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a painful, crippling disease, Eva Amey of
Elmira, N.Y. got herself off welfare more than a year ago and has
become a teacher's aide working with handicapped high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   Amey, 32, earns $5,756 a year and lives with her three children
and second husband, a local highway department worker, in a
two-room apartment. Her medical bills often run $500 and sometimes
$1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The bills weren't a problem as long as she remained on Medicaid,
the joint state-federal that serves 36 million low-income people.
Federal law permitted Medicaid recipients leaving welfare for work
to keep the benefit for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But a paperwork snafu ended her Medicaid coverage last October.
By the time Amey got a lawyer and appealed, she found out her
year's worth of Medicaid had expired. Limited medical insurance
through her school-aide position would hardly make a dent in her
costs. With the salary of her husband, a temporary worker with no
health insurance, and child support from her first husband, Amey's
family of five has $22,491 a year to live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cutting down on my medications,'' she says, adding that
she takes pills for her fibromyalgia, a muscle and
connective-tissue disorder, ``only when I can't stand the pain
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make a choice between seeing the doctor and
eating. If I get sick, it's `OK, do I go to the doctor or pay the
bills? Eighty dollars to see the doctor _ to me, that's the
groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care advocates fear there are many more people like Amey.
They say tens of thousands of ex-welfare recipients now in the work
force are poised to join the ranks of the 43.4 million Americans
who have no health insurance whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unintended consequence of welfare reform is that a large
number of low-income people (who go from welfare to work) are being
rewarded by losing their health care coverage,'' says Ron Pollack,
executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that
concentrates on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people moving into jobs wind up in
entry-level positions with low wages and few benefits,'' Pollack
adds. ``The majority of those receive no heath insurance. So when
they lose Medicaid, they lose coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Families USA is conducting a survey of working former welfare
recipients who have lost Medicaid, and Pollack says the number will
be at least in the tens of thousands and maybe higher.
</P>
<P>
   Amey's situation is a measure of the rough headwinds that former
welfare recipients encounter when they leave the rolls. With
prodding from the states that were undertaking their own
experiments, Congress enacted a welfare overhaul in 1996. The law
limited recipients to two years of public assistance at any one
time and five years over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and congressional Republicans have hailed the
sharp declines in the welfare rolls _ 7.9 million people are now on
welfare; in 1993 the number was 14.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But health care advocates argue that the vulnerability of these
new workers and their families often is overlooked in the rush of
headlines celebrating the success of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers that people with low wages face in trying to cope
with everyday living _ whether (paying for) childcare, health
insurance or basic transportation _ are just amazing,'' says Diana
Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid
and the Uninsured, which tracks low-income people's access to
health care..MDRV/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Health-plan coverage for the poor is ``where our system of
employer-based coverage is eroding, and public policy is not
filling the gap,'' Rowland says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
Washington-based advocacy group, 15.8 million working parents have
incomes at or below $27,300 a year, which is twice the
government-set poverty level for a family of three. Of those, more
than a third _ 5.4 million _ were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the federal government is getting the word out that
time-limited Medicaid is, in fact, available to those leaving
welfare for work. Before the 1996 law, Medicaid coverage came
automatically with welfare. But the law separated the two programs,
leaving many recipients entering the job market with the belief
that Medicaid no longer was available.
</P>
<P>
   Many state and local welfare agencies did little to inform
recipients that they still qualified for Medicaid. So last month
the U.S. Health and Human Services Department sent a letter to
state and local administrators, encouraging them to disseminate and
process Medicaid applications without delay.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal initiative, the Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), approved by Congress as part of the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act, offers states money to expand Medicaid for poor
children or to create a separate health program for them.
</P>
<P>
   And some states have found creative ways to extend Medicaid
coverage. Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and South Carolina have
received federal waivers to give welfare-to-work families an extra
year on Medicaid. Vermont has authority to offer an extra year
above that _ a total of three years _ for some families.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Eva Amey and thousands more like her continue to
fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Yacknin, a lawyer with the Greater Upstate Law Project in
Rochester, N.Y. who has represented Amey, is lobbying the New York
legislature for a new program called Family Health Plus, which
would use the state's estimated $1-billion-a-year-for-25-years
share of tobacco-lawsuit settlement money to extend health
insurance to low-income, working adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are scrimping on food,'' Yachnin says. ``They're
in a worse position than when they were on welfare.''

 &HT;    Tour guides: Two reporters' views of the game of golf and its
masterly practitioners
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other reporters are often jealous of columnist/author John
Feinstein (``A March to Madness,'' ``A Season on the Brink'') when
they see him at golf tournaments. Does he really work for a living
when he isn't counting how many chairs Bobby Knight tosses in a
season? When are we going to see him open a laptop and start typing
something?
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we know what Feinstein was doing in 1998. He spent the
year catching the main characters of golf in their most
entertaining, enlightening moments during the major championships.
Feinstein's ``The Majors'' is a wonderful follow-up to his
best-selling ``A Good Walk Spoiled.'' It's not often that you get
to feel as though you're eavesdropping on history.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia golf fans who believe the Masters Tournament is the
center of the universe, ``The Majors'' is a great way to get ready
for Augusta's azaleas and annual Sunday agony on the back nine.
Feinstein describes last year's drama with such detail, you can
almost feel the energy rushing through winner Mark O'Meara and
leaving the disappointed David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Though Feinstein can't break his habit of tweaking his most
loathed sports agency, the International Management Group, and its
relationship with Tiger Woods every once in a while, who cares?
Nobody likes IMG, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Good Walk Spoiled,'' Feinstein focused on lesser-known
characters such as Paul Goydos and Brian Henninger. ``The Majors''
looks at more familiar players _ specifically Duval and Fred
Couples _ and also brings us closer to tour players, including Brad
Faxon, Jim Furyk, Scott McCarron and Jay Haas.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't appreciate Duval's penchant for privacy, as he
hides behind his Oakley sunglasses, should understand the situation
a bit better after Feinstein's look at the former Georgia Tech
player, who lost a three-stroke lead on the back nine at Augusta
last year. Duval's turbulent childhood _ a brother died of a blood
disease after David was an unsuccessful bone marrow donor; his
parents fought constantly on their way to a divorce _ helped shape
his semi-loner personality. Duval sought shelter from the turmoil
on the golf course and to this day still gets great enjoyment from
playing alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some things revealed in the book that haven't been highly
publicized:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Duval was dropped by IMG agent Hughes Norton when Woods came
along. In the long run, it was a break for Duval. And Norton was
recently fired by Woods, and by Greg Norman before him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Duval was up to 226 pounds before he started losing weight in
1996.

   &QR;  In 1993, Duval missed getting his PGA Tour card by about
$2,000 because at the last minute the purse for the Nike Tour
Championship, which he won, was decreased from $250,000 to
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Justin Leonard's caddie, Bob Riefke, detailed his conversation
with Matt Kuchar's father/caddie, Peter, when paired with them
again at the U.S. Open following a distracting round at the
Masters. Not surprisingly, Peter Kuchar, after being told the
specific five or six occasions where Leonard was distracted,
basically acted as though Riefke was imagining it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the tour Couples is pretty much branded as an airhead _ and
sometimes does and says thing to justify the label _ but through
Feinstein's observations he comes off with a lot more substance.
Especially evident is Couples' character regarding his relationship
with his wife, Thais, during her battle with breast cancer. To read
Feinstein's account, you realize that while there certainly are
better intellectuals on the PGA Tour, there probably is no better
human being.
</P>
<P>
   David Owen's ``The Making of the Masters,'' which is subtitled
``Clifford Roberts, Augusta National and Golf's Most Prestigious
Golf Tournament,'' seems more concerned with offering
counterattacks on other Masters books than with establishing its
own identity. Despite that mind-set, Owen, a staff writer for The
New Yorker and a contributing editor to Golf Digest, uncovers some
interesting anecdotes and some new information.
</P>
<P>
   He reports that Augusta National's par three course, the
experimental area for the bent grass transformation that eventually
occurred on the big course greens in 1980, has a new strain of
Bermuda grass on some greens that might be implemented eventually
for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Owen contradicts author Curt Sampson's claim in his book, ``The
Masters,'' that Augusta National changed its rules, no longer
inviting the Canadian Open champion after black golfer Charlie
Sifford, an American, won it in 1962. Owen contended that Augusta
National at the time merely ``had a policy of inviting Canadian
winners of the Canadian Open'' and reminded that it wasn't until
1972 that the eligibility requirements were changed to invite all
winners of PGA Tour-sanctioned events.
</P>
<P>
   A humorous incident is presented that emphasizes how the late
Clifford Roberts, as Augusta National chairman, didn't let the
rules slide for anyone. He noticed Charlie Yates, a longtime
member, walking through the clubhouse one day in shorts and asked
him what he had planned for the day. When Yates said he was playing
golf, Roberts asked, ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   When Yates returned from the locker room, he was wearing long
pants.

THE ARTS AREN'T JUST FOR THE RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The thing that really got me was when Alma
Robinson said, ``I was thinking about this. It's time for the arts
to give something back. What do we do for poor people?''
</P>
<P>
   Usually we think of arts organizations as beggars holding out
tin cups for funding. Robinson, executive director of California
Lawyers for the Arts (CLA), a group that provides legal services
for artists, has a different view of the arts in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``One out of 11 jobs in San Francisco is in the arts, whether
it's corporate or nonprofit, advertising or fashion design,
multimedia or graphic design,'' she says. ``The arts are a
multimillion-dollar industry.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does a socially responsible industry do? One thing it
can do is provide apprenticeships, jobs, education and support to
people coming off welfare, and that's just what the CLA's Arts
Industry Employment Initiative will do.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, people will have a chance to get off welfare and work
behind the scenes in theater, opera, music and museums _ in costume
departments, front offices, computer work, whatever there is.
Welfare recipients aren't so different from you and me. They want
interesting jobs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when I first met Robinson and her associates, the
thing that intrigued me was they were designing a welfare-to-work
program that treated the poor with respect _ as people with talents
for more than pushing a broom and interests in arts beyond the art
of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, people pooh-poohed this and said `They
wouldn't be interested in the arts.' That isn't the case,'' said
Robinson, who has 18 years experience at CLA, a Stanford University
law degree and a background writing for the defunct Washington Star
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Her reporter instincts show. She didn't assume anything about
welfare recipients. She surveyed dozens of them about their
talents, experiences and interests in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found a man with 18 years experience as a professional
musician. We're looking for these people.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't need that much experience. You just have to be over
21, live in San Francisco and receive Temporary Aid to Needy
Families, commonly called welfare. Recipients of General Assistance
or SSI are ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   The program developer is Nanette Hogan, a career counselor with
a master's degree in education from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find talking to clients is that they have a lot of
talents in the arts, but they're pushed into jobs they're just not
interested in,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, Hogan and the CLA have lined up an impressive array of
nonprofit arts groups to take their apprentices. You realize how
huge and diverse the arts industry is in San Francisco when you
look at the list: Intersection for the Arts, Galleria de la Raza,
the Exploratorium, the San Francisco Opera, the Bayview Opera, the
San Francisco Jazz Festival, the Wajumbe Cultural Institute, the
SOMA Art Festival, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the Mission
Cultural Center, the San Francisco Girls Chorus, the Precita Eyes
Mural Arts Center and the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
</P>
<P>
   CLA needs more corporations and private companies with
arts-related jobs to take apprentices. The city is loaded with
fashion operations, Web designers and graphic designers. So far CLA
has signed up only the architectural firm of Simon Martin-Vegue
Winkelstein Moris.
</P>
<P>
   CLA will pay 87 percent of an apprentice's salary and the
company will get an $8,000 tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   CLA has a six-year track record of training and placing
disadvantaged high school kids in arts apprenticeships and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like CLA are not rich, and giving back to the community
costs money. Still, the cost of a three-month apprenticeship works
out to $4,750, which is cheap by job-training standards, especially
since it includes college credit courses.
</P>
<P>
   The project is supported by the Private Industry Council and the
Department of Public Services. Planning grants were provided by the
Mayor's Office of Community Development, the San Francisco
Foundation and the Institute for a Civil Society.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a Boston foundation that seeks out worthy
community development organizations to fund _ much as the MacArthur
Foundation seeks out individuals for its so-called genius grants.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes genius lies in simplicity and common sense. The best
way to get people off welfare is to help them find work they're
interested in. Then support them in it.
</P>
<P>
   Then connect the work directly to classes, so they can learn the
things they need to know. Most important, perhaps, is to give poor
people a long-term view of a job, and the kind of networks you need
to _ well _ network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's life with a future people haven't thought about,'' as
Hogan put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can find kindred spirits, people who are creative and
hours that are a little more flexible,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what many San Franciscans want. So why can't the poorest
have a shot at it?
</P>

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In this, the holiest week of the Christian year, the news is
surprisingly good and peaceful in the United States. However, the
news from around the world is increasingly horrific, such as the
Serbian atrocities in Kosovo and the catastrophe in Sudan, where
1.9 million have died.
 &HT;    This week the Dow Jones average closed over 10,000 for the first
time. Unemployment and inflation are near historic lows. The
economy is so strong, the financial solvency of Medicare is
expected to last 16 years, seven years longer than predicted only a
year ago.
 &HT;    There are other encouraging numbers. For the first time in 25
years the number of American divorces has fallen below 1 million,
dropping from 1,153,000 in 1997 to 974,000 in 1998. This is a
stunning development. One has to go back to 1974 to see a
comparable low number of divorces.
 &HT;    As far back as 1979 there were 1,179,000 divorces, and they
remained at that stratospheric level for two decades. However, in
1998 alone, they dropped by 15 percent.
 &HT;    ''Wow!'' said Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation. ''That
calls for a celebration.''
 &HT;    He noted other areas of progress: ''Teen virginity, abstinence,
and abortions all going in the right direction.'' For the first
time in 20 years, the majority of high school kids are virgins,
thanks to the Southern Baptist ''True Love Waits'' campaign in
which 2.5 million teenagers have pledged to remain chaste till
marriage.
 &HT;    Nationally, abortions are down from 1.6 million in 1990 to 1.3
million.
 &HT;    This progress is not without its dark side.
 &HT;    The number of marriages fell from 2,219,000 in 1997 to only
2,072,000 in 1998, to 8.5 per 1,000 people, the lowest rate in this
century. The reason is that cohabitation has soared 10-fold,
shooting up from 430,000 in 1960 to 4.3 million in 1998. That's
double the number who are getting married! In fact, cohabitation
has diverted 25 million Americans from getting married at all. The
number of never-married jumped from 21 million in 1970 to 46
million in 1998.
 &HT;    Of course, if there are fewer marriages, there will be fewer
divorces. But I would have expected a gradual decline, not the
abrupt, unprecedented drop of 179,000 last year alone. That is an
indication that the divorce climate is being transformed. Marriage
is becoming more esteemed. The increase of chastity by the young
and 300,000 fewer abortions is further evidence.
 &HT;    Thus, there is a resurrection of Christian ethics in American
daily life. This is good news indeed on the eve of Easter,
celebrating the resurrection of Jesus.
 &HT;    Without that event, Jesus would be unknown today. ''Although we
reckon the turning of time from B.C. to A.D. at the birth of Jesus,
the real revolution occurred when Jesus rose from the dead,'' said
Presiding Bishop H. George Anderson of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church of America in his Easter Message.
 &HT;    ''In fact, the resurrection of Jesus changed time forever. Time
no longer holds humanity captive, locking us into a few decades of
existence. Time has been pushed aside and now swings open to reveal
an eternity beyond. This is a new world we live in, full of endless
hope and promise.''
 &HT;    I doubt that any of the half million displaced Muslims of Kosovo
would agree. And who were their persecutors, the people who
separated men from their wives and children, killing many of the
men, torching homes and driving the survivors into exile? So called
''Christian'' Serbs. It made my stomach turn to see on TV the
generals leading the ethnic slaughter, pulling out crosses from
their army shirts, and kissing Orthodox priests..
 &HT;    I spoke Wednesday night with Kevin Cook, acting director of
World Vision's relief effort in Macedonia. In Kosovo, World Vision
had helped 75,000 refugees with blankets, heating stoves and even
repair of their war-damaged homes. Today those homes have probably
been torched, and World Vision has been forced to leave.
 &HT;    ''The refugee situation is growing exponentially,'' said Cook.
''There are now a few thousand an hour coming over the border, as
opposed to a few dozen an hour, days ago. There is a line of cars
15 kilometers long, trying to get out. No one is really prepared
for this. It has happened so fast.
 &HT;    ''These people are seriously traumatized. They have lost their
homes and businesses, burned to the ground, and are coming with
just the clothes on their back. Their needs are extensive.''

need.

AN OH, SO FAMILIAR FRONT PORCH VIEW OF THE DEEP SOUTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proper Southern lady knows what to do when she finds a
relative upstairs in bed with a bullet through her brain and the
pistol still dangling from her right hand. When this happens to
Camille Dixon (Glenn Close, dressed like a blend of Blanche DuBois,
Isadora Duncan and a Talbot's catalog cover) in Robert Altman's new
film, ``Cookie's Fortune,'' she simply rearranges things to make it
look like murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide,'' she says to her painfully
passive sister, Cora (Julianne Moore). ``Nobody in this family
commits suicide. Suicide is a disgrace. Only crazy people commit
suicide.'' And just to be safe, Camille actually eats the suicide
note. It's another quiet Easter weekend in Holly Springs, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things about Holly Springs seem familiar. But then I
grew up in Vincent, Ala., population 1,700 or so, where ``y'all's''
is an accepted plural possessive, supper is served during the
network news and summer starts in April. Altman, whose hometown is
the very metropolitan Kansas City, Mo., got a lot of things about
small Southern towns right, but then his screenwriter, Anne Rapp,
once lived in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   That's clear from the beginning of the film, in which the
nighttime streets of Holly Springs are silent, except for the
ceaseless chirping of crickets, and dark, except for the lights in
the windows of the red brick First Presbyterian Church, where
Camille is earnestly rehearsing the cast of the Easter play.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same way at Calvary Baptist in Vincent, and at the
town's other churches, where prayer meeting, choir practice and the
like could eat up as many nights a week as theater, work-related
events and restaurant dinners do in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The events in ``Cookie's Fortune,'' in fact, depend on an
authentic small-Southern-town tradition: traveling serving dishes.
The only reason Camille drops by the house of Jewel Mae Orcutt
(Patricia Neal), better known as Cookie, is to get ``Mother's fruit
salad bowl'' for Easter dinner.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, every pie plate and casserole dish in
town had a piece of masking tape on the bottom with the owner's
name scribbled on it. This wasn't always a matter of borrowing and
lending; people were forever taking their deviled eggs or string
beans or banana cream pie with vanilla wafers to church socials,
school functions and after-funeral meals. Only a fool would send a
good dish off without ID. And returning the dish was a good excuse
for paying an unannounced visit to the owner.
</P>
<P>
   One thing in the movie rang untrue: fanning. And the friendships
between black and white residents seemed suspiciously idealized. I
can't speak for the state of race relations back home, because I've
been away (in New York, that paragon of racial tranquillity) for
decades, but I (italics)can(end italics) speak for the state of
air-conditioning. You just don't see Southern women fanning
themselves anymore, the way Ms. Close's character does, because
contemporary Southerners live in a bubble of air-conditioned
houses, cars, stores and churches.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be different in Holly Springs, a real town of about
7,000, which sometimes seems considerably more genteel than my
hometown. Installing central air in one of the town's historic
houses (Camille and her sister live in the Yellow Fever House)
might be considered a sign of real disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close is not the only star of ``Cookie's Fortune,'' of
course, but this time Altman's use of an all-star ensemble doesn't
feel like a strained series of cameos. In a town like Holly
Springs, of course, the local catfish supplier would look like Lyle
Lovett. Of course the handsome, tough-talking police investigator
from out of town would be Courtney B. Vance. Of course the dim,
young sheriff's deputy would be Chris O'Donnell; he was probably
the guy who escorted the Homecoming Queen onto the field in high
school, too.
</P>
<P>
   Small-town Southerners take pride in being colorful. Otherwise,
they wouldn't use metaphors like ``knee-high to a grasshopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a character is very different from being crazy, however,
and ``Cookie's Fortune'' hits the nail on the head with Camille's
horror at the prospect of anyone's thinking there is insanity in
her family. My mother still refers to a great-aunt's long-ago
mental illness as the time ``when Aunt Madeline wasn't herself.''
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child, the worst insult you could deliver was to
joke that someone should be ``sent to Tuscaloosa.'' The city of
Tuscaloosa was and is the home of the main campus of the University
of Alabama, but the reference was to its neighbor Bryce Hospital,
the state psychiatric facility. New Yorkers may say that sort of
thing about Bellevue, but not with the same fervor.
</P>

   The only suicide I ever heard of in my hometown took place after
I'd gone away to college. It was one of the two local doctors, a
woman, which made it easy for everyone to distance themselves from
it. That's what happens to women who go to college and concentrate
on careers rather than on their families.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, that's what happens to people who get too big
for their britches. In big cities, sending the children to
psychiatrists can be seen as just one more way of helping them to
turn out perfect. Going into psychotherapy yourself is a
self-improvement project _ like joining a gym, learning Italian,
using a personal shopper.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude would never do in the Holly Springses of this
world. There, admitting to neurosis is admitting to
dissatisfaction, and being dissatisfied means you aspire to
something you don't have, and aspiration is considered bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   The best I can figure, this goes back about 130 years, to
Reconstruction, when only Yankees and scalawags like Rhett Butler
had money. Not having anything nice, and being proud of it, became
the norm. But I'm basing this entirely on Melanie Hamilton's
character in ``Gone With the Wind,'' so, as we say back home, don't
mind me.
</P>
<P>
   Because of anti-aspiration sentiment, being both down-to-earth
and self-deprecating is crucial in small Southern towns. That's why
in ``Cookie's Fortune'' you will see Liv Tyler as Emma Duvall, the
most beautiful girl in town, driving a pick-up truck and fishing
with the boys with a bottle of Wild Turkey in the back pocket of
her cut-offs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a plaque beside the liquor-store cash register says
``On this site in 1897 nothing happened.'' That's why Jack Palmer
(Donald Moffat), the only lawyer in Holly Springs, is pushing his
luck when during a Scrabble game he begins explaining the
Indo-European origins of the word ``awe.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may be why Cookie can get away with living in a house
with a spiral staircase and stained-glass windows. In her old age,
she runs around the house in a sloppy Mississippi State sweatshirt
and considers Willis Richland (Charles S. Dutton), a black man who
lives in her guest house, her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   People in towns like Holly Springs and Vincent make mistakes
like everybody else, of course; it's just that nobody talks about
it. Which brings us back to deception, the only way that occurs to
Camille to deal with Cookie's embarrassing demise. Camille even
thinks she can get away with lying to God. After Willis is
mistakenly arrested for Cookie's murder, she kneels beside her bed
and prays for him: ``May God rest his soul if he committed this
terrible crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lies in Holly Springs unravel near the end of the
film. A secret about one character's parentage is uncovered when
the sheriff's office is checking blood types. Another character,
who had supposedly died while doing missionary work in Africa, is
revealed to have met his end in a button-factory accident in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still dying to know what Reverend Keller's transgression was
when he was removed from the First Baptist Church back when I was
12. But we don't talk about that.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES SCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Grants totaling more than $300 million will be
awarded to 50 towns and cities this summer to help them provide
safer schools and better learning environments for students, the
Clinton administration announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, communities seeking funds must submit a plan
that includes the involvement of local school administrators, law
enforcement officials, community organizations, mental health and
medical counselors, families and students.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the problems of school violence
and underperforming students must be addressed with a
community-wide approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement alone can't do the job,'' she said at her
weekly news conference. ``But when communities work together, we
can prevent violence in all its forms before it occurs and give our
young people a safer, healthier environment in which to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the program's administrators _ who are from the
Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services _
began accepting applications Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She said awards will range up to $3 million a year for urban
school districts, up to $2 million a year for suburban schools and
up to $1 million a year for rural and tribal schools.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley said activities likely to be
funded include after-school programs, teen courts, the hiring of
security personnel, mentoring programs, anti-drug classes, home
nurse visits and alternative education, which consists of programs
tailored to problem students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building safe schools depends on building strong
communities,'' Riley said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the program, known as the Safe Schools/Healthy
Students Initiative, was conceived last October after fatal
shootings at schools in Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do all we can to prevent another tragedy from taking
the life for one of young people,'' she said.

NOT MUCH NEW IN `RELAX . . . IT'S JUST SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The independent film world seems intent on producing only two
types of stories: violent scam movies and the kind of romantic sex
comedies in which there is a perfect balance of gay, straight and
ethnic characters who hang out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax ... .It's Just Sex,'' which was shown at last year's
Seattle International Film Festival, falls into the second
category. It's a gay '90s ``Big Chill'' clone that settles into the
same category as ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' and several
other recent light-hearted gay-themed friendship films.
</P>
<P>
   Director P.J. Castellaneta, who made his film debut with
``Together Alone,'' has crafted another movie in which Los Angeles
is an equally important main character. In this smoggy realm live a
diverse group of 20-somethings who are trying to find their niche
in the big world.
</P>
<P>
   Vincey Sauris (Mitchell Anderson) is a gay playwright looking
for Mr. Right. Tara (Jennifer Tilly) is a kind of surrogate mother
to the gang and she wants to have a baby with her boyfriend, Gus
(Timothy Paul Perez). Gus is commitment-shy and he's already
reeling from the shock that his brother Javi is HIV-positive. Buzz
(T.C. Carson), a black artist who has just begun to date Vincey is
new to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's longtime lesbian couple, Megan (Serena Scott
Thomas, sister of Kristin) and Sarina (Cynda Williams), who have
just broken up because Megan's attracted to a guy named Jared
(Billy Wirth). Sarina rebounds with the needy Robin Moon (Lori
Petty), and soon everything is in chaos because the viewer can
barely keep all these characters and relationships, well, straight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film opens with a clever ``newsreel'' introduction
that playfully tweaks gay stereotypes, it also enforces them as
well. After awhile, the movie feels as desperate as the friends as
they climb in and out of bed with new potential partners and
desperately cling to the boyfriend or girlfriend they've already
managed to snag. They're afraid of love and getting close but they
can't think of anything else either.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that truly elevates ``Relax ... It's Just Sex''
out of the ordinary is a startlingly scary scene in which Vincey is
the victim of a hate crime. His rage and ultimate revenge upon one
of the thugs is a unique moment in gay cinema. It also shifts the
tone of the film and, from that point on, even extended family
doesn't feel very comforting or soothing.
</P>
<P>
   Castellaneta tries to introduce some new twists, but the film's
philosophy is finally the same old thing: we all need friends to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Relax ... It's Just Sex. Directed and written by P.J.
Castelleneta. Cast: Jennifer Tilly, Mitchell Anderson, Lori Petty,
T.C. Carson, Serena Scott Thomas. Jour de Fete Films. 106 minutes.
Unrated with sexual content, language, violence.

`UNMADE BEDS' IS SAD, BLEAK COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fascinating sad ``revisionist'' documentary is a
contradiction in terms. On one hand, it's a portrait of four lonely
people looking for love and, on the other, a rather cruel expose on
how they go about finding it.
</P>
<P>
   British filmmaker Nicholas Barker has made a ``documentary'' in
that the four people he uses are telling their real-life stories.
But he's helped them rewrite their stories to accommodate both the
screen and themselves. In short, he's directing them in screen
versions of their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's an iffy concept that sometimes strikes a nerve and, on
other occasions, feels stilted and exposes the ``actors'' as true
amateurs. Back in 1995, Barker hired a crew to scout the New York
City personals ads for potential candidates. The search took
several months to find four people who fit the requirements Barker
wanted for his film. He then wrote scripts based on incidents that
were concurrently happening in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The four people are very different and also quite alike. Brenda
is a divorced mother of a 16-year-old daughter. She's tough and
jaded and certain about what she wants in a man _ money. Michael is
40 and has been looking for a wife for 15 years through the
personals. He's disillusioned because women won't look at him
twice. Why? Because he's short. Aimee is attractive and has a great
job. She moved from Kansas to Manhattan with her best friend. Her
goal is to marry by the time she's 30 but she weighs 225 pounds.
Finally, Mikey is 54 and has lived the life of a carefree swinging
single for years. He's bitter and angry toward women in general and
lives in the past.
</P>
<P>
   These characters prowl the city looking for love and yet
rebuffing most of the people they meet. Ultimately, they emerge as
funny and sometimes abrasive and self-loathing, but most of all
they're vain and deluded about their own attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unmade Beds,'' as a result, is a very black and bleak comedy
and it pushes and strains at the boundaries of voyeuristic bad
taste. But Barker swears he has never been a director who prides
himself on good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Barker's camera peeps into the windows of Manhattan residents,
creating a ``Rear Window'' scenario by prying into people's
privacy. It's an unsettling tool that both embarrasses us and
heightens the impact of the plight of his four single souls. As we
watch couples and other singles happily readying for bed, a night
out or even nakedly making love, we empathize more readily with
this often quite unlikable quartet whose desperate existences
become raw reminders of the unavoidable human truths _ aging and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Unmade Beds. Directed and written by Nicholas Barker. Cast:
Brenda Monte, Michael De Stephano, Aimee Copp, Mikey Russo. Chelsea
Pictures. 92 minutes. Unrated with nudity, language.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wanted: a man. Knowledge of trouble, trombones (76)
and River City required. Broadway experience optional.
</P>
<P>
   The call is out for the perfect Harold Hill, the sweetly slick
protagonist of ``The Music Man.'' The musical is scheduled for a
Broadway revival this fall, but the push to find the right man for
the part is on now.
</P>
<P>
   Actors who have been mentioned for the role include Patrick
Swayze and Steve Martin. Michael David, one of the show's
producers, said that although producers had made tentative
inquiries to about a dozen people, only two formal offers have been
made. (He would not say to whom.) Production members involved in
negotiations said that Alec Baldwin, an early favorite, declined
because of scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   And while producers say there is no need for panic _ rehearsals
are not scheduled to begin until mid-August _ there is a need for
speed.
</P>
<P>
   By this time every spring, the three Broadway landlords _ the
Shuberts, the Nederlanders and the Jujamcyn Organization _ are
already booking for fall. The Gershwin Theater, owned by the
Nederlanders, is considered a likely home for ``The Music Man.''
But David said that the project, in the works for two years, would
be postponed unless a star was found soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eye of the needle in this case is very small,'' David
said. ``If the elements are not in place, we'd be foolish to
proceed right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The production window is also limited because the director,
Susan Stroman, is scheduled to begin work on another Broadway-bound
show, a musical, ``The Night They Raided Minsky's,'' in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   Trailer Park Vacancies
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lee Cole, the producer of ``Killer Joe,'' Tracy Letts'
blood-soaked thriller, said this week that he was hunting for a
star to complete the new cast he is forming to keep the
five-month-old production alive.
</P>
<P>
   Barring his finding one, the show will close on April 18. ``If
we can get the right cast together, we'll make a run of it,'' he
said. The show's box office receipts at the SoHo Playhouse are
running at break-even, said Cole, who is also considering runs in
Chicago, San Francisco and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   An American Accent
</P>
<P>
   After a season with considerable hand-wringing over the dearth
of American plays, the schedules for the summer festivals are
packed with Yankee scribes.
</P>
<P>
   New York Stage and Film, for example, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
will present the premiere of ``Chesapeake,'' by Lee Blessing (``A
Walk in the Woods'').
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayer will direct and Mark Linn-Baker will star.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will also include a workshop production of
``Current Events,'' the second play by David Marshall Grant
(``Snakebit'').
</P>
<P>
   This comes after word that John Guare, Warren Leight and Kenneth
Lonergan will each present new plays at the Williamstown Theater
Festival this summer, though they will probably have to fight for
attention with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawke, who
will be appearing in ``As You Like It'' and ``Camino Real,''
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Soap Opera to Stage
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years Anna Friel has been a common sight in
the London tabloids, evidence of a fascination dating from her role
on the steamy nighttime television drama ``Brookside.'' But she has
remained little known stateside.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has a clue who I am,'' Ms. Friel said. ``It's really
lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change. With several films nearing release, Ms.
Friel, 22, is the flavor du jour in Hollywood circles, a status
confirmed by her inclusion on a Vanity Fair cover.
</P>
<P>
   But currently she is playing Alice, a mysterious ingenue, in
``Closer,'' at the Music Box Theater in Manhattan. The role is her
professional stage debut and, she said, an enormous learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I got the job over classically trained actresses,''
Ms. Friel said with a smile. ``I was terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's an amateur. A former pre-law student raised near
Manchester, England, Ms. Friel's first major break came at 16, when
she was cast as a confused teen-ager named Beth Jordache on
``Brookside.'' That led to more film and television work, but no
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she has made the leap, Ms. Friel said she would like to
try the stage again. ``I'm loving it,'' she said. ``But I told the
cast if I do anything wrong, tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   En Garde to Disband
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week that Anne Hamburger would be the new
artistic director of La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego signaled the
death of one of New York's more innovative theater troupes, En
Garde Arts, which Ms. Hamburger founded in 1986. She says that the
company's board has decided to disband this summer after her
departure.
</P>
<P>
   En Garde was one of the first theater companies to devote itself
to site-specific theater, performing in spaces like the
then-dilapidated Victory Theater (``Crowbar'' in 1990) or a Hudson
River pier (``Stonewall'' in 1994). But in recent years, Ms.
Hamburger said, such sites have become harder to find. ``The real
estate boom, while great for the city, is not great for
site-specific work because not so many spaces are around anymore,''
Ms. Hamburger said, adding that production costs had soared.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was unsure whether she would undertake
site-specific works when she moves to the more conservative
environs of San Diego and to a large institutional theater.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Irene Worth, in ``Ring Round the Moon'' at the Belasco
Theater, suffered a ``very mild stroke'' on Tuesday afternoon, said
Philip Rinaldi, a spokesman for the production. Her illness has
postponed the first preview from Thursday night to Friday night.
Marian Seldes will replace Ms. Worth in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   _ An adaptation of ``Molloy,'' Samuel Beckett's novel, will open
at the Irish Arts Center on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ After two years and a $5.5 million overhaul, Second Stage's
new theater opens Friday night in a former bank at Eighth Avenue
and 43rd Street with the first preview performance of ``That
Championship Season.''

has exploded in recent years, and the excuses that fund companies
give for starting them grow flimsier each day. More and more

industry subsectors and ever more esoteric investing styles. The
logical end? Following are excerpts from an imaginary annual

not much help in identifying the wheat. By Mark Hulbert. WITH

   MUTFUND-INSURANCE (Undated) _ A few big insurers have got a deal
for you. Well, maybe. First, you pick one of their funds _ from
high-risk to mild-mannered, your choice. Then, for as little as 0.1
percent of the investment annually or possibly as much as 0.5
percent, these companies will guarantee that the money you put up
plus an annual gain of 4 or 5 percent, will always be there, no
matter how far the market plunges. On a $50,000 investment, then,
that guarantee would cost $50 to $250 a year. Sounds good, but
there is a catch: You have to die in order to collect on the

`THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS': FEEBLE AND UNFOCUSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are appealing performers, but none
of the energy, professionalism and gameness they display while
portraying a married couple facing problems galore in the remake of
``The Out-of-Towners'' can surmount the mess that surrounds them in
this misguided comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 Neil Simon screenplay that provided the so-called
inspiration for this excursion into relentlessly silly mediocrity
won no hosannas from the critics, but at least it had its sensate
creative fingers firmly on the pulse of an anarchic era when
municipal strikes frequently crippled New York City, muggers and
squirrels vied to top the census of wildlife in Central Park and
hijackers regularly turned flying into a literal diversion.
</P>
<P>
   But as rewritten by Marc Lawrence and directed by Sam Weisman,
who rewarded moviegoers with the disarming and funny ``George of
the Jungle,'' the new ``Out-of-Towners'' is so feeble and unfocused
as to make the Farrelly brothers of ``There's Something About
Mary'' appear to have suckled at the bosom of Aristophanes.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in
the original ``Out-of-Towners,'' which was directed by Arthur
Hiller, Martin and Ms. Hawn play Henry and Nancy Clark. After 27
years of marriage, they are saying goodbye to their college-age
son, who is off to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter is already living in New York City. Henry is about to
leave for New York for a job interview, and Nancy, who is feeling
alone and neglected in their expansive house in Ohio, decides to
come along, unaware that the distracted, defeated Henry has lost
his longtime job in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``The Out-of-Towners'' goes rapidly awry is in failing to
choose a comic focus and maintain it. The film never decides
whether it wants to be a story of the comic misadventures of a
couple on a trip to New York, a commentary on the perils of life in
the big city or a bittersweet romance about a long-married couple
facing an empty nest and rediscovering passionate love. As a
result, it flounders around all three.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Hawn and Martin have to contend with a schizoid approach
to their portrayals as they are bedeviled by a plot that diverts
their flight to Boston and sends them without their luggage on a
tortuous trail to New York, where they are speedily robbed, denied
a hotel room, pursued by dogs and mounted police, blunder into a
sex therapy meeting in a church and a taxi involved in a bank
robbery, and are exposed while coupling on the grass outside Tavern
on the Green.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, they are sometimes characters, sometimes cartoons
and never credible comic creations. The same Nancy who clearly
yearns for some excitement in her marriage is the moron who
brandishes and loudly discusses Henry's shoe inserts and rash cream
when they occupy different aisles and seats on the plane that takes
them to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Nancy and Henry who can sensibly discuss their future
haven't got the brains to board the right train in Boston or to
handle a rented car without driving it through $2,200 worth of
crated seafood in the Fulton Fish Market. (They blithely walk away
from the damage and the car).
</P>
<P>
   The list of inconsistencies could be expanded, but the point is
that Henry and Nancy are two characters desperately in search of a
laugh track, and since ``The Out-of-Towners'' is supposed to be a
movie and not a sitcom Ms. Hawn and Martin are figuratively up the
Hudson without a paddle.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a saving grace to this film, it is John Cleese,
delivering another of his comic gems as Mersault, the snobbish
hotel manager who is as adept at publicly disdaining the
unfortunate and groveling before the privileged as he is at
privately cross-dressing in mink, earrings and spike heels and
dancing riotously to ``Bad Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The small but noticeable role of the speechifying mayor is
credited to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who carries it off as if to the
Gracie Mansion born.
</P>

`URGES:' FREE SPIRITS COPE WITH THE DEMANDS OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our post-Monica, ``Something About Mary'' world, there are
fewer and fewer taboos, fewer and fewer rules about acceptable
behavior, and with a no-fault society, novelists have increasingly
focused on characters afflicted with rootlessness and a surfeit of
choices. The characters in this accomplished debut collection of
stories by Nathan Englander are an exception. Most of them are
Orthodox or Hasidic Jews, living within a ritual-bound world; they
struggle not with the fallout of too much freedom, but with the
strictures of their faith, with finding a balance between tradition
and independence, obedience and desire.
</P>
<P>
   In reading these stories, it's easy enough to see the influences
that have helped shape the work of the 29-year-old Englander. His
stories not only share the powerful mixture of allegory and
quotidian detail that Bernard Malamud pioneered, but they also owe
a decided debt to Isaac Bashevis Singer's magical narratives about
art and eros and the uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Englander's voice is distinctively
his own _ daring, funny and exuberant, keenly attuned to both the
absurdities of life and its undertow of sadness and disappointment.
He's able to shift gears easily, moving from a dark, Russian fable
about writers condemned to death by Stalin (``The 27th Man'') to a
Marx Brothers-like farce about a woman willing to do anything to
get her husband to give her a divorce (``The Last One Way'').
</P>
<P>
   In many of the stories, the humor and sadness are welded
together into a seamless, Kafkaesque whole. In ``The 27th Man,'' a
young, aspiring writer finds himself sentenced to death along with
some of the most prominent Jewish authors in the Soviet Union; his
fate, the result perhaps of a clerical mistake, becomes the
occasion for a small literary masterpiece and some last-minute
collegial recognition. In ``The Tumblers,'' a group of Orthodox
Jews escape the transports to the Nazi death camps by posing as a
group of circus acrobats; their plight, the hero realizes, is ``no
more unbelievable than the reality from which they'd escaped, no
more unfathomable than the magic of disappearing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   For Charles Morton Luger, the hero of ``The Gilgul of Park
Avenue,'' faith arrives as unexpectedly as one of Kafka's magical
transformations. Charles is sitting in a cab on Park Avenue when he
realizes that he has undergone a most strange and wonderful
metamorphosis; this WASPy financial analyst realizes, in a blinding
flash, that he is Jewish. He searches out a spiritual adviser from
Bolinas, Calif. _ a self-proclaimed rabbi, who tells Charles he
possesses an ancient Jewish soul and urges him to read ``The
Chosen'' by Chaim Potok and ``QB VII'' by Leon Uris. Charles'
snooty, bigoted wife thinks he is having a nervous breakdown _ or a
midlife crisis. ``Why couldn't you have turned into a vegan?'' she
wonders. ``Or a liberal Democrat?''
</P>
<P>
   Similar marital problems afflict many of Englander's heroes,
pointing up one of the few limitations of this collection _ a
tendency to portray women, uniformly, in story after story, as
selfish, demanding and narcissistic creatures, insensitive to their
husbands' spiritual and emotional needs. In ``Reunion,'' a woman
named Robin, fed up with her husband's embarrassing bouts of manic
depression, shrieks at him: ``Disappear or I'll have to kill you
for what you do to this family. I'll stab you to death right here
in front of the children, and that will really ruin their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Last One Way,'' a disaffected wife tells the matchmaker
who set her up with her husband that she'll end the marriage, even
if it means committing murder. In the title story, a woman refuses
to sleep with her husband until he persuades his rabbi to grant him
a special dispensation to have sex with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strictures of Orthodox belief, the pragmatic
solutions of contemporary life _ like divorce, separation,
extramarital affairs or psychiatric counseling _ rarely occur to
these characters. They are forced to try to come to terms with
their problems within the framework of tradition, or make a rash
and radical break with all they have grown up believing.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of ``Reb Kringle'' _ a portly Orthodox Jew with a long
white beard _ finds himself in the unhappy situation of having to
play Santa Claus at a local department store in order to make ends
meet, or face the wrath of his practical wife. As he sees it, he
can betray his faith or his wife's wishes, choose faith or domestic
peace. As for Ruchama in ``The Wig,'' she finds herself torn
between the rule that married women must cut their hair, out of
modesty, and don a wig, and her own vain desire ``to arrive at shul
looking trim and with the long, beautiful hair of her youth.'' Her
solution is to bully a young delivery man into selling his flowing
locks, which she plans to fashion into a luxuriant (and highly
immodest) wig.
</P>
<P>
   When Englander turns from such parables to more
documentary-style narratives _ like the book's final story (``In
This Way We Are Wise''), which concerns an American visitor's
reaction to a bombing in Jerusalem _ the results are more mannered
and self-conscious. The lucid, almost transparent prose found in
the book's earlier pages turns turgid in this story (``My body
exorcises its charger of burning buildings, its icy-waters diver'')
just as the moral impetus, artfully submerged in Englander's other
tales, is bluntly set in boldface. All in all, a disappointing
conclusion to a volume that otherwise showcases this young writer's
bountiful and finely honed talents.

DIGGING OUT THE HUMOR IN A SERIAL KILLER'S TALE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ During the 1980s, the unisex bathrooms at downtown
Manhattan clubs would get pretty crowded at the height of an
evening, but it was never this bad. Here on the set of ``American
Psycho,'' in the restroom of the nightclub that serves as a
stand-in for the Tunnel, what with the camera crew, the boom
operator and the lights, there was barely space for the elaborately
costumed extras _ girls in kitsch cocktail dresses and guys in
designer suits _ to slip into a stall for a good snort of cocaine.
(Actually, vitamin B powder.)
</P>
<P>
   The scene being filmed was a sharply satiric one. In it, two
appalling yuppies, played by Justin Theroux and Christian Bale,
wait outside a stall for their turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this theory out now,'' says Theroux's character, an
already hyperventilating fellow on the verge of a breakdown, ``that
if you can catch AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is
infected, then you can also catch anything _ Alzheimer's, muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes. Dyslexia, for Christ's
sake.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, the serial killer
who is the film's protagonist, replies coolly, ``I'm not sure, guy,
but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   The humor being aimed for _ a swipe at the blind narcissism of
the youthful privileged class during the Reagan 80s _ is crucial to
the success of the movie, which may have more prerelease bias to
overcome than any film in recent memory. The 1991 novel by the same
name, on which it is based, depicts scenes of sadistic violence
narrated by Bateman in a seemingly indifferent manner that by some
literal readings was perceived as amoral.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that many people who failed to recognize (or
consider) the satiric intent of the author, Bret Easton Ellis,
thought the disturbing work should not have even been published,
much less made into a movie. Should the film not succeed as the
black comedy and social commentary that its director, Mary Harron,
intends, it is likely to sink into the same swamp of outrage that
the novel did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name `American Psycho' conjures up horrific experience,''
said Edward R. Pressman, the film's producer. ``But the script has
made me confident that we can make a terrific film that a
mainstream audience can enjoy and tolerate, that will not be overly
violent or pornographic and that will sustain the wit of the book.
What came across in readings is how funny the film will be, and we
think that will surprise people.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's humor may be crucial as well for the career of Bale,
who is, at 25, a promising actor with a serious resume. Since
appearing, at age 14, in Steven Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun,''
he has worked with directors like Kenneth Branagh in ``Henry V'',
Gillian Armstrong in ``Little Women,'' Jane Campion in ``Portrait
of a Lady'' and Todd Haynes in ``Velvet Goldmine.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, with the opening on Friday of ``Metroland,'' an
independent film shot two years ago by Philip Saville and based on
an early Julian Barnes novel, Bale has his first lead role as an
adult, playing a man in his early 30s in the throes of questioning
the life choices that have turned him from the rakish artist he was
as a youth into a domesticated suburban husband and father. (Emily
Watson plays his wife.)
</P>
<P>
   In May, he will appear as Demetrius in Michael Hoffman's starry
production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of these roles is likely to draw scrutiny like his
portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a rich, vacuous 26-year-old obsessed
with designer clothing, hip restaurants and exercise who has a
nasty compulsion to maim and disembowel his workplace rivals, his
ex-girlfriends and the occasional child, homosexual, homeless man,
prostitute and pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something nice about all the red flags this project
sends up,'' Bale said, dropping, for the sake of an interview, the
American accent he has maintained throughout the filming, both on
and off camera. ``I got all kinds of messages on my answering
machine, people saying `This is career suicide, Christian.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he admitted, a desire on his part to flout
expectations and succeed. ``But it's not at all that I want to do
something that's shocking,'' he said. ``This is not an in-depth
psychological analysis of what drives someone to become a serial
killer. When Mary first sent me the script, I hadn't read the book,
and that's what I thought it was, so I didn't want to do it. But I
found the script really funny, and I called her and told her so.
She said, `Thank God, you find it funny.'''
</P>
<P>
   With an aquiline nose and chiseled jaw, Bale is handsome in a GQ
kind of way, especially in the custom-made suits by Cerruti he
wears for the film. (Many other designers whose names dot the novel
donated period clothes for other characters to wear, but none
wanted to be associated with a character like Bateman.)
</P>
<P>
   Bale, born in Wales, was a child actor encouraged by a
grandfather who was a stand-up comedian and ventriloquist, and
parents who, as he describes them, were both resourceful and
footloose. His mother was once a dancer and a circus clown; his
father was a pilot for a time; later, he managed his son's
burgeoning career.
</P>
<P>
   His first job was in the theater, in London, in a comedy, ``The
Nerd,'' starring Rowan Atkinson (aka Bean); he was 10. His first
film, made in Sweden and Russia and featuring Timothy Bottoms and
Susannah York, was called ``Land of the Faraway.'' ``I've only seen
it in Swedish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, he was cast by Steven Spielberg as the
leading character in the 1987 film ``Empire of the Sun,'' which
follows the internment of a privileged British boy in a prisoner of
war camp under the Japanese during World War II. It was a
career-launching performance, but it was the last time he was
called on to carry a film. Since then, he has been cast largely as
a sweet-tempered lad.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tortured London suburbanite in ``Metroland'' is
nearly as much of a departure for him as Pat Bateman. He is playing
Bateman as an empty shell, he said, someone who has no center, no
soul. ``If you go back and look at the magazines of the 80s, the
advertising, the stories about what a real man is, what a winner
is, where power comes from,'' Bale said, ``Bateman has this image
of himself stolen from those magazines.
</P>
<P>
   While he's emotionally vacant, the whole persona is an act for
himself, so I'm really playing somebody who's acting the whole
time, but he's acting without having anybody in his life who, when
he shuts the door he can go, `Whew, done that, this is me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bale committed to ``American Psycho'' almost two years ago, and
he, like Ms. Harron, the director, has clung to the prospect of
making the film as if to a life raft. For a while last summer,
Leonardo DiCaprio expressed interest in playing the part of
Bateman, and Ms. Harron, who understood that the presence of such a
megastar would change the nature of the film, resisted, was fired
from the project, then rehired when DiCaprio wouldn't commit to the
part. Bale, meanwhile, turned down several roles in the hope that
things would turn out exactly as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more involved in this project than anything I've ever
done,'' he said. ``I was on board before there was any money for
it. After that much time this wasn't just another job for me, so I
never accepted that I wouldn't get to play the character. I did
have an awful lot of people saying, `Christian this is ridiculous,
you're becoming obsessed. Do something else!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harron, a Canadian whose previous film was the well-received
``I Shot Andy Warhol,'' starring Lili Taylor as the obsessed
stalker of the famous Pop artist, wrote the ``American Psycho''
screenplay with Guinevere Turner. They deleted much, though by no
means all, of the novel's brutality (there are four scripted
killings) and the two writers have come under criticism for
adapting a work that contains so much violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harron said, however, that they were attracted to the book
because ``it had a skewed and critical look at male behavior, macho
behavior, that we'd never seen before, and that it should fit into
a feminist line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Oxford,'' she continued. ``It was my one experience
meeting upper classes, and upper class men in gangs, and when I
read `American Psycho,' I recognized these wealthy, privileged,
handsome young men, who travel in gangs, who have such a sense of
entitlement and who are so obsessed with each other and competitive
with each other that they're only interested in sleeping with a
woman if one of the other guys wants her.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has been controversial since three months before its
scheduled publication, when Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had a contract
with the author and had accepted the finished manuscript, reversed
itself and refused to publish it, citing matters of taste. When it
was subsequently picked up by Vintage and published as a trade
paperback, Ellis received numerous death threats, and a boycott of
Vintage and its parent, Alfred A. Knopf, was organized by the Los
Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women _ an action
that did not, however, keep the novel from making the best-seller
list.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, here in Toronto, antiviolence and victims'-rights
groups tried _ in vain _ to keep the city from issuing a permit to
allow Lions Gate Films to make the movie here. The city is just
five years removed from the gruesome murders committed by a serial
killer named Paul Bernardo, who reportedly kept a copy of
``American Psycho'' at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very sympathetic to the protesters in Toronto,'' Ms.
Harron said. ``I didn't know there was this big connection, and I
felt terrible for the victims' families. You do feel responsible
and wonder if you're doing the right thing. It sounds like I just
want to put horrible mayhem on the screen, but I don't. I'm plagued
by these issues, actually. But how much do you restrict your work,
if it's serious work? I feel like there's something to do here that
hasn't really been done, a portrait of the late 80s that's worth
putting on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that leaves the question of what the film may do for or
to Bale. Psychotic killers tend to be memorable. Anthony Perkins,
after all, never climbed out from under the weight of Norman Bates.
On the other hand, Anthony Hopkins rode Hannibal Lecter to a career
revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really need to do a romantic comedy or something very
quickly, before this comes out,'' Bale said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a rehearsal room above City Center, three Russian
guitarists, the Kolpakov Trio, struck up a bouncy, slightly
mournful gypsy tune. Kalyi Jag, a Hungarian group, joined in,
strumming guitars and tapping on a milk can, playing a variant of
the tune that came through their own tradition. Taraf de Haidouks,
from Romania, chimed in with the hammered strings of a cimbalom and
stuttering, breakneck lines from its accordionist.
</P>
<P>
   Grins began to flash between the musicians. Yuri Yunakov, a
Bulgarian saxophonist, took up the melody, zigzagging all around
it, while the percussionists in Musafir, a group from Rajasthan,
India, started to double time the beat with wooden clappers and a
hand drum.
</P>
<P>
   A flamenco dancer, Antonio El Pipa, stepped forward, his back
arched like a drawn bow as his heels clattered cross-rhythms. Next
to him, Masafir's dancer, Sayari Sapera, tried the swaying, sensual
hip movements of a dance originally used to charm snakes. Her hands
traced arabesques akin to flamenco gestures; she was barefooted,
twirling, with bells around her ankles jingling at every step.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in its way, a family reunion. The musicians and dancers
were about to start touring together as the Gypsy Caravan, a
sextuple bill, produced by the World Music Institute, that comes to
City Center on Friday and Saturday. They were rehearsing a
potential grand finale, bending history and musicology a little bit
to make a point: that the Gypsy heritage stretches all the way from
India to Andalusia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a musical diaspora that has survived poverty and
persecution while transforming, and being transformed by, every
culture it has touched. ``We can all speak together,'' said Gusztav
Varga, the leader of the Hungarian band Kalyi Jag (which means
Black Fire). ``We have one language.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Gypsy music is one of flexibility backed by hidden
tenacity. Lately, the itinerary has been documented in films like
``Latcho Drom'' and on albums like ``The Gypsy Road'' (Alula),
which has selections from five of the six bands on the Gypsy
Caravan tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma, as gypsies call themselves, began to spread across
Europe from northwestern India in the 11th century. (The word Gypsy
comes from the mistaken idea that the Roma originated in Egypt.)
They were not welcomed. The Roma were distrusted, exploited,
scapegoated, sometimes enslaved, as the familiar Gypsy stereotypes
grew. They were shunned and marginalized; they were also pressured
to assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austro-Hungarian Empire and more recently in Eastern
Europe, Rom language and traditional dress were outlawed. In Spain,
where it was banned from 1499 to 1800, the Rom language is
virtually lost, even as Spain has come to prize the flamenco
tradition that merges Rom, Andalusian and Moorish roots.
</P>
<P>
   As nationalism has surged in Eastern Europe, the Roma still face
discrimination. Bulgaria outlawed Rom language, music and dress in
the 1980s in a stated effort to cleanse Bulgaria of outside
influences, despite the fact that Roma people had been in Bulgaria
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Yunakov, a Rom of Turkish descent who was a member of Ivo
Papasov's renowned wedding band in Bulgaria, said band members
often had to flee the police if they chose to perform a Gypsy song.
He and two other members of his current band were imprisoned for
playing the wrong songs, and threats were made against Yunakov's
children.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Yunakov emigrated to the United States. For the
last five years, he has been performing on Tuesday nights at the
Turkish Kitchen restaurant in Murray Hill. There, he plays not Rom
or Bulgarian music but Turkish songs.
</P>
<P>
   Like other minorities, the Roma learned to live between
cultures: to present different faces to the outside world and their
own communities. They picked up the language and musical styles
where they settled yet held on to their own traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, the Rom language still uses words and structures
that can be traced back to Sanskrit and Punjabi. And behind closed
doors families passed down the old tunes and dances.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the musicians in the Gypsy Caravan play at least two
repertories. One is for listeners who expect to hear so-called
Gypsy music and simply adds Rom touches to a local folk and pop
repertory. The other, rarely revealed to the wider public, is the
music and dance they perform for one another, and the Gypsy Caravan
tour is intended to present the purer Rom styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a completely different sound,'' said Varga, who started
Kalyi Jag in 1978 to hold on to the old Hungarian Rom music.
(Contrary to stereotype, there's no violinist in the group.) More
recently, he founded a school to teach children the Rom language,
along with English and computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Varga said he could hear common characteristics in much of the
music on the Gypsy Caravan program, like a certain clipped, 2/4
rhythm that appears in flamenco, in his own repertory and in the
Indian songs of Musafir. Rom songs often use a raw, incantatory
vocal style that clearly has non-Western roots, although scales and
structures change with every regional style.
</P>
<P>
   Three-part harmonies, for voices or instruments, are widespread,
and much of the dancing shares a percussive approach, from the heel
taps of flamenco to the thigh- and boot-slapping dances of Hungary.
Improvisation is an essential part of the music, as it is in many
local folk styles along the Rom route.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in many parts of Eastern Europe, Rom musicians have long
been especially prized for wedding celebrations, at which the
dancing can go on nonstop for hours or days. But as Manole Ionel,
who plays accordion in the Romanian band Taraf de Haidouks, said:
``You arrive as a musician, and you are welcomed. But you leave as
a Rom, and nobody wants to pay you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is more variety than similarity in the styles of
the Gypsy Caravan. Despite their cultural kinship, the groups on
the bill represent styles that have long been separated from one
another, geographically and historically.
</P>
<P>
   Musafir, the Rajasthani group, is not made up of Rom musicians;
as Hameed Khan, the group's founder and tabla player explained, the
Roma were the ones who migrated, not the people who stayed in
India. ``What is a memory of people who left nearly 1,000 years
ago?'' he asked. ``The migration never came back.'' Musafir (which
means traveler in Farsi) was organized to include as many of
Rajasthan's performing traditions as possible, including North
Indian classical music and devotional music.
</P>
<P>
   Its musicians come from three groups that live in the Thar
desert: Langas, Manghiyars and the nomadic Saperas. For the Gypsy
Caravan concerts it will concentrate on the vigorous folk songs and
dances that are a likely part of the Rom heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kolpakov Trio reflects the history of Russia's reaction to
the Rom presence. Writers like Pushkin celebrated Rom music;
aristocrats became patrons. After the revolution, Stalin was also a
fan, and in 1931 the government built the Moscow Romen Theater,
institutionalizing Rom performance styles but also homogenizing
them and adding Western influences. (Only later, under Khrushchev,
did the Soviet Union start to restrict the Roma severely.)
Alexandre Kolpakov, the group's leader, was trained at the Romen
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But he began to play the seven-string guitar, a traditional
Russian Rom instrument, as a boy in his hometown among the Servo,
the oldest Rom group in Russia. The trio reflects an intimate older
style of Rom music, with rich vocal harmonies and songs that start
out moody and introspective then accelerate dramatically. His
18-year-old nephew, Vadim Kolpakov, studied with him and joined the
trio in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to further the culture, to
transmit it to the next generation,'' Alexandre Kolpakov said. ``To
give what you have and to see people taking it _ that makes you
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio El Pipa's flamenco group focuses on the dancers, whose
imperious postures and explosive foot-stamping depict vignettes of
pride and desire. But the group also includes his aunt Juana
Fernandez Reyes, who sings with an indomitable, gravelly voice that
conjures age-old melancholy and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   She learned the tradition through her family, which had
generations of musicians. The feeling, she said, ``comes from
inside; it is always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Taraf de Haidouks, which means ``Band of Brigands,'' also brings
together musicians from two generations, playing Romanian songs
that work their way up to dizzying speeds, with raw, quavering
voices and endless variations spun out on accordion and fiddles.
The elder musicians have spent their lives playing at local
weddings, baptisms and parties; the younger ones have turned their
ears to the outside world, adding influences from around the
Balkans and playing newer tunes on the old instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the old songs as they are and as they have been,''
Ionel said. ``Each musician puts something into the piece, but the
traditional part cannot be changed.'' (Along with the Gypsy Caravan
tour, Taraf de Haidouks will perform a New York club show at the
Bottom Line on April 14.)
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians and the Bulgarians are the speed demons on the
bill; their versions of the old tunes ought to leave jet trails
behind them. Yunakov's Bulgarian band uses modern instruments,
including the saxophone _ which began replacing the trumpet in
Bulgarian bands in the 1970s _ and an electric keyboard alongside
the more traditional accordion.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on the age-old tradition of Rom musicians, who have
kept their ears open all the way along their 1,000-year itinerary,
Yunakov continues to extend his music; along with his Rom, Turkish
and Bulgarian songs, he has taken up Albanian music since arriving
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every road,'' Yunakov said, ``you find something new to
learn.''

ENGLISHING A FRENCH CLASSIC (WITH THEIR APPROVAL)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ French theater buffs still speak with reverence of Jean
Vilar's production of ``Le Cid'' at the 1951 Avignon Festival as
the definitive modern version of Corneille's 17th-century
masterpiece in verse.
</P>
<P>
   True, few people actually saw the two acclaimed performances
with Gerard Philipe in the lead role, but no matter. When the
Anglo-Irish director Declan Donnellan innocently suggested
presenting ``Le Cid'' in French at Avignon in 1998, the festival's
current head, Bernard Faivre D'Acier, looked decidedly alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know, there was this very important performance
at Avignon and it's very difficult to follow it,''' Donnellan
recalled. ``I was very sad and I asked him when that was. He said
it was in 1951. I thought, my God, France really is a very exotic
country. I wasn't even born then. I was taken to see Gerard
Philipe's costumes for `Le Cid' and I asked, `Where is his
third-act costume?' `Oh,' they said, `he's buried in it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Donnellan was still not intimidated by this reminder of
the place of ``Le Cid'' _ and indeed of Philipe and Vilar, the
festival's founder _ in France's cultural pantheon, it is because
in 1986 he directed what he believes is the first-ever
English-language production of the play in England. With Cheek by
Jowl, the theater company that he co-founded in 1981, he has also
directed Racine's ``Andromache'' in English. And he happens to be
fluent in French. So he persuaded Faivre D'Acier to go with ``Le
Cid'' _ and the gamble paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The production was the high point of last year's Avignon
Festival, almost unanimously praised by French critics as an
intelligent and disturbing fresh look at a dusty classic. Since
then, it has been seen in many French provincial cities as well as
in London in February and most recently at the Theatre des Bouffes
du Nord, the Paris home of Peter Brook's experimental theater
company.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is ending its touring life at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, with seven performances _ accompanied by English-language
surtitles _ at the Majestic Theater from Tuesday through next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In writing ``Le Cid'' in 1636, Corneille was inspired by two
1618 plays by the Spanish poet Guillen de Castro. They were based
on the legend of an 11th-century Castillian knight, Rodrigo de
Vivar, who was banished by King Alfonso and joined one Moorish king
in battle against another. For his bravery, he was given the rank
of lord: ``Sidi'' for the Moors, ``El Cid'' for the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But as the legend evolved, he was transformed into a Castillian
hero who married the daughter of a knight whom he had slain. Castro
added that the young woman was in love with Rodrigo before she was
orphaned. Corneille then went further.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Le Cid,'' Chimene and Rodrigue win their fathers' approval
to marry. But when Rodrigue's father, Don Diegue, is appointed
tutor to King Fernand's heir, Chimene's father, Don Gomes, is
outraged and insults his rival. Don Diegue demands that his son
avenge his honor, which leads Rodrigue to kill Don Gomes. Chimene
is now herself required to seek revenge, even though she still
loves Rodrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The young knight is sent into battle against the Moors and, in
defeating them, earns the title of Le Cid. When he returns, Chimene
designates Don Sanche to challenge Rodrigue _ and pledges to marry
the winner. To her relief, Don Sanche is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The play's plot and its Alexandrine verses are conventionally
classical, yet in its day, ``Le Cid'' was considered brazenly
subversive. It challenged the unity of place, time and action
required by early 17th-century French theater. Corneille also
called it a tragicomedy at a time when tragedy and comedy were
never mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the ensuing furor, including charges of plagiarism,
that Cardinal Richelieu summoned the Academie Francaise to sit in
judgment (it issued a 192-page critical verdict). Corneille, still
only 30, was so shaken that he was never as daring again. He went
on to write five more tragedies _ ``Horace,'' ``Cinna,''
``Polyeucte,'' ``Rodogune''` and ``Nicomede'' _ but they were far
more traditional in structure. By the time Racine shook Paris with
the emotional punch of ``Phedre'' in 1677, the aging Corneille was
considered a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the centuries that followed, ``Le Cid'' has
become a central pillar of the French canon, its most famous
speeches learned by heart by generations of high school students, a
task facilitated by both the predictable rhythm and limited
vocabulary of its verse. Many French adults can also remember
seeing one or another production of the play as children.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as likely, it was at the Comedie Francaise, they would
have seen it interpreted as an epic tragedy. In tackling ``Le
Cid,'' then, Donnellan was also taking on French memories.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the production is in French, the director obviously could
not use Cheek by Jowl (which in any event was disbanded as a
permanent troupe last spring). And since he was not familiar with
French actors, auditions took several months. His first surprise
was to cast a young black French actor, William Nadylam, as
Rodrigue. (Donnellan has frequently opted for multicultural
casting, but black actors in France are still largely limited to
black roles.)
</P>
<P>
   He then stripped the play of much of its pomp and ceremony by
using simple early 20th-century costumes and uniforms. He also
designed the production so that the action segues from scene to
scene, with many actors onstage for much of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Some French theatergoers were surprised by the humor amid the
mayhem, but the 45-year-old Irish-born director said he wanted to
probe the play's dualities: tragedy against comedy, honor against
shame, passion against reason, the individual against the state,
parent against child.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the play is about the absolute crucial importance of
disobedience,'' Donnellan explained. ``What is very sad at the
heart of the play is that Rodrigue does not disobey his father. But
Corneille makes it clear that you have to embrace all these
dualities. These people are obsessed with honor because they are
also obsessed with shame. People ask, `Does Chimene want Rodrigue
dead or alive?' The answer is both. She wants him completely dead
and completely alive. She completely loves him and completely hates
him. We find it difficult to live with conflicts, but here the
conflict is absolutely played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most unorthodox is the transformation of Rodrigue into a
tormented and reluctant hero. And this is done by interpreting the
knight's speeches, not as oratory a la ``Henry V,'' but as
self-doubting monologues _ even when he is not alone _ a la
``Hamlet.'' After his great military victory, for example,
Rodrigue's report to the king is traditionally delivered
triumphantly. Here, it becomes a lament over the horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if someone shows off about the people he's killed _
it's really fear and doubt speaking,'' Donnellan said over coffee
at the Theatre des Bouffes du Nord. ``The louder the abuse, the
bigger the lie; the louder we shout about our certainties, the less
people believe. I think even if this scene were done with flags and
baroque splendor, the whole baroque thing is really about doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Having presented Rodrigue as something of an anti-hero,
Donnellan has understandably been relieved by the warm reception
his version has received from both the French public and theater
critics. ``Our national hit has been rejuvenated and dusted off,''
said Le Nouvel Observateur. ``Heresy?'' asked the financial daily
Les Echos. ``Not at all. This production, which is both
iconoclastic and true to Corneille, is a success. It's for those
who do not fear insolence.'' Le Figaro's headline over its review
was just one word, in English: ``Wonderful!''
</P>
<P>
   Donnellan, who directed an acclaimed production of Tony
Kushner's ``Angels in America'' at the National Theater in London
in 1992, has received praise in New York for three of his Cheek by
Jowl productions _ ``The Duchess of Malfi,'' ``As You Like It'' and
``Much Ado About Nothing'' _ which traveled from England to the
academy in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The director said he had been heartened by his first experience
of working with French actors and before French audiences. ``The
actors came with such openness and warmth that there was no
demolition to do,'' he said. ``A lot of work was done on movement
because the French tradition is very Cartesian, very intellectual.
The French are famous for their arrogance, but they could not have
been more open about my meddling with their tradition.''

SOUL MATES AGING, ONE MISSIVE AT A TIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love Letters,'' A.R. Gurney's spare, epistolary duet for the
stage, is _ as the author himself has pointed out _ a quasi-play.
</P>
<P>
   The script for the original production, which opened in New York
10 years ago with a revolving cast that began with John Rubinstein
and Kathleen Turner, contains an explanatory note from the author:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a play, or rather a sort of a play, which needs no
theater, no lengthy rehearsal, no special set, no memorization of
lines and no commitment from its two actors beyond the night of
performance. It is designed simply to be read aloud by an actor and
an actress of roughly the same age, sitting side by side at a
table.'' It works best, he wrote, ``if the actors don't look at
each other until the end.'' Yet they (italics)``listen(end italics)
eagerly and actively to each other along the way, much as we might
listen to an urgent voice on a one-way radio, coming from far, far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a leap of artistic faith, ``Love Letters'' has become a
full-length television film (ABC, next Monday at 9 p.m.), with
sets, costumes and the occasional supporting player. The stars are
Laura Linney (most recently Jim Carrey's wife in ``The Truman
Show'') and Steven Weber (who starred in the sitcom ``Wings'').
</P>
<P>
   They join the scores of famous ``Love Letters'' couples who,
until now, sat side by side reading the intimate lifelong
correspondence between Melissa Gardner and Andrew Makepeace Ladd
III _ two WASPy soul mates (this is not really an oxymoron) whose
bond begins in childhood and ends with her death in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst took a turn. So did Steve
Allen and Jayne Meadows and Timothy Dalton and Whoopi Goldberg. Not
to mention Sandy Duncan and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   But taking an intimate two-character encounter from the stage to
the screen means taking some dramatic risks: mainly, making it
bigger. It is a risk that Gurney has been willing to take since the
day in 1990 when the producer Martin Starger bought the screen
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the money he paid me, I had a tennis court put in,''
Gurney said with a laugh in a telephone interview from his country
house in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney's recreation aside, the producers meant business and
never gave up, even when some major studios dropped out. Besides
having Gurney retool the script _ yet again, for television _ they
hired Stanley Donen, the venerable Oscar-winning Hollywood
director, who had been involved with Gurney and the producers in
some of the early feature-length plans.
</P>
<P>
   Best known, perhaps, for his lavish, big-screen films _
``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' and
``Funny Face,'' to name a few _ Donen has also directed more
intimate films, like ``Two for the Road'' (Audrey Hepburn and
Albert Finney) and ``Indiscreet'' (Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant).
</P>
<P>
   But a television movie is a first for Donen, a job he said he
was eager to undertake because ``I had a sort of image'' of how to
do it. Taking something small and making it bigger, but not too
big, is, he said, ``the fun, or the challenge or the adventure'' of
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're involved in the pragmatic problems of a person sitting
at home watching something that they could just as easily turn
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound grand, but I think of Diaghilev when
Nijinksy said, `What do you want me to do?' And Diaghilev said,
`Astonish me!' The challenge is how you astonish the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurney said, ``I never thought it would be a movie.'' And after
almost a decade of off-and-on negotiations, he could be excused for
wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Some might consider his work _ his plays include ``The Cocktail
Hour'' and ``The Middle Ages'' _ intellectual or elitist, but
Gurney has worked for television before. His Off Broadway play
``The Dining Room'' was broadcast on PBS in 1984, with a cast that
included W.H. Macy, John Shea and Frances Sternhagen. And in the
1970s Gurney adapted John Cheever's story ``O Youth and Beauty!''
for the PBS series ``Great Performances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the ABC deal started to come together only after Gurney had
done rewrites for two film studios, Columbia and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original screenplay was quite different,'' Gurney said of
his initial, feature-film treatment. ``There were all sorts of
major changes of place. We went to Naples and Japan and the
carrier,'' the one that Andy Ladd was assigned to as a young Navy
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   But once ABC decided to make it, the expanded story ``had to be
put back into the bottle,'' Gurney said. Rehearsal and filming, in
Toronto, took barely three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest shifts from theater to film was in having the
characters interract.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the play is that you have two people side by
side, never looking at each other,'' Gurney said. ``Since the play
is all about missed connections, you don't see them connect till
the very end, when it's too late. When she finally looks at him and
sees him for what he really is. You could argue that they're
connecting, but they're not connecting. She's an emanation of his
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the action is strictly chronological. Andy has the
first line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew Makepeace Ladd III accepts with pleasure the kind
invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Channing Gardner for a birthday
party in honor of their daughter Melissa on the occasion of her
seventh birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: ``Dear Andy: Thank you for the birthday present. I have
lots of Oz books, but not `The Lost Princess of Oz.' What made you
give me that one? Sincerely, Melissa.''
</P>
<P>
   Their exchanges proceed through their separate, single-sex camp
and boarding school experiences, to teen-age sexual
experimentation, college and beyond, when their lives and points of
view sometimes contrive to keep them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Andy, the upright, uptight WASP so often present in Gurney's
plays about the culture he knows so well, becomes a United States
senator with the charisma of Al Gore. He has a wife, three sons and
a dog and sends out numbingly detailed, mimeographed Christmas
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, a very rich girl from a home of multiple divorces, is
rebellious, loving, artistic and self-destructive. Over the years,
Melissa yearns for the stability his love would bring her; Andy
yearns for the freedom her open and artistic nature would bestow on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Because television movies work on slimmer budgets and tighter
shooting schedules than feature films, Donen chose to rely on a
script that resembled the stage version in many respects. But to
set it up for the viewer, he chose to abandon strict chronology by
starting with a flashback and using the letters as opportunities
for more.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens not with an exchange about a long-ago birthday
party but with Ladd's return to his suburban Washington home after
attending Melissa's funeral. He carries with him the boxes of his
letters to Melissa that she had saved. He goes to his study, opens
a safe and removes a strongbox, in which he has kept Melissa's
letters to him, carefully indexed.
</P>
<P>
   At his desk, he begins to read and Melissa _ her ghost, that is
_ materializes in a blue dress. At times during the movie, Andy and
Melissa speak to each other, hold hands, embrace. At other times
they speak only to the camera. But always, Gurney, says, the
audience is aware that ``this is a man in his study talking to a
ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney, the troubled Melissa, says she believes that after
years of alcoholism and depression, Melissa took her own life. But
she also thinks Melissa is finally at peace.
</P>
<P>
   Andy's last letter, to Melissa's elderly mother, ends with these
words:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've every loved anyone the way I loved her, and
I know I never will again. She was at the heart of my life, and
already I miss her desperately. I just wanted to say this to you
and to her. Sincerely, Andy Ladd.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney said, ``He's finally admitted something. It's finally
sitting with him. It's resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first time, in the stage production, that one
character, Melissa, turns to look at the other. ``Thank you,
Andy,'' says Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   On film, the lovely woman in the blue dress dematerializes.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Looks like war
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're at war in the Balkans _ you, me, our country. America. I
mention this because, while everyone knows it is so, no one seems
actually to have noticed, much less to care. There is an eerie
detachment, as if our war were _ what? _ say, a balloon, floating
out there somewhere but tethered to us only by a thin string, no
burden but after a while not much of an entertainment either. Just
sort of _ around.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the thing is all over the TV network news. It leads every
program. Newspapers spill it over full pages. There are ritual
briefings at NATO headquarters, the Pentagon, the State Department.
Screens fill with serious visages speaking somberly.
</P>
<P>
   But the war enters common conversation, if at all, only in
shallow dips at the margins. It seems to be on almost no one's
mind. ``How about Kosovo?'' is more a conversation killer than
starter, at first usually evoking only confusion and then
indifferent recognition.
</P>
<P>
   We are shooting up Serbia and, to a lesser degree, other parts
of what is left of Yugoslavia. Pouring explosives on the bomb
sites, and the political tinder, in a very modern version of
dumping boiling oil from the battlements _ that is to say, at least
for now, at relatively safe remove from most rejoinders and distant
from the horrors where the oil strips off skin and washes away
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt who the malefactors are in this matter.
Serbia and its awful Slobodan Milosevic first provoked a guerrilla
resistance _ itself a nasty business _ by ending the traditional
autonomy of Albanian-majority Kosovo and then used that resistance
as an excuse for another of their eager ``ethnic cleansings.''
</P>
<P>
   However this matter ends, it will have been the special
contribution of the Serbs, just as the century was running out, to
have added a new horror to the thick catalog of human torments this
century will pass on to the next. Is genocide a wee bit much for
you? The Serbs offer, as a slightly lesser alternative, ethnic
cleansing, in which citizens are murdered wholesale and whole towns
are cindered by way of forcing the larger number of survivors to
flee to other countries, all in a calculated application of tragedy
as an instrument of policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear that NATO's bombing isn't exacerbating
the very problem it is meant to blunt, or that more of it will be
any more effective, or that it won't set off the region's
firecracker mini-states. We'll see. Military and policy planners
ask for time. All right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's this weird disconnect. The war plays as if it
were a video game. Some thousands of miles away, and thousands of
feet below us, or so it seems, there is another puff of silent
explosion. These are hits, not kills. We bomb, not people, but
targets. Refugees are churned up, but our attention drifts. Video
games are not much as spectator sports. There's no engagement when
you don't have the joy stick.
</P>
<P>
   But our virtual war is another people's bloody hell. Even in a
good cause, we owe ground zero the courtesy of caring.

`WEIR:' DARK YARNS CASTING LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a story is told well enough, you'll follow it
anywhere, even when it's leading you to places you never intended
to go. Take the plain-spoken, utterly alluring tales unfolded by
the denizens of the rural Irish bar in ``The Weir,'' Conor
McPherson's beautiful and devious new play at the Walter Kerr
Theater. At first, they seem to beckon like comfortingly well-worn
paths into realms of folklore both exotic and familiar, Gaelic
variations on the sorts of campfire ghost stories you recall from
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Then a moment arrives, and it's hard to say exactly when because
you've shed all sense of time, when you realize that you have
strayed into territory that scrapes the soul. Suddenly, the subject
isn't just things that go bump in the night, but the loss and
loneliness that eventually haunt every life. There's a new chill
abroad, evoking something more serious than goose flesh, but there
is also the thrilling warmth that accompanies the flash of insight.
</P>
<P>
   That the audience of ``The Weir,'' which opened on Broadway
Thursday night and was first seen in London two seasons ago, is
surprised and unsettled by this turn from teasing shadows into a
more profound darkness shows that 27-year-old McPherson is a
first-rate spinner of yarns.
</P>
<P>
   That the characters onstage seem equally, and convincingly,
unsettled and surprised by their own narratives shows that
McPherson is a first-rate playwright. Under the seamless, gentle
direction of Ian Rickson, the show's five actors make an
unforgettable case for the impossibility of distinguishing the
teller from the tale.
</P>
<P>
   In its first moments, ``The Weir'' would seem to reflect the
ultimate cliche of a storyteller's opener: ``It was a dark and
stormy night.'' The sounds of ominous winds and driving rains can
be heard beyond the uninhabited set, a scruffy black box of a
barroom designed by Rae Smith. The play's characters arrive at
staggered intervals, slightly blown and bedraggled, seekers of
refuge from the bluster of the outside world. Of course there is a
fire to huddle around.
</P>
<P>
   What McPherson is doing with this standard Gothic equipment is
acknowledging an ages-old tradition, the idea of wayfarers
assembling under siege to swap information and accounts of lives as
they do in Boccaccio's ``Decameron.'' As ``The Weir'' continues, it
makes a vibrant case for the endurance of that tradition and for
the great and essential value of telling stories.
</P>
<P>
   Though a feeling of individual isolation in a baffling and often
hostile world pervades ``The Weir,'' the stories woven by its
characters become solid, if temporary, bridges among them. If the
disturbing mysteries of existence haven't been given explanations,
they have been given forms, and that in itself is a victory. The
notion of the oppressiveness of the immense quiet of country life
recurs in ``The Weir.'' Stories are what break the silence.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the play are four drinking cronies, the kinds
of men who might not have become friends in an urban environment
but who have long ago made a comfortable adjustment to one
another's quirks and temperaments. There is Jack (Jim Norton), who
runs a garage and is the oldest and most theatrically loquacious of
the lot, and Jim (Kieran Ahern), a gentle, slightly slow-witted
odd-jobs man who lives with his aged, ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Finbar (Dermot Crowley) is a splashy fellow who wears a pink
shirt and flashes 20-pound notes and is a local success in real
estate. The pub's owner and bartender is Brendan (Brendan Coyle),
who is the most taciturn of the quartet, which by no means suggests
that he is less eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that a stranger is introduced into
this company, someone whose very presence will change the course of
the men's habitual conversation. One of McPherson's more cunning
inspirations is to make this prototype a woman (played by Michelle
Fairley), a trespasser of sorts in a masculine domain who
automatically raises the level of self-consciousness in the room
and turns each of the men into even more of a performer than he is
normally. Named Valerie, she is a newcomer to the region and has
rented a house from Finbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' is built around five monologues delivered by four
of the characters. All but one have a supernatural element, and
each of them is effectively self-contained. The first, told by Jack
with the flourish of a homespun Danny Kaye, is benignly spooky, a
minor-key tale of fairies and spectral knocks on doors. But it
ingeniously creates a foundation for everything that follows,
opening the floodgates, or the weir (dam) of the title, for an
accelerating rush of revelations that cut closer and closer to the
bone.
</P>
<P>
   To say much more about these stories would be unfair. One can
list a few of their elements without giving too much away; you
learn, for instance, why Finbar quit smoking years ago and why
Valerie has moved from city to country. Everything here, of course,
is in the why, and though Finbar's tale may seem slight in
comparison with Valerie's devastating chapter of autobiography,
they are cut from the same cloth, a shimmering weave of the mundane
and the ineffable.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the stories, in fact, deepens and expands the others.
The order in which they are arranged offers a master lesson in
dramatic construction. A dimension of otherworldly menace is
increasingly heightened in the succeeding monologues until the very
last one, which like the first belongs to Jack. It is a plain story
of lost love, with no ghostly shadows at all, yet it is absolutely
of a piece with everything that has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It is to McPherson's credit that you are aware of these patterns
only after the play is over, and that while you are watching it the
monologues never register as discrete dramatic contrivances. Unlike
the work of another bright light of the British theater, Patrick
Marber (currently represented on Broadway by ``Closer''),
McPherson's doesn't call immediate attention to mechanics and
symmetries.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of ``The Weir'' emerge out of an organic flow of
conversation, partly the formulaic banter among longtime friends,
partly prosaic exchanges on subjects like horse racing and the
foreign visitors who invade the countryside in the summertime.
Rickson and the performers are expert in conveying the
idiosyncratic ritual among drinking buddies, and what happens when
it is disrupted, as when Valerie asks for the unexpected: a glass
of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkable, when you think about it, how little of this
talk is merely atmospheric filler. The play's lyricism is a matter
of steady accumulation rather than bursts of flowery metaphors, a
stealthy poetry reflected even in Paule Constable's exquisitely
graded lighting. Every phrase has its purposeful place and reason,
but the actors never make the mistake of letting on that they know
this.
</P>
<P>
   All have appeared in previous incarnations of the play, and the
ensemble work is so seamless that it seems unjust to single out one
performance. You're always aware of the connections among the
characters onstage, the ways in which they chafe, comfort and
occasionally embarrass each other. A moment in which Jim sits down
stiffly by the newly arrived Valerie is turned into a gloriously
subtle study in social awkwardness by Ahern and Ms. Fairley. What
Coyle does with the simple act of pouring a glass of wine is a sly
comic marvel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Coyle, who won a Laurence Olivier Award (the London equivalent
of the Tony) for his role in ``The Weir,'' is the only character
who doesn't tell a proper story. Yet by the evening's end, you feel
you know Brendan as intimately as any of the others on stage. It's
hard to think of a recent performance in which the act of
listening, by all of the performers, takes on such articulate
dramatic weight.
</P>
<P>
   The monologues of ``The Weir'' are really dialogues between
narrator and listeners, just as every play is a dialogue between
itself and its audience. This fine, stirring and generous
production reminds us of the priceless worth of that exchange. We
may have begun the evening as eavesdroppers; by its end, we have
fully and transportingly joined the conversation.

CHEVY OFF TO A SHAKY START  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 THE LEDGER   (Lakeland, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chevy is off to a shaky start in this year's Winston Cup
competition.
</P>
<P>
   It may be bad luck, being in the wrong place at the wrong time
or it may be the law of averages finally catching up with Jeff
Gordon and, to a lesser extent, Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, last Sunday, Gordon slammed into a wall at the
Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth and wound up 43rd, the worst
finish of his career although he has been last in races before. In
1996, he was 42nd in the Daytona 500. In 1997, he was 42nd and last
in the spring race in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 39th the week before in Rockingham, S.C., after his
engine let go and now the 43rd in Texas, it can be argued that this
is Gordon's worst start since 1993, his first year of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's weak eighth-place finish in Texas was only his
second time in the top 20 in the first six races this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Chevy can't still save its season. While
there have been disappointments, there have also been surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Since Terry Labonte, who won in Texas, was taken out in a wreck
at Daytona, he has run with the kind of consistency expected from
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner, Earnhardt's teammate, has been surprisingly
strong, although some of Gordon's bad luck seems to have rubbed off
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Texas, after Gordon hit the wall and wrecked, so did
Skinner, who finished 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   From Chevy's standpoint, all this is complicated by the
possibility of having to switch to a new car late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this year's first race, the Daytona 500, the
powerful Hendrick team which builds cars for Gordon, Labonte and
Wally Dallenbach, lobbied to postpone the car's debut until 2000
because NASCAR and Chevy could not reach agreement on its final
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a cutoff date, a date when we get the rules, a date
when we can test,'' John Hendrick said back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get a date when we feel we have enough time to
properly test the car and know what we've got, I don't know of a
single owner who would be in favor of making the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tight points race, moving to a new car with all its
unknowns could cost Chevy a championship. Now it appears that, led
by Hendrick's opposition, Chevy will hold off racing its new car
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the top Chevy teams have their work cut out for
them. Gordon probably has the best chance of breaking out.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, like Earnhardt, this is beginning to look like a
long season.

REPORT CRITICIZES UTILITY FOR POWER OUTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU and ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A state investigation into the power outage that
crippled San Francisco in December harshly criticized the Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., saying that more than 140 human errors
occurred from the moment the power failure began to when power was
restored some seven hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In the 105-page report released Wednesday, independent
consultants for the California Public Utilities Commission also
accuse the utility of stymieing its investigation into the Dec. 8
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said they were not able to talk to the PG&AMP;E
workers most directly involved in the power failure, relying
instead on interview notes provided by PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said that a key document, the switching log in
the control room of the San Mateo substation where the failure
began, was doctored to cover up a misstep that ended up tripping
the system and causing the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E assailed the report as ``flawed'' and ``reckless,'' utility
spokesman Len Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to PUC President Richard Bilas, PG&AMP;E chief executive
Gordon Smith urged the commission to reject the report's most
damning conclusions, adding that the consultants had gone outside
of their jurisdiction by focusing on transmission issues.
</P>
<P>
   That turf belongs to the quasi-public California Independent
System Operator in Folsom, Smith said. According to PG&AMP;E, the
California Independent System Operator also issued a report
Wednesday that concluded the utility complied with industry
standards and had reacted appropriately to the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people in the San Francisco area were
affected by the power failure, which started at 8:15 a.m. and ended
at 3:54 p.m. Hospitals, transit trains, traffic lights, elevators,
homes and businesses were affected.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has acknowledged that there were mistakes made by a
crew working at the San Mateo station and has disciplined some
employees.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E found fault with many of the PUC assertions. It disagreed
with the dollar figure of the estimated damages. The PUC report
placed the damages between $200 million and $400 million. So far,
claims have been in the $15 million range, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The utility disagreed with the PUC claim that full power could
have been restored within three hours, instead of the seven hours,
39 minutes it took. The procedures recommended by the consultants
would have caused serious damage to the electrical equipment of the
utility and of the customers, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the PUC places the blame for the blackout on human
errors, those errors point to systemic problems within the utility
company, according to the report, including inadequate field
supervision and double-checks of equipment and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the report says, PG&AMP;E suffers from an ``error-prone
work culture that is not self-critical ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the December 8 outage, significant human errors
were made by the majority of the PG&AMP;E organizations involved in the
event,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Blunders were made every step of the way. ``Grounding errors,
engineering errors, operator switching errors, review errors,
testing errors, maintenance errors, etc.,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not carry fines or penalties, but warns that
unless its recommendations are taken, another major blackout could
occur.

STUDY SAYS INTERNET BECOMING A FORCE IN SEXUALITY

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An estimated 4.6 million daily Internet users
may end up having more sex with a mouse than a person, according to
a study published in a leading psychology journal.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 4.6 million of the estimated 57 million people who
use the Internet daily could become hooked on cybersex, said Dr.
Alvin Cooper, the study's lead author and director of the San Jose
Marital and Sexuality Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, whose study is being published by the American
Psychological Association in the April issue of Professional
Psychology: Research and Practice, said the Internet has spawned a
sexual revolution with more than 9 million people visiting erotic
Web sites daily, sending suggestive e-mail or joining sexual chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen to 30 percent of the on-line population goes to sexual
Web sites, and sex is the most popular on-line search topic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has evolved as a really powerful force in
sexuality because ... it offers affordability, accessibility and
anonymity,'' Cooper said Wednesday. ``It is not a good thing or a
bad thing. On-line sexuality is like a vehicle that can be driven
recklessly or enhance people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's study analyzed 9,177 of the 13,000 Internet users who
responded. According to Cooper, 86 percent of those responding to
the Internet survey were men. The survey was conducted over a
three-week period beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersex has gotten increasing attention and no research. It's
all hype and speculation and no facts,'' said Cooper, a training
coordinator at the Department of Counseling and Psychological
Services at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said 8.5 percent of the study's participants searched for
sexual material on line for more than 11 hours a week, generally
leading to serious problems in their lives. Most of these people
demonstrated signs of ``sexual compulsivity,'' or a very high
on-line sex drive, Cooper said. About 47 percent of his sample
spent less than 60 minutes a week on line for sexual activities.
They demonstrated no sexual difficulties in life, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ co-authored by Coralaie Scherer, Sylvain Boies and
Barry Gordon _ has come under fire because it collected all its
data on line from willing participants through the MSNBC Internet
site. No follow-up phone calls could be made by the researchers to
confirm the reliability of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a random sample,'' said David C. Heilbron,
a former statistics professor at the University of California at
San Francisco. ``I don't think it means anything about Internet
users of the population in general. It's just a group of people who
chose to respond to this particular inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper defended his research. ``You don't do a study about
on-line sex off line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this myth that people go on-line in an uncontrolled
way and cybersex takes over their lives,'' Cooper said. ``But those
who use the Internet as a recreational tool rather than in a sexual
way demonstrate no significant problems. It's like watching
`Baywatch' or looking at Victoria's Secret catalogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But psychologist Pauline Holmes of Christian Psychotherapy and
Family Counseling in San Francisco disagreed, calling cybersex
destructive to families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would look at it as a form of adultery even though it
doesn't necessarily involve physical contact,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people nowadays don't think oral sex is sex, so
looking at a computer definitely couldn't be sex, but the fact of
the matter is that cybersex is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Because almost everyone has unfaithful thoughts, the real issue
becomes how serious cybersex becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is looking at pornographic materials and sexual
literature,'' Holmes said. ``Getting involved with another person
on-line _ that's definitely another level.''

ANTIQUES COLUMN: DESPITE EDEN, SNAKES STAY IN FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As lowly reptiles go, the serpent has had a
remarkably high-profile career.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the serpent, although with the help of an apple, is
basically blamed for Adam and Eve's fall from grace and eviction
from Paradise, serpents and snakes have never gone out of fashion
in jewelry. According to Simon Teakle, the jewelry specialist at
Christie's, ``It's a stronger trend than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   There are glittering examples of Western civilization's take on
the snake in Doyle's ``Fine and Period Jewelry'' auction April 11;
Sotheby's sale of ``Magnificent Jewels'' on April 12 and 13,
Christie's ``Magnificent Jewels'' on April 14, and Phillips'
``Important Estate Jewelry'' on April 21. There are also snakes
among the 270 pieces of jewelry in the ``Art of Cartier''
exhibition in Mexico City at the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes,
which opens April 14 and runs through July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Each era and part of the world seems to have its own meaning for
the snake, as a symbol of fertility, immortality, eternal love,
wisdom, you name it. The pharaohs of ancient Egypt wore sacred
serpents as pendants around their necks. In ancient Greece,
Aesculapius, the god of medicine, had a household snake wrapped
around his staff, which remains the symbol of the medical
profession. The Romans also held Aesculapius' snake sacred. And
don't forget Medusa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The serpent is probably one of the best known and, next to the
scarab, one of the oldest images from the animal world,'' Teakle
said. ``The ancient Greeks and Romans revered the snake as a
guardian spirit and symbol of wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a snake design appears menacing. Christie's Lot 44 is
a showy gold necklace with three cobralike snakes intertwined,
circa 1960. Each has a large cabochon opal crown on its head,
bordered in diamonds, and has sapphire eyes and a body, or chain,
of diamond-studded gold links. Each is on the alert, head raised,
tongue out, hissing. The piece, unsigned, is estimated to sell for
$15,000 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Fay, the antique jewelry specialist at Sotheby's,
said, ``Queen Victoria liked snakes as motifs because they were
emblems of eternal love.'' She continued: ``Her betrothal ring was
an emerald-set serpent. It has its tail in its mouth. The circular
coil represents eternity and everlasting love.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the queen's interest, snake jewelry became
fashionable in the 1890s, when, Teakle said, the snake became a
ubiquitous motif on rings, bracelets and necklaces. Lot 354
(estimated at $12,000 to $15,000) at Christie's is a coiled snake
bracelet, circa 1890, signed Tiffany &AMP; Co. The snake's ``skin'' is
made of textured woven gold, and the head is covered with diamonds.
The eyes are emerald. ``It's like a very fine basket, the way the
strands are woven,'' Teakle said, adding that the signature added
to the piece's value.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's sale includes beautiful objects that depict other
animals, real and mythological. Lot 226 is an Art Deco agate,
enamel and diamond cigarette case signed by Boucheron, Paris
($20,000 to $30,000). It is decorated with enameled ladybugs that
sit on diamond-studded, carved chalcedony daisies. The agate is a
rosy butterscotch; the flowers are lavender; the stems are dark
green, and the ladybugs are bright orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design is strong, the color palette is exquisite, the
quality of the carving on the flowers is great, and it is
charming,'' Teakle said. Lot 250 at Christie's is a lapis lazuli
and gold vanity case (circa 1925) with an inlaid panel depicting a
fierce Chinese dragon with a long snakelike tail ($75,000 to
$100,000). The mother-of-pearl dragon panel is bordered on two
sides by rows of cabochon rubies, sapphires and rose-cut diamonds.
It is signed by Linzeler-Marchak, a Paris jeweler in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is in the league of the greatest Deco boxes,''
Teakle said. ``In the Art Deco period, there were the well-known
houses, like Cartier and Boucheron, and other houses that are not
household names but were superb jewelers. The dragon inlay is not
signed here, but it may well have been done by Vladimir Makovsky,
who sold panels like this to Van Cleef and Cartier.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cartier, the snake was never as popular as the panther, the
favorite animal of both the Duchess of Windsor and Jeanne
Toussaint, Cartier's jewelry director in the 1930s. Nonetheless,
``watercolor drawings of snake rings and bracelets appear in
Cartier sketchbooks from 1910 on,'' said Gail Winston, a
spokeswoman. She added, ``From this date forward, snakes were
increasingly present in Cartier jewelry designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The showiest Cartier snake in the ``Art of Cartier'' exhibition
is the necklace made in 1968 for the Mexican actress Maria Felix,
who starred in Renoir and Bunuel films in the 1940s. An articulated
piece, it was made with 2,473 diamonds mounted on platinum. ``The
underside is enameled in red, green and black, so the piece is
completely reversible, like Indian jewelry,'' said Eric Nussbaum,
the director of antique collections for Cartier in Geneva. Maria
Felix ``was fascinated by snake jewelry,'' Marilyn Nissenson and
Susan Jonas wrote in ``Snake Charm'' (Abrams, l995), a book about
snake motifs in art. They recount how she wore her necklace with a
turquoise bangle snake bracelet that had a turquoise ball hanging
from its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier still makes snake jewelry, and in 1997 designed another
flexible snake necklace with diamond scales. The snake coils around
two pear-shaped detachable emeralds weighing more than 200 carats
each.
</P>
<P>
   Lalique, the French glass and jewelry designer (1860-1945), was
obsessed with snake and insect motifs, beginning with his jewelry
for Sarah Bernhardt. According to ``Snake Charm,'' his showpiece
``was a sinister-looking corsage ornament consisting of nine
writhing serpents with ropes of pearls hanging from their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Odile Briot, writing in the catalog for a Lalique show
last year at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum said, ``The
serpent takes pride of place in Lalique's heraldry of the
feminine.'' She continued: ``The serpent is an archaic underworld
god, chased out of the Christian Paradise. Just like a gemstone,
its plastic perfection makes it a striking sign of the sacred in
nature. The snake is the living abstraction of the line which Art
Nouveau would see as the underlying `biomorphic' structure of
form.''
</P>
<P>
   There are none of Lalique's fabled dragonflies in the Christie's
sale, but Lot 211 was clearly inspired by Lalique. It is a diamond
and emerald dragonfly brooch with blue and green enamel wings lined
in diamonds. Its abdomen is set with diamonds, and the eyes are
emeralds. (Estimate: $12,000 to $15,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Salem, the jewelry expert at Phillips, explained the
popularity of snakes and reptiles in jewelry today. ``People
appreciate nature much more than in the past,'' she said. ``Maybe
it's a reaction to all the technology in our lives. Nature makes us
feel more grounded. It appeals to our human side.''

PONTIAC TURNS HEADS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 THE LEDGER   (Lakeland, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Pontiac, NASCAR's stepchild in the battle between Ford and
Chevy for stock car racing supremacy, the struggle to get to the
top has not been so much a case of one step back, two steps forward
as it has one step back, one-and-a-quarter steps forward. But gains
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth two Pontiacs _
the team cars owned by Joe Gibbs and driven by Bobby Labonte and
rookie Tony Stewart _ finished third and sixth, respectively.
Another Pontiac driven by Ward Burton had a lead for 56 laps.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six races this season, Pontiac has two poles, two
runner-up finishes, five top fives and 14 top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Pontiac had two poles, one win, two top fives and
four top 10s after six races.
</P>
<P>
   Through the race in Texas, Labonte was second in the point
standings and Burton eighth, giving Pontiac two drivers in the top
10 compared with none a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac's resurgence began when Gibbs, unhappy over what he
thought was second-class status with Chevy, switched to Pontiac in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   With Richard Petty's team floundering, Pontiac had no lead car,
a role filled for Chevy by Jeff Gordon and for Ford by Mark Martin,
and Gibbs' operation quickly moved to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gibbs' two cars have accounted for both Pontiac poles,
one of the two runner-up finishes, four of the five top fives and
seven of the 14 top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pontiac problem is lack of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, nine drivers are in Pontiacs compared with seven in
1998, but they pale in comparison to the Ford and Chevy
contingents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember the numbers are against Pontiac,'' said
John Andretti, who drives Petty's car. ``The longevity of some of
those teams with the other manufacturers also means a lot. Pontiac
has been with Petty Enterprises a long time, but they really
haven't been that long with Joe Gibbs and some of the other
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty began his association with Pontiac in 1982. The next most
senior team member is Chuck Rider, who started with Pontiac in
1989. Derrike Cope is his current driver.
</P>
<P>
   With only nine teams and many of them fairly new to Pontiac,
Andretti points out that Pontiac goes into races riding a tighter
line than either Ford or Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, you're not comparing apples to apples,'' Andretti
explained. ``If it was a third of the field, a third of the field
and a third of the field and everybody was dealing with the same
level of teams, then I think the results would look different.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one guy has a problem, there goes a huge percentage of the
Pontiacs out of the field and, of course, not everybody hits the
setup every weekend, so already, you're missing two or three of
them,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   With Ford or Chevy, if a couple cars miss the setup it's not a
big deal, because they'll have between 15 and 20 entries in a given
race. Pontiac, though, needs everybody running well. But if they're
all not running well, at least some of them are running better.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte continues to set the pace, pulling teammate Stewart
along with him. Burton has improved dramatically over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the parity is better this year than it was at the
start of last year between Ford, Chevy and Pontiac,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we've had this body for quite a while now,''
he said. ``That probably helped because we just had more of a
database to draw from because we stayed with what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is, can Pontiac teams keep it up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have more wins, more top fives and more top
10s and finish higher in the points,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that goal is out of reach.''

AUTHENTIC HORNBLOWER, WHERE GRIM MEETS GHASTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are

<TEXT>
<P>
   The squeamish are advised to pop a couple of Dramamine before
sailing with Horatio Hornblower. You're in for some rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Sunday night, A&AMP;E is presenting four new films
featuring Hornblower, the young 18th-century British naval officer
created by the novelist C.S. Forester. Judging from the first of
these, ``The Duel,'' the filmmakers have gone to great pains to
reproduce the unrelentingly grim life aboard His Majesty's ships.
They have succeeded perhaps too well. The drama's two hours feel
longer than Grandma's last Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Horatio, who matures from a frightened boy to a leader of men,
is on screen virtually every moment, so the casting was crucial.
The producers have given the role to an actor with nautical
experience; he played a crew member on the big-screen Titanic. The
series' Horatio is a square-jawed 24-year-old Welshman named Ioan
Gruffudd (pronounced yo-IN GRIFF-iths). He is given to long periods
of stoic brooding between bursts of overacting (pronounced EAU-vuh
ACT-ing). If you can imagine a young Al Gore in a Napoleon hat,
you've got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   When first glimpsed, Midshipman Hornblower, already seasick, is
clambering from a rowboat onto the Justinian off Spithead on the
English coast. It's 1793, and war with the new Republican
government in France is imminent. Meanwhile the ship's men have
little to do but get on one another's nerves (not to mention
yours). This gives Hornblower ample time to suffer the assaults,
verbal and otherwise, of the sadistic Jack Simpson (Dorian Healy),
who looks like Rod Stewart on a bad hair day.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes Simpson. As he enters the cramped quarters below
decks, one of his fellow midshipmen snarls, ``Stand off, Jack, or
by God I'll trim the wall with your brains.'' (Imagine two hours of
men talking like that.) But at least Healy's psychotic bully offers
some hint of a living person.
</P>
<P>
   Hornblower must face Simpson (the duel of the title) and his
other nightmares, all in the crucible of the war that eventually
begins. During the course of this first installment he is
transferred to the frigate Indefatigable, commanded by the
tough-but-wise Capt. Pellew (Robert Lindsay), who will become
Hornblower's mentor. Lindsay is an actor with a flair for comedy
and charm, but this role (this whole production) hasn't a hint of
either quality.
</P>
<P>
   The three remaining films _ based, like the first, on sections
of one 1950 Forester novel, ``Mr. Midshipman Hornblower'' _ will
appear on succeeding Sunday nights. The hero will actually meet a
woman or two and will earn the rank of lieutenant (pronounced
left-TEN-ahnt).
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have made a great deal of prideful noise about
the production's nautical authenticity. They say that their
125-foot-long Indefatigable is a replica of a 24-gun frigate, the
first such ship to be hand-built from wood in 150 years. But the
viewer who doesn't know a mainsail from a clearance sale will
quickly grow weary of all the smoke, fog, blood, screaming,
splashing, scowling and scurrying rats. That viewer will yearn for
another kind of authenticity. While the eye may be impressed by the
shipbuilders' craft, the mind and heart will wonder where the drama
is.

ART REVIEW: A GIDDY BACCHANALIA OF IMAGERY AND EXPLOSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is new if temporary treasure to be found at the
Museum of Modern Art right now, and it lies at the center of the
engrossing, challenging exhibition of early drawings by German
painter Sigmar Polke. The third gallery in this show, which has
been organized by Margit Rowell, chief curator of drawings, and is
devoted to works from 1963 to 1974, presents only four drawings,
all dated 1969-71.
</P>
<P>
   But each is the size of a large wall, and two even curl
seductively on the floor like magic carpets. All are dense with
overlapping images, exploding forms, delicate notations, mad
scribbles, florid stains, seeping colors, even footprints. Fitted
together from smaller pieces of paper, their mixes of media suggest
a startling degree of physical experimentation and include paint,
oil, felt-tip pen, ball-point pen, crayon, pencil, stencil and
collage.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble effect is one of the most astounding artistic
sights currently available in New York, and the first encounter can
take your breath away. (This is only the third time the four have
been shown together, and their first U.S. appearance.) The drawings
easily live up to their apocalyptic title: ``The Ride on the Eight
of Infinity.'' I love the unexpected innocence of the ``eight'': it
is like a child's on-first-sight name for the infinity symbol's
double loop.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of these drawings a beatific, albeit rabbity, face
emerges in four stages from deep pale-green space; around it is a
rose window of clambering human silhouettes, outlines of a real
person lying on the paper. In the next, a blocky robotlike head is
sprayed in the face with a hose, manned by a vivid blue hand that
seems related to a face emerging from a cloud as a genie would. In
the third, a giant motorcyclist seen dramatically from above surges
diagonally across the paper, trailing a huge shell-like coil that
includes a highway, a star-spangled-banner sky and a woman's
profile. And in the final one, drawing takes over as swirling
cyclones and spirals of scribbles move in and out of expanses of
red paint.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious comparison is with the three big classic ``drip''
paintings that formed the heart of the Modern's recent Jackson
Pollock retrospective. But in place of the Pollocks' irreducible
unity and enveloping oneness, the Polkes substitute a virtual
babble of competing intellectual, visual and cultural forces. These
works did not result from an extended meditative dance around the
canvas. They came in fits and starts over time, in gestures and
images large and small, in amendments, accidents, obliterations and
accretions, in fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of them as the product of one person, or
even a single culture. Abstract Expressionism as filtered through
Pop Art, '60s psychedelia, even American painting of the '80s,
they're all here, but so are Egypt, Byzantium and Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   From certain angles, the gallery suggests some opulent inner
sanctum, a hidden chamber brilliant with glowing tapestries,
frescoes or ancient cave paintings. For once, the faintly
oppressive subterranean atmosphere of the Modern's euphemistically
titled ``mezzanine'' (read basement) galleries feels just right.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to see these drawings first. They supply a kind of
fire not unlike winter morning porridge; this can power you through
the rest of the show, which sometimes feels a bit arctic.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the remaining galleries don't seem quite
full, as if the show needed either less space or more art. Given
the roving exuberance of Polke's art, the installation should have
been , well, more effervescent. It is also too bad that the show
stops so early in Polke's career, although it reaches the point
when his drawings had successfully established the basic tenets of
his art.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the years after 1974 are partly accounted for in two
exhibitions in galleries on the Upper East Side, which, together,
have a richness nearly equal to the Modern's show. Michael Werner,
who first showed Polke's work in his gallery in Cologne in 1970,
has mounted a mesmerizing display of drawings from the artist's
sketchbooks of the '80s. Knoedler, which sometime collaborates with
Werner, has a show of beautiful new works on paper, some of them
quite large and most of them echoing ideas first introduced in the
Modern's show. (The exceptions are the beautifully intricate
networks of bright runny color made by wild and rapid tilts of the
paper surface with results that variously suggest crackled glazes,
chaotic lace or sotto voce Pollock.)
</P>
<P>
   Polke is arguably the greatest and most influential of the East
and West German painters who came of age in the late 1960s and
early '70s, but whose work was not seen in New York until the early
'80s. His main competition is Gerhard Richter, whose intellectual
rigidity is the inverse of Polke's heady, almost (sometimes
actually) intoxicated sense of license. Not for nothing is one of
the show's final drawings, depicting an open vial of yellow
crystals, titled ``Polke as a Drug.''
</P>
<P>
   In a generation that includes Georg Baselitz, A.R. Penck, Markus
Lupertz and Anselm Kiefer, Polke has always been the mercurial
maverick, gleefully shifting styles, media and material at will. He
has, for example, produced an enormous body of photographs as
aggressively manipulated as his paintings. (They were seen in a
large show at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art in 1995.)
His art has been consistently resistant to assimilation and easy
viewing; after 40 years, its physical eccentricity and roughness
can still startle.
</P>
<P>
   The current show is no exception. Just as Polke was capable of
pushing drawing to monumental, mural-size extremes, he was also
capable of going for broke in the opposite direction, making
drawings from the slightest, most abject bits of materials and
ideas, whose first impression is of inconsequentiality.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening galleries of this exhibition you may sometimes
think you are looking at children's drawings. You are not. Rather,
you are seeing a young artist with a wide subversive streak
wreaking havoc with the tradition of the medium. On sheet after
sheet, he brashly questions accepted notions of skill, beauty,
refinement and technique, while also dealing with some of the
pressing questions of the day and the latest ideas in contemporary
art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the start of the exhibition, Polke was in his third
year of a course of art study at the Duesseldorf Art Academy that
would continue until 1967. Fellow students included Richter; Joseph
Beuys was a teacher. American Pop art, with its emphasis on
consumer culture, was just making its presence felt. Its attitude
dovetailed with the growing German recovery, fueled as it was by
impeccably designed products, especially cars, desired the world
over.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the exhibition, Polke covers a lot of
ground, working fast and loose. His subjects fall into general
categories: modern art, modern romance, tourism, consumerism, all
of which he approaches with the double edge of satire and
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   As his drawing styles waver, wither and expand during this
period, it is important to bear one idea in mind: Polke always
keeps his hand in, keeps it personal. He may be the most
peripatetic of postmodernists, but his drawings almost always
incorporate an element of automatism, providing readings of the
artist's nervous system as clearly as anything by Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   With buoyant grids, curves and liver shapes, Polke makes
abstractions that suggest cocktail napkin designs. With cursory,
scrappy marks, he introduces phallic worms that angle and dangle,
leering at women, crowing (``Inhibitions?'') at little men, all in
a cartoon style so light as to almost wash off the page. Words and
sarcastic captions are frequent; his use of the non sequitur echoes
through the work of succeeding generations, from William Wegman to
Raymond Pettibon's laconic, loquacious verbal art, now in full view
at the Drawing Center in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Polke plays American art off German life while
refusing to partake of the material confidence of either. The best
drawings in the show's first section are numerous smiling Roy
Lichtensteinian blondes rendered small and crabbed in scratchy blue
ballpoint, a medium more common, impoverished and intimate than the
anonymous elegance of newspaper advertising or comic-book
illustration favored by the Americans. Still, the singularly
beautiful ``Spider Man'' demonstrates that he could be suavely
illustrational when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, Polke's hand turns jovial and relaxed, as in
a series of loose, cartoonish gouaches of potato-head couples and
tourist-poster abstractions that incorporate plumes of fluorescent
spray paint and seem to satirize the flourishes of Lyrical
Abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is symptomatic of Polke's ability to see the expressive
potential of common implements that he may be the first artist to
take the felt-tipped pen seriously, as evidenced by sketchbook
drawings from 1971-72 in the show's final gallery. Here the artist,
who started making images that resemble children's drawings, closes
out with a few dozen that suggest the work of a juiced-up teen-age
boy. But these sometimes stark, hallucinatory images of sci-fi
faces and pretzelized creatures are much more psychologically
subtle than you initially think, and also full of unexpected
perceptual tricks and delicate positive-negative reversals that
animate the entire page. The artist's conclusion seems to be that
the late-century soul is twisted, but thriving.
</P>
<P>
   This gallery also includes some of the show's most touching
moments. One is a 1965 drawing-love letter that begins ``!Lieber
Toni,'' and over lines of neat little images seems to tell the
story of a happy relationship, full of travel and art. Also here is
a charming sketchbook, open to one page with the others reproduced
in an accordion photograph, that is devoted exclusively to images
of self-satisfied little easy chairs living happy bourgeois lives.
</P>
<P>
   After its central knockout gallery, the remainder of this
exhibition becomes richer and fuller as you spend more time with
it. It doesn't take too long to realize that the flaming
imagination and restless experimentation that courses so raucously
through ``The Ride on the Eight of Infinity'' swirls more quietly
through everything else, a rich, ceaseless underground current.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigmar Polke: Works on Paper 1963-1974'' is at the Museum of
Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd St., Manhattan, (212) 708-9400, through June
16.

CLINTON APPEALS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT AS ALLIES WEIGH WIDER MISSION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, summoning the ``determination
and resolve'' of the American people for an escalating offensive in
the Balkans, declared Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic will be held responsible for the fate of three captured
American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The president, joined by Defense Secretary William Cohen and
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led a
nationally-broadcast patriotic pep rally in Norfolk, Va., as allied
leaders weighed whether to widen the eight-day-old operation to
create a safe haven inside Kosovo for tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanian Muslim refugees fleeing murderous evictions by Yugoslav
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the allied commander at NATO headquarters,
said in Brussels that NATO leaders are discussing whether to send
troops from a 12,000-troop allied force stationed in Macedonia into
neighboring Kosovo to establish a sanctuary to protect refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to discuss the allies' capabilities or timing for
such a mission.
</P>
<P>
   A similar idea is being advanced by retired Army Gen. George
Joulwan, who preceded Clark as NATO commander in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Joulwan said he is urging the 19-nation military alliance to
create a ``safe corridor'' for refugees inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Joulwan added in an interview with Hearst Newspapers that merely
preparing to insert allied ground forces into Kosovo could help by
``taking the initiative from Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The former NATO commander said the rapid reaction force in
Macedonia, including 400 U.S. soldiers and about 5,000 British
troops, could move quickly into southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in Norfolk, Va., to hundreds of applauding
military personnel and their relatives shortly after Yugoslav
officials announced in Belgrade that they would court martial the
three U.S. soldiers captured Wednesday by Yugoslav forces while on
patrol along the border between Macedonia and the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken; there is
no basis for them to be held; there is certainly no basis for them
to be tried,'' Clinton declared in remarks in an aircraft hanger as
he stood before a warplane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``President Milosevic should make no mistake: The
United States takes care of its own. And President Milosevic should
make no mistake: We will hold him and his government responsible
for their safety and for their well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's efforts to underscore U.S.
interests in the Balkans appeared to be paying off. An ABC
News-Washington Post survey completed Tuesday showed that the
percentage of respondents who believe that vital U.S. interests are
at stake in the turbulent region has grown from 27 percent two
weeks ago to 47 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made an impassioned appeal for public support at home,
emphasizing that U.S.-led intervention in the Balkans is needed to
``prevent a wider war.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the allied air campaign, Clinton said: ``We've been doing
this for seven days now _ just seven days. We must be determined
and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I ask you also to resolve that we will continue
to carry out our mission with determination and resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to be addressing slackening public support for
the NATO air campaign that has failed to stem the Yugoslav armed
forces' scorched earth campaign against the Kosovars. The air
attacks also have been blamed for Yugoslavia's accelerated
offensive that has uprooted more than 600,000 Muslim residents of
Kosovo and sent more than 120,000 fleeing into neighboring Albania,
Montenegro and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News-Washington Post survey showed Americans' support
for the air strikes has eased somewhat from 60 percent supporting
the effort six days ago to 55 percent favoring the continued air
campaign as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Joulwan put it: ``If the political objective was to prevent
Serb troops from ethnically cleansing and that's not being achieved
with bombing, then you have to come up with Plan B, C or D.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired Army general, who masterminded allied efforts in
Bosnia in 1995 that helped drive Bosnian Serbs to the bargaining
table, added: ``I would hope that some major somewhere has been
trying to figure out what options are available, particularly
ground options.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine who joined the
Clinton administration to head the Pentagon, cited the resolve of
President Theodore Roosevelt and World War II British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill in his appeal for the American people to
``stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added: ``We knew it was not going to be easy.''

`WEIR:' DARK YARNS CASTING LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a story is told well enough, you'll follow it
anywhere, even when it's leading you to places you never intended
to go. Take the plain-spoken, utterly alluring tales unfolded by
the denizens of the rural Irish bar in ``The Weir,'' Conor
McPherson's beautiful and devious new play at the Walter Kerr
Theater. At first, they seem to beckon like comfortingly well-worn
paths into realms of folklore both exotic and familiar, Gaelic
variations on the sorts of campfire ghost stories you recall from
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Then a moment arrives, and it's hard to say exactly when because
you've shed all sense of time, when you realize that you have
strayed into territory that scrapes the soul. Suddenly, the subject
isn't just things that go bump in the night, but the loss and
loneliness that eventually haunt every life. There's a new chill
abroad, evoking something more serious than goose flesh, but there
is also the thrilling warmth that accompanies the flash of insight.
</P>
<P>
   That the audience of ``The Weir,'' which opened on Broadway
Thursday night and was first seen in London two seasons ago, is
surprised and unsettled by this turn from teasing shadows into a
more profound darkness shows that 27-year-old McPherson is a
first-rate spinner of yarns.
</P>
<P>
   That the characters onstage seem equally, and convincingly,
unsettled and surprised by their own narratives shows that
McPherson is a first-rate playwright. Under the seamless, gentle
direction of Ian Rickson, the show's five actors make an
unforgettable case for the impossibility of distinguishing the
teller from the tale.
</P>
<P>
   In its first moments, ``The Weir'' would seem to reflect the
ultimate cliche of a storyteller's opener: ``It was a dark and
stormy night.'' The sounds of ominous winds and driving rains can
be heard beyond the uninhabited set, a scruffy black box of a
barroom designed by Rae Smith. The play's characters arrive at
staggered intervals, slightly blown and bedraggled, seekers of
refuge from the bluster of the outside world. Of course there is a
fire to huddle around.
</P>
<P>
   What McPherson is doing with this standard Gothic equipment is
acknowledging an ages-old tradition, the idea of wayfarers
assembling under siege to swap information and accounts of lives as
they do in Boccaccio's ``Decameron.'' As ``The Weir'' continues, it
makes a vibrant case for the endurance of that tradition and for
the great and essential value of telling stories.
</P>
<P>
   Though a feeling of individual isolation in a baffling and often
hostile world pervades ``The Weir,'' the stories woven by its
characters become solid, if temporary, bridges among them. If the
disturbing mysteries of existence haven't been given explanations,
they have been given forms, and that in itself is a victory. The
notion of the oppressiveness of the immense quiet of country life
recurs in ``The Weir.'' Stories are what break the silence.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the play are four drinking cronies, the kinds
of men who might not have become friends in an urban environment
but who have long ago made a comfortable adjustment to one
another's quirks and temperaments. There is Jack (Jim Norton), who
runs a garage and is the oldest and most theatrically loquacious of
the lot, and Jim (Kieran Ahern), a gentle, slightly slow-witted
odd-jobs man who lives with his aged, ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Finbar (Dermot Crowley) is a splashy fellow who wears a pink
shirt and flashes 20-pound notes and is a local success in real
estate. The pub's owner and bartender is Brendan (Brendan Coyle),
who is the most taciturn of the quartet, which by no means suggests
that he is less eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that a stranger is introduced into
this company, someone whose very presence will change the course of
the men's habitual conversation. One of McPherson's more cunning
inspirations is to make this prototype a woman (played by Michelle
Fairley), a trespasser of sorts in a masculine domain who
automatically raises the level of self-consciousness in the room
and turns each of the men into even more of a performer than he is
normally. Named Valerie, she is a newcomer to the region and has
rented a house from Finbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' is built around five monologues delivered by four
of the characters. All but one have a supernatural element, and
each of them is effectively self-contained. The first, told by Jack
with the flourish of a homespun Danny Kaye, is benignly spooky, a
minor-key tale of fairies and spectral knocks on doors. But it
ingeniously creates a foundation for everything that follows,
opening the floodgates, or the weir (dam) of the title, for an
accelerating rush of revelations that cut closer and closer to the
bone.
</P>
<P>
   To say much more about these stories would be unfair. One can
list a few of their elements without giving too much away; you
learn, for instance, why Finbar quit smoking years ago and why
Valerie has moved from city to country. Everything here, of course,
is in the why, and though Finbar's tale may seem slight in
comparison with Valerie's devastating chapter of autobiography,
they are cut from the same cloth, a shimmering weave of the mundane
and the ineffable.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the stories, in fact, deepens and expands the others.
The order in which they are arranged offers a master lesson in
dramatic construction. A dimension of otherworldly menace is
increasingly heightened in the succeeding monologues until the very
last one, which like the first belongs to Jack. It is a plain story
of lost love, with no ghostly shadows at all, yet it is absolutely
of a piece with everything that has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It is to McPherson's credit that you are aware of these patterns
only after the play is over, and that while you are watching it the
monologues never register as discrete dramatic contrivances. Unlike
the work of another bright light of the British theater, Patrick
Marber (currently represented on Broadway by ``Closer''),
McPherson's doesn't call immediate attention to mechanics and
symmetries.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of ``The Weir'' emerge out of an organic flow of
conversation, partly the formulaic banter among longtime friends,
partly prosaic exchanges on subjects like horse racing and the
foreign visitors who invade the countryside in the summertime.
Rickson and the performers are expert in conveying the
idiosyncratic ritual among drinking buddies, and what happens when
it is disrupted, as when Valerie asks for the unexpected: a glass
of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkable, when you think about it, how little of this
talk is merely atmospheric filler. The play's lyricism is a matter
of steady accumulation rather than bursts of flowery metaphors, a
stealthy poetry reflected even in Paule Constable's exquisitely
graded lighting. Every phrase has its purposeful place and reason,
but the actors never make the mistake of letting on that they know
this.
</P>
<P>
   All have appeared in previous incarnations of the play, and the
ensemble work is so seamless that it seems unjust to single out one
performance. You're always aware of the connections among the
characters onstage, the ways in which they chafe, comfort and
occasionally embarrass each other. A moment in which Jim sits down
stiffly by the newly arrived Valerie is turned into a gloriously
subtle study in social awkwardness by Ahern and Ms. Fairley. What
Coyle does with the simple act of pouring a glass of wine is a sly
comic marvel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Coyle, who won a Laurence Olivier Award (the London equivalent
of the Tony) for his role in ``The Weir,'' is the only character
who doesn't tell a proper story. Yet by the evening's end, you feel
you know Brendan as intimately as any of the others on stage. It's
hard to think of a recent performance in which the act of
listening, by all of the performers, takes on such articulate
dramatic weight.
</P>
<P>
   The monologues of ``The Weir'' are really dialogues between
narrator and listeners, just as every play is a dialogue between
itself and its audience. This fine, stirring and generous
production reminds us of the priceless worth of that exchange. We
may have begun the evening as eavesdroppers; by its end, we have
fully and transportingly joined the conversation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force special operations troops that stand
by to rescue pilots in Yugoslavia and other hot spots are a small
but elite team, enduring grueling training to prepare themselves
for risky work.
</P>
<P>
   When Air Force personnel rescued a downed F-117A stealth fighter
pilot Saturday, Airman 1st Class Fernando Riordan understood why
his training at Lackland Air Force Base is so hard.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a tough person to become a parajumper, or ``PJ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the individual we're looking for, people who won't
quit,'' said Staff Sgt. Kevin Kirby, an instructor at the Air Force
special operations school in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   PJs, known also as pararescuers, begin their training at
Lackland. They handle risky assignments such as extracting downed
pilots and stranded mountain climbers, and they are trained to
rescue crews of the space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   There are 470 pararescuers are among 359,222 active-duty Air
Force personnel. In all, 90 serve in the Air National Guard and 100
are in the Air Force Reserve, said Lt. Denise Kerr, a base
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   All Air Force pararescuers are men. Women are excluded because
the duty requires proficiency in hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   The rigors and glories of PJ duty draw recruits like Riordan and
Senior Airman Kirby Cole to Lackland. But the school's
superintendent, Master Sgt. Rod Alne, advised that only a few will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, around 80 students start 10 weeks of training. On
average, 65 students will wash out, one-third of them after the
first week.
</P>
<P>
   From Lackland, students must undergo 52 more weeks of grueling
training that includes airborne school at Fort Benning, Ga., and
survival training at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Just making it through the first day at Lackland will strain
many recruits, who must swim 75 feet under water, run 1.5 miles in
10:30 minutes and do 50 situps and 50 pushups in 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they graduate, the recruits must run 6 miles in 45
minutes, swim 2.5 miles in 80 minutes and swim six, 75-foot laps
under water.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their second week, Airman Salem Simon and Riordan, 19, of
Concord, Calif., know they won't make it if they fail any test. But
both like their intense training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much the baddest guys walking,'' Simon, 19, of
Buffalo, N.Y., said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary motto is, `That others may live,' and the other
motto that we live by, and the motto that most special operations
forces live by, is `the silent professional,''' Alne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to beat our chests or boast about what we've
done as long as inside we know what we are and what we can do,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has declined to discuss details of the downed
F-117A and the rescue of the American pilot in Yugoslavia, saying
that to do so could reveal sensitive information about the
radar-evading warplane.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Lackland school, the rescue is seen as a success of
the rigorous training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited,'' said Kirby, 29, who made an aborted
pilot rescue mission during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they've been through this training, I know all the
training they've been through, I know the stress level they were
probably thinking, I know the adrenaline rush that's probably going
through them, and sometimes I even wish I was there with them,'' he
added.

 &HT;    NASCAR's rapid growth fuels uncertain future
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its meteoric rise from the backwoods to the big time has been
staggering for NASCAR, now in its 51st stock-car racing season.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's growth has been unprecedented in sports, but for every
plus there's a minus, and the sport faces major issues and
decisions that will shape its future.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million people attended NASCAR's 33 Winston Cup
races last year, a staggering average of 190,940 fans per event,
including qualifying and races. But those fans paid an average
ticket price of around $50 and are finding that their access to the
drivers, the foundation of the sport, is deteriorating because of
corporate demands.
</P>
<P>
   The sport has taken its showcase event _ Winston Cup _ to every
corner of the nation. New tracks are being built and planned in
major markets, including Chicago, Kansas City and New York, and the
competition for race dates is intense. But drivers are concerned
about year-round racing, and the sport's established Southern race
facilities are worried about losing race dates to national
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has refined the sport and created fan-pleasing
speeds, but the cost of that technology is astronomical and has
driven the single-car teams out of the sport. As a result, the
Winston Cup circuit has been dominated by two race teams, and fans
are clamoring that the playing field is not level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting scary to think about where (NASCAR's) going to be
in three or four years,'' said Richard Childress, owner of Dale
Earnhardt's No. 3 Chevrolet team.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the challenge. To say that NASCAR has reached a
crossroads is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've got a pretty good thing going right now,'' said
Bill France Jr., whose father founded the sport in 1949. ``We try
to protect it, and we try to preserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   But France knows it's a delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   During the lean years, the sport was nurtured by a Southern
grass-roots following and endured because of its ability to adapt.
But times aren't lean for NASCAR in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate money is flowing, and the issues are real.
</P>
<P>
   Less access a threat
</P>
<P>
   to grass-roots loyalty
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for NASCAR's popularity has been the personality of
its drivers and their accessibility to the fans and media. NASCAR
officials say they take pride in being the only sport to offer fans
an open locker room _ the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's gotten us where we are is our open locker
room policy,'' said Brian France, senior vice president of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But the influx of major corporate sponsors has put more demands
on drivers, who already are spending more time on the road and less
at their shops. The garage area has become a corporate gathering
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest problem for drivers today is the demands
on their time,'' said Ricky Rudd, owner and driver of the No. 10
Ford. ``In the late 1970s and early '80s, we'd sit on the pit wall
and sign autographs for two hours. It wasn't just Richard Petty
doing it; everybody did it. But back then, you didn't have to be
somewhere Monday or Tuesday. Now, everyone is trying to catch a
flight, because they've got somewhere to be on Monday. ... There
are more sponsors on the car now, and there are responsibilities
that come with sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer, says the group
nearly instituted an autograph policy before this season. Drivers
would have been available for autographs after the race, but the
garage area, where most autographs are requested, would have been a
signature-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers tell us their concern is, `We don't want to be known
as guys who don't want to give an autograph,''' Helton said. ``We
were ready to take the hit and say if you do give an autograph,
we're going to penalize you.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon says the days spent away from
the track are what burn out most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big sport now,'' said Gordon. ``There's a lot of
money involved, a lot of sponsors with commitments for the drivers
and the crew chiefs that keep you busy. You've got to learn how to
say no. You've got to ... make sure you're fulfilling your
commitments, but most of all you've got to fulfill your commitment
to the race team and to what really is making this all go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to the garage area, once a haven for fans, is now tightly
monitored. ``NASCAR has gotten so strict about who comes in the
garage area that you can't even get your own kids in anymore,''
Kyle Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, who owns two Winston Cup teams, says drivers are
still signing autographs, but there's not enough time to sign them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was accessible, I was accessible to 20,000 people,'' he
said. ``These guys have to be accessible to 120,000 people. (It)
makes it a little bit different. Also, they can't get to the people
because the press is in the way. There's almost as much press now
as there used to be fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These drivers are really operating and talking and signing
more autographs than I did, but there are so many more people that
they're missing so many. They're handling just as many people as we
ever handled. There's just so many more people that you get
complaints now that you didn't get back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some radical ideas
</P>
<P>
   for a bigger schedule
</P>
<P>
   This year's Winston Cup schedule runs through late November and
consists of 34 points races and two non-points events. While some
owners are asking for a second race at existing speedways, several
new tracks are being planned. How big can the Winston Cup season
get?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Bud Shootout and The Winston (non-points events),
we've got 36 weekends in '99,'' said Helton. ``The issue is, can we
make it 37 or 38 or 39? We think there is still room. We just don't
know how much room.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR obviously believes there's still plenty. International
Speedway Corp., the sister company of NASCAR, owns six tracks and
half of the facility in Martinsville, Va., and is in the early
stages of building tracks in Kansas City and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Penske Motorsports, which operates several racing facilities
with Cup races, is planning a track outside Denver. Other groups
are building or planning tracks in Baltimore, Kentucky and
Nashville. Real estate mogul Donald Trump and International
Speedway Corp., owner of Daytona, Talladega and three other tracks,
have announced plans to build a superspeedway in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has reached such an unbelievable degree of popularity
that you have to sell it into every potential major market,'' owner
Michael Kranefuss said. ``I think we are pretty much covering the
whole of the United States, with respect to the coastal areas. But
I think the center _ Kansas City, Denver and Chicago _ is extremely
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers are apprehensive about expanding the schedule,
which already covers 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough deal,'' driver John Andretti said. ``You want to
grow quickly, because it's exciting to grow fast. But you want to
grow with some control, because it's easy for any business to
outgrow itself. ... As a driver, I want to race every day. If it
was strictly a driving thing, I'd say let's run four or five times
a week. Of course, that's not very realistic. The crews wouldn't be
able to keep up. You'd never have enough cars. The costs would be
astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   France Jr. says he has no plans of taking away dates from
current track owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a track owner and say you need to repave your
track, he's going to say, `I'm not even sure if I'm going to have a
race next year.' It's very volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith, who owns six tracks, thinks he has the answer:
splitting the sport, like baseball, into an American and National
League.
</P>
<P>
   France frowns at the idea, instead offering a proposal of
teammates sharing driving time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cure,'' Smith said. ``You'd have to have two
leagues, then you could run 60 events, instead of the 30 or 40
you're running now. One day, if everybody in the sport wants to
grow together, they'd want to go to two leagues. It's been
discussed for three or four years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says his plan, which would put one league on the East
Coast and the other on the West Coast on a given weekend, would
offer drivers more chances at seat time and victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a potential sponsor, you're interested in your car
winning,'' he said. ``Your car might win eight times in the
American League, but in the Winston Cup we're running today, you
might not finish in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the promoters and NASCAR would have to work very hard
to develop those `name drivers.' We don't know how many Jeff
Gordons or Mark Martins are out there. There are probably a lot of
great drivers out there, but they don't have the seat time.''
</P>
<P>
   France says track owners and promoters would never warm to the
idea of Gordon and Earnhardt driving on opposite sides of the
country and adds that sponsors are another important consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a race in Texas and Bobby Labonte isn't racing
there, the first thing that's going to happen is Joe Gibbs is going
to come to me and say he's got to be there because Excide
Batteries' corporate headquarters is there,'' France said. ``You
could never tell someone which league they're going to be in.''

 &HT;    Several Winston Cup drivers to race this weekend
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Winston Cup drivers are enjoying a rare weekend off for
Easter, but racing fans still can watch action in NASCAR's other
two series.
</P>
<P>
   A few Cup drivers will be competing in this weekend's BellSouth
Mobility 320 at Nashville Speedway. Among the drivers attempting to
qualify for the Busch Grand National race are Cup regulars Geoffrey
Bodine, Buckshot Jones, Kevin Lepage, Sterling Marlin, Joe
Nemecheck and Elliott Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a Winston Cup rookie from Tucker, will replace Larry
Pearson in the No. 00 Pontiac. Pearson injured his lower back in
last week's Busch race at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Craftsman Truck series will be celebrating the 100th race in
its five-year history, in Saturday's NAPA Card 200 at Evergreen
Speedway in Monroe, Wash., 4:30 p.m., ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers _ Rick Carelli, Ron Hornaday, Butch Miller, Joe
Ruttman and Jack Sprague _ can collect a $100,000 bonus by winning
the race. They're the only drivers who have competed in every event
since the series' inception in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raced for $100,'' Ruttman said. ``If we won, we paid our
expenses and were able to race the next week. It wasn't a lot, but
we did it for fun. That's why we still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers resting
</P>
<P>
   following injuries
</P>
<P>
   Several Winston Cup drivers can use the open date. Mike Skinner,
who fell from first to ninth in the standings points the last two
races, cracked his right shoulder blade in a hard crash last week
at Texas. It's the same shoulder Skinner injured at Texas a year
ago. He's undergoing physical therapy this week, and owner Richard
Childress will have a relief driver standing by at Bristol on April
11.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has sore ribs and a badly bruised shoulder coming
off the worst finish of his career. Jimmy Spencer complained of
soreness after the Primestar 500 and skipped a testing session at
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's team
</P>
<P>
   penalized again
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough week for Skinner. His Busch team was fined by
NASCAR officials for the second time in four races, although this
fine wasn't quite as expensive. Skinner lost the winner's purse at
Atlanta last month after post-race inspection turned up illegal
cylinder heads. On Tuesday, C.R. Miller, his crew chief, was fined
$1,000 for illegal parts.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner was caught cheating after he wrecked during last
Thursday's practice. NASCAR officials found holes drilled in the
car's frame. It's one of the oldest tricks in racing and is
designed to make the metal lighter. The holes also were found in
his backup car. Skinner withdrew from this week's Nashville race.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legend
</P>
<P>
   back to the track
</P>
<P>
   Junior Johnson, who won 50 races in 14 seasons, 1953-66, returns
to racing as a consultant for Sasser Motorsports, which makes its
debut at Nashville this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who sold his Winston Cup team to Brett Bodine in 1995,
doesn't have a financial investment in the venture and won't be
involved in the day-to-day operations. But Johnson says he'll help
the team in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some great offers to get back into racing,'' Johnson
said. ``Just six months ago, I had an offer to come back and head
up a big-time, competitive Winston Cup team. I just thanked them
for remembering me and said, `No, thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cook will drive the No. 65 Chevy of Sasser Motorsports,
which plans on racing in five events this year and adding a second
car next season.

   WASHINGTON _ The Kosovo war could be the unmaking of Vice
President Al Gore, who is stuck with defending the administration's
policy, and the making of GOP presidential candidate John McCain,
who is free to be a tough-minded hawk without bearing
responsibility for any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario, of course, is vastly premature, although the
armchair generals are already on television second-guessing the
bombing and finding it militarily inadequate, politically unwise
and a tragic repetition of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's critics have not had the courage to call for
NATO to retreat and completely abandon the Kosovar Alabanians being
forced from their homes and their country by Yugoslavia's
bloodthirsty President Slobodan Milosevic. Instead they have been
picking away at the president's already damaged credibility,
questioning his judgment, NATO's timing, the apparent lack of an
exit strategy and public confusion about just why we are there.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may have a window of two weeks in which to
sell the U.S.-led intervention in the Balkans to the voters and
demonstrate that an expanded bombing strategy may yet work without
resorting to ground troops. After that, Congress returns from its
traditional spring recess, and the doubting voices now on vacation
may be raised in unison against the commander-in-chief's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both the president and vice president, fully aware
that public opposition to the Vietnam War was partially due to
President Lyndon Johnson's failure to explain its strategic
importance, are making a concerted effort to articulate the reasons
behind the bombing campaign. And despite the professed puzzlement
of doves and Clinton-bashers, there are indeed powerful reasons _
humanitarian, economic and strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that the bombing campaign precipitated and
accelerated Milosovic's cruelty are reckless and uninformed. In
fact, the opposite is true. NATO started too late and probably with
too little.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Tex, was
typical of the armchair generals. He whined that Clinton ``had not
made the effective case about how American interests are vitally
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Armey have us do if he feels no American interests
are involved? Pull a cowardly retreat, give up our claim to being
the world's greatest superpower, reaffirm Milosevic's dictatorship,
encourage Balkan instability and leave the Kosovars to their fate
as stateless, homeless people? Stick our heads in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   There is convincing evidence that Milosevic had been plotting
the massive obliteration of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo
since at least October. But President Clinton and Congress were
preoccupied with the 1998 election and the impeachment charade. By
the time they got around to confronting the Balkan reality, 40,000
Serbian troops were massed for a rampage in Kosovo, peace
negotiations had collapsed and there was no alternative to military
action.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the bombing campaign to immediately bring
Milosevic to his knees is disappointing but not proof that we are
permanently militarily impotent. Clinton justifiably complained in
an interview March 31 with CBS' Dan Rather that ``everybody wants
things to operate like a 30-second ad. This air campaign is not a
30-second ad.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when e-mail allows Kosovars to reach the outside
world and Internet hackers can cripple NATO's Web site for several
days, air campaigns cannot go on forever without definitive
results.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the 2000 presidential campaign, which does
come close to being a 30-second ad, at least in the sense that at
this early stage quick favorable impressions can make a difference.
And the candidate most worth listening to is McCain, the former
Vietnam POW who has a reputation for courageous domestic views and
military common sense.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reactions have been remarkably sound and persuasive. No
beating around the bush here, waiting for public opinion to jell.
He says we have a strategic interest in the Balkans and that it is
pointless to look backward toward what might have happened had we
acted differently earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In USA Today, McCain says, ``We must all keep our nerve. We are
the superior power, and any sign of hesitation or doubt on our part
will only worsen the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid to suggest the deployment of ground troops, a
dangerous escalation that the administration still publicly
opposes. (Although Clinton and his advisers have conspicuously
never said ``never.'')
</P>
<P>
   In his article, McCain calls for an immediate ``manifold
increase in the violence'' against Serbia proper and the Serb
forces in Kosovo. He warns that there will be ``significant ''
civilian casualties in Belgrade and American deaths as well, but he
believes the sacrifice is necessary for the cause. ``We must use
all the force necessary to hasten this war's end,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gore echoes the administration policy of barring the use of
American ground troops. Campaigning in New Hampshire this week, he
said we would not ``put troops into a combat situation over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the current bombing strategy continues to have little
effect, political pressure will grow on the administration and NATO
to send in troops on the ground to counter the Serbian bullies and
allow the ethnic Albanians to return.
</P>
<P>
   Troops in large numbers would be a difficult decision in any
case. No president likes to put young men and women in harm's way.
But it is emotionally wrenching and politically troublesome for a
president who ducked a regional war (Vietnam) when he was expected
to fight it now having to justify a different war when he asks
others to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we elect presidents to make tough decisions. If they were
easy, we could make them ourselves. Clinton must do what is
necessary, as McCain urges.

 &HT;    AID EFFORTS IN BOSNIA NEAR STANDSTILL
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia has had the
unintended effect of paralyzing international aid efforts in the
Serb-controlled half of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our personnel that have been withdrawn from the (Serb
Republic) are very, very anxious to get back,'' said Nicole Szulc
(CQ), spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe. ``They are very concerned that their work could suffer
as a result of inactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization runs elections in Bosnia and conducts democracy
training for political candidates. The training has been suspended
because of the evacuation. That means the 47 staffers who have been
pulled out are unable to prepare for elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has evacuated staffers working in diplomatic
and development missions in the Serb Republic, as have several
other embassies and most non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all international projects to rebuild housing,
infrastructure and businesses and to clear mine fields have been
put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The few agencies that are still working in the area are relying
on Bosnian Serb staffers. But even those workers are taking
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved our cars to safe places and we've taken down the
(sign) on our office,'' said, Milica Kakotovic (CQ BOTH), the
country director for the Oxfam relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombing began, several incidents have persuaded
international officials who didn't move initially to leave. A
library run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Visegrad, a hard-line Serb town on the border with
Yugoslavia, was slightly damaged by a rifle-launched grenade
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, British and Austrian embassy field offices in
Banja Luka, the capital of the Serb Republic, were lightly damaged
Friday night by rock-throwing mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations World Food Program office in Banja Luka also
was attacked recently and several U.N. vehicles have been destroyed
by grenades since the bombing began. So far, there have been no
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that there have been a succession of events
that have increased the tension in the Serb republic,'' said Simon
Haselock, spokesman for the Office of the High Representative, the
agency in charge of implementing the Dayton Peace Accords in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare it with other parts of the world, it is
relatively insignificant,'' he added, noting the violence has been
on a par with that of a soccer riot in England.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accords agency has left a skeleton staff in Banja
Luka, while closing five other offices.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation comes at a particularly sensitive time in the
Serbian part of Bosnia. It has been tense since March 3, when
Carlos Westendorp (CQ), the international supervisor for Bosnia,
fired the president of the Serb Republic for actions Westendorp
said undermined the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, international officials announced the north
Bosnia town of Brcko would be an independent district, removing it
from Serb control and effectively splitting the Serb Republic in
two.
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions prompted demonstrations throughout the Serb
Republic and protests from Serb politicians both in the Serb state
and in the national government. The most significant came from
Zivko Radisic (CQ BOTH), the chairman of the national presidency.
Radisic suspended his cooperation with the national government.
Without him the three-member presidency cannot act.
</P>
<P>
   The state government is also in crisis because the fired
president has not been replaced.

   ``We've moved our cars to safe places and we've taken down the
(sign) on our office,'' said, Milica Kakotovic (CQ BOTH), the
country director for the Oxfam relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombing began, several incidents have persuaded
international officials who didn't move initially to leave. A
library run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Visegrad, a hard-line Serb town on the border with
Yugoslavia, was slightly damaged by a rifle-launched grenade
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, British and Austrian embassy field offices in
Banja Luka, the capital of the Serb Republic, were lightly damaged
Friday night by rock-throwing mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations World Food Program office in Banja Luka also
was attacked recently and several U.N. vehicles have been destroyed
by grenades since the bombing began. So far, there have been no
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that there have been a succession of events
that have increased the tension in the Serb republic,'' said Simon
Haselock, spokesman for the Office of the High Representative, the
agency in charge of implementing the Dayton Peace Accords in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare it with other parts of the world, it is
relatively insignificant,'' he added, noting the violence has been
on a par with that of a soccer riot in England.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accords agency has left a skeleton staff in Banja
Luka, while closing five other offices.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation comes at a particularly sensitive time in the
Serbian part of Bosnia. It has been tense since March 3, when
Carlos Westendorp (CQ), the international supervisor for Bosnia,
fired the president of the Serb Republic for actions Westendorp
said undermined the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, international officials announced the north
Bosnia town of Brcko would be an independent district, removing it
from Serb control and effectively splitting the Serb Republic in
two.
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions prompted demonstrations throughout the Serb
Republic and protests from Serb politicians both in the Serb state
and in the national government. The most significant came from
Zivko Radisic (CQ BOTH), the chairman of the national presidency.
Radisic suspended his cooperation with the national government.
Without him the three-member presidency cannot act.
</P>
<P>
   The state government is also in crisis because the fired
president has not been replaced.

BABY BOOMERS DISCOVER ONCE-SHUNNED WAIKIKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With WAIKIKI-IF-GO)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAIKIKI, Oahu _ Sunset is falling on Diamond Head, outrigger
canoes are surfing in on the day's last wave and up and down
Waikiki Beach, tiki torches are flickering to life.
</P>
<P>
   At the Halekulani Hotel's House Without a Key bar, a genteel,
older crowd is sipping orchid-laced mai tais and watching former
Miss Hawaii Kanoe Miller dance a sensuous hula as Sonny Kamahele
and the Islanders play ``Little Grass Shack.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the beach, at Duke's Canoe Club, the dance floor is a
roiling sea of taut, bronzed flesh _ buff young surfers sporting
Maori tattoos on their bare backs and women with pieced navels in
thong bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously missing from this scene is one group: baby
boomers. My generation has generally made a point of skipping
Waikiki, shuddering at the highrise hotels and crowded beaches as
we hurry to board our connecting flights to Maui or Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   Curious to see what we've been missing all these years, I
recently visited Waikiki, armed with my friend Lynn Ferrin's
advice: ``If you think of it as an idyllic beach spoiled by
development, you'll probably hate it. But if you think of it as a
vibrant Pacific city with the best beach of any city in the world,
you'll have a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   I went looking for the Hawaii of my parents' generation, a
Hawaii that the twentysomething cocktail-culture crowd is
rediscovering: The Waikiki of the old Matson Liners, of
floral-print aloha shirts and grass skirt hulas, of tiki bars and
umbrella drinks and Don Ho.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have recently begun to play up this theme,
instituting a sunset torch-lighting ceremony along Kalakaua Avenue,
Waikiki's main drag, and reviving the old Boat Days celebrations,
in which arriving and departing cruise ships are greeted by hula
dancers, leis tossed into the water, choruses of ``Aloha 'oe,'' and
_ if the logistics can be worked out _ coin divers.
</P>
<P>
   My first stop was a ramshackle old store in a semi-residential
neighborhood, five blocks from the beach. For lovers of classic
aloha shirts, Bailey's Antiques is Lourdes, Mecca and
Bloomingdale's all rolled into one: a dizzying, floor-to-ceiling
sartorial celebration of palm trees, hula dancers, pineapples,
orchid leis, long-board surfers, tiki heads, Pan Am Clippers,
ukuleles and erupting volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Racks sag under the weight of more than 5,000 aloha shirts, from
original 1940s beauties that sell for $2,500 and more, to
floral-print cotton and rayon designs, to shimmering new silk
reproductions of the old classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1940s were the golden age of aloha shirts,'' explained
owner David Bailey as he led me past display cases of dashboard
hula dolls and used Hilo Hattie records. ``In the '70s, the Tom
Selleck orchid look took over and things went into the doldrums.
Now they've started to reproduce the old ones, and the aloha shirt
is having a renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   After agonized deliberation _ I was tempted by a dazzling copy
of the Frank MacIntosh design that Matson Line waiters wore in the
1940s _ I chose a tasteful ginger blossom design on a tangerine
background, an early '50s pattern reproduced on luscious silk.
</P>
<P>
   I was wearing it as I strode into the open-air lobby of the
Halekulani Hotel. To my parents' and grandparents' generations,
there were just three Waikiki hotels worth considering: the pink,
Moorish Royal Hawaiian; the colonial, banyon tree-shaded Moana
Surfrider (now a Sheraton) and the five-diamond Halekulani, which
was modernized and expanded with a substantial makeover in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   To enter these classic hotels is to step through a portal into
another place and time. One leaves the frazzle and dazzle of
Kalakaua Avenue behind and joins a more refined, trade wind-cooled
world that hasn't changed much in style since the days when waiters
and clerks paddled outrigger canoes out to ocean liners to present
arriving guests with leis.
</P>
<P>
   The Halekulani is famed for its service. Guests register not at
the front counter, but in their rooms. Chocolates, fruit bowls and
miniature conch shell souvenirs are delivered to all guests _ VIPs
and civilians alike. From our balcony, Jeri and I could look down
Waikiki Beach to Diamond Head, watch surfers riding the waves and
listen to the ukulele-backed harmonies of Sonny Kamahele and the
Islanders bubbling up from the terrace below. I was already
beginning to suspect I hadn't given Waikiki a fair chance all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one person who has come to embody this corner of
Hawaii, it's Don Ho, the ``Dean Martin of Waikiki,'' who's been
performing nightly here for more than 35 years. In the evening we
crossed Kalakaua Avenue to the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel, where we
found a table in the Hoku Hale Showroom and ordered a round of mai
tais.
</P>
<P>
   It was a full house, and the crowd was a microcosm of Waikiki:
Lots of white-haired septuagenarians in matching shirts and
muumuus, plus a smattering of young Rat Pack wannabes who revere Ho
the way they do Tony Bennett and swing music. In recent years,
members of such alternative bands as Green Day, Porno for Pyros and
Foo Fighters have dropped by to catch Ho's show.
</P>
<P>
   After posing for pictures out in the lobby, Ho sauntered out
onto the stage, took a seat behind a console in a big
Morticia-style wicker chair and launched straight into his biggest
hit:
</P>
<P>
   Tiny bubbawwws
</P>
<P>
   In da wine
</P>
<P>
   Make me happy
</P>
<P>
   Make me feel fine
</P>
<P>
   ``I sing `Tiny Bubbles' twice each night,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, at the beginning, in case some of you don't make it all
the way through the show. And again at the end, for people my age
who can't remember if we've done it already.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was a surprisingly endearing mix of old Hawaii
standards _ ``Pearly Shells,'' ``Shack Down By the Sea'' _ corny
jokes and audience participation. ``Sing a song, tell a joke or buy
the round a house,'' Ho announced. Free champagne was sent to the
tables of couples married 50 years or more _ there were at least
half a dozen of them on this night _ veterans, current members of
the military, newlyweds, anyone celebrating a birthday and, it
seemed, just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The following day Ho agreed to show me around his Waikiki. We
walked down Kalakaua Avenue to the International Marketplace, where
Ho made his reputation playing at the original site of Duke's in
the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were lined up all the way out to the street, and we'd
play until 3:30 in the morning,'' he said. ``This was the center of
the universe in the '60s. Any celebrity passing through town would
come by to sit in with us _ one night we'd have Marlon Brando
beating on the congas; the next night it would be Bill Cosby. Frank
Sintra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Bob Hope _ they'd all end up on stage
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ho why he thought the baby-boom generation abandoned
Waikiki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to blame,'' Ho said of himself and his contemporaries.
``In the '60s and '70s we told them to get out of here and go to
the outer islands _ and they never came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the next generation seems like they're bored with the
outer islands. They're coming back here because this is where the
nightlife is, where the action is. I've been around long enough to
know these things go in cycles. Nowadays, with the younger people,
the honeymooners still go to Maui _ but the singles all come to
Waikiki.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ho, who still keeps an eye on the local club scene, likes the
new Duke's, Rumors, Scruples and Esprit for nightlife. And, of
course, the Waikiki Beachcomber. ``Almost every night we get
someone in their 20s who says, `My grandmother told me I had to
come see you,''' Ho said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   heading toward Diamond Head, we reached the beach-side statue of
Duke Kahanamoku, ``the father of international surfing,'' with his
hands outstretched papally and draped with flower leis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we'd hang out surfing all day,'' Ho recalled.
``In the evening we'd sit around and get out the ukuleles and make
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho remembers Kalakaua Avenue in the 1950s and '60s as a rowdy
place, where you'd often find sailors fighting in the street
outside the bars. Today it's lined with ABC stores (the ubiquitous
suntan lotion-and-beach towel shops; if you're not standing
directly in front of one, move 10 steps in either direction and you
will be) and shimmering, rarefied boutiques with the buffed-brass
nameplates of Cartier, Gucci, Prada, Chanel, Ferragamo and Tiffany.
The price tags are all in Japanese, but the stores are virtually
empty these days. As one clerk lamented to me: ``The Japanese are
still coming, but they're not spending like they used to. They're
not shopping here; they're heading to the outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day Jeri and I strolled down Waikiki Beach on
powdery white sand that for years has been barged in from the
island of Molokai, because hotel sea walls have altered the natural
process of sand accretion. We wove our way in and out of sunbathing
families of Japanese tourists (the clerk was right about that
part); basted, pinkening Midwesterners; knots of local surfers and
young hipsters who appeared to be sleeping off hangovers. This is
hardly the beach for solitude, but for people-watching it's tough
to beat.
</P>
<P>
   At a little thatch-roofed beach shack next to the Royal
Hawaiian, we stopped to take advantage of one of the greatest
tourist bargains in Hawaii _ or anywhere else, for that matter: an
outrigger canoe ride.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Waikiki tradition even older than Don Ho. I've seen
paintings of tourists riding outriggers in the 1920s and '30s, and
except for the addition of some highrise hotels it hasn't changed a
bit. Nor, it seems, has the price: You still get to ride three
waves for $5.
</P>
<P>
   While we waited for a few others to sign up, we chatted with
Dickie C-Kee, who's worked at the shack for more than 30 years and
once, he said, taught Frank Sinatra to surf.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come and go, but Waikiki is pretty much the same
place,'' he said. ``Same beach, same surf.''
</P>
<P>
   When three other tourists showed up, a muscled, tattooed beach
boy named Eddie had us drag the long, narrow canoe into the
bathtub-warm water, slide in and start paddling out toward the
surf: 14 strokes on the left, 14 on the right _ just like in the
Don Ho song.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining speed, we smacked into the face of an incoming wave and
were briefly airborne before landing with a splash that soaked
everyone. Out beyond the break, where the surfers sat on their
boards and waited, we turned around and let several swells pass
beneath us before Eddie gave the order to start paddling.
</P>
<P>
   The next swell suddenly lifted the tail of the canoe, and there
was an giddying surge of acceleration as we caught the wave and
hurtled toward shore. A rainbow arched over Diamond Head, the pink
towers of the Royal Hawaiian glowed in the late-afternoon sun _ and
if there was more fun to be had anywhere for $5, I would like to
know about it.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset I ambled back down the beach to the Duke Kahanamoku
statue. As night began to fall, three bare-chested Hawaiian men in
red wrap-around skirts and ceremonial yellow shoulder-coverings
blew on conch shells and began lighting the tiki torches along
Kalakaua Avenue. At a nearby stage, young girls wearing leis and
flowers in their hair danced a hula to ``Little Grass Shack'' _
there's no escaping the song in Waikiki _ before a crowd of
delighted tourists armed with lawn chairs and camcorders.

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The East Texas town of Huntsville is best
known for its prison and a succession of executions. But today the
town is festooned with yellow ribbons because one of the U.S. Army
soldiers captured on the border of Macedonia and Kosovo, Spec.
Steven M. Gonzales, calls Huntsville home. Gonzalez's family lives
in Huntsville, where his father is a prison employee, and he
graduated from high school in another East Texas town, Palestine.

 &HT;    SOLDIERS' CAPTURE LIKELY TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION _ BUT HOW?
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The capture of three U.S. soldiers by Yugoslav
forces will bring the war home to Americans, but their plight could
shift public opinion either for or against President Clinton's
policy, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Americans awoke Friday to televised images of the bruised and
battered faces of Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 24, of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Images have a great impact,'' said Lou Klarevas, a George
Washington University foreign policy professor who studied how
public opinion affected the ill-fated 1993 peacekeeping mission to
Somalia. ``It puts an American human face on the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   After Americans saw scenes of an American soldier's corpse being
dragged through the dust of Mogadishu and the beaten face of U.S.
helicopter pilot Michael Durant, support for the Somalia mission
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But there was disagreement whether this week's captures have the
potential to erode public backing for the NATO strikes in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the captured soldiers ``makes people uncomfortable. It
makes them mad,'' said Steve Kull, pollster for the Program for
International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland's
Center for International Security Studies. ``It dampens their
enthusiasm for the mission, but doesn't necessarily lead them to
want to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, public interest in the Kosovo mission is high and
support has been growing, Kull said. ``The public is more likely to
feel angry'' over the soldiers' capture, he predicted, leading to
more interest and more support.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sands, an analyst for the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, said the opposite effect was possible.
</P>
<P>
   If the public feels ``we are winning'' in Yugoslavia, it will be
willing to accept some casualties, Sands said _ as was true in the
Persian Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But people will react differently ``if the intangible sense is
that we are losing,'' Sands said, adding, ``I think the intangible
sense is that this isn't going very well. That makes people want
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodding Carter, the State Department spokesman during the Carter
administration, said the eventual policy effect of the captured
Americans ``depends almost entirely on how the administration plays
it'' and how the news media reacts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter administration officials spoke often about American
hostages in Iran and the news media focused on the issue, he said.
The Reagan administration, by contrast, ``decided never to talk''
about American hostages being held in Beirut and ``the media could
not sustain coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that three American soldiers being held by the
enemy in a multi-nation mission to stop the killing of thousands of
ethnic Albanians, Carter said. ``In what context do you place this?
If the administration stands steady, they will overcome it with
policy _ if they have a policy to overcome it with.''

   YUGOSLAVIA, KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia threatens to place
three captured American soldiers on trial friday; other military
and refugee developments in the NATO strikes against Yugoslavia.
(Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   w/KOSOVO-CLINTON _ NORFOLK, Va. _ President Clinton warned
Yugoslavia on Thursday to treat three captured soldiers with care
and to ``make no mistake: the United States takes care of its
own.'' Clinton's speech to military families here was largely
devoted to defending NATO's conduct of the war. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CAPTURED-GONZALES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to find out what we
can about Steven Gonzales, the soldier from Huntsville who is
missing in Macedonia. Gonzales was a well-liked, academically
gifted high school student who left Texas A&AMP;M after his freshman
year because he wanted to join the elite Army Ranger corps.
(Kelley, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CAPTIVES _ WASHINGTON _ Until now, the American bombing
campaign in Yugoslavia has been a distant news event for most
Americans. But the capture of three U.S. soldiers in Yugoslavia,
and their appearance on Serb television, suddenly has brought the
conflict home. Will the images of captured Army soldiers stir
public sentiment as it did when U.S. soldiers were captured in the
Gulf War? And how might that translate into pressure on the Clinton
administration? (Dart, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-JOURNAL _ KUKES, Albania _ The human suffering of the
thousands of Kosovar Albanian refugees pouring across the border
into Albania is an emotional sight for even hardened reporters. Cox
Newspapers correspondent Bert Roughton Jr. offers a personal view
of the event he is covering. (Roughton, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BOSNIA _ SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ The NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia has had the unintented effect of partially paralyzing
international efforts in neighboring Bosnia. Most international
officials and aid workers have pulled out of the Serb-controlled
half of Bosnia, suspending operations there and closing their
offices. (Nesmith, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CNN _ ATLANTA _ Behind the scenes at CNN for coverage of
Kosovo. We concentrate on the International Desk, sort of the air
traffic controllers of CNN coverage, a multi-national, multilingual
bunch who work in the trenches. (Kloer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-MURDERS _ MEXICO CITY _ A man linked to a rash of
unsolved murders of women in Juarez confessed in court Thursday to
violently assaulting a 14-year-old girl who escaped from him. The
suspect, Jesus Manuel Guardado Marquez, was a bus driver who
ferried women to the city's maquiladora factories. He has
implicated eight other drivers in murders there. Meanwhile, U.S.
authorities are investigating whether a man arrested for sexual
torture crimes in New Mexico _ not far from Juarez _ could have
also committed some of the murders in Juarez. (Ferris, Cox News
Service) Moving in international and general news categories.
</P>
<P>
   NATION
</P>
<P>
   VIDALIA-ILLEGALWORKERS _ The spring harvest of south Georgia's
famed sweet Vidalia onions _ scheduled to begin in about two weeks
_ may dodge the bitter conflicts that erupted in the fields last
year when government agents swooped down to round up workers they
suspected of being illegal aliens. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
workers fled and part of the $90 million crop died in the dirt.
Now, growers are taking steps to hire only legal workers this year,
experts say. (Davis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   GALOTTO-RECORD _ Tonight's giant jackpot, the largest ever in
Georgia, will join the growing trove of state lottery lore. Among
the fascinating tales: the woman who sent a copy of her winning
ticket to her ex-hubby; the man who waited six months to collect
because he had spent his money too quickly the first time he won;
the woman who won $8.5 million, but still bought her wardrobe at
Dollar General because ``I just don't see spending any more money
than you have to''; and the worst odds in the history of the Big
Game _ tonight's. (Steiden, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   w/WINNING _ What to do ``when'' you win the $150 mill. Tongue in
cheek, obviously, but with real advice on such things as whether to
take lump sum or anual payments; what to tell people asking for a
handout; what to do about your security; whether to quit your job;
who NOT to tell. (Hendrick, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ESCORTS _ CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As hundreds of cars queued for the
short drive to bury Kenneth Swayney, his widow, Theresa, looked
back from the family car and smiled ruefully. So many cared, she
thought, feeling comforted. That memory compelled the usually
reserved Swayney into a City Council committee meeting here
recently to fight for a dying Southern tradition: police escorts
that enable mourners to form a procession from funeral home or
church to the cemetery. (Riddle, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

FANS DEMAND JUSTICE FOR `VENGEANCE UNLIMITED'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The letters arrive in bunches, tersely worded and tightly
written, double- and single-spaced, long and short, computer-formal
and ballpoint-pen-scribbled. All expound on the dramatically
pleasing virtues of a television series that few tube voyeurs have
bothered to sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited,'' the low-rated drama starring Michael
Madsen as a mysterious vigilante who exacts terrifying revenge to
aid the wronged, is dying a torturous death at the hands of a
less-than-patient ABC. Those feeling the potential loss are making
a last-ditch effort to snatch the drama from the jaws of
cancellation, to reverse a decision that has probably already been
made.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's programming gurus continue to say publicly how much they
``like'' and ``believe in'' the series; that the last thing they
want to do is take an ax to its knees and watch it fall.
</P>
<P>
   Having heard this rhetoric before (only the name of the show
changes) the show's producers and viewers have banded together in
an intriguing tag team, reaching out to network chiefs Jamie Tarses
and Stu Bloomberg by asking TV critics, writers and other media
observers to take another look and make another evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of critical do-over, if you will. They hope this campaign
will remind ABC that critically acclaimed productions should be
held to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign started innocently enough: The acerbic critic of
Entertainment Weekly backpedaled on his earlier thrashing of the
drama, which he called an ``admirably lunatic attempt'' by a
hit-hungry network wanting to counterprogram against NBC's
``Friends.'' That comedy proceeded to rip ``Vengeance'' to ratings
shreds. (ABC's spin is that the series did well in targeted demos.)
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just EW's Ken Tucker who thought Madsen's portrayal of
a guy referred to only as ``Mr. Chapel'' was something from the
dark side of a bar stool. Just as fair was the media's questioning
of whether audiences would accept a shady character who seemed to
be teetering on the fringes of sheer madness.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's reversal came via EW's online service; a printed
version of his piece is tucked into the envelope of each letter
I've received.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign asserts that reviewers had watched one, maybe two
of the 16 episodes, made their critical call and went back to
watching and touting ``ER'' and HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' cinematic
pleasures that quickened the pulse from the start.
</P>
<P>
   This irks ``Vengeance'' co-creator John McNamara and other
producers whose pilots are panned early and left to die, giving
networks reasons to put promotional dollars elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a show is good and it gets better,'' says McNamara, whose
previous credits are ``Profit'' and the delicious ``Spy Game.''
``People will find it because it's so much crap out there. But
they've got to be ``told'' that it's there from the network and
from critics. Otherwise you're taking away what's so glorious about
series television: the ability to improve on the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike films, television shows are living mechanisms, evolving,
having good nights and bad, deepening, softening, becoming more
character-driven, more demographically astute, etc.
</P>
<P>
   A theory on ``Vengeance'' is that viewers and critics were
thrown by a series featuring a hero who basically tortures people
and asks us to be amused by it. McNamara insisted on infusing the
series with black comedy, which is fine, but viewers need to stay
with the show to actually ``get'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact for producers is that we as viewers and critics
rarely return to a series that fails to get our attention in the
first few minutes, let alone the first few episodes. It's a result
of the dizzying wealth of programming offered to us and how a
remote control has become a network executive's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance'' is now in a precarious position. The last of the
show's allotted 16 episodes aired Feb. 25, so there's nothing for
viewers to go on. Judging from some stories I've seen in the past
week, the Save-This-Show campaign has indeed fired up critics, who
are now hyping the show they helped de-hype just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's not as though Tarses and Bloomberg can look
at Nielsen numbers and see how the show has improved. And don't
count on the ``critically acclaimed'' equation helping out. It
didn't help ``Nothing Sacred'' or ``Cracker'' or ``Maximum Bob'' or
``Cupid'' or ... you get the idea.

</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: INSERTS the word Serbian before Internet in the 11th graf.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Kosovo war could be the unmaking of Vice
President Al Gore, who is stuck with defending the administration's
policy, and the making of GOP presidential candidate John McCain,
who is free to be a tough-minded hawk without bearing
responsibility for any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario, of course, is vastly premature, although the
armchair generals are already on television second-guessing the
bombing and finding it militarily inadequate, politically unwise
and a tragic repetition of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's critics have not had the courage to call for
NATO to retreat and completely abandon the Kosovar Alabanians being
forced from their homes and their country by Yugoslavia's
bloodthirsty President Slobodan Milosevic. Instead they have been
picking away at the president's already damaged credibility,
questioning his judgment, NATO's timing, the apparent lack of an
exit strategy and public confusion about just why we are there.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may have a window of two weeks in which to
sell the U.S.-led intervention in the Balkans to the voters and
demonstrate that an expanded bombing strategy may yet work without
resorting to ground troops. After that, Congress returns from its
traditional spring recess, and the doubting voices now on vacation
may be raised in unison against the commander-in-chief's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both the president and vice president, fully aware
that public opposition to the Vietnam War was partially due to
President Lyndon Johnson's failure to explain its strategic
importance, are making a concerted effort to articulate the reasons
behind the bombing campaign. And despite the professed puzzlement
of doves and Clinton-bashers, there are indeed powerful reasons _
humanitarian, economic and strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that the bombing campaign precipitated and
accelerated Milosovic's cruelty are reckless and uninformed. In
fact, the opposite is true. NATO started too late and probably with
too little.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Tex, was
typical of the armchair generals. He whined that Clinton ``had not
made the effective case about how American interests are vitally
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Armey have us do if he feels no American interests
are involved? Pull a cowardly retreat, give up our claim to being
the world's greatest superpower, reaffirm Milosevic's dictatorship,
encourage Balkan instability and leave the Kosovars to their fate
as stateless, homeless people? Stick our heads in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   There is convincing evidence that Milosevic had been plotting
the massive obliteration of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo
since at least October. But President Clinton and Congress were
preoccupied with the 1998 election and the impeachment charade. By
the time they got around to confronting the Balkan reality, 40,000
Serbian troops were massed for a rampage in Kosovo, peace
negotiations had collapsed and there was no alternative to military
action.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the bombing campaign to immediately bring
Milosevic to his knees is disappointing but not proof that we are
permanently militarily impotent. Clinton justifiably complained in
an interview March 31 with CBS' Dan Rather that ``everybody wants
things to operate like a 30-second ad. This air campaign is not a
30-second ad.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when e-mail allows Kosovars to reach the outside
world and Serbian Internet hackers can cripple NATO's Web site for
several days, air campaigns cannot go on forever without definitive
results.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the 2000 presidential campaign, which does
come close to being a 30-second ad, at least in the sense that at
this early stage quick favorable impressions can make a difference.
And the candidate most worth listening to is McCain, the former
Vietnam POW who has a reputation for courageous domestic views and
military common sense.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reactions have been remarkably sound and persuasive. No
beating around the bush here, waiting for public opinion to jell.
He says we have a strategic interest in the Balkans and that it is
pointless to look backward toward what might have happened had we
acted differently earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In USA Today, McCain says, ``We must all keep our nerve. We are
the superior power, and any sign of hesitation or doubt on our part
will only worsen the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid to suggest the deployment of ground troops, a
dangerous escalation that the administration still publicly
opposes. (Although Clinton and his advisers have conspicuously
never said ``never.'')
</P>
<P>
   In his article, McCain calls for an immediate ``manifold
increase in the violence'' against Serbia proper and the Serb
forces in Kosovo. He warns that there will be ``significant ''
civilian casualties in Belgrade and American deaths as well, but he
believes the sacrifice is necessary for the cause. ``We must use
all the force necessary to hasten this war's end,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gore echoes the administration policy of barring the use of
American ground troops. Campaigning in New Hampshire this week, he
said we would not ``put troops into a combat situation over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the current bombing strategy continues to have little
effect, political pressure will grow on the administration and NATO
to send in troops on the ground to counter the Serbian bullies and
allow the ethnic Albanians to return.
</P>
<P>
   Troops in large numbers would be a difficult decision in any
case. No president likes to put young men and women in harm's way.
But it is emotionally wrenching and politically troublesome for a
president who ducked a regional war (Vietnam) when he was expected
to fight it now having to justify a different war when he asks
others to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we elect presidents to make tough decisions. If they were
easy, we could make them ourselves. Clinton must do what is
necessary, as McCain urges.

 &HT;    Fall fundamentals
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something ``old,'' something ``new,'' something ``borrowed,''
something . . . ``whew!''
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes for trend-conscious women to reassemble
their cold-weather wardrobes, many may find the task as daunting as
planning a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The top designers of New York and Europe, who recently completed
a monthlong series of fall/winter runway previews for the 1999-2000
season, seemed to agree on the fundamental trends. But the trends
they agreed on were so plentiful that filtering through them still
won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The surest way to greet the next fall/winter season in style is
to first decide which essentials you need to complement your
lifestyle, body type and existing wardrobe. The numbers, after all,
are in your favor: There are so many trendy colors, cuts and
materials coming that there has to be at least one that'll suit you
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A cautionary note: Orange was the most alarmingly popular
color shown on the runways. And that's indicative of what fashion
is about. Designers exist to enact new ``laws'' from season to
season. So, while the color orange's ``fresh squeezed'' appeal is
certain to refresh your wardrobe for a season, don't overdo it.
``Grape'' could soon replace ``orange'' as the shade with the most
juice. The other standout colors included camel, cream, red, green,
brown and blue. Patterns with the most punch included paisley,
geometric or floral embroidery, and buffalo plaid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Border patrol: Here's an arresting thought: You could escape
the fashion police's scrutiny all season _ no matter the cut, color
or material of your clothes _ as long as they're trimmed
attractively at the cuffs, seams, waistbands or hems. Most
designers showed something trimmed in lace, scalloped, beaded,
embroidered, whip-stitched or fringed, in hopes of shaking the
minimalism-minded into buying something new.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stretched-arm strong: One way to fortify your wardrobe is to
buy a top or jacket with sleeves that extend over the hands. You'll
hear much from now on about the ``utility'' features that designers
want to supply the millennial woman with, and these hyper-extended
sleeves are one example. They help ward off the cold, just in case
you forget your gloves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paper or plastic? Designers placed such emphasis on body
pouches, shoulder purses and handbags that a new one, in any shape
or material, looks like a must.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Waist not? Want not: Don't even try to wear the trendiest look
in pants _ ``Charlie's Angels'' tight and low in the seat, snug in
the thigh and flared from the knee down _ unless you fall somewhere
below the nation's average pant size for women. That pretty much
excludes everyone from size 14 up. But so what? Read on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Loose-tongued: Fortunately for the majority of women,
designers seemed well-versed in the look known in the industry as
``stealth wealth.'' That means loungey pants in luxe fabrics such
as cashmere. They're for women who look as if they wield enough
power to define propriety of dress for boardrooms or dinner parties
on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Skirting the issue: There's no getting around the fact that
designers emphasized skirts over pants. And who can blame them?
Skirts can be cut thigh-high or floor-length, slit every
which-a-way and tailored tight or loose. In skirts, women have the
ultimate ``all-inclusive'' trend.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hemming and hawing: But honestly, most buyers and editors
attending the shows either laughed or stared dumbfounded at how
high some designers hemmed skirts for the fall/winter season. If
cold-weather considerations didn't enter their minds, codes of
decency should have.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shirts leave: Watch the most stylish women you know and notice
how they've downsized the number of blouses they wear. That trend
continues, with sweaters, tanks and tunics, in delicious fabrics.
And sweaters can be woven so snugly and sheerly these days that the
phrase ``nothing at all'' applies quite often.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hide nor hare: No fur or skin escaped designers' notice.
Shearling coats were shown so often that they got to be boring. Fur
trim was everywhere, as was leather, which was treated as a
wardrobe staple akin to wool. And chances are that next March, when
the Academy Awards roll around, you'll see some starlet wearing
something that could be aptly described as ``that Oscar-winning
wabbit!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blanket statements: Like Linus, designers seemed infatuated
with blankets. They quilted down-filled coats, suits and separates
and threw ruggy wraps around waists and shoulders. If anything
shows how interwined designers' home and apparel collections have
become, it's these looks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Neck and neck: The throat area was featured prominently.
Designers played a ``now you see it, now you don't'' game in which
necklines plunged nearly to the navel or the turtlenecks of
sweaters were cut amply enough to serve as face guards in a
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Given the boot: Accept what designers are doing in the way of
footwear graciously, ladies. They show their realization that you
like high heels _ for the mere idea of them _ but most are showing
shoes with flattened heels and all-purpose soles. It's that
``utility'' factor again. But it's an ``all-inclusive'' look as
well. Buy a pair of knee-high boots if you buy nothing else at all.
Worn with a skirt that's knee length or higher, they look swell on
most women.

 &HT;    History is big draw in New Bern
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BERN, N.C. _ According to an old witticism, North Carolina
is a vale of humility between two mountains of conceit. The
mountains _ Virginia and South Carolina _ are renowned for a pride
in heritage that can border on ancestor worship. Everyone knows
about their original capitals, Williamsburg and Charleston: one a
sort of colonial stage set, the other perhaps the most
history-obsessed city in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But can you name the first capital of North Carolina? Unless
you're a native Tar Heel, the name of New Bern probably doesn't
roll off your tongue. Compared to its better-known peers, this
serene city of 15,000 is as easy to miss as a whisper in a roomful
of blowhards.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because it would be a shame to miss New Bern. It
may be the most charming spot on the Southern seaboard that you've
never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   The clock towers and church steeples of New Bern rise from the
picturesque triangle of land where the Neuse and Trent rivers meet,
30 miles inland from the Outer Banks. Park the car. Dock the boat.
The 20-block historic district was made for strolling, with its
shady sidewalks and pocket parks and cozy shop windows and
gingerbread-trimmed homes garnished with azalea and crape myrtle.
(Fourteen of the most impressive residences _ dating from 1748 to
1922 _ will be open to the public during the annual spring tour
April 9-10.)
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the homes that drew my eye when I first strolled
New Bern last fall. It was the bears. They're everywhere: in public
statues, on gift shop shelves, on the doors of police cars. There's
even a snarling bear bust jutting out of a wall at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The bears are a historical pun, I soon found out _ a reference
to the city's founding in 1710 by Swiss and German immigrants who
named it for Bern, Switzerland. ``Bern'' comes from the German word
for bear. A few years ago, New Bern's downtown redevelopment agency
(Swiss Bear Inc.!) decided it would be fun to fill the town with
bears, scary and whimsical. It didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Bear has been at the forefront of a revitalization
movement that has seen dozens of buildings rehabilitated, sidewalks
and underground utilities constructed, and acres of derelict
riverfront reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place used to be a disaster,'' says the agency's
director, Susan Moffat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a new park and convention center are under way on a
waterfront that teems with sails and masts. The transformation is
so striking that Time magazine recently featured New Bern as one of
the most attractive new retirement spots in America.
</P>
<P>
   The chief attraction for tourists remains history. New Bern
(locals pronounce as if it were one word _ NEW-bun) has 36 National
Register properties, 15 antiques shops, the original state capital,
half a dozen museum homes, a Civil War museum, a fire museum, a
history museum _ all that, and a special place in the nation's
sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   This is Pepsi-Cola's home town. A mustachioed pharmacist, Caleb
Bradham, created the drink in 1898 at his downtown drug store. That
building is gone, but another one _ almost as old _ houses the
Birthplace of Pepsi store, a combination soda fountain, memorabilia
exhibit and souvenir stand where you can buy a bumper sticker that
says, ``Friends Don't Let Friends Drink Coke.'' When I walked in, a
TV was playing vintage Pepsi commercials starring everyone from
Harpo Marx to James Dean. Someone must have a sense of humor around
here, because I also watched a mildly subversive clip from
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``I'm getting a Pepsi. You want one?''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine: ``You can't drink Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine: ``We're adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, anyone with an adult interest in North Carolina
history ends up at Tryon Palace, the redbrick Georgian mansion that
served as the colonial governor's residence and first state
capital. Finished in 1770, it was regarded as one of the grandest
edifices in the colonies. George Washington once attended a party
there (although he actually slept down the street at another house
that's also part of the tour).
</P>
<P>
   Tryon Palace has a fitful history that says a lot about the
populist streak in North Carolina's character. Many colonists
opposed its construction as a British boondoggle. William Tryon,
the royal governor, returned the sentiment; he despised North
Carolina and stayed in the palace for only 13 months before leaving
for reassignment in New York. Colonists promptly ran off his
successor on the eve of the Revolution. The state's General
Assembly met in the building for a few years, then moved to the new
capital in Raleigh. The palace burned in 1798 and wasn't rebuilt
until the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the lively exchange I witnessed during my tour, the
anti-colonial feelings haven't been completely extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   We had just been ushered into the drawing room when a young man
in a powdered wig and fancy knee breeches appeared and welcomed us
to his home. In a hammy British accent, he introduced himself as
his majesty's governor and asked where we came from. A man from
Asheville caught his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, the frontier,'' the governor said, stroking his chin
thoughtfully. ``How is the Indian trouble going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trouble?'' the man shot back. ``There's no trouble. You took
care of that when you gave the Cherokees blankets full of
smallpox.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was dumbstruck; this wasn't on the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure I don't know what you're talking about, sir,''
he finally replied. And with that, he bid us a brisk good day,
vanishing just as the first Gov. Tryon did more than two centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: New Bern is almost 500 miles from Atlanta. Take
I-20 east to Florence, S.C., I-95 north to Smithfield, N.C., U.S.
70 east toward the coast. It's about a nine-hour drive. The closest
major airport is Raleigh-Durham, two hours away. Fourteen-day
advance fares from $94 on AirTran, Delta and Midway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Festivals: The home and garden tour, April 9-10, includes 14
homes, four gardens and 11 churches. $13.50 in advance. The
summer's big event is the Pepsi Heritage Festival, June 11-13; the
fall's is the Mumfest, Oct. 8-10. For information and tickets, call
the tourist bureau. 1-800-437-5767.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Big attraction: Tours of Tryon Palace, the first state
capital, include the building, several other homes and acres of
formal gardens bursting with tulips during the spring. 610 Pollock
St. 1-800-767-1560.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Offbeat attraction: The New Bern Fireman's Museum has a
stunning collection of antique fire engines, some of which were
pressed into service when a third of the town burned in 1922. Don't
miss the stuffed head of Fire Horse Fred, who pulled engines for 17
years; he died in the harness on his way to a false alarm. 408
Hancock St. 252-636-4087.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thirsty? Pepsi was created in New Bern just before the turn of
the century and was based there until the 1920s. The best place to
get a taste of the early years is the Birthplace of Pepsi store and
soda fountain, on the site of the pharmacy where the cola was first
concocted. 256 Middle St. 252-636-5898.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sightseeing: New Bern Tours offers guided excursions through
the historic district on open-air bus trolleys. There's a Pepsi
cooler on board, if you're still thirsty. 1-800-849-7316.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lodging: In addition to half a dozen chain motels, New Bern
has eight bed-and-breakfasts within the historic district, most
with porches and rockers that look quite seductive after a stroll.
The Harmony House has the quirky history you love in a B&AMP;B: The
1809 Greek Revival was sawed in half around the turn of the
century, and one side moved nine feet to make room for a grand
Victorian stairway. 215 Pollock St. 1-800-636-3113. The Sheraton
Grand, on the Trent River, is a favorite of boaters; they can dock
out back and see their masts from their rooms. 100 Middle St.
1-800-326-3745.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: The best dinner in town can be found at the Harvey
Mansion, an elegant 1790s house that doubles as an art gallery.
Continental cuisine _ try the superb veal in mushroom sauce. 221 S.
Front St. 252-638-3205. For lunch, it's hard to beat the crab cakes
at Sonny's Raw Bar and Grill. 235 Craven St. 252-637-9000. For
drinks, try the Chelsea Restaurant and Publick House, located in a
1912 pharmacy that once belonged to Pepsi's founder (hence the huge
Pepsi mural). 335 Middle St. 252-637-5469. For a treat, don't miss
the Cow Cafe, a nifty little ice cream parlor decorated in
black-and-white Holstein spots. 305 Avenue C. 919-638-1131.

`PAULINA': UNCOVERING THE SECRETS OF A CRUEL CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Dominique Swain did a glorious job as the title character of
Adrian Lyne's ``Lolita'' last year, capturing the attitudes and
behaviors of a barely adolescent girl. But when Erika Isabel de la
Cruz Ramirez plays the title character of ``Paulina'' at age 13,
huddling in a graveyard, hiding from the man who keeps her as a
sexual prisoner, she is what a real Lolita might have looked like:
amazingly young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulina'' is a remarkable documentary about a Mexican maid and
the childhood tragedy that shaped her life. The filmmaker, Vicky
Funari, and her parents lived in Mexico for a while, and Paulina
Cruz Suarez was their maid. When Ms. Funari visited Mexico City a
few years ago, she looked up Ms. Suarez and began asking about her
life. The story she heard was simultaneously devastating and
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when Paulina was 8, she walked to a well in her village
to get bathwater. She slipped and fell, cutting her vagina on the
metal edge of a trough. When her mother found the little girl
bleeding, she concluded that she had been raped. Since Paulina had
never heard the word ``rape,'' she assumed that it meant falling
and cutting yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than receiving sympathy, Paulina is ostracized and
taunted by the townspeople and her own family. Their methods
include disdainfully calling the little girl ``senora'' and taking
her out of school. The only recourse is to give her to the cacique,
or local boss, Don Mauro. ``Let her grow awhile and I'll take
her,'' he tells her parents, promising them certain land rights in
return and vowing to marry Paulina when she is old enough. Instead
he rapes and beats her regularly. She repeatedly resists and often
hides from him. When she is 15, she runs away on a bus and makes a
new life, cooking and cleaning for wealthy families in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suarez herself tells much of her story, sometimes on camera
and sometimes in voice-over as re-enactments appear on screen.
These are not the ludicrous shadowy re-enactments of cheap
news-magazine programs. They are, like the rest of the documentary,
assured, intelligent filmmaking, but with minimal dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker also revisits Paulina's village and interviews
people, including Paulina's parents, who knew her and Mauro. The
most chilling encounters are with Paulina's mother, who contends at
first that she doesn't remember the incident, then remembers it
wrong. When the mother is asked about Mauro, she tells the
interviewer that Paulina went with him at age 13 because she was in
love with him. Neighbors and Mauro's other women know better and
say so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suarez, who has a grown daughter of her own now, is the
picture of dignity and good humor _ and a testament (trite but
true) to what the human spirit can endure and rise above. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Susannah, Susannah!'' one felt like calling out.
``What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?'' Such a
big opera house, such a little opera.
</P>
<P>
   Amiable, direct, wholly without guile, Carlisle Floyd's American
heroine and the work that bears her name arrived in the halls of
grand opera on Wednesday night, looking like some lonely tourist
lost in the vastness of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera has not done well by American composers
in recent years; the principal exception was John Corigliano's
``Ghosts of Versailles,'' a piece calculated to the grandiose
dimensions and capabilities of the house. Putting on ``Susannah''in
a 3,800-seat house seems an impulsive act. One hears that Renee
Fleming wanted particularly to sing the title role, and her lovely
sound and simple musicality made her perfect for it.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Ramey as the adulterous preacher, Olin Blitch, is as
ideally suited as she. Credit their splendid performances for the
several moments when Floyd's 44-year-old opera matched the scale of
its surroundings. Two of these episodes came in arias by Ms.
Fleming: one a long accumulation of lyrical energy (``Ain't it a
pretty night''), the other a charming copy of American folk
balladry (``The trees on the mountains''). Ramey is at the center
of Act 2's church meeting, preaching vehemently as a choir hymn
grows behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susannah'' may be getting more from the Met than it deserves.
The piece is perfect in size and difficulty for the regional opera
house or the amateur production, but lesser singing, I suspect,
reveals its thinness even more. Floyd has a nice way with hoedowns,
countrified modal melody and drumroll crescendos, but there is
amazingly little going on at the musical end of this opera. Put it
this way: Kurt Weill's music is not as simple as it seems;
``Susannah'' is.
</P>
<P>
   The subject, a Tennessee mountain version of the Bible's
``Susannah and the Elders,'' is certainly operatic. Just as Greek
tragedy finds a natural home in O'Neill's ``Mourning Becomes
Electra,'' so the simple austerity and Manichaean morality of
fundamentalist America provides just the elements on which opera
thrives. ``Susannah'' is a bleakly eloquent drama crying out for a
score to match it. Friendly as it is, Floyd's music tells its story
and nothing more. There are no layers, no resonances, no
implications beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   There are no significant demands on singers, either, although
the secondary cast does seem intent on making its music bigger than
it is. The orchestra part is so basic that relatively speaking the
splendid Met orchestra conducted by James Conlon was having an
evening off. Even the wariest ear in the audience could find
nothing capable of offense; everything went down as smooth and
digestible as can be. Serious listeners, indeed, could put up their
feet and enjoy a free night as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Met production by Robert Falls is appropriately basic.
Michael Yeargan's clapboard cottage and church (inside and out) and
his bending stand of trees in silhouette slide on and off the
stage. Mountain vistas glow with rising and setting suns. The
opening square-dance scene was a little confused, but a lot of that
has to do with the opera, not the production. Jerry Hadley (Sam
Polk) drawled effectively. John McVeigh played Little Bat in the
spastic manner of Jerry Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there is a lot nice about ``Susannah'' and nothing wrong
with it. Yet one couldn't resist an impression of something small
and innocent that had wandered into the wrong place. Its 90 minutes
could be put inside the first act of ``Parsifal'' and leave so much
extra room that it would have to be tied down to keep from rattling
around. Simplicity is an admirable concept, but there is just not
enough musical ambition here to meet the theatrical potency of the
subject matter. In fairness, Floyd finds a momentum in Act 2 that
almost wholly escapes him in Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   But monosyllabic as ``Susannah'' is, maybe we should just let it
sing its sweet song well and accept small virtues gratefully. In
one way, the opera speaks well for the country we live in. Given
all our arrogance, here is at least one proof that Americans can be
modest too.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A winter storm warning was in effect Thursday night for the
mountains of Arizona as a potent Pacific disturbance approached
from the southwest. On Friday, the disturbance will move over the
central Plains, where the risk of powerful thunderstorms will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop across parts
of Nebraska and Kansas as the arriving disturbance lifts
increasingly moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico. A
few of these storms could approach severe levels, with hail and
high winds possible. Storms will then move eastward into parts of
Iowa and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, isolated, powerful thunderstorms will erupt
across the high plains of western Oklahoma and western Texas as a
dry line, which will mark the boundary between very humid air from
the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the Rockies, arrives Friday
afternoon. Farther east, a second ribbon of moisture-laden air from
the Gulf of Mexico will fuel showers and thunderstorms from eastern
Texas and Louisiana to the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio
Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will intensify across parts of the northern Plains Friday
night as the disturbance arrives from the central Plains.
Moderately heavy snow is possible in parts of the western Dakotas,
southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean winds blowing over cold Atlantic waters will chill parts
of southeast New England. Meanwhile, in the wake of a front
stalling across the northern Middle Atlantic states, stubborn low
clouds and patchy drizzle will dampen parts of Pennsylvania and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sandstorm
</P>
<P>
   Fierce winds gusted as high as 100 mph across parts of northeast
Arizona on Wednesday, kicking up dust and sand while dramatically
and dangerously lowering visibility. Related auto accidents claimed
two lives. The raging sandstorm developed as a sharp cold front
swept across the Southwest states. Behind the front, momentum from
strong winds several thousand feet aloft mixed toward the ground.
These sandstorms are sometimes called haboobs, deriving from the
Arabic word habb, which means wind. Haboobs sometimes have a wall
of swirling dust and sand that is 3,000 feet high.

`COOKIE'S FORTUNE': A SALOME STORY WITH SOUTHERN SUGAR AND SPITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Productions notes appear at end of review.) 
 (DW)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Robert Altman's vintage
ensemble films makes a serenely captivating return with ``Cookie's
Fortune.'' In this seamlessly copacetic treat, Altman once again
dreams up a well-rounded community of symbiotic oddballs, then
effortlessly lures the viewer into their world. With a fine cast
working on a single, nicely eccentric wavelength, he and the
screenwriter Anne Rapp turn picturesque Holly Springs, Miss., into
a hotbed of grudges, power struggles, family secrets and historical
footnotes, all presented with the same rueful overview. ``On this
site in 1897,'' reads a sardonic sign in the local liquor store,
``nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' enjoys every bit of mischief that Holly
Springs has to offer. It especially notices the racial contrasts.
The film opens in a blues club where a sultry black singer (Ruby
Wilson) makes the atmosphere instantly inviting; then it checks out
what the white folks do for entertainment. At the local church,
rehearsals are in full swing for a play about Salome and John the
Baptist (``Excuse me, head coming through!'' says the prop man)
under the aegis of Camille Dixon, played by Glenn Close as a
ladylike monster who insists on sharing a writing credit for
``Salome'' with Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   The film has its own Salome story waiting in the wings. But
first it must introduce the beautiful friendship between
good-hearted Willis Richland (Charles S. Dutton, appealing and rock
solid in this central role) and crusty Jewel Mae (Cookie) Orcutt
(played touchingly by Patricia Neal in a rare screen appearance).
</P>
<P>
   The film teases its audience with the possibility that a black
man may be breaking into a wealthy old white woman's house in the
middle of the night, but in fact it's only Willis stopping by on a
friendly basis. These two have a cozy rapport of long standing.
Willis is closer to Cookie than any of her white relatives happen
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Camille, played diabolically well by Ms. Close, barges
resentfully through the story, annoyed by the wealth of her Aunt
Cookie, the pliant dizziness of her sister Cora (Julianne Moore)
and the general existence of Cora's tomboyish daughter Emma (Liv
Tyler), who prefers working with catfish to any daintier
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyler, who fits right into the Altman ensemble style, makes
it easy to understand why Emma is admired by a police rookie (Chris
O'Donnell) and a Peeping Tom (Lyle Lovett) with equal ardor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film is loaded with local color, it doesn't drift
into the vagueness that has weakened Altman's secondary work. Nor
does it strain for humor or purpose the way, for instance,
``Pret-a-Porter'' did. Unlike his evocative John Grisham film,
``The Gingerbread Man,'' this one does not unfold on unfamiliar
terrain, preferring instead to rekindle the attitudes of his wonder
years in the 1970's. If ``Cookie's Fortune'' is lighter and less
haunting than Altman films of that era, it is also more tightly
plotted and direct. The director astutely shepherds this story
through assorted outrages and revelations until it arrives at a
lovely finale, one that gives each character exactly what he or she
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' poignantly understands why Cookie herself
won't be around for much of the story. Lonely and infirm, she has
come to dwell on memories of her late husband, and in hopes of
release and reunion she decides to join him. Most unfortunately,
Willis has been leaving fingerprints on Cookie's guns around the
same time (he's been cleaning them), and Camille is the one who
discovers her aunt's body. Cursing her aunt (``How dare you do this
to me, you crazy old lady!'') while casually looting Cookie's
bedroom, Camille eats the suicide note and thus turns Willis into a
murder suspect. She is abetted in this by Cora, played by Ms. Moore
with the mix of apparent wide-eyed naivete and secret willfulness
that Shelley Duvall brought to Altman films of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Cookie's Fortune'' is a test of everyone's mettle,
and it unfolds with a simple decency that is one of the film's most
pleasing aspects. Far from being the story of a racist frame-up,
``Cookie's Fortune'' shows why the town sheriff (Ned Beatty)
believes in Willis: ``Because I fished with him.'' It shows how the
best of Holly Springs is brought out by this crisis, though Altman
will never be mistaken for Frank Capra when it comes to fighting
injustice and righting old wrongs. This story has a welcome
malicious edge as it brings out its characters' true colors in
unexpected ways. When Cora finally asks, in this story's most
delicately bittersweet moment, ``I did good, didn't I?'' the answer
is absolutely: for her, and for the whole film too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes mild profanity, implied sexual situations
and a few double-entendres.

 &HT;    CLINTON WARNS YUGOSLAVS ON SOLDIERS, DEFENDS KOSOVO POLICY
 &HT;    470&AMP;adds. With KOSOVO-STRIKES.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ President Clinton, at a campaign-style rally with
military families to bolster support for the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia, delivered a blunt warning Thursday to President
Slobodan Milosevic about harming three U.S. servicemen held by his
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic should make no mistake _ the United States
takes care of its own,'' Clinton said from a stage set up in front
of two menacing jet fighters with skulls painted on their tails.
``President Milosevic should make no mistake _ we will hold him and
his government responsible for their safety and for their
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to about 1,600 military personnel and their
families in a hangar at the Naval Air Station, part of a vast
military complex along the Virginia coast that includes the only
NATO headquarters in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the home of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, an
aircraft carrier that sailed last week for the Persian Gulf. But
U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander in Europe, has requested
that the Roosevelt be diverted to the Adriatic Sea to provide more
firepower over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The president, whose private meeting with a small group of
military dependents had been planned for several days, was forced
to address the capture of the three American servicemen in an event
that was to have been simply a gesture of appreciation for the
sacrifices of military families.
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was ``absolutely no basis'' for the
three American servicemen to have been captured by the Serbs. He
added, ``There is no basis for them to be held. There is certainly
no basis for them to be tried. All Americans are concerned about
their welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A platoon of Marines dressed in camouflage stood stiffly in
formation during the president's speech, but many of the sailors,
soldiers, pilots and their families milled about the cavernous
hangar as the president defended his decision to rally a NATO
bombing campaign against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the military personnel departed immediately after
Clinton's remarks, many trying to avoid reporters seeking their
reaction to the president.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of civilians remained, crushing forward to shake
the president's hand or snap photographs of him working the crowd.
And typically, they were supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds so much like World War II, and we need to help them
(ethnic Kosovars) out,'' said Erica Honaker, 16, whose father, Navy
Lt. Commander Herb Honaker, is assigned to the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me feel that what our country is doing is
worthwhile,'' said Becky Meyers, 24, whose husband, Army Lt. Luke
Meyer, is stationed at nearby Fort Story.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the selling of the president that is under way, but
rather the selling of his Kosovo policy, which is under greater
scrutiny after more than a week of bombing that has failed to stop
the Serbian forces' brutal expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While warning of the dangers to come as NATO steps up its
bombing, Clinton vowed that NATO would ``continue to carry out or
mission with determination and resolve'' and that Milosevic's
actions ``will carry a very high price indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Americans should be patient, that the NATO bombing
campaign would ultimately achieve the goal of weakening Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide whether we are going to take a stand with
our NATO allies and whether we are prepared to pay the price of
time to make him pay the price of aggression and murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the horrendous images of World War II, Clinton said
taking a stand against the ``ethnic cleansing'' of ethnic Albanians
is necessary to prevent ``widespread war'' in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot do everything in the world, but we must do what we
can,'' he said. ``We can never forget the Holocaust, the genocide,
the carnage of the 20th century. We don't want the new century to
bring us the same nightmares in a different guise.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not alone in defending the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, who accompanied the president
to Norfolk, bristled at news reports suggest the administration did
not give adequate attention to military assessments that a bombing
campaign would not prevent Serbian forces from stepping up their
attacks on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read with some interest reports in today's papers, and
I have found for the most part they are completely fictitious,''
Cohen told reporters. ``The consequences of this action were indeed
considered. We had to consider whether or not we could sit on the
sidelines and watch indifferently while 40,000 (Serbian) troops
went on a rampage through Kosovo, while NATO took no action
whatsoever.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine, if you will, an evening with Roberto Benigni
doing impressions of Stevie Wonder, Edith Piaf, Fidel Castro,
Marilyn Monroe, Barbra Streisand and the Pope. Now imagine him
impersonating them all in a lip-synching show, with paper
headdresses, costumes and props affixed to his scalp and torso.
</P>
<P>
   No, this wouldn't necessarily be the scariest post-Academy
Awards show hallucination. It would, in fact, be an approximation
of ``Ennio,'' an honest-to-goodness off-Broadway show that, ahem,
unfolds like no other production in town. The effect may be weird,
but the strangest thing about ``Ennio'' is that it's an absolute
hoot. Its star, Ennio Marchetto, an Italian actor who takes his
inspiration from commedia dell'arte and Walt Disney, might consider
having ``the Irrepressible'' legally attached to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Riffling through a wad of whimsical costumes _ some with moving
parts _ Marchetto accomplishes for grown-up-size paper-doll
accessories what Rich Little did for the larynx.
</P>
<P>
   In skits set to pop, rock and opera music, and each over and
done with in a flash, he transforms himself into a living Potato
Head, tugging and pulling at paper noses, sleeves and handbags to
become Whitney Houston or Marge Simpson at will. The split-second
transformations are themselves the show's wittiest conceits.
Marchetto peels away a likeness of Freddy Mercury of the rock group
Queen to reveal the visage of Queen Elizabeth II; a surgically
re-engineered Cher is supplanted by that marvel of movie
engineering, R2D2.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of ``Ennio,'' a 75-minute show that runs through April
11 at the McGinn-Cazale Theater on the Upper West Side, is one that
bears sober contemplation: in New York City, you never know where
your next laugh is coming from. When someone declares, ``There's a
hyperactive guy on Broadway and 76th Street dressed as a cardboard
Celine Dion who mouths the words to the theme song from
`Titanic,''' the instinctive response is probably not, ``I'm
there!'' Which makes the success of ``Ennio'' all the more
enticing. This is, after all, also the city that taught America the
perfect shrugging comeback to any startling revelation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew?''
</P>

   ``Ennio'' shares the off-Broadway stage these days with any
number of vehicles for truly out-there comedy. At the Westbeth
Theater Center in the West Village, a pair of comic actors from
Australia who call themselves the Umbilical Brothers are appearing
nightly in ``Thwak,'' an exuberant and effortlessly funny showcase
for their arsenal of Saturday morning cartoons come to life.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kaufman Theater on West 42nd Street, another young comic
partnership, Premium Bob, takes absurdist swipes at depictions of
the American male in the stylized madness of ``Manhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of outrageously joyful stand-up, there is the
shrieking, wind-up toy sensibility of Mario Cantone, a comedian of
extravagant tantrums and extravagant gifts, who just finished one
of his intermittent gigs at Caroline's on Broadway (and deserves an
off-Broadway showcase of his own, if his put-upon voicebox can
withstand it).
</P>
<P>
   And soon to arrive at the Flea Theater downtown is Elevator
Repair Service, an oddball downtown troupe that in a blending of
banal everyday behavior like sotto voce conversations, and the
tight choreography of jerky movement seeks to find laughs where no
troupe has found them before.
</P>
<P>
   These acts _ for that's what they are, each with a shtick as
identifiable as that of any comedy team that played the vaudeville
circuit _ may be stylistically diverse, but they also have a lot in
common.
</P>
<P>
   They are all products of a mediacentric age; their shows are
obsessed with popular culture and riddled with references to
celebrities. Cantone makes fun of them; Marchetto becomes them, and
Elevator Repair Service is inspired by them. Its latest offering,
``Language Instruction: Love Family vs. Andy Kaufman,'' which
begins Thursday, is the return of a 1994 production.
</P>
<P>
   And the material intersects at odd angles: Marchetto and
Cantone, for instance, both eerily impersonate Peggy Lee; Premium
Bob and Cantone are both scathing on the subject of professional
ice skaters; the Umbilical Brothers and Premium Bob both make the
lampooning of action-adventure movies a central theme.
</P>
<P>
   But there the similarities end. Cantone is a practitioner from
the medieval school of stand there with a microphone and make 'em
laugh; what distinguishes his art is that it does make 'em laugh.
(I dare you to listen to him while dealing with a mouthful of your
favorite beverage.) An actor as well as stand-up performer _ he
replaced Nathan Lane in the final months of the Broadway run of
``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' _ Cantone is a proponent of the
comedy of outrage. Everyone from Julia Child to Nancy Kerrigan gets
his dander up (if you ever meet him, plead with him to do his
impression of Carol Channing meeting the rapper Heavy D), but his
very best jokes are on his Italian-American family, ``all 900 of
them,'' gathered for the holidays at his mother's and seated on her
couch ``like a Scorsese casting call.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, David Latham and Paul Boocock, who make up
Premium Bob, take a cerebral, vaguely nonlinear approach to parody,
the kind that can find amusement in the portentous enunciation of a
single word, like ``Fact!'' as it is used in those commercials
highlighting the healing properties of antacids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manhunt'' is the latest generation of a show that Premium Bob
has been working on for about a year. It's a collection of visual
and linguistic tics that from my observations divides audiences in
about half.
</P>
<P>
   This became clear to me during a recent performance when I sat
behind a mountain of a man who shook with laughter at the precision
of Latham's and Boocock's antics. His body quaking, he turned
frequently to check the response of the man sitting next to him,
who looked so bored that he might have been mistaken for a
spectator at an eight-hour reading of the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Together they seemed like characters in a blatant editorial
cartoon: one wearing the label ``Funny,'' the other ``Not Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   With Premium Bob, both sides have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The repetitious tableaux, spoofing the opening sequences of old
television detective shows, the clipped intonation in the narration
of a meaningless story about the search for a missing no-account
named Dobie McDobie, is all meant to poke fun at pomposity, and
it's only sporadically effective. When comedy is so purposefully
unspontaneous _ the self-consciousness of the visual style
occasionally brings to mind the work of the experimental director
Anne Bogart _ the remoteness of it all becomes a bit tiresome. You
admire from a distance and never fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thwak,'' the Westbeth show featuring David Collins and Shane
Dundas, is destined for cult hit status; these ingenious Australian
cutups, with their 70-minute exhibition of astonishing sound
effects and visual gags, are smart without ever resorting to
smarminess. ``Ennio,'' too, is likely to develop a loyal following,
the kind that demands, say, a Web site devoted to Marchetto's
adorable fantasias.
</P>
<P>
   As with Cantone and the Umbilical Brothers, Marchetto's
ebullient hour on the stage reveals that it may not matter all that
much if there are no second acts in American life, as long as your
first one is funny.

MICHIGAN TOWN RALLIES FOR AMERICAN HELD IN YUGOSLAVIA

 c.1999 Huron Daily Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPAC, Mich. _ Yellow ribbons and U.S. flags went up Thursday in
the tiny Michigan community where Army Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, one of three U.S. soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces, grew
up.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, 25, and the other two Americans were paraded before
television cameras Thursday. His face was battered and bruised, and
state-controlled Yugoslav media said the soldiers would face a
military trial.
</P>
<P>
   People in Capac (pronounced KAY-pack) said Stone was popular, an
average student, who ran on the Capac Junior-Senior High School
cross-country team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a tough kid,'' said Ken Marzka, a teacher at the
school who once coached Stone. ``When push came to shove, he got
tougher and tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone also was a member of Students Against Drunk Driving. He
joined the Army shortly after he graduated from Capac High in 1991.
He now is married and has a 5-year-old son. His family is staying
with relatives in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Marzka said he was told that Stone recently came home on leave
and told a friend that joining the Army was ``the best thing he
ever did for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Capac senior Tiffany Ellis said many of the students at the
500-student school hadn't paid a lot of attention to NATO air
attacks in Yugoslavia until the capture of one of their own. Ellis
said Stone's capture brought it home to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are yellow ribbons on every tree on Main Street,'' said
banker Gordon Bade. He said customers at the CSB Bank in Capac,
where he is executive vice president, talked about little else
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was something of a
prankster, who was well liked by students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise us a bit that he's serving our country on
a peace mission,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, along with Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles, and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas,
reportedly were patrolling a rugged area near the border between
Macedonia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces had been stationed in Macedonia, a former republic
of Yugoslavia, as part of a peacekeeping mission that predated the
current hostilities. All three Americans are members of the 1st
Infantry Division assigned to the peace force.
</P>
<P>
   Capac is a town of about 1,600 people west of Port Huron, in the
Thumb of Michigan. It is located along Interstate 69, where
hundreds of heavy trucks rumble by each day on their way to and
from the Canadian border crossing at the Blue Water Bridges between
Port Huron and Sarnia, Ontario. Fast freight trains on the Grand
Trunk Western's main line between Toronto and Chicago pass through
town several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Farming has been the driving force for the area for generations,
with large farms growing corn, wheat, beans and sugar beets. But
the area is changing. Located about 50 miles north of Detroit, the
area around Capac has been growing rapidly in the last few years.
Among the orchards and fields are many new developments of
condominiums and large, expensive homes. The rural lifestyle has
attracted many new residents, who commute to jobs in the suburbs of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But Bade said Capac hadn't lost its rural sense of community.
Bade said Capac and the surrounding towns are pulling together,
remembering and praying for Stone and the other captured soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical small town,'' he said.

GIRLS LOVED ADVENTURES WITH LEWIS CARROLL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Great Britain )   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``His were sad, scrawny little nymphets, bedraggled
and half-undressed, or rather semi-undraped, as if participating in
some dusty and dreadful charade,'' said Vladimir Nabokov, the
Russian translator of Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland.'' Nabokov noticed ``a pathetic affinity'' between
Carroll, who photographed little girls clothed and naked, and
Humbert Humbert, the pedophilic narrator of his own ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Carroll a pedophile?
</P>
<P>
   As you walk through ``Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis
Carrol Centenary Exhibition,'' organized by the Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin to
mark his death in 1898 and now at the Equitable Gallery in
Manhattan through April 24, the question seems oddly irrelevant.
What is most startling, and attractive, in his portraits of girls
is not what he saw in them but what they saw in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis Carroll ... came to our country home to photograph the
children,'' wrote Dymphna Ellis, one of the children Carroll
photographed. She added: ``I feel sure I was a `favorite.' He made
every child that. He developed the photographs in our cellar ... I
remember the mess and the mystery ... We cried when he went away
... We were absolutely fearless with him. We felt he was one of us,
and on our side against all the grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   These don't sound like the words of a victim of childhood
seduction. But something in them is still alarming: cellar, mess,
mystery, fearless. The words make you think that whatever Carroll
and his little subjects were up to, it was exciting and seductive
for all concerned. They were co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are the evidence. From the looks of them, these
little girls weren't worried about the Big Bad Wolf. Even Carroll's
photograph of Agnes Grace Weld posing as Little Red Riding Hood
doesn't suggest that. She is intense, penetrating and focused as
she emerges from the woods with a basket of goodies.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition vigorously inoculates the viewer against the idea
that Carroll was a pedophile. It devotes more space to Carroll's
pictures of family, friends and colleagues than to those he called
his child friends. It shows none of his nude pictures of girls and
only one photograph of Alice Liddell, Carroll's favorite girl and
the saucy inspiration for ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' It
includes testimonials from the women Carroll photographed as
children: they adored him.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges instead is something even more unsettling. The
children in the photographs, in striking contrast to the grown-ups,
are bold, sultry, mischievous and seductive. They seem as eager to
please him as he was to please them. They appealed to him, in both
senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   What electrified them so?
</P>
<P>
   There is a hint in Carroll's letters to them. The exhibition
includes a letter he wrote to Rosamond Langbridge upbraiding
Rosamond's big sister Gladys for being ``wanting in businesslike
habits.'' (He had asked Gladys if the three sisters would like to
divide a gift of six different books among themselves, and she had
neglected to specify a desired distribution.) Carroll's letter,
playfully alluding to a certain grasping disposition in Gladys and
referring Rosamond to ``Blackstone's Treatise on the Just Claims of
Younger Sisters,'' gently teases Rosamond into his world with a
brew of logic, scolding, meddling and silliness.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll apparently worked an even stronger seduction with
photography. He brought out something in the girls that was, for
want of a better word, sexual.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition includes the famous photograph of Alice Liddell
as a beggar girl in ripped clothes addressing the viewer with an
all-too-frank gaze. There is Irene MacDonald standing in her
nightie with a mirror and brush, looking mightily exasperated and
petulant. The caption is ``It Won't Come Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of the pictures bear the children's signatures at the
bottom, some straining to be neat and proper and others obviously
untrained, which only adds to the ragtag excitement. Maria White,
the niece of a porter at Oxford, sits like a good girl in a flouncy
skirt holding a dead plant. Her restraint is belied by the stray
marks between the letters of her name.
</P>
<P>
   What about Carroll's treatment of adults? A lecturer in
mathematics at Oxford, Carroll obviously did not reserve all his
mock scolding for children.
</P>
<P>
   He also sent his adult friends logic puzzles, riddles and notes,
some of which are included in the show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he composed a ditty about all the Oxford professors
who ``might, could, would, or should'' have attended a meeting on
academic standards. It begins: ``A is for Aclana who'd physic the
masses, B is for Brodie who swears by the gasses, C is for
Conington, constant to Horace, D is for Donkin, who integrates for
us.'' This A, B, C is at least as childish as anything Carroll
wrote for children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Carroll's taunting, it seems, never elicited the same kind
of intensity in grown-ups that it did in children. He got
gentleness (in a photograph of his father reading); eccentricity
(in a photograph of his brother, Skeffington Hume Dodgson, dressed
in fishing gear and looking as if he's expecting to get wet);
domestic tranquillity (in a photograph of two women named Alice
Donkin), and youthful pensiveness (in a photograph of Robert
Bickersteth leaning on a column). But a search for that raw,
insolent look invariably lands the viewer in front of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, some pictures of intense grown-ups.
But tellingly, they involve fathers and daughters. In one, George
MacDonald, a stammerer like Carroll, sits with an open book while
his eldest daughter, Lilia Scott MacDonald, leans on him. This
photograph is all sly reversals. The father's arm is around the
girl's waist, fiddling with her belt as a child might. The girl's
hand is around her father's shoulder, as if she were the adult.
Their glances are reversed, too. She is staring fixedly, sternly,
at the book he should be reading. He is giving Carroll that look so
many little girls gave him: mischievous, knowing and stubborn. &QL;

MURDER 101, IN HIGH SCHOOL  
 NEW RELEASES OF VIDEO CASSETTES: REVIEWS BY NEW YORK TIMES
CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-agers misbehave in droves on screen these days, but for
extreme juvenile delinquency the ground was broken a decade ago in
``Heathers,'' Michael Lehmann's controversial film about a pair of
originals who righteously liquidate those who displease them.
</P>
<P>
   Back on a new DVD released this week by Anchor Bay, Veronica
(Winona Ryder) and J.D. (Christian Slater) remain in top form,
which is to say they get away with murder. For Veronica at least,
the experience proves to be gloriously liberating.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 that kind of thing didn't happen. ``People were making
teen movies, but it was at the end of the John Hughes cycle _ `The
Breakfast Club,' `Ferris Bueller's Day Off,''' Lehmann said.
Teen-agers were exhibiting plenty of worldliness, but they stopped
at totally dissociating themselves from the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heathers'' removed that reticence. Conceived and written by
Daniel Waters, the film is a satire about two high school students,
one a disenchanted member of the school's viciously abusive ruling
clique and the other a rolling-stone misfit, who team up to do away
with several richly deserving classmates and make it look like
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, evil starts at around age 12,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica is hardly evil, however. As a member of the favored
group, she is fed up with her friends' behavior. When J.D. suggests
they feed the nastiest member of the clique _ one of three girls
named Heather _ a lethal cocktail, it seems like a cool notion.
Heather pitches over, shattering a glass coffee table. Veronica
concocts a suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   The same modus operandi works perfectly with two boorish
football players and date rapists, only this time Veronica shoots
the pair and the suicide theme is angled to make them appear to be
gay lovers.
</P>
<P>
   She is appalled by what she's done but also more than a little
thrilled. ``This isn't a geeky girl getting revenge on the popular
kids,'' Waters said. ``Here's the Albert Speer insider. She's part
of this Third Reich, so she has to work from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer in town, J.D. has no such connection. ``Teen movies
in the 50s had the cool loner kid riding in James Dean-like,''
Waters said. ``I wanted to have fun with that. He started out that
way, but then he pushed it to the psychopathic level.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually J.D. tries to blow up the school with everybody in
it. Slater gives the role his best Jack Nicholson impression, which
is startlingly good. J.D. isn't necessarily evil either, just
monumentally twisted. Together he and Veronica make a mess.
Infatuated with him at first, she eventually tries to disengage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about at this point that the film loses its nerve,''
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said there was truth in that. In his original script,
Veronica blew herself up. In real life teen-age suicide had reached
alarming dimensions in the late 80s, and the studios wouldn't touch
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it was made by New World. And Veronica walks away an
enlightened young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a choice of making something that was slightly
compromised or having nothing to make,'' Waters said.  &QL;

   Taking on a daunting job of literary adaptation, Jonathan
Demme's film gives Toni Morrison's novel a pulse on screen. Through
manifestations of terrible events real and demonic, the former
slave Sethe (Oprah Winfrey, left with Danny Glover) tries to
reconcile the horrors of her experience with the possibility of
renewal. From the corporeal world comes Paul D. ( Glover), an old
friend bearing a slave's name. Floating from the depths of a river
comes the beautiful Beloved (Thandie Newton) to bring Sethe face to
face with an unspeakable past. Though it begins slowly, ``
`Beloved,''' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,

   Playing on the savage scowl and swastika tattoo of a skinhead

visual enticement as it builds rhetorical fever from the ersatz

acts, re-created in almost loving detail, and done a little time in
prison. Later he repudiates the violence, in an ``inflated yet
gut-slugging film that dares to address America's neo-Nazi culture
with brutal candor'' (Maslin). &QL;

   In a latter-day version of the 1934 film ``Death Takes a

tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Parrish has everything,
including a heart problem that is about to kill him. In return for
showing Death around his opulent domain, the mogul can have some
extra time to get squared away for ``the next place.'' Joe learns
about peanut butter and falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire
Forlani), but it all takes ``so long that every character

   A group of pals from a small North Carolina town are still
paying for a youthful indiscretion: accidentally running over a man
and then inadvisably tossing his body in the harbor. Fully
recovered, the victim has taken up a cargo hook and is dispatching
the young people like tuna on a conveyor belt. Now it's down to one
survivor (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who is trapped in the Bahamas in
this sequel with ``a higher body count, cruder shock effects,
louder screams, vanishing credibility and loss of narrative
coherence'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

MAKING GOOD ON A PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 11 years, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art has been little more than a name and a promise. But on May 30,
it will finally open to the public, and North Adams, Mass., will be
the site of the largest center for contemporary visual and
performing arts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Thomas Krens, who was then the director of the Williams
College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass., began lobbying to
transform the former site of an electric company in North Adams.
Krens, now director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New
York, was joined in his campaign by Joseph Thompson, then an
exhibition designer also working at the Williams College Museum.
</P>
<P>
   By 1988 Thompson had become the director of the museum, which
was still in the planning stages. Five years later, he changed the
institution's mission, deciding to encompass the performing as well
as the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, on a 13-acre campus of renovated 19th-century
factory buildings in the northwestern corner of the state, will
open with a wide range of programs: several art exhibitions,
site-specific commissions, sound-art installations, multimedia
performances, dance and music concerts and digital, animation and
film presentations.
</P>
<P>
   A three-hour drive from Manhattan, the museum is hoping to
attract a broad audience. ``Berkshire County is already a strong
and healthy destination,'' Thompson said. ``Over 2 million people a
year come here, and 70 percent of them are from the New York
metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the museum's plans, he added: ``This campus is a
platform for all kinds of cultural activities. We do our own
exhibitions, but we also team up with productions.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will offer artists the chance to show their work in
extraordinary physical spaces. Bruner/Cott &AMP; Associates, a
Cambridge-based architectural firm, is responsible for the final
design of the buildings, but its architects collaborated on the
institution's feasibility studies with Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles
architect who designed the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain; Venturi
Architects from Philadelphia, and Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The finished campus has more than 220,000 square feet of
galleries, theaters and art fabrication spaces. (The museum will
also be a laboratory of sorts, giving visitors the chance to see
works in progress.) There are 19 light-filled galleries, one as
long as a football field and another that has a ceiling 40 feet
high. It also has a 10,500-square-foot black box theater, a smaller
theater, rehearsal studios and outdoor courtyards for music, film
and performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects that are to be ready for the opening are a
large-scale installation by Natalie Jeremijenko, an installation
artist from Australia; a group exhibition of works by artists
including Joseph Beuys, Mario Merz, Robert Rauschenberg and John
Chamberlain; a new work by the video artist Tony Oursler that was
commissioned by the museum, and a work that uses digital technology
to multiply the body of the dancer Bill T. Jones into an
interactive ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Other opening programs include an extensive animation series
featuring a project by Walt Disney Pictures; the world premiere of
``Jet Lag,'' a multimedia collaboration between the Builders
Association and the architects Diller &AMP; Scofidio, and a show that
pairs drawings by the choreographer and dancer Trisha Brown and the
painter Terry Winters.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's reach will extend beyond its campus. Timed to its
opening will be billboard art _ commissioned from artists like Gary
Simmons, Leon Golub and Sue Coe _ along the highways of western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The state has given the museum a $22 million construction grant
and board members and volunteers have raised more than $15 million.
Operating costs will come from an $8 admission fee and private
fund-raising.

   Thinking Big
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York will no doubt make gallery
space for monumental sculptures a priority in its expansion. It
announced this week that Leon Black, a trustee who is president of
Apollo Advisers, a New York investment concern, and his wife,
Debra, had given Richard Serra's 1988 sculpture ``Torqued Ellipse
IV'' to the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-ton sculpture is a twisted ribbon in the shape of an
ellipse standing on its edge. It is part of a series inspired by
the dynamic spaces created by the early Italian architect
Borromini. The Blacks bought the work from the artist. It is in an
exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao through Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Ronald Lauder, the Modern's chairman, gave the
museum Serra's ``Intersection II'' (1992), a 60-ton sculpture made
of four 2-inch-thick gentle curves of hot-rolled steel. It also
owns several smaller works by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Serra is someone whose work we are seriously committed
to,'' said Glenn Lowry, director of the Modern. ``These are
astonishing works.''
</P>
<P>
   Degas Pastels
</P>
<P>
   The Impressionist and modern art department at Sotheby's in
London is bucking the current trend of auctioning masterpieces in
New York. For the third year in a row, Sotheby's in London will
offer important works that haven't been on the market in ages.
</P>
<P>
   In June it will auction ``Dancer in Repose,'' an 1879 Degas
pastel of a dancer sitting on a bench massaging her foot. It has
not been for sale for 104 years and has never been exhibited
outside France. The work, expected to sell for $8 million, was
acquired in 1885 by Jules-Emile Boivin, a French businessman, from
Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris, one of the first great Impressionist
dealers. It has remained in the family since.
</P>
<P>
   At the same sale, the Boivin family is selling another Degas
pastel, ``Woman Sitting in Front of a Piano'' (1882-1885). It is
expected to sell for $4 million to $5.6 million. The two are among
six works by Degas that Boivin acquired in the 1880s. Among them
was a Degas painting, ``Woman With Vase of Chrysanthemums'' (1865),
which Louisine Havemeyer bought in 1921 and bequeathed to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1929. Another pastel, ``Dancers''
(1882-1885), was acquired by the French government in lieu of taxes
and is in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending these pastels to New York wasn't even a discussion,''
said Melanie Clore, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who
also heads its Impressionist and modern art department in London.
``Our track record shows that we can make record prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in London, Sotheby's sold a 1900 painting by Monet for
a staggering $33 million; the year before it sold a van Gogh
drawing for $14.7 million, a record for a work on paper by the
artist.

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: REFUGEE TEARS FLOW INTO A RIVER OF SADNESS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania It is early morning. The sun is still hidden by
the vast craggy mountains that ring this sad old village. There are
brilliant blue breaks in the clouds, and people here study these
windows for NATO planes. Among the Albanians _ both those from
Kosovo and those from Albania _ the planes are seen as nothing less
than sweet angels of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   We are rambling in a 25-year-old Volvo piloted by my guide and
new best friend Murat, who dreams of driving a taxi in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   I am accompanied by a photographer named Seamus Conlan, an Irish
guy who rolls his own cigarettes and tells horrific stories of the
war and famine he has seen in Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   We bounce down a narrow road that is more dust and rock than
asphalt. It winds between the border with Kosovo and Kukes, a place
so poor that I can think of no point of reference in America to
help me describe it to you.
</P>
<P>
   It is ugly, full of bulky Soviet-era buildings that house dim
apartments, shops and offices. Garbage lines the street, inviting
what must be hundreds of stray dogs to rummage. Rusting engine
blocks and transmissions lay here and there. Flattened clear blue
plastic bottles are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The streets smell of urine and rotting food. This morning a
little boy played with a hoop made from some rusting car part,
guiding it with a bent wire hanger down the filthy street. I have
not seen one place of tranquility or beauty.
</P>
<P>
   We are looking for refugees. We have heard that more than
100,000 ethnic Albanians are being emptied from the towns and
villages of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We round a bend to find the chaos for which we had hoped. As far
as I can see, there are tractors towing carts filled with women,
old men and children.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus and I get out of the car to fill ourselves with the
story. We start wandering the seemingly endless line of tractors
pulling carts jammed with ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. They look
so worn out, so dazed. One pretty little girl I'd guess to be 5 or
6 a little younger than my son rests her head on her hands. Her
tiny little nails still bear traces of bright red nail polish. I
want to touch her, but I keep moving, keep studying.
</P>
<P>
   The only distinct sounds are the tractor motors and crying
babies. Many spent the frigid night at their mother's breast. God,
these are stout people. What would Americans do in such adversity?
</P>
<P>
   One woman sits against a waist-high stone wall with a baby
nestled under her dirty Chicago Bulls T-shirt. Her eyes seem empty.
</P>
<P>
   I move on. They come on this exodus with a little food, some
blankets and water in large plastic containers like the one I use
for lawn mower gasoline at my home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Many eat dense slices of bread handed out by the Red Cross; the
small children clutch pieces in their fists.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learn than 9,000 refugees have spent the night in this
field, which is mostly mud and garbage.
</P>
<P>
   I ask them for their stories. Many of these people haven't seen
a sympathetic face in a long time. They want to talk to me, to
unburden themselves. I feel a duty to listen and try to hear it
all. The stories are confused and jumbled. One woman looks at my
plastic ID, which has the shield-shaped U.S. symbol that American
athletes used to wear at the Olympic Games. She smiles and points
to the sky. ``NATO,'' she says, ``NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories are so consistent: Serb soldiers or paramilitaries
wearing masks swept through villages and ordered people out of
their homes. The people say they are robbed and commanded to go to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that all of Kosovo is being emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina, the provincial capital, must be a ghost town. Enver
Doda, (CQ BOTH) a technician with a Pristina radio station, says
the Serbs round up 20,000 people each night and take them to the
sports stadium in the city center. They spend the night on the
playing field, uncertain of their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they will be shot,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But in the morning, they are loaded into buses and driven toward
the boarders with Albania and Macedonia. More than 100,000 of them
have arrived in Albania, the poorest country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any people left in Pristina,'' Doda says. ``There
were 400,000 people there. Now there is no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Doda has been changed by this exodus. He seems a nice,
articulate young guy who speaks great English. He says he used to
be able to separate his feelings for Serb authorities from his
feelings about Serb police and soldiers. ``But now, I think they
are barbaric people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to think that about any people, but I understand
his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Shaqiri, (CQ BOTH) a famous singer of patriotic Kosovar
songs, waits in line at the border crossing for the Albanian police
to register his car, which has no license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are said to be stripping people and their cars of all
identity documents an act intended to strip them of their
identities. Shaqiri says his house was fired upon and his family
has fled. He intends to join the guerrilla fighters with the Kosovo
Liberation Army to go back to fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   I continue to the border _ and cross the red line painted across
the bridge between the countries. I am in Kosovo for a few minutes,
still unable to see the end of the parade of refugees. The border
police say the line of cars, tractors, horse-drawn carts and people
on foot stretches back 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every man and woman breaks into tears as they cross
the border.
</P>
<P>
   What must it mean to them to finally reach safety? I try to ask
a couple of them how they feel, but decide to skip pursuing such a
stupid and possibly insulting question. They don't have the words
to express their feelings, and I don't have the talent to express
it for them.
</P>
<P>
   I lean on the side of the bridge and watch Serb border guards
and wonder what they would say if I could ask them about all of
this.
</P>
<P>
   An older Kosovar taps me and asks through my translator if he
can tell me something. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Tears fill his eyes. He says the Serbs shot his brother and
14-year-old nephew. ``They each have one bullet hole in the head,''
he says, pointing to the middle of his forehead with the tip of his
index finger. ``They killed every man on my street.'' He is from
the town of Jakova. He says that last Friday, masked Serb
paramilitaries went door-to-door down his street and forced the
residents from their houses. The men and women were separated.
``They tell the women, 'Go to Kosovo.'''
</P>
<P>
   He says that after the women were sent down the road, the men
were executed. Desperate for any details that can help me judge
whether there is any truth to this story, I ask him for the names
of the men.
</P>
<P>
   He names his brother, Skender Ibrahim, 43, and Skender's son,
Rigmond Ibrahim. He doesn't want to give his name, saying he fears
for his life.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are impossible to verify, a frustrating problem
for a journalist. I don't know what to make of it all.
</P>
<P>
   I look out again towards Kosovo, frustrated that Yugoslavian
authorities won't let me in so I can see for myself. This is an
important time to get at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Again, a tap on my shoulder. The man who says he lost his
brother and nephew hands me a paper. On it are the names and ages
of four men under the words, ``killed persons.'' The names are
Naser Thafi, 30; Qazim Godeni, 65; Bexim Godeni, 26; and Xhevdet
Sadiki, 56. (ALL CQ)
</P>
<P>
   He entrusts the names to my care. I lean again on the railing
and look at the list, and try to imagine the people the names
represent.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, a few of my tears join the vast river.

CLINTON DEFENDS NATO ACTION IN KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-GONZALES and KOSOVO-LEGAL.
Stories will move shortly.) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ Urging patience and determination, President
Clinton on Thursday passionately defended NATO's military campaign
in Kosovo before a military crowd that may be most affected by how
the operation unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   In his first out-of-town speech since he ordered airstrikes last
week in Yugoslavia, the president once again laid out the case for
the military action before more than 2,000 military personnel and
their families at the Norfolk Naval Station.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serb capture of three U.S. soldiers and the inability
of the airstrikes to halt the Serb campaign against the Kosovars,
Clinton has faced mounting criticism for his decision to get
involved in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   But saying ``this is not an easy challenge with a simple
answer,'' the president tried to respond to his critics who say
that airstrikes are not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing this for seven days now _ just seven days''
he said. ``Our pilots have performed bravely and well, in the face
of dangerous conditions and often abysmal weather. But we must be
determined and patient. Remember, the Serbs had 40,000 troops in
and around Kosovo, and nearly 300 tanks, when they began this,
before the first NATO plane got in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Serb offensive against the ethnic Albanians would
have been carried out regardless of whether the NATO forces had
struck and that at least the United States and its allies had
signaled to Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic that such atrocities
would not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we, in the last year of the 20th century, going to look
the other way as entire peoples in Europe are forced to abandon
their homelands or die? Are we going to impose a price on that kind
of conduct and seek to end it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to blunt criticism that the United States has
been selective in its response to ethnic cleansing, ignoring
similar activity elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world,'' he said. ``But just because we can't do everything for
everyone doesn't mean that for the sake of consistency we should do
nothing for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is strategically significant because the region has
spawned bloody conflicts in this century, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, what has this got to do with America? Remember we
fought two world wars in Europe,'' he said. ``This is something we
are doing to try and avoid in the 21st century the kind of
widespread war, large American casualties and heartbreak that we
saw too much of in the century we are about to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also warned Milosevic of severe consequences for
Serb capture of three U.S. military peacekeepers in Macedonia,
vowing, ``America takes care of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president never mentioned another thorny issue _ his
refusal so far to send ground troops into Kosovo. A number of
military experts and lawmakers have argued that the only way to
stop the Serbs is through a ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen reiterated the administration's
stand in a briefing to reporters before the president's speech,
saying ``there are no plans and no intent to use ground troops.
We're carrying forward with our air campaign, and that's something
that NATO is solidly behind, and we're solidly behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech Clinton met privately for an hour with about
20 families of soldiers deployed to the Balkans. He also called
Aviano Air Base in Italy, where many of the NATO military aircraft
flying over Yugoslavia are based.
</P>
<P>
   For the address, the White House chose a setting that they hoped
would bolster Clinton's military image.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Clinton in the cavernous airplane hangar were two fighter
jets and a bleacher filled with military personnel and their
families. The president was joined by U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb,
D-Va., a decorated Vietnam veteran. Virginia's other senator,
Republican John Warner, a former Navy secretary and chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, declined an invitation to attend, an
administration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed after Clinton's address expressed considerably
more support for the operation than those questioned before the
president spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be robbed of their history, who they are and
their identity,'' said Brenda Gentry, whose husband is in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   John Alsop, who is in the Navy, said he had become increasingly
convinced of the necessity of the mission after seeing photographs
of ethnic Albanians fleeing their homes under threat of massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got the makings of turning into another Holocaust,'' he
said, but added he does not believe airstrikes alone would
accomplish the mission. He said he wanted Clinton to authorize the
ground operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for him to say exactly when the troops are going
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Etter said the president made a ``good case'' for
military action. ``A lot of wars have started in that area. Let's
just nip it in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were not as convinced that the United States should
be involved in the European dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Maclin, a 36-year old Navy aviation mechanic, said he
believed the United States had rushed into military action and
should have spent more time negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have held out a little longer than we did,''
he said. ``Now it doesn't look too good to me.''

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ In a chilling display of force, Serb gunmen are
systematically emptying Kosovo's capital city, Pristina, marching
its ethnic Albanians out through gantlets of masked, heavily armed
Serbs, refugees crossing the border Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 more Albanian Kosovars arrived here on
Thursday, stretching at times more than a dozen miles back into
Serbia in a heart-rending line of farm tractors, frail old people
being carried in wheelbarrows and weeping village women on foot
clutching their children and, perhaps, a blanket or a plastic bag
with a few clothes. An old man died of exhaustion on the border
crossing Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The people leaving Pristina, once an urbane center with a
university and coffee houses, who told almost identical accounts of
the latest Serbian tactic of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees said that on Wednesday afternoon there were knocks on
the doors of all homes in ethnic Albanian neighborhoods, which
comprise most of the city. Sometimes it was only one gunman _
special police or paramilitary _ with a black ski mask over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Leave now, the refugees said they were told, and they were
quickly and roughly thrown out of their homes and robbed of their
money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the street, they said, they found their
neighbors in a forced march between lines of masked, uniformed and
armed Serbs. At one point, the refugees said, the Serbs videotaped
the march. Indeed, Serbian state television broadcast just such a
forced march in Pristina Tuesday ago.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said they were split into two groups, one taken to
the city's railroad station, the other to a soccer stadium. It was
difficult to estimate from the accounts exactly how many people
were involved, but they clearly numbered tens of thousands. One
train load was sent to the Macedonian border. At least three babies
were born Thursday night in the railroad station, the refugees
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the night, the Serbs brought in fleets of buses and large
trucks, including freezer trucks of the kind used to transport
sides of beef, the refugees said. Many ethnic Albanians spent hours
packed into the buses and trucks until they were driven south past
burning villages early in the morning and dumped out at the last
village, Szhur, to walk the final few miles to the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine what happened,'' wailed Suzana Krusnigi,
collapsing in tears a few steps over the border with her elderly
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching television, Sky News, and I walked out into the
garden and there were three people with black masks and big guns,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to kill my mommy. They said you give me money or I
will kill her,'' she said. ``I had 550 Deutsch marks hidden in my
sock, and I gave it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing, she said: ``In every house they broke the doors. When
we went out everyone was in the street walking between men with
black masks and big weapons.'' She also described the forced march
and a sleepless night at the railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Pristina is empty today. No Albanians. Only Serbians with
guns, they all have guns,'' she said. ``Can the world see what they
are doing?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The long lines of silent, shaken refugees, many crying,
stretched all around her. Among the seemingly endless procession of
people atop carts pulled by tractors was 98-year-old Shahin
Jhabani, stretched motionless on a wheel barrow, his feet in maroon
socks dangling over the wheel, a few odd family possessions, a
blanket, a pair of woman's high-heel shoes and a bright-colored
child's jacket tucked around him.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. Thursday, some 13,000 people had crossed over the
border, a process made painfully slow for much of the day by the
Albanian authorities' insistence on a new procedure for registering
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Actually what they were registering mostly was their automobiles
_ stripped of license plates by the Serbs _ and issuing a
mimeographed piece of paper good for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon after pressure from European aid officials
and the flood of people on foot, the system quickened somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   But in the darkness there were still many thousands of people
backed up nearly 10 miles into the Serbian territory, a line
constantly receiving more people, even as it inched forward, from
Pristina and other areas to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exploded something at the main door of our house,'' said
Ruzhid Morina, 56. ``Four police with masks came in. Their first
demand was money. At this moment the children were frightened and
started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took only the things we had at hand, two blankets for the
kids and a plastic sheet in case it rains,'' he said. ``All this
happened in just five minutes and we were made to leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides of the street were long lines of Serb police in
masks and we had to walk between them to the train station.''
</P>
<P>
   As the procession passed a movie theater, he said, police in a
white Opel Cadet cruised alongside, videotaping him.
</P>
<P>
   After the march and the long night in the train station, Arsim
Rahmani, 26, said he could see from the windows of the bus that
there were no ethnic Albanians. ``Our shops were looted. There were
only Serbs, driving our cars.'' For many, crossing the border
seemed a moment of mixed emotions. They were shattered at the
thought of all that they had lost. And yet, said Rahmani and his
wife, Aferdita, who was three months pregnant, there was a certain
relief, too, in being free of the threat of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not important that now we are poor people,'' she said,
leaning close to her husband. ``What is important is now I am not
afraid.''

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR FACES POSSIBLE HEART PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Saying that he is not facing a medical emergency but
rather a quality-of-life issue, Governor Paul Cellucci will enter a
Worcester hospital Friday to undergo a routine medical procedure
that will likely correct a blocked coronary artery.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure on the 50-year old governor, which experts say is
a common medical operation, will begin with a catheterization to
confirm his doctor's diagnosis of why Cellucci feels shortness of
breath when he exercises. With that confirmation, the physicians
will carry out an angioplasty to expand the restricted heart
artery.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who will be awake during the procedure, is expected to
spend the night at St. Vincent Hospital and be released on
Saturday. He said Thursday he plans to be back at his desk at the
State House on Monday for a full day of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no medical emergency to do anything now,''
Cellucci told reporters Thursday as he and his doctor, George
Saperia, downplayed the risk or implications of the procedure.
``It's kind of a quality-of-life issue. I would like to exercise
without getting this discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he has been told there is a only a ``remote''
chance that the catheterization will find some other problem than
the one diagnosed by Saperia.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he began feeling a shortness of breath just
over a year ago when he took his routine morning 4-mile walks. At
the time, the doctor perscribed drugs for high blood pressure and
high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said he changed his diet several years to lower
his cholesteral count, which he said is now about 190. He said his
blood pressure reading is now about 120 over 80. Both readings are
considered normal.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he and his doctor decided in January to
schedule the procedure because they felt the medication was not
correcting it. They chose to do it Friday because it accommodated
both their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had no effect on my job performance, has no effect, will
not have any effect,'' the governor said. He said Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift can make any decision when he is incapicatated.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said did not feel any obligation to reveal the
condition during last year's campaign because it has no impact on
his ability to carry out his duties as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job... I don't consider this a stressful job,''
Cellucci said. He added that Dr. Saperia indicated it is ``more a
genetic thing.''

`THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS': A GRIPPING TALE OF FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 BY JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' was shown as part of last year's New
York Film Festival. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   On a note of uncommon grace, ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' begins
simply and becomes a glimpse into an unexpected world.
</P>
<P>
   Though its two main characters, young Frenchwomen adrift and
living hand to mouth, are rough-edged and scrappy, they wind up
forming a bond of enormous delicacy. As that bond frays, this
impassioned first feature by Erick Zonca reveals a soulful, moving
vision of our shared responsibility for one another's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a film whose two stars jointly won best actress honors at
Cannes, the most immediately unforgettable figure is Elodie
Bouchez's Isa (short for Isabelle).
</P>
<P>
   At 21, she's a scruffy opportunist toting her backpack through
Lille, raising pocket money by hustling religious pictures to
passers-by. She takes a factory job as a seamstress, failing
dismally but winding up with a fellow worker, Marie (Natacha
Regnier), as her new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Marie couldn't care less about being a seamstress either. In a
film that easily incorporates class struggle into its story and
cares more about working-class experience than many a more openly
political drama, she too lives strictly in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Both women are at an adventurous age, looking for opportunity
wherever they find it and working only because they must. Then,
with the lovelorn blindness of a Dreiser heroine, Marie hitches her
hopes to a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   Zonca depicts Marie's love affair with furious intimacy. It
begins in a most unexpected way. Isa and Marie have been happily
taunting bouncers at a club, mostly just for sport; Marie even has
an affair with one of them (a hefty biker, played with incongruous
tenderness by Patrick Mercado).
</P>
<P>
   The women have also harassed smug-looking Chriss (Gregoire
Colin) without realizing that he is the club's owner. One day
Chriss spots slim, pretty Marie while she is shoplifting a jacket
and saves her from arrest. Rebellious but also secretly impressed,
Marie lets Chriss buy the jacket and buy her, too.
</P>
<P>
   With her big, toothy grin and rough features, Ms. Bouchez's Isa
looks like the plainer of the two women at first. But as she rises
to the occasion of befriending the badly confused Marie, she takes
on an astonishing radiance, a glow of stirring compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave out an impression of serenity, grace and absolute
confidence in life,'' Zonca has said of the young woman who
inspired this story, and the luminous Ms. Bouchez summons that same
spirit magnificently here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' escalates with frightening urgency
as Marie loses her bearings. Wise in the ways of stubbornly
wrongheaded love affairs, Zonca shows how sexually responsive she
is to Chriss' cruelty, and how easily sexual desperation drives a
wedge between the friends when Isa counsels caution.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes of tumultuous intimacy, he watches the two feisty
heroines fight out their differences. The two actresses perform
with overwhelming naturalness, as if utterly locked into this
conflict. Zonca had them live together while making the film, and
it shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this beautifully acted drama, as raw and immediate
as it is heartfelt, describes much more than the fallout from
friendship or a headstrong love affair. It leaves behind what Isa
has discovered: the profound ties among the lives that are seen
here, and the way those ties make sense of our world.

NAZI CRIMES BRING MAN 2 LIFE TERMS IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For more than 50 years, Anthony Sawoniuk lived a quiet
existence in Britain, settling in South London and earning a modest
living as a railway cleaner and ticket collector. But he was a man
harboring dark secrets from the distant past, and they have finally
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotionally charged trial at the Old Bailey, Sawoniuk,
78, who suffers from diabetes, walks with a heavy limp and is so
deaf that the judge in the case had to shout to make himself heard,
was convicted of two counts of murder Thursday in connection with
the 1942 killings of 18 Jews in Domachevo, a former Polish town
that is now part of Belarus. He was sentenced twice to life in
prison, once for each count.
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk _ whose name had long been on a KGB list of possible
war criminals who had escaped to Britain _ was the first person in
Britain to be tried under the country's 1991 War Crimes Act, and
may well be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Other suspected war criminals have died before the cases could
proceed, or have not been tried because of infirmity.
</P>
<P>
   In Sawoniuk's case, the charges stemmed from incidents in the
sleepy spa town of Domachevo in 1942, a year or so after the Nazis
came in and herded the entire Jewish population into a makeshift
ghetto. Sawoniuk, a Domachevo native and only 20 at the time, was
appointed police chief and charged with enforcing the new laws
against Jews he had played with and gone to school with.
</P>
<P>
   On Yom Kippur in September 1942, some 2,900 Jews were rounded up
and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk was not accused of taking part in the massacre, but
rather of taking part in a ``search and kill'' operation to hunt
down survivors. There had originally been more than 4,000 Jews in
Domachevo; when the Nazis were done, witnesses said, there were
just 12.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member jury in the case heard a number of elderly
witnesses testify to the horrifying acts committed by the Nazis and
by Sawoniuk in particular. Their testimony proved all the more
compelling because in a small community of about 5,000 people, most
of them Jews, they had known the defendant and called him by his
nickname, Andrusha.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Alexander Beglay, 69, said that he was 12 when
Sawoniuk caught him and a friend scavenging for clothes in the
deserted ghetto several days after the massacre. Sawoniuk, he said,
forced them some distance from the town, where two Jewish men and a
Jewish woman were being guarded by police near a pit in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were emaciated and had yellow patches on the back and
front of their clothes,'' Beglay told the court, speaking through
an interpreter. Sawoniuk ordered them to strip, and when the woman
refused to remove her underpants, he threatened to beat her with
his truncheon, Beglay said. When she was naked, she was shot along
with the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrusha was standing behind each one,'' the witness said.
``They fell into the pit one after another, and he levered them
into the pit by raising his knees.'' He then forced the boys to
bury the bodies, Beglay said.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, 75-year-old Fedor Zan, who had the seat behind
Sawoniuk's in school, said that he had seen the defendant shoot and
kill 15 Jewish women in a forest, after forcing them to take their
clothes off. ``He mowed them down with a machine gun,'' Zan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk denied all the charges, testifying that the Jews had
not been so much as mistreated, and said the past was too murky for
him to remember it properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a monster,'' he said, adding at one point that he
could not recall whether, for example, the Jews had been forced to
wear yellow patches on their clothes. ``I can't remember,'' he
said. ``It was 57 years ago. I lost my memory a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he never killed anyone. ``I never hate Jews,'' he
told the court. ``They were my best friends. I was born next door
to them. I grew up with them. I went to school with them. They
accuse me. They lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk, who arrived in Scotland as a refugee in 1946, claiming
to have spent the war fighting against the Nazis, managed for most
of his life to keep his past a secret, not even telling two of his
wives what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk's lawyer, Martin Lee, said that his client was likely
to appeal the conviction, adding that ``retroactive criminal
prosecution'' was bad law.
</P>
<P>
   But Jewish groups and groups who support war-crimes legislation
praised the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere passage of time does not make a guilty person less
guilty,'' said Rabbi Jonathan Romain, chairman of the Jewish
Information and Media Service. ``It is not pleasant to have to take
an elderly man to court, but it is even less pleasant to think of
the murders of which he is accused going unpunished.''

YELTSIN CALLS ON GROUP OF EIGHT NATIONS TO MEET ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin fired off another peace
offensive Thursday, even as a Russian military reconnaissance ship
was heading into the Mediterranean in an open demonstration of
Moscow's anti-NATO stance in the conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Thursday on national television, Yeltsin called for an
emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the world's seven
leading industrial powers, plus Russia, to seek a political
settlement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since six members of the group are now involved in the NATO
bombing campaign, Yeltsin's latest proposal seemed as unlikely to
be successful as the diplomatic mission earlier this week to
Belgrade and then to Germany led by Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   But with its back-to-back diplomatic initiatives, Moscow is
clearly trying to maintain a visible role in the crisis, and take
the lead in calling for a political settlement to a conflict that
has already caused damage to its relations with the West, and to
its own political equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing campaign has unleashed a powerful tide of
anti-Western sentiment in Russia, which has been a significant
factor in Moscow's handling of the crisis. Politicians of all
stripes here are united in a condemnation of NATO's actions. The
debate now is over how best to counter them, by military or by
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
   As the chorus for a military response picks up steam, top
generals have said they are considering more ``appropriate
measures'' as a response to the conflict. This week, the Russian
Defense Ministry notified Turkey of its plans to send seven vessels
from its Black Sea Fleet through the Bosporus, starting with the
electronic intelligence-gathering ship Liman, which is due to leave
the port of Sevastopol on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision to send the other six ships, including the
flagship cruiser Admiral Golovkov; two anti-submarine ships, the
Kerch and the Sderzhanny, and two patrol ships, the Pytlivy and the
Ladny, has yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
   By ostentatiously sending ships into the Mediterranean, where
Russia already has one intelligence-gathering vessel, the
government has mixed its signals, earning an irked rebuke from
Washington. Some Russian newspapers on Thursday interpreted the
Defense Ministry's move as a step toward more direct involvement
with its historic ally Serbia, even though Yeltsin and others have
pledged to keep Russia out of the military conflict. Others have
suggested that sending out the spy ship is more a political gesture
than a military one.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has put on other displays of force this
week. The Northern Fleet has dispatched 20 vessels on military
exercises in the Barents Sea, which Thursday was the staging area
for a successful ballistic missile launch.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said his proposal for a meeting of the eight foreign
ministers was a sequel to the Primakov mission, which, according to
Moscow, failed because of NATO intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo problem can and must be settled at the negotiating
table,'' Yeltsin said in his special television address. ``This was
clear from Yevgeny Primakov's talks with Slobodan Milosevic,'' the
president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   According to some Russian analysts, Moscow will keep introducing
ideas _ and even taunts _ in order to keep its hand in the
diplomatic game over Kosovo, waiting until the moment when the West
has to turn to Russia to act as broker in a political settlement
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats here have also noticed that for all the harsh
Cold War oratory heard from top officials here recently, Moscow's
actions have been relatively mild, and several key elements of its
relations with the United States have remained untouched.

 &HT;    Appropriated for the faith
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, APRIL 4. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Christianity triumphed throughout Rome and the rest of
Europe, sites and monuments that were once pagan were co-opted to
Catholic use. Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pink obelisk: In the square of St. Peter's, the famous pink
granite obelisk where lovers meet and tourists mingle dates back
almost 4,000 years. It was built in Heliopolis, Egypt, by a pharaoh
to honor the sun some 2,000 years before Jesus was born, brought to
Rome by Emperor Caligula in 37 B.C., and moved to its present place
in 1586 at the direction of Pope Sixtus V. The move required 900
men and 140 horses. Originally engraved with dedications to
Augustus and Tiberius, the obelisk under Sixtus was dedicated to
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   -- Baroque extension: On the edge of the the scattered ruins of
the ancient forum, a baroque extension rises above the columned
portico of a first century temple to the emperor Antonius and his
wife Faustina. The extension was added long after the building was
claimed as a church in the 11th century and dedicated to St.
Lorenzo, or St. Lawrence, who was believed to have been condemned
to death there.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Pantheon: Even this ``temple of all the gods,'' sitting
across a plaza from a McDonald's restaurant, was consecrated as a
church in 609 and still serves a local parish. Parts of the
Pantheon became Christian in other ways as well. In 1632, Pope
Urban VIII had bronze from the portico melted for Bernini's
baldacchino, or canopy, over the altar in St. Peter's Basilica.
Michelangelo studied the engineering of the Pantheon dome when
planning the dome of St. Peter's.

 &HT;    By Gayle White

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Italy
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny morning, the distinctive dome of St. Peter's Basilica
casts a shadow that dominates the landscape as Catholisim still
dominates the life of modern Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors climb hundreds of narrow, curved stairs to St. Peter's
435-foot cupola for a perspective of Rome where riders on motor
scooters regard red lights as suggestions, cellular telephones ring
continually, and tourists line up outside Gucci and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Easter, the holiest day of their year, tens of
thousands of Christians will gather outside St. Peter's, the home
church of a billion Catholics. With the year 2000 only months away,
the festivities are a foretaste of a yearlong birthday party
celebrating 2000 years of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is appropriate. The history of the faith can be
traced by a walk down these narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a Palestinian Jew who, Christians believe, died
and was resurrected almost two millennia ago. Word of that belief
reached Rome, a center of commerce, government and religion, and
the seat of an empire that eventually stretched from Britain to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Christianity was tolerated in Rome along with
worship of gods and goddesses from throughout the conquered
territories. But unlike the other cults of the day, Christianity
required exclusivility of its followers. Persecution began when
Roman authorities demanded worship of the ruling emperor and
Christians refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adversity, Christianity continued to grow and become
more organized until, in 381, Emperor Theodosius made it the
empire's official religion. For the most part, since that time,
Rome has remained the center of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Rome has given me a better perspective on the
history of the faith through the lives of the saints,'' said J.
Paul Kimes, 25, a native of Birmingham who is studying for the
priesthood at the Vatican's North American College. ``In the
States, the saints always seemed distant. But to know these people
walked these streets, that the blood of the martyrs was shed in
these streets, makes the saints stop being distant and become close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In its homeland, there are signs that Catholicism may be losing
influence: In a 1998 poll, a minority of Italians (47.6 percent)
said they are certain of the existence of God, while a majority
(51.9 percent) said they seldom or never attend religious services.
Yet for Christians around the world, Rome remains a pilgrimage
site. They come to study, worship or just to feel closer to their
religious roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to see the universality of the church,'' Kimes said.
``There are people from all over the world here, and the only thing
we have in common is our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday afternoon in the magnificent St. John Lateran
Church, the cathedral church of Rome, nuns in long habits, priests
in robes and lay people in the casual clothes of tourists make
their way in a procession around the geometrically patterned marble
floor of the sanctuary. Incense hangs in the air and light shimmers
off the gilding that seems to cover everything. At the center of
the church, a golden, haloed Jesus stares down.
</P>
<P>
   In a dingy building across the street, other nuns and tourists
make their awkward way up 25 marble steps covered in dark walnut
wood. These stairs, moved from Jerusalem, are said to be the ones
Jesus walked to the trial that led to his death. Small openings in
the wood show what are reputed to be bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think Jesus walked up these stairs!'' exclaimed Mike
D'Onofrio, 50, a chemical engineer from Pittsburgh, who had just
made his way up with his wife Carole and daughter Lisa. ``That's as
close as I've ever come to him physically _ except for the
Eucharist, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very powerful,'' said Carole D'Onofrio, 50, a
fund-raiser for a hospital. ``It's breathtaking. It brings your
faith to life in a different kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Rome's churches claim at least one relic or remembrance
of a saint, but none is more bizarre than the small crypt chapels
of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, adorned with the bones
of dead Capuchin monks arranged in intricate patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the end of the tour says, ``What you are now, we used
to be: What we are now, you will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling reminder that mankind seeks immortality through
religion _ especially here in the Eternal City.

<P>
   ORVIETO, Italy _ You can see your breath in the sanctuary of St.
Andrew and St. Bartholomew Church on a drizzly Saturday night
during Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen space heaters feebly try to battle the chill of a
temperature barely breaking the 30s as older women, in wool or fur
coats, gather on the hard, worn wooden pews to pray the rosary.
Their voices hum below the urgent appeal of the bells in the tower,
which seem to beg others to come. As the women continue their
prayers, the tone of the bells becomes deeper and the rhythm more
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ave Maria, piena di grazia,'' the women repeat in Italian_
``Hail Mary, full of grace''_the cadence of the words obvious even
to those who do not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   In front of them, incongruous with the tall gray stone walls and
the dark wood of the church, a representation of Mary is haloed in
small white electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew is a combined parish of about 400
families in the medieval part of this hill town of 21,000 people in
the region of Umbria about 90 minutes from Rome. The church is one
of hundreds of struggling congregations off the usual path of
tourists in Italy, the homeland of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 88 percent of Italians identify themselves as
Catholic, Catholicism is often more a matter of culture than of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Great Christian works of art draw millions of visitors to
museums, the smallest alcove in the largest city may be adorned
with an icon, and a street is likely to bear the name of a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Catholic teachings against artificial birth control
and abortion, the average Italian woman bears only 1.2 children,
and one in four pregnancies end in abortion. Also contrary to
church teachings, Italy's divorce rate doubled between 1980 and
1995 _ although it remains a fraction of that in the United States.
And, only 29 percent of the country's Catholics said they attend
Mass at least once a week, according to a 1998 International Social
Survey Programme, down from 34 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Alita Gia, who will not give her age but describes herself
through an interpreter as ``an old woman,'' comes to Mass at St.
Bartholomew and St. Andrew daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people come,'' she says. ``Even here, those who are
young, both husband and wife, have to work and young people are in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, she says, the church was fuller. ``People were
freer. Women were much more in church. Since people are busy, women
are much more uninvolved in church.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew's pastor, the Rev.
Marcello Piterelli, steps up to give a homily on Jesus' temptation
by Satan from the book of Matthew, about 40 people are in the pews.
All but a handful are women. There is one family with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are the largest group,'' Piterelli, 77,
acknowledges. In his 52nd year in the priesthood, he has served
this parish and another rural one nearby since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who experience intensive spiritual
foment,'' he says. ``They've lost the yeast in their life, what
brings them joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those people who remain ``firmly connected'' to the church,
he says, are not necessarily tied in to its full spiritual
dimensions. ``Some of them,'' he said, ``are scrupulously attached
to the formality of the gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piterelli prepares the bread and wine, believed to be Jesus'
body and blood, worshippers can hear the bells of another church in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   When they have had communion, Piterelli announces that the Mass
is concluded, and the worshippers go out into a drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
   Store windows on the streets nearby display bright pottery and
fashionable clothes. And the cobblestone lanes are crowded with
laughing, chatting shoppers.

   Vatican City
</P>
<P>
   On the ancient gray-brown cobblestones of St. Peter's square,
with moss and trampled cigarette butts between them, gathers a
Sunday morning crowd that seems to be a portrait of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sun that flirts from an overcast sky, American teenagers
in sports jerseys stand next to European women in full-length furs,
dark-faced African nuns in white habits, pale Irish nuns in black
habits and Asian tourists with cameras poised. Three dozen youths
from a church in Naples sing and dance the macarena. A man holds
his cellular telephone out to share the sound as bells begin to
ring out the 11 o'clock hour.
</P>

   Curved marble arms of a double colonnade seem to reach out from
the basilica to embrace them.

   This is ground zero for the largest Christian denomination in
the world, the center of a separate ``country'' with its own
government, newspaper, radio station and publishing house, home to
about 1,000 people. Decisions made here have changed the course of
Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
   A church has stood on this site since the 4th century when
Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire. The
facade of the present church is completely obscured by scaffolding
_ as are some 700 sites in the Vatican and Rome _ undergoing
cosmetic work to prepare for the estimated 25 million people
expected to visit in the year 2000. A joke around Rome says that
one church was scaffolded for so long that the scaffolding was
declared a historic structure.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that does not matter. The attention of the
faithful and the curious is not on the magnificent center of the
building, but on a window above its right arm.
</P>
<P>
   A cheer goes up when a banner is flung out showing the papal
seal. Another, louder cheer follows several minutes later when the
long-awaited man himself appears, postage-stamp sized, to say a
blessing. He greets the school group from Naples, and the children
and their chaperones jump, scream and hug each other. He mentions a
group of Latinos, and they bring out a guitar and begin to sing. An
impromptu festival is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, the 263rd successor to St. Peter, is the
mortal head of a billion followers of Jesus Christ, considered the
immortal head of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just, like, the center of everything,'' says Chris Uhl,
17, of Boston, who is wearing a Red Sox baseball cap backward as he
fulfills his ``lifelong dream'' to see the pope. ``He runs the
whole shebang.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II presides over a diverse and sometimes divided
institution seeped in centuries-old tradition and facing modern
challenges. As the most visible, most traveled pope in history, he
has used modern transportation and communication techniques to
connect the planet's scattered population of Catholics, some of
whom are tied together more by sentiment than faith.
</P>
<P>
   While upsetting liberal Catholics _ especially many in the
United States _ by insisting that the church adhere to prohibitions
against contraceptives, married priests and women in the
priesthood, he has become a symbol of the church's endurance.
</P>
<P>
   CeCe Winter Khan, 35, of Ottawa, Kan., is here with her husband
Tariq and her 20-month-old daughter, Caroline. Khan describes
herself as a ``cafeteria Catholic'' who accepts some church
positions and rejects others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my child to attend Catholic schools. I'm active in a
parish. I gave up beer and chocolates for Lent. I go to Mass every
week,'' she says. ``I do not agree with everything the Catholic
church teaches _ I don't agree with the stance against birth
control _ but this pope is someone I really respect. He's a
wonderful, gentle man.''
</P>
<P>
   William DePriest, 28, of Greenbrier, Tenn., who is in the U.S.
Air Force stationed in Naples with a NATO unit, is United
Methodist, one of the denominations that grew out of the split with
Catholicism during the Protestant Reformation, but says he came to
St. Peter's because ``Protestants came from Catholicism, so he's my
pope, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Being here on Sunday ``is awesome. It's overwhelming. It's very
humbling,'' says Barbara Larkin, 63, of Philadelphia. ``The ability
to touch things that are such a part of your religion brings you
closer to it. It makes it seem real. We're where our religion
began.''
</P>
<P>
   To peel back the layers of the Vatican and of Rome is to trace
the development of mankind's beliefs through the epochs. What is
now the seat of Catholic Christendom was the center of a vast pagan
empire at the time Jesus was born in Palestine. As the faith he
founded grew, his followers were sometimes tolerated, sometimes
persecuted until eventually their beliefs became the official
religion of the empire.
</P>
<P>
   Even after they were generally accepted, Christians faced
internal disagreement, political struggle, and papal scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the empire _ the Latin-speaking west and the
Greek-influenced east _ came to a final falling out in 1054 when
the head of the church of Rome and the head of the church of
Constantinople formally excommunicated each other. The western
branch became known as the Catholic Church; the eastern is called
the Orthodox Church. In 1965, Pope Paul VI and Patriarch of
Constantinople Athaneagoras I finally canceled the orders but the
churches remain separate.
</P>
<P>
   As Rome became the center of Catholicism _ except for 1305-1377
when the papacy was snatched by the French to Avignon _ the bishop
of Rome evolved into the head of the church, called ``papa,'' or
pope. In the Catholic church, popes were known as sponsors of both
some of the world's greatest Christian art and some of the church's
most blatant abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Sixtus IV, for example, is known for both the Sistine
Chapel and the Spanish Inquisition. The family name of the infamous
Borgia popes has become synonymous with corruption. And the attempt
to fund the construction of St. Peter's Basilica in the early 1500s
resulted in the crass sale of ``indulgences,'' or papal pardons,
that sparked the next major division in Christendom, the Protestant
Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though not unscarred and unscathed, the Catholic
church has lasted.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's _ believed to be set on the site of the grave of the
apostle whose name it bears _ is the marble representation of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Peter's is more a place than a building,'' said Charles
Byrd, 35, who is studying at the North American College in Rome to
be a priest in the Archdiocese of Atlanta. ``People were praying
here long before there was a church.''
</P>
<P>
   A sovereign state
</P>
<P>
   While the mystical link between humankind and God is explored in
St. Peter's, more mundane aspects of the Catholic religion are
managed in offices nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is a government with hundreds of thousands of
citizens spread throughout more than 2,500 dioceses around the
world. More than 160 countries have diplomatic relations with the
world's smallest country.
</P>
<P>
   Within its 108 acres are tennis courts, satellite dishes and a
cemetery. There is a small theater where, occasionally, the pope
watches a film _ most recently ``Vita e Bella,'' or ``Life is
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican gas station keeps the Vatican vehicles fueled. A
Vatican police force guards the buildings and takes reports on the
pickpockets who prey on the pilgrims. A Vatican bookstore sells
volumes in all the major languages. A Vatican post office takes
care of official mail as well as tourists' postcards. And a door
opening onto a narrow street inside the Vatican wall reveals the
ordinariness of an institutional kitchen, with the expected odors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the walls is a marketplace of street vendors who try to
peddle religious medals, papal snow globes and Vatican refrigerator
magnets to tourists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper than barbecue chicken,'' one yells to a group of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Roger Roensch, who heads the office for North American
visitors to the Vatican, sees both sides of life in the center of
the Catholic Church. Roensch reads the Vatican newspaper in Italian
and English daily and listens to Vatican radio every morning in
Italian, French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm shaving, I get the news,'' says Roensch, 66,
formerly a priest in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He prays in St. Peter's. ``And,'' he said, ``it's great to be in
attendance at the Holy Father's audiences and get to hear him say
all those things most people only read about.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Roensch needs to go from his office, several blocks from
the Vatican, to conduct business inside its walls, he has to pass
through the Vatican police and the colorfully dressed Swiss Guards,
the special unit that guards the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I need to go to a special office, such as the Secretary of
State, I have to have a written pass,'' he said. ``It's like going
through Customs in the United States. When you go in, you realize
you're going into a sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   2000 a year to celebrate
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican bureaucracy is busy these days preparing for 2000,
declared a Jubilee year by John Paul II. Over the next year, the
city of Rome and the Vatican will host a calendar full of special
events for every segment of Catholicism: the disabled, laborers and
members of religious orders, to name a few. One of the largest will
be World Youth Day in August, expected to draw several hundred
thousand teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catholic tradition, a Holy Year, or Jubilee, is a year of
forgiveness, reconciliation and commitment to service. The idea
goes back to the days of Moses, when, according to the scriptures,
God told the Israelites to ``hallow the fiftieth year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the faithful, Pope John Paul II wrote, ``Every
Jubilee Year is like an invitation to a wedding feast. ... The
present task of the Bishop of Rome, as the Successor of Peter, is
to make the invitation to the Jubilee celebration all the more
insistent (for the) two thousandth anniversary of the central
mystery of the Christian faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics will begin the celebration on Christmas Eve this year
when the pope walks through a now-sealed Holy Door in St. Peter's
to symbolize a new beginning _ a metaphor for the new life
Christians claim in Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a time of hope for the church,'' said Sister
Gilmary Kay, 32, a nun in the Michigan-based Sisters of Mercy who
works with Roensch. ``It's an opportunity to move to greater
holiness in whatever way God has called us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the year 2000, there is a sense that although the church
remains firmly centered in the Vatican, its power increasingly lies
outside Europe. With Catholic leaders in various parts of the world
raising questions about birth control, clerical celibacy, women's
roles and lay involvement, some significant questions loom as an
aging and frequently ailing John Paul II and the church he heads
move toward a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Dorn of Jefferson City, Mo., senses it. A church
history teacher, he speaks of the ``connectedness'' and
``universality'' he feels at St. Peter's with Catholics around the
world. But in that universality, he is aware of the breadth of the
church beyond its historical roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fascinating, absolutely fascinating, to see
what comes next,'' Dorn says.
</P>
<P>
   He has come here before sunrise on a recent Monday morning to
offer Mass with some friends in one of the small chapels around St.
Peter's periphery. The scene is much different than the day before
_ no dancing youths, no Latino guitar players, no papal photo
opportunities. Inside the cavernous church, oversized statues of
popes and saints watch over the treasures and tombs. Mosaic
cherubs, their faces made up of fingernail-sized tile, look down
from the heavenly heights above. In a chapel reserved for prayer,
eight nuns _ some in gray, some in blue, some in black _ kneel with
two other women and two men.
</P>
<P>
   On the right-hand side of the entrance to the church, in
Michelangelo's famous Pieta, a smooth-skinned Mary, mother of the
church, is alone with her lifeless marble son. Three dead roses lie
on the floor, their scattered petals blending with the deep pink
and brown marble of the floor. A maintenance man with a long broom
sweeps them away.
</P>
<P>
   But today is special. It is the Feast of the Chair of Peter, and
the statue of St. Peter is dressed as pope in red brocade robe,
gold crown, ring and pectoral cross. One foot remains bare, the
detail of its sculpture worn away by the lips of pilgrims who have
kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn stands near the adorned Peter as he considers the future of
the church that claims the saint as its first pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years or less, a paradigm shift is coming,'' Dorn said.
``For the first time since we left Jerusalem, the Catholic church
is going to be majority Third World, Southern Hemisphere. Europe
has dominated the church since the end of the 1st century. Now,
it's not going to be the major stockholder.''
</P>
<P>
   When cardinals have to elect a successor to the Polish Pope John
Paul II _ himself the first pontiff from outside Italy in
centuries, there is some chance they will choose an African or a
Latin American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what they're going to do, including them,'' Dorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics like to look at papal elections as politics as usual,
he said. ``But I think there's this sense of the spirit moving the
church.

STEAM PLANT OWNER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR PATRIOTS STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Under intense pressure to get out of the way,
a steam plant company on the proposed New England Patriots stadium
site here has agreed to demolish the facility and relocate its
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And so months of fretting and posturing ended with smiles and
handshakes Thursday when Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland said
the most complicated issue surrounding the team's move had been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the whole enchilada,'' Rowland said at a
hastily called new conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots issued a statement saying they were ``encouraged by
this development and continue to be enthusiastic about the stadium
project.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after Rowland and the steam plant's
corporate chief, Arthur Marquardt of CTG Resources Inc., ate
takeout Caesar salads in the governor's office and smoothed weeks
of hostility over lack of progress on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the resolution seemed so simple it's surprising
it took so long.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a quasi-public
agency that turns trash to energy, has agreed in principle to run
piping from its own plant a mile away to the stadium site, feeding
that location with heating and cooling along with the rest of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   CRRA will sell its power to CTG, which will become an energy
retailer instead of a producer.
</P>
<P>
   CTG also said it would raze its 1960's office building right
next to the steam plant and move its headquarters to leased space
in a vacant tower in nearby Constitution Plaza, although that part
of the deal has not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   CTG was considering building a new corporate office facility at
another location, but the $48 million pricetag made the governor
fume. None of the $374 million in public financing for the stadium
and infrastructure is earmarked for clearing the site. Instead, the
corporate relocation will be funded privately by Connecticut's
business community, which so far has pledged about $25 million to
that component of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing space in Constitution Plaza would be less expensive,
officials said, eliminating the $23 million gap to move the
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is significantly smaller, if there is one, far more
manageable. . . . And we have a lot of other partners here,''
Rowland said, referring to other business leaders who have pledged
to help get the site cleared by providing more money and resources.
</P>
<P>
   If CTG does not finalize a lease at Constitution Plaza, the
company has already agreed to move to a temporary location to clear
the stadium site. Then the state can begin the significant task of
cleaning up pollution there caused by a previous coal gasification
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he believes the location will be ready for
construction by next spring, a schedule that must be met for the
Patriots to begin playing in Hartford by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the surprise announcement that a deal had been
struck regarding the site, Rowland also released a status report to
the Patriots a day early.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-page document, required to be ready Friday as part of the
development agreement with the team, came to this simple
conclusion: ``The stadium project is progressing rapidly on all
fronts within the project timeline. There are no problems of site
availability, preparation, cost or remediation that cannot be
overcome in time to make the site available on-time for stadium
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides clearing the site, the team must be convinced by the
report that the state has enough money set aside for infrastructure
to allow cars to exit parking lots within one hour of stadium
events; and must have a plan ensuring that the Patriots will not be
held responsible for any environmental problems or cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The status report is vague in addressing the infrastructure
issue, saying that a ``traffic impact analysis'' is still being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Rowland, said $55 million of
the $374 million project already aside for infrastructure would be
enough to cover the parking, roads, and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says the state has begun the process of
obtaining $50 million in environmental liability insurance, which
will cost between $300,000 and $500,000 a year.

   AOMORI, Japan _ When he was a boy, Tomihiro Yoshizaki used to
dig for arrowheads in some strange mounds of earth outside this
city in northern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now those mounds have been excavated, resolving crucial
mysteries about the ancient hunter-gatherers who lived here 5,000
years ago. Just one mystery remains: to what extent are Yoshizaki
and other modern Japanese descended from those ancient people?
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the Japanese people remain a much-debated puzzle,
but part of it is being pieced together here on the vast
archeological site near Aomori, 375 miles north of Tokyo. Local
people like Yoshizaki, 45, had long known about the mounds and the
artifacts. But they were investigated only in 1992 when surveyors
preparing to build a baseball stadium uncovered evidence that this
was once a village of the Jomon people who lived in Japan from
10,000 B.C. to about 300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Now the site is perhaps the most important archeological dig in
Japan, attracting half a million tourists a year and shedding new
insights into prehistoric life here. Moreover, even after filling
40,000 boxes of material, archeologists say that they have at least
15 more years' work before they have completed their investigations
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Aomori had very little history,'' mused Yoshizaki.
``But now all of a sudden we have a great deal of history, and
we're very proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The excavations have aroused enormous interest in Japan, where
archeology is a national craze. Japan spends more than $1 billion
annually in public funds to excavate some 13,000 sites each year,
archeology books become best sellers, and leading experts often
appear on television.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are in some ways political as well as archeological
because of the intense rivalries in East Asia. North Korea claims
that it, not Africa, is where humans first appeared. South Koreans
believe that it was their emigrants who brought civilization to
Japan and that a Korean clan probably founded the Japanese imperial
family. Chinese suggest that Xu Fu, an ancient Chinese envoy who
was sent to Japan in the third century B.C., became Japan's first
emperor, Jimmu.
</P>
<P>
   These theories have not been a big hit in Japan. But the
underlying competition may be one reason for the pride in new
findings that the Jomon people who lived in Japan even earlier _
about 10,000 B.C. to 300 B.C. _ were much more sophisticated than
anybody had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Jomon sites have been found all over Japan, but the excavations
here have been the most startling. The first discovery was of six
enormous holes in the ground with the remains of wooden pillars one
yard thick, evidently the base for some huge structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stunned people, and not only because it raised questions
about how they cut and dragged the logs,'' said Yasuhiro Okada, a
chief archeologist at the site in Aomori. ``But also because it
suggests a certain population and level of technology and social
organization. This all showed much greater skills than we had
assumed for these hunter-gatherers, and it was a stunning discovery
for most Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation showed that the site was a settled village
with hundreds of inhabitants and separate cemeteries for children
and adults, and that its people had dabbled in agriculture by
planting chestnuts and millet and other domesticated plants. There
apparently was trade, for the dig turned up jade from 400 miles to
the south and obsidian from the northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view had been that virtually all culture
originated in Korea and China and then spread to Japan, but now
some Japanese archeologists point to evidence that some innovations
went the other way. They suggest that buckwheat farming,
lacquerware-making and other innovations originated in Japan and
then traveled to Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we have learned many things from Korea and
China,'' said Makoto Sahara, a historian and director general of
the National Museum of Japanese History. ``But not all things.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a complication, though. While modern Japanese feel
pride in Jomon achievements, analysis of skeletons suggests that
the Jomon did not look like modern Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had features that made them look more like
Caucasians and they seem to have resembled the Ainu, an ethnic
group that still lives in tiny numbers in northern Japan. In the
museum here in Aomori, Japanese tourists wandered by exhibits about
the Jomon and gazed affectionately at pictures of what their Jomon
ancestors are believed to have looked like _ even though the only
one in the room who looked much like the pictures was an American.
</P>
<P>
   One theory has been that waves of immigrants from China and
Korea quickly displaced the Jomon people and their culture in about
300 B.C.They ushered in the Yayoi period, which emphasized rice
paddy cultivation and whose people looked more like today's
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, a growing body of skeletal, DNA and
linguistic analysis has suggested that modern Japanese are the
product of both Jomon people and the Yayoi immigrants from China
and Korea _ and perhaps other population infusions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Horai, a scholar, argues that modern Japanese are a mix
of about 35 percent Jomon and 65 percent Yayoi. That would mean
that Japanese are descended mostly from Chinese and Koreans but
also have an important Jomon component.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent DNA studies clearly indicate the close genetic
relationship between the Japanese on the main islands and the
Koreans in particular,'' said Keiichi Omoto, a leading scholar on
the origins of Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars note that despite the perception in Japan and abroad
that Japanese are homogeneous, there is considerable regional
variation in physical appearance. In particular, Japanese in
northern provinces tend to have rounder eyes and more body hair and
wider faces, traits that may suggest a bit more Jomon heritage.
</P>
<P>
   A museum at the site in Aomori offers a computer screen to
advise visitors on the proportion of their blood that comes from
the Jomon, based on their eyes and body hair and other
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in northern Japan can be 60 to 80 percent of Jomon
origin, while those from western or southern Japan are 40 percent
Jomon or less,'' said Okada, the archeologist. He added: ``The
Jomon people were the real ancestors of the Japanese. They formed
the base.''

   CBS Inc. announced Thursday that it had agreed to buy King World
Productions Inc., the syndicator of television hits like ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy,'' for
$2.5 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Karmazin, the chairman of CBS, said that his company would
swap 0.81 CBS share for each of King World's 74 million outstanding
shares, which values them at $33 each based on CBS's closing price
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of King World rose 56.25 cents Thursday, to $31.125. CBS
fell 68.25 cents, to $40.125.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been looking to extend its control over programming for
its owned-and-operated stations. From a financial view, King World
not only has $800 million in cash on its balance sheet, but it
requires little capital expenditure and carries no debt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, King World's controlling shareholders, Roger King,
54, the chairman, and his brother, Michael King, 50, the vice
chairman, who have about 20 percent of King World's stock, have
long been considering whether to sell their company or expand it.
</P>
<P>
   Though King World has come up with some of the most successful
TV shows in history, it has failed to match that success investing
the cash those hits have generated. In a conference call Thursday,
Karmazin and the King brothers described the new relationship as
one in which the Kings could focus on programming while Karmazin
focused on investing the capital that King World brings to the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel is a very good banker,'' Michael King said. ``And King
World has not been a good banker. We will do what we do best,
programming, and we will let Mel invest.''
</P>
<P>
   In selling to CBS, the King brothers will keep management roles.
Both will report to Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television. Because the deal is for stock, the Kings are not forced
to pay capital gains taxes on the sale. Once the deal is completed,
which is expected later this year, the brothers will own about 1.6
percent of CBS. Oprah Winfrey, who is also a King World
shareholder, will own about five-tenths of a percent. Karmazin owns
about 1 percent of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Both CBS and King World have syndication businesses, and the
companies said Thursday that they planned to keep those businesses
separate. But Chris Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said
the merger would give CBS more leverage in the television
syndication business because a single company will be selling rerun
rights to a larger group of programs. Among CBS's first-run shows
are ``Martha Stewart Living'' and ``Pensacola, Wings of Gold.''
King World programs about 20 hours a week, Dixon noted, including
``Wheel of Fortune,'' the highest-rated syndicated show, and the
No. 2 ``Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But what particularly appealed to Wall Street about the deal was
that it will add immediately to CBS's bottom line. The merger will
add about 10 cents a share to CBS's 1999 net profits. Though CBS's
television stations make money, the network itself loses money, and
the King World deal will help offset some of those losses. Because
CBS has tax-loss carryforwards that it inherited through its merger
with Westinghouse four years ago, it can probably shelter income
from federal taxes this year and part of next year as well, CBS's
chief financial officer, Fred Reynolds, said.
</P>
<P>
   Though numerous companies had considered bidding for King World,
one key problem has been whether Oprah Winfrey would renew her
contract after it expires in 2002. But as one analyst said
Thursday, few thought either ``Wheel of Fortune'' or ``Jeopardy''
would survive as long as they have, and they have been sold to
stations through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal year ended Aug. 31, King World had a profit of
$136 million on revenue of $684 million. In 1998, CBS had revenue
of $6.8 billion and a net loss of $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   John Tinker, who follows the company for Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, said King World would have a better shot at making new
shows more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS immediately gives them a broad reach since its stations
reach 32 percent of the country,'' he said. ``That leverage is very
valuable. And there may be some advantages even for shows that are
syndicated on other stations. Take Oprah Winfrey. She is now on
ABC. But even before the contract is up, CBS could do specials.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Who knows what happens when the contract is up.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank Allen &AMP; Co. represented King World. CBS
represented itself.

ORDERS FOR RAYTHEON TOMAHAWK COULD BUILD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. could see an acceleration of orders for its
Tomahawk cruise missile as a result of recent military actions.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy, the prime user of the missile, said it has
requested authorization to accelerate plans to buy upgraded copies
of the missile, which the Lexington, Mass. defense contractor
builds mainly in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Under a request pending with US Secretary of Defense William
Cohen, the Navy seeks $113 million to pay for the retrofitting of
324 missiles with the latest technologies. The money had been
allocated for work in 2000 and 2001, but the Navy says it needs the
missiles sooner as replacements, after firing more than 300 of them
against targets in Iraq in December.
</P>
<P>
   Tomahawks have also been fired during the current round of air
strikes against Yugoslavia, further depleting the Navy's supply.
The Navy has ``over 2,000 Tomahawks'' on hand, said Lieutenant
Meghan Mariman, most of which use satellite-based navigation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Navy is slowly upgrading Tomahawks that are not
equipped with the latest technology. In addition to the new
navigation systems, upgrades would include new titanium warhead
casings and newer engines.

<P>
   ALGUNJA, Macedonia _ When three members of the 1st Squadron of
the 4th US Cavalry were captured by Serb forces in a valley nestled
below this border village, they were driving through an area the
troops have dubbed ``Injun country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the villages northeast of Kumanovo, most of the residents are
ethnic Serbs. They have been hostile to the US troops that have
been driving through their villages for the last five years, and
especially since the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Slave Markovic, the local postman, led two
reporters to the top of a hill overlooking the road, he and other
local people said, on which the US soldiers were driving when Serb
troops surrounded them and peppered their armored Humvee vehicle
with small-arms fire. Speaking on the condition on anonymity, a
NATO officer confirmed that the last radio contact with the
captured soldiers was in the area pointed out by Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian TV quoted residents of the Yugoslav village of
Slavuevac as saying that the Americans had driven about a mile into
Serbian territory before they were captured, following shouted
warnings and shots.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Markovic, 36, who said he heard
but did not see the shooting, said the soldiers had been on a road
that leads into Yugoslavia. He and other locals from Tatarinovac,
the last village in Macedonia before the border, are convinced the
Americans unwittingly crossed into Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans vehemently deny this, saying that when confronted
by hostile forces the three-man reconnaissance team radioed back
that they were three miles from the border. But radio contact was
lost, and those who took part in a desperate and ultimately futile
search-and-rescue mission said they had no idea where the soldiers
were when they were captured.
</P>
<P>
   General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, said the
three soldiers were captured while in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   From the hillside overlooking the unpaved road where locals say
the capture took place, the rugged terrain provides ample
opportunity for an ambush. Given the hostility of the indigenous
population, military officials here are not ruling out the
possibility that the soldiers were set up by Serb partisans, who
may have tipped off Serb forces about the movements of US troops on
border patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic said that local youths were bragging that they helped
lure the Americans into a trap when the US patrol stopped and asked
them how far they were from the border. US and NATO officials in
Skopje, the Macedonian capital, scoffed at that claim, saying the
soldiers never would have sought or relied on directions from
locals they knew to be hostile to them.
</P>
<P>
   Between noon and 5 p.m. Thursday, no less than five separate
NATO patrols, ranging from two to four vehicles, were seen in the
vicinity of where the soldiers were captured. While the men who
were captured went out on patrol with two other vehicles, it is
unclear how or why they got separated.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe on Tuesday, the captured
soldiers' commander, Lieutenant Colonel James Shufelt, said his
troops were routinely stoned as their vehicles passed through
ethnic Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at risk,'' Shufelt said. Still, interviews with Shufelt
and several of the 350 soldiers under his command suggested they
have felt relatively secure as they performed scouting missions
along the border with Kosovo and southeast Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the squadron was confident enough about security along
the border that it had allowed reporters to accompany patrols this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The task force at Camp Able Sentry had just finished a five-year
UN peacekeeping mission along the Macedonian border. Last week, the
soldiers began reconnaisance missions along the border in support
of the NATO troops waiting in Macedonia to implement a Kosovo peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to answer questions Thursday about the
abductions, including what kind of equipment was on board that
would have helped the soldiers avoid crossing into Yugoslav
territory by mistake. But a US military source said those who
conduct border patrols routinely carry a global positioning system,
a navigation device that allows them to follow the contours of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their patrol plan was nowhere near the border,'' said a US
Army officer, who acknowledged, however, that the soldiers could
have taken a wrong turn or misread the positioning system.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the scene of the capture Thursday, and to the
captured soldiers' base on Tuesday, provided some insight as to why
the Americans were unable to flee or fight when confronted on an
isolated border road.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are no markings or checkpoints clearly showing the
border. The road is treacherous and only wide enough for one
vehicle, making the prospect of turning around difficult and time
consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers interviewed Tuesday said that while the Humvees are
bulletproof, they cannot withstand hand-held or mobile-launched
missiles, which could be easily aimed at them in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were under orders to carry their M-16 rifles on
patrol. But the Humvee is cramped, with heavy armored doors that
are cumbersome to open. If the Americans were surrounded as they
reported, it would have been difficult for them to leap out to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Shufelt said troops at Camp Able Sentry are on a six-month
rotation, and that most of the soldiers under his command had been
at the base for about 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, one NATO officer said it was possible the
soldiers got lost and inadvertently drove into Serb territory,
while another said the border mission dated back to 1993 and that
the squadron was well aware of the border's contours.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with villagers, meanwhile, suggested that the US
soldiers, and the investigators now trying to piece together the
capture, could not count on help from local residents, who consider
themselves Serbs living in Yugoslavia, despite the fact that
Macedonia quit the Yugoslav Federation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In the Macedonian village of St. Nagoricane, a few miles from
the site of the capture, ethnic Serb residents rejoiced as they
watched news on the television of Zika Tosic's cafe and convenience
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell Clinton this,'' Tosic said, pulling his forefinger
across his neck to imitate a throat-cutting. ``It is too bad they
only got three.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby farming community of Nikuljane, villagers
complained that troops searching for the captured soldiers ran over
and killed a dog, wrecked vineyards, and traumatized small children
with low-flying helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jeeps go by every day and we can't sleep. They scare the
children,'' said Blagoja Jovcic, the village elder.

STEAM PLANT OWNER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR PATRIOTS STADIUM

<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Under intense pressure to get out of the way,
a steam plant company on the proposed New England Patriots stadium
site here has agreed to demolish the facility and relocate its
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And so months of fretting and posturing ended with smiles and
handshakes Thursday when Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland said
the most complicated issue surrounding the team's move had been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the whole enchilada,'' Rowland said at a
hastily called new conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots issued a statement saying they were ``encouraged by
this development and continue to be enthusiastic about the stadium
project.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after Rowland and the steam plant's
corporate chief, Arthur Marquardt of CTG Resources Inc., ate
takeout Caesar salads in the governor's office and smoothed weeks
of hostility over lack of progress on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the resolution seemed so simple it's surprising
it took so long.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a quasi-public
agency that turns trash to energy, has agreed in principle to run
piping from its own plant a mile away to the stadium site, feeding
that location with heating and cooling along with the rest of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   CRRA will sell its power to CTG, which will become an energy
retailer instead of a producer.
</P>
<P>
   CTG also said it would raze its 1960's office building right
next to the steam plant and move its headquarters to leased space
in a vacant tower in nearby Constitution Plaza, although that part
of the deal has not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   CTG was considering building a new corporate office facility at
another location, but the $48 million pricetag made the governor
fume. None of the $374 million in public financing for the stadium
and infrastructure is earmarked for clearing the site. Instead, the
corporate relocation will be funded privately by Connecticut's
business community, which so far has pledged about $25 million to
that component of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing space in Constitution Plaza would be less expensive,
officials said, eliminating the $23 million gap to move the
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is significantly smaller, if there is one, far more
manageable. . . . And we have a lot of other partners here,''
Rowland said, referring to other business leaders who have pledged
to help get the site cleared by providing more money and resources.
</P>
<P>
   If CTG does not finalize a lease at Constitution Plaza, the
company has already agreed to move to a temporary location to clear
the stadium site. Then the state can begin the significant task of
cleaning up pollution there caused by a previous coal gasification
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he believes the location will be ready for
construction by next spring, a schedule that must be met for the
Patriots to begin playing in Hartford by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the surprise announcement that a deal had been
struck regarding the site, Rowland also released a status report to
the Patriots a day early.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-page document, required to be ready Friday as part of the
development agreement with the team, came to this simple
conclusion: ``The stadium project is progressing rapidly on all
fronts within the project timeline. There are no problems of site
availability, preparation, cost or remediation that cannot be
overcome in time to make the site available on-time for stadium
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides clearing the site, the team must be convinced by the
report that the state has enough money set aside for infrastructure
to allow cars to exit parking lots within one hour of stadium
events; and must have a plan ensuring that the Patriots will not be
held responsible for any environmental problems or cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The status report is vague in addressing the infrastructure
issue, saying that a ``traffic impact analysis'' is still being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Rowland, said $55 million of
the $374 million project already aside for infrastructure would be
enough to cover the parking, roads, and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says the state has begun the process of
obtaining $50 million in environmental liability insurance, which
will cost between $300,000 and $500,000 a year.

 &HT;    CONFESSION BY BUS DRIVER HEIGHTENS PROBE INTO MULTIPLE MURDERS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY - A bus driver confessed Thursday to raping and
nearly killing a teenage girl. That intensified an investigation
into dozens of grisly murders over the last six years in Juarez,
Mexico, a city across the border from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Manuel Guardado Marquez, who listened to the 14-year-old
victim testify in a Juarez court, also has confessed to killing
four women (cq), according to Juarez police.
</P>
<P>
   During informal questioning, Guardado also named eight men he
said had killed women who worked in Juarez's many maquiladora
factories. Some of the men, like Guardado, worked as bus drivers
and ferried female factory workers to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating the eight men. One appeared on a
Mexican television station Wednesday night to declare his
innocence, said Astrid Gonzalez, a Chihuahua state employee who
counsels crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said Guardado previously was convicted of rape and
received a ``light sentence.'' She didn't have any other details.
</P>
<P>
   Guardado allegedly assaulted the 14-year-old victim March 18,
choking her and leaving her for dead, according to Mexican press
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said people in Juarez hope Guardado's arrest will help
solve some of the murders that have haunted the city.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of 180 killings have not been solved, according
to Gonzalez. The victims were raped or sexually brutalized in 54 of
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim begins)
</P>
<P>
   ``The impunity in this city is so great that anybody can come
and kill,'' said Esther Chavez, a Juarez women's activist who has
criticized authorities for not doing more to stop the murders.
</P>
<P>
   She said ``we are very happy that this individual (Guardado) was
detained, but it was circumstantial,'' she said. ``It wasn't
because of a police investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Guardado was arrested in Durango state after he severely beat
his wife and her family contacted police. The 14-year-old girl
Guardado allegedly assaulted identified him.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Gonzalez said Juarez authorities have
heard that FBI agents are investigating whether there is a
connection between a couple arrested this week in New Mexico, and
the killings in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are David Ray Parker and Cindy Lea Hendy, who were
arrested Tuesday after a woman alleged she had been abducted and
sexually tortured by the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Hendy live near Truth or Consequences, N. M., only a
few hours from Juarez. FBI agents are investigating possible links
to crimes in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Richard Newman of the New Mexico State Police declined to
confirm or deny if authorities there are looking into a Juarez
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ressler, a retired FBI criminal profiler who was a
consultant to Juarez police, suspects that many of the Juarez
killings might be the work of ``people close to the factories,''
such as supervisors or bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls themselves should have been told to get off the bus
and have their families meet them,'' Ressler said. ``I observed
them jumping off the buses and just disappearing, alone.''

IMAGES OF CAPTURED SOLDIERS COULD CHANGE SUPPORT FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, the warfare in Serbia has produced a confusing
collage of television images -- refugees streaming across borders,
allied planes lifting off for bombing runs, assorted demolished
buildings and talking heads pontificating from the safety of the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   The media phase of the conflict came into much sharper focus
Thursday, however, when the battered faces of three captured US
soldiers _ Andrew Ramirez, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M.
Gonzales _ became the dominant television image, dramatically
driving home the concept of real risks to real Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives (the war) a face, doesn't it?'' said Brookings
Institution senior fellow Stephen Hess. ``The media needed it; . .
. you need it to frame a story.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sight of the captured servicemen could increase public
interest in Kosovo, it also conjures up memories of Michael Durant,
the US Army helicopter pilot who was captured and dragged through
the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. Television images of the
injured American captive were widely credited with souring public
opinion on the Somalia mission and US forces pulled out within
months. (Time magazine published a cover story headlined: ``What in
the World Are We Doing?'' next to a picture of a wounded Durant.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is whether pictures of three US prisoners in
Serbia could start prompting the nation to question the wisdom of a
war about which it is already ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of the calculus of how much sacrifice is too much
for something that is important but not vital,'' to US interests,
said Pew Research Center director Andrew Kohut, whose polling
reveals tepid support for the US role in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the story of the captured airmen _ who may stand trial
in Yugoslavia as early as Friday _ quickly moved into the media
spotlight. Their photographs led all three major network newscasts
Thursday evening. CNN's ``Crossfire'' program tackled the topic
with former Vietnam prisoner of war Senator John McCain, from
Arizona. The parents of Steven Gonzales discussed his capture at a
press conference while news reports showed yellow ribbons being
strung around trees in honor of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   With US soldiers suddenly in enemy hands, Thursday's coverage
featured other telling reminders of American foreign policy
debacles. A Fox News Channel report noted that some citizens were
``starting to talk about Vietnam,'' while a participant in CNN's
``Talkback'' program characterized the servicemen as ``hostages,''
a grim throwback to the Iranian takeover of the US embassy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the American media have been treating NATO's war in
the Balkans as a major story. According to network news analyst
Andrew Tyndall, 64 percent of the ABC, NBC and CBS nightly
newscasts last week were devoted to Yugoslavia. That is ``more than
the peak week of Monica,'' he said. ``This is the peak foreign
policy story of the Clinton presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet public opinion does not seem to have crystallized in favor
of or against US involvement in the ethnic strife. By a narrow
margin _ 47 percent to 42 percent _ the respondents to an
ABC/Washington Post poll believed vital US interests are at stake.
A plurality of those polled by the Pew Research Center disapproved
of sending US troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers. When asked if the
United States has a responsibility to do something about ethnic
fighting in Kosovo, the Pew respondents were split right down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important,'' said Kohut, ``is we don't have a
majority...saying what happens in Kosovo is vital to the US.''
People are responding to the war on a humanitarian basis, he added,
but have yet to be convinced it is in the best interests of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Tyndall believes that television coverage of the war to date has
not benefited American policymakers, since ``we see the refugees''
pouring out of Kosovo and it appears that ``the bombing created the
refugee crisis.'' The prisoners make the situation even more dicey,
he added, since ``Clinton's been really leery of anybody in uniform
getting killed ever since Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Kolodzy, a former CNN producer who teaches a course in
international media at Emerson College in Boston, offered the
dissenting view that images of the captives could spark a more
hawkish public response. ``I think it's really going get people
angry,'' she said. ``People feel (the conflict in) Iraq was dragged
out, and I think it could backfire on the Serbs.'' She did
acknowledge, however, that the Serbs may have been emboldened by
what happened in Somalia to use the prisoners for public relations
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut does point out that the lessons of Somalia have been
misinterpreted. ``It was misinterpreted as Americans aren't willing
to accept casualties,'' he explained. ``What's clear is that
Americans won't accept casualties when they don't think our vital
interests are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kohut's own data, the Clinton administration has
yet to convince Americans that our national interest is on the line
in Yugoslavia. Unless he does, painful images of three bruised
American captives could prove to be the loudest shot fired in the
Balkan war.

SO MANY PRODUCTS, SO FEW BUCKS FOR THEM IN `EDTV' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy product placement!
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers who caught ``EDtv'' during its opening weekend
couldn't help but notice the number of name-brand products featured
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   For those not familiar with the concept of ``EDtv,'' it's the
tale of Ed, a regular guy who agrees to let a cable TV channel
broadcast his life, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ed eats Pop Tarts for breakfast and drinks lots of Pepsi. His
girlfriend, Shari, delivers packages for UPS, wearing the company's
trademark brown uniform, of course. When Ed and Shari eventually
break up, there's a USA Today poll _ declaring Shari an unfit
girlfriend _ to thank.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the name brands featured in Ed's
everyday life. Factor in the dozens of companies _ including
Calgon, Saturn, Maytag and Trojan _ who buy commercial time on the
live TV show, and who could blame moviegoers for assuming serious
cash was made from product placement?
</P>
<P>
   Director Ron Howard wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to get a lot of money out of this
product placement. I really did,'' Howard said during a recent
visit to Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the case. Advertisers granted permission to use
their logos but wouldn't pay any placement fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't because of the satirical nature of the movie,''
Howard explained. ``Its irreverent edginess made them fear somehow
that their product would be in a movie that was a little too
controversial, that it may be used in a situation that might not do
the product credit. Or, they thought we might make fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of cash didn't keep Howard from using the products, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed real products. I wanted it to be as realistic as it
could be, so I wanted recognizable names. I don't want to make up a
name for a condom. I want Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a smart element in the movie, and I also
thought, we're going to offset our budget with this. I bet we can
raise a couple million bucks with this advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wound up being zippo. Well, it wasn't zippo because they
did give us the right to use their logos and that is giving
something. And I think we might have gotten a little money for the
Reebok plants, but not a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing about this all my life and have never been
able to cash in on it. Maybe someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, Howard's next film is ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''
For his trip to Whoville, maybe the evil green one could drive a
Ford Explorer instead of a sleigh.

   TIRANA, Albania _ In a muddy outdoor recreation center in this
capital city, the Albanian army has set up 200 tents around an
empty swimming pool to house 2,000 of the Kosovo refugees who have
poured across the border and been bused here for relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Albanian soldiers and local volunteers ladled out rice
from huge cauldrons onto plastic plates for families, crouched on
blankets and flattened cardboard boxes under canvas roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee camp, chaotic and squalid but teeming with good
intentions, has become a kind of shining tent city on the hill for
beleaguered Albania _ a source of anxiety, but also of pride.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden influx of more than 100,000 Kosovo refugees is
already straining the resources of this country, the poorest in
Europe. But the fact that Albania, long the basket case of the
Balkans, is suddenly thrust into the role of benefactor has, for
now, lent its government and its citizens a novel sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is a sign to other countries,'' said Mufta, a
50-year-old mechanic. He showed up at Tirana's indoor basketball
court and sports arena, which has been transformed into the
capital's first clearing point for refugees, to seek a Kosovo
family he could take into his home. ``Italy helped our people when
they fled to their shores,'' he said, ``and now we Albanians have
to help the Albanians of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, Albania was the most isolated Communist
dictatorship in Eastern Europe. The overthrow of communism in 1991
was accompanied by riots and destruction that led to starvation in
some regions and tens of thousands of refugees. A shaky transition
to capitalism was stopped in its tracks two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Albanian was overwhelmed by nationwide riots that
followed the collapse of a series of pyramid schemes that cost tens
of thousands of Albanians their life savings. About 2,000 people
died in that uprising, a new wave of refugees fled, and investment
dried up.
</P>
<P>
   The country remains mired in corruption and crime, highway
robbery, blood feuds and organized gangs, much of it sustained by
more than 600,000 weapons looted from army and police armories
during the rioting.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling Coca-Cola bottling plant, built by an Italian
subsidiary in 1993, was proudly re-opened four weeks ago, after it
burned down last year after an electrical fire. It is heralded
locally as a sign of Albania's free-market future, but next to the
red rooftop Coca-Cola logo are two piles of sandbags put up hastily
in 1997 to shield snipers, a reminder of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's new prime minister, Pandeli Majko, 31, chosen last
September by the Socialist Party to replace Fatos Nano, who was
forced to resign, was supposed to be represent a new generation of
leadership. While he is not viewed as personally corrupt, few in
Albania are ready to praise his tangible accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Since the refugee crisis exploded on its borders, Majkos'
government has pleaded for international aid, but it has not waited
for outside assistance to help refugees. The Albanian Red Cross,
private businesses, state and city employees, high-school students
and elderly volunteers are on the front-line of assistance to the
Kosovo refugees in the capital, from pitching tents to distributing
food and clothing, and providing medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Pampers for the babies, but otherwise we are doing all
right,'' said an Albanian nurse who was directing a makeshift
medical center in the Hotel Arberia, which the government
commandeered Monday as an emergency refugee center. On Thursday,
230 Kosovo refugees were packed into its corridors and rooms,
looked after by hotel employees and a team of nurses dispatched by
a local municipal clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and international aid organizations have
sent food and have pledged nearly $100 million in assistance for
the refugees. Foreign aid workers helping on the ground provide
efficient know-how and flashes of exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Many have complained about the lack of coordination and
occasional flashbacks to Soviet-style bureaucracy, most noticeably
a decision by Albanian authorities at the border in Kukes on
Wednesday to institute a new and complicated system of registering
refugees. That led to long lines of refugees, many of whom had gone
without food for days, stretching back across the border into
Serbia. That decision was reversed Thursday and the processing
system eased a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Albania has done a remarkable job despite the
difficulties, and the difficulties are enormous,'' a senior Western
diplomat said. Other European officials have emphasized the dangers
that the refugee emergency poses to Albania's already shaky
stability. The country was just about to get back on its feet from
the past implosion, the riots in 1997, when the Kosovo situation
happened, Daan Everts, director of the mission in Albania for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation, told reporters on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful how welcoming the Albanians have been of the
refugees, but you cannot expect that to last very long,'' he said.
``Longer-term settlement is going to be a difficult problem that
can become dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Albanians seem to be mostly basking in a
sense of pride and unity with the West that has long eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped all our investments, all our budget is being
redirected for the refugees,'' Tirana's Mayor, Albert Brojka said
cheerfully as he stepped through the muddy paths of the tent city.
``I am hoping that we will persuade the West that Albania is part
of it, that we are European, and no longer under the Eastern
dictatorial system that we had here for 50 years.''

 &HT;    Hats a perfect topper for a look brimming with style
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For some women, it's love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing in the second-floor millinery salon at Elder-Beerman
Northwest last week, Caroline Watkins spotted a cream-colored
straw-and-mesh hat trimmed in delicate silk flowers and immediately
lost her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm going to have to buy an outfit and shoes to match
it,'' says Watkins, a minister's wife from Dayton who has come in
search of an off-white hat she can wear to church for first
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman is completely dressed when she has her hat on,'' she
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Salon manager Julia Refour, who's been in the hat business for
13 years, couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Her boutique is filled with chapeaus of every style, shape and
color: delicate straw rollers in pretty pastels trimmed in dainty
florals and ribbon, boater styles with wide grosgrain ribbons and
bows, crisp white picture hats with upturned brims, colorful
reversible berets, gold and silver metallics, luxurious furs with
matching hats, and flings and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Refour's hats range from $59 for a simple straw cloche to $499
for elaborate designer styles bearing names such as Jack McConnell,
George Zamau'l and Frank Olive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my first hat at age 18,'' Refour recalls. ``We wore hats
to church ... it was a straw floral profile for Easter. I thought I
was lookin' good.''
</P>
<P>
   Local hat lovers have followed Refour from store to store: First
to Donenfeld's, then Lazarus and _ since March 1998 _ Elder-Beerman
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   She sends hats to customers all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw celebrities wearing designer hats at the Academy
Awards,'' she says. ``After people saw them on television, they
called to see if we carried them. The same thing happened after a
wedding on `The Young and the Restless.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many local women, she says, buy hats for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman bought five hats recently and said that instead of
having to go back to her hotel to change outfits, she planned to go
to her car and change hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lehman, owner of Gretchen &AMP; Co., says hats serve more
than a fashion function these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a health issue because of our awareness of sun
damage,'' she says. ``I have a lot of customers who have already
had a problem with skin cancer and come to buy hats when they are
going to Florida or on a cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman carries Amy Hamilton's charming handmade hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy's hats are very romantic, they have rosebuds and tulle in
beautiful pinks and lavenders,'' she says. Hamilton hats start at
$89.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen &AMP; Co. also carries Anabel Ingall's Australian hats
fashioned from paper straw ($110 and up), a full line of cotton
crocheted hats that start at $28, and panamas in a range of brights
and pastels.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Bush, director of the Headwear Information Bureau in New
York City, has represented the hat industry for years and wears
hats everywhere _ to the mailbox, walking her dog, to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wear a hat, you'll have men following you down the
street and it will get you a better seat at a restaurant,'' she
insists. ``The maitre d' is not about to sit you behind a pole when
you look so attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush says spring is the hat season, with Easter and Mother's Day
being major hat holidays.
</P>
<P>
   She says color is making news this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going along with what's happening in ready-to-wear _ iced
blue, mint, pinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her late 50s, Bush began wearing hats when she moved to
New York from Youngstown at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stand out from the crowd,'' she says. ``A hat does
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's women, she says, feel the same, which is why hat sales
have been increasing by 10 percent to 15 percent a year since the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Robbins of Dayton agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old woman has been wearing hats for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have a plain outfit and the hat makes the outfit or
you buy an outfit and accent it with a hat,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total look from the top of your head to the bottom of
your toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that when you wear them a lot of people
notice you.''

 &HT;    For CNN, war is almost familiar
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the day of her fifth anniversary working at CNN,
Mina Ivanovic was rockin'. Standing up at her desk (without even
low walls to qualify it as a cubicle) in the CNN newsroom, she
stood, phone receiver in her left ear, phone receiver in her right
ear, rocking her weight from foot to foot as she juggled two
producersin the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Ivanovic is part of CNN's
multinational team that coordinates all of its international
coverage, and has been working 14 hours a day, including weekends,
since NATO started bombing Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your hometown, you can't disengage completely,'' she said
during a brief period without a phone in her ear. ``But you've got
to do your job, you've got to get the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic was approached by CNN seven years ago in Belgrade to be
a translator when the Yugoslav conflicts were heating up. Fluent in
English (four years in the United States as a child, plus her
college major) and Serbo-Croatian, she was supposed to go to London
for a PR job at a bank, but didn't want to leave her family, and
wound up working for CNN for two years in Yugoslavia. She moved to
Atlanta five years ago, and now works on the international desk
with native Russians, Chinese, Iranians, Germans, Turks and
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The adrenaline level isn't nearly as high inside CNN as it was
one week into the Gulf War; for one thing, the international desk
is more seasoned now, with an average of 10 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 staffers make arrangements and call the shots for the
60-plus CNN employees in the Balkans region and surrounding
countries covering the war.
</P>
<P>
   Those correspondents, producers and crews have been in more
danger recently than most journalists were during the Gulf War.
Christiane Amanpour, who won her second Peabody Award on Wednesday
for her reporting from Yugoslavia, is posted in Albania
interviewing refugees because being inside Kosovo or Yugoslavia is
considered too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been singled out by name by certain people,'' said
Eason Jordan, president of CNN International. ``Her life would be
in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Serbs are considered hostile to most U.S.-based
media, CNN has been given special attention; Serbian TV has called
the network ``a factory of lies'' and accused it of war crimes. CNN
staffers have been repeatedly arrested and threatened, and their
equipment confiscated at roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled up to an army checkpoint in a Jeep Cherokee. Next
thing you know, we're walking,'' said Steve Cassidy, international
deputy managing editor in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   CNN estimates it has lost $400,000 to $800,000 worth of
equipment to members of the Serb army or paramilitary groups,
including bulletproof vests, cell phones, cameras and even an
entire armored car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a Wegner Digital Video Encoder,'' said Cassidy.
``What are they going to do with that, unless they're going to
start an all-news network?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult conditions,'' said Will King, also a
deputy managing editor. ``There's no international Hyatts for them
to stay in.'' Some CNN staffers are in sleeping bags, one satellite
operator lived in his truck for 36 hours, and meals can be boiled
eggs, cheese and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Also getting lots of air time, in addition to Amanpour, are
Brent Sadler, who's back in Belgrade after being thrown out, and
Chris Burns, CNN's Berlin bureau chief, whose stand-up on the
Albanian border Thursday referred to an ``ethnic Albanian Trail of
Tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficult working conditions, CNN's ratings are up
since the NATO bombing began. Ratings for the past week were about
80 percent higher than March 1998, when Monica Lewinsky was the
focus of much of CNN and other news coverage. During the actual
bombing strikes, CNN's ratings have been up about 120 percent, to
nearly 1 million U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   The technology in covering a war in the '90s can be amazing:
multiple satellite feeds, digital images, live shots of refugees in
Albania, broadcasts taken directly from Serbian TV. (Of the three
TV sets on Ivanovic's desk, one is tuned to Serbian TV constantly.
On Thursday, despite the war, it was showing highlights of a
volleyball match.)

<P>
   Or it can be rather low-tech. Scotch-taped to a wall just
outside the CNN anchor booth is a large map of the Balkans, the
kind you'd buy at a good bookstore, with the $9.99 price tag still
on it.

   As celebrations of Easter, Christianity's holiest day, draw near
for the faithful worldwide, a growing number of Roman Catholic,
Orthodox and Protestant leaders are calling for an end to the
hostilities between NATO nations and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome Thursday, Pope John Paul II urged a weeklong cease-fire
as a step toward a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis. The
pontiff's plea came at the close of a day-long visit to Belgrade by
the Vatican's top diplomat, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, who met
Patriarch Pavle, the Serbian Orthodox Church's leader who also
called for a cease-fire. The archbishop also presented the pope's
plea to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, all eight Catholic cardinals in the United States
took a highly unusual joint action, calling for an immediate end to
the conflict and a resumption of negotiations, in public letters
sent to President Clinton and Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals also urged Milosevic to end attacks on Kosovar
Albanians, tens of thousands of whom have been driven from their
homes, and asked Clinton to halt NATO's airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Cardinal Law, archbishop of Boston, said in a telephone
interview that ``it has to be a cease-fire on both sides.''
Speaking of the Yugoslav Army's attacks on Kosovo civilians, he
said: ``The atrocities that are going on in Kosovo as they are
reported are simply unacceptable by any standards and must cease.''
Were those attacks to continue, he said, negotiations between NATO
and Yugoslavia would not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another signer, Roger Cardinal Mahony, archbishop of Los
Angeles, said the cardinals believed that five developments must
occur closely together to bring peace: an end to Yugoslav violence
in Kosovo; a halt to the NATO bombing; a return of the refugees; an
international effort in Kosovo to aid civilians and monitor peace;
and a regional peace conference. ``It doesn't work without all
five,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued a statement
Wednesday calling on the Yugoslav government to halt its
``intolerable aggression'' against Kosovar Albanians and for NATO
to stop bombing as an ``appropriate response'' to such a
development.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic initiatives have come amidst similar, sometimes
emotional pleas from Orthodox Christian leaders. Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, senior figure among the
heads of self-governing Orthodox churches, issued a statement this
week appealing ``on bended knees'' and ``from the tormented depths
of my heart'' for an immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   His message was quoted in its entirety in an Easter appeal for
an end to all fighting _ in Yugoslavia and elsewhere _ by
representatives of the World Council of Churches, which comprises
nearly 340 Protestant and Orthodox denominations, and global
federations of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed
Protestant churches.
</P>
<P>
   Lending urgency to many of the appeals is the conjunction of
holy days among the world's major monotheistic faiths, occurring
over a 15-day span that began last Saturday when Muslims celebrated
the feast of Id al-Adha, which marks the culmination of Mecca
pilgrimage. On Wednesday evening, Jews began celebrating Passover.
Western Christian churches celebrate Easter on Sunday, which is
Palm Sunday in the calendar of the Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Tauran said the pope ``and many Christian leaders
like Patriarch Pavle, whom I have just met, consider that it would
be a gesture of great humanity if all military actions would be
suspended by all during the week that separates the Western and
Eastern commemorations of this feast.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar idea was recently offered by Archbishop Spyridon, head
of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of the United States, who wrote
to Clinton last week, asking that the NATO bombing be halted from
April 1 to April 12, a period preceding Good Friday in the Western
Christian calendar and extending until the day after Orthodox
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese is a member of the National
Council of Churches, whose general secretary, the Rev. Joan B.
Campbell, said on Wednesday that she was intrigued by another idea
discussed within the council's Protestant and Orthodox member
churches, a cease-fire over the Orthodox Easter weekend. ``It seems
to me we have to break the cycle of violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than public statements, she said, was that
many churches were contributing aid to Kosovar Albanian refugees.
``The place where the church always stands strong is in those
places where people are hurting,'' she said.

   ARCADIA _ The dispute over Santa Anita Derby jockey assignments
was settled Wednesday with Gary Stevens scheduled to ride General
Challenge in Saturday's $750,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, who had been promised that mount by Bob Baffert,
apparently will drop his breach-of-contract complaint against the
trainer and ride High Wire Act for John Shirreffs.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate McCarron, Baffert said he'd put the jockey on
marginal Kentucky Derby prospect Straight Man and other good horses
in the future. Without that settlement, the case would have been
decided by the Santa Anita board of stewards.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions had run high Tuesday morning when a public argument on
the subject between Baffert and McCarron agent Scotty McClellan
ended with Baffert shoving McClellan, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas-trained Charismatic was added to the list of
3-year-olds expected to be entered today for the Santa Anita Derby.
No jockey was named.
</P>
<P>
   Other riding assignments: Prime Timber, David Flores; Desert
Hero, Corey Nakatani; Honest Lady, Kent Desormeaux, and Capsized,
Alex Solis. &QL;

 &HT;    The next step in Kosovo
 &HT;    (EDs: The following editorial is from Friday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ White House and NATO officials profess to be shocked
that Serb forces have reacted to the bombing campaign by increasing
the ferocity of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Every day now, Serb
troops are driving out tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians and
committing genocidal horrors that we won't fully appreciate until
the gun smoke clears and the mass graves are uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   That expression of surprise by the White House _ whether feigned
or real _ is frightening and ultimately discouraging. It betrays a
fundamental lack of leadership and foresight on the part of
President Clinton and his staff and bodes poorly for U.S. efforts
to resolve this tragedy quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration certainly had reason to hope that an
intense bombing campaign would force the Serbians to back down and
negotiate. But hope is one thing; certainty is another. Given Serb
brutality in Bosnia and Croatia and the symbolic importance of
Kosovo to Serbians' sense of nationhood, the current response by
the Serbs had to be considered at least a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But there's the rub. As a policy-maker, once you accept the
possibility that the Serbs might greatly intensify their
ethnic-cleansing campaign, you have to plan a potential response.
And the only sure way to intervene in such a nightmare would be to
have ground troops ready to roll, a step that Clinton had ruled out
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   So, having ruled out the only solution, it's almost as if
Clinton and his staff chose to rule out the problem as well. They
took a gamble by bombing, knowing that if it failed, the price
would be paid by Albanian peasants.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials defend the president by pointing out that
he faced an extremely difficult and complex situation. Had he done
nothing, he would have been heavily criticized for standing by and
allowing the ethnic cleansing to continue. He chose to bomb instead
and is now being criticized for that move. His third option _ the
use of U.S. troops _ would have been even more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Although that's all true, sympathy for the White House goes only
so far. Bill Clinton wanted to be president _ in fact, he put the
nation through hell in his effort to keep the job. He wanted to
make tough decisions; now he has one. Mobilizing thousands of U.S.
troops for potential insertion into Kosovo would certainly have
cost him politically, and it would have required him to actually
lead. He would have had to change the minds of the American people
on something important. But that's why we have presidents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Clinton could have promised that troops
would not be used unless they were absolutely necessary, in
response to just the sort of humanitarian emergency we now face. In
fact, the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of NATO troops for
potential use in Kosovo might have greatly altered the calculations
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as he contemplated his
course of action. Instead, guaranteed that his troops would face no
ground-based opposition, he chose to fight.
</P>
<P>
   So now what? The immediate goal is to end the slaughter of
Albanian civilians, and we don't have troops as an immediate option
or even threat to force that outcome. However, Clinton should
announce as soon as possible that U.S. troops are being mobilized
for use if necessary, and he should make that case to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Until those troops are ready, we are stuck trying to cobble
together a solution with bombing and diplomacy as our only tools.
The long-term goal of that effort must be creation of a structure
that sustains itself over time, that restores some sense of
stability to an inherently unstable region.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, trying to resettle ethnic Albanians within a
Serb-controlled Kosovo would certainly fail that test. Humpty
Dumpty cannot be put back together with air power alone. The only
solution attainable without troops that also meets the test of
sustainability would be a partition of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The sites most dear to Serbian hearts _ the ancient monasteries
and battlefields _ lie in northern Kosovo, the area closest to
Serbia itself. Ceding that half of the region to Serbia, while
reserving the southern section to ethnic Albanians, either as a
U.N. protectorate or a part of Albania proper, might be the best
approach.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic accepts such a compromise, U.S. and NATO troops
would still be required to keep the peace, at least initially. If
he does not _ if he is intent on continuing this mad campaign of
genocide against the helpless Albanians _ the option that Clinton
unwisely ruled impossible could instead become absolutely
necessary.

NOW NIXON THE COMEDY 
LIFE IN FAST FORWARD 
THINKING SMALL

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Few episodes of American postwar history have been
treated with more solemnity than Watergate, particularly in
Hollywood. Americans have pondered, shuddered, railed at and
perhaps even wept over the break-in that brought down a presidency
and influenced a generation.
</P>
<P>
   So now, in the era of Monicagate, maybe it is time to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyway, is the intention behind ``Dick,'' a comedy that
might be dubbed Watergate Lite. Imagine a movie with Oliver Stone's
paranoid vision and the sensibility of ``Clueless,'' and you have
``Dick,'' which is scheduled for release on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the antics of two teen-agers, Betsy Jobs
(Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams), who visit
the White House of Richard (Dick) Nixon (played by Dan Hedaya, who
was in ``Clueless''). The two wander into a room filled with
presidential secrets, which prompts a frightened Nixon to hire them
as dog walkers so he can keep an eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   The two fumble their way through the Watergate mess as unwitting
but crucial players while the audience learns what really happened
to those 18 minutes of erased tape, the identity of Deep Throat and
what supposedly made Nixon so paranoid. The baby-boom generation
was torn by those questions; Generation X is now going to have a
good chuckle over them.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was produced by Gale Ann Hurd , who has produced 22
movies and is well known not for frothy comedies but for
high-adrenaline pictures like ``Armageddon,'' ``The Terminator,''
``Aliens'' and ``The Abyss.'' Ms. Hurd, 43, said she was proud of
her ability to raft white-water rivers and take on the toughest
mountains on her bike.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that ``Dick'' was something of a switch and
said it grew less out of her political interests (``When I got to
college I decided I was going to be a Marxist,'' she said. ``My
first B was in Marxist economics, so I decided to become a
righteous capitalist.'') than a sense that it might just be time to
laugh at Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really dark and twisted happens in this film,'' Ms.
Hurd said. ``I think, given where we are, it's the best possible
time to laugh at this. It's cathartic.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``After doing a lot of special-effects-driven movies,
it's really nice to think about character for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurd said that ``Dick'' was aimed partly at a teen-age
audience, given that the engines of Nixon's misfortune are two
teen-agers, although teen-agers looked at Watergate almost as
ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't necessarily get the more obscure Watergate
references, like Gordon Liddy, but they loved the movie in our test
screenings,'' she said. ``It was nice to do this without that
cynical 90s patina.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Fast Forward
</P>
<P>
   Making movies that connect with teen-agers has always required a
somewhat irreverent approach. Such films often drip with sarcasm,
and their characters tend to joust with authority.
</P>
<P>
   But for the current generation, the introduction of new
entertainment technologies like computer games has in some
instances even changed how stories are told.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Go,'' for example, a new comedy by Doug Liman scheduled to
be released on April 9, the plot repeatedly stops and rewinds, each
time with a new character in the lead, suggesting the branching
structure of an adventure computer game.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any computer mice by the theater seats. But icons
will be on-screen in the form of the stop-motion faces of the
actors, on which the director clicks before unspooling their
delirious and often amusing tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structural part of it fits the mind of young people
today,'' said Liman (above), 32, whose first movie, ``Swingers,''
introduced audiences to a retro-hip milieu. ``This audience doesn't
like receiving information in the traditional ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the nocturnal antics of a group of
20-somethings as they party, botch drug deals, duel with the police
and, in one memorable sequence, go wild in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It takes place in the span of a night and a day, and ends with
the frayed threads coming together in a spirit of manic energy and
a near-total lack of restraint. The ensemble cast includes Sarah
Polley, Katie Holmes, Desmond Askew, Timothy Olyphant, Jay Mohr and
Scott Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters do unlikable things, but you love them for
it,'' Liman said.
</P>
<P>
   The director said he had resisted the unusual narrative
structure when he started to read the script, which was written by
John August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like gimmicky things,'' Liman said. ``I was like, `Oh,
I was really liking this script until he started jumping around
with the narrative. Oh, well.' But I read more, and he got me over
the bump. By the third story line, he had earned my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't read a magazine from front to back. I read
three books at once and might be watching TV and changing the
channels. That's the way we experience things.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the characters' misadventures is that in the end, they
survive despite their self-destructive tendencies. Liman, who
recently earned his pilot's license, compared that to a new
four-seat airplane he had just bought, part of a new aircraft
generation that has a parachute built into the fuselage as an extra
safety feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 18 it's like you've got that parachute,'' Liman
said. ``You've got that `get out of jail free' card. That's what
the characters in the movie have. The name `Go' refers to that.
They react rather than think.''
</P>

<P>
   Thinking Small
</P>
<P>
   This year's Oscar derby was more contentious than usual, full of
more blatant publicity gimmicks but less interesting to the public,
with the show's Nielsen ratings down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a lesson, it was that smaller production houses,
the so-called independents, are getting better at developing the
more engaging and successful movies, at least in terms of peer
recognition if not the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Though Miramax stole the show by winning the prizes for best
movie, best foreign-language film and much more, the ``other''
independent, Lions Gate, also did well. This relatively small
operation drew five nominations and prizes for two films that it
distributed last year, ``Affliction'' and ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Lions Gate is aiming for more of the same. While the
major studios are cranking out their big-budget special-effects
thrill rides for the summer, most notably the latest ``Star Wars''
movie, Lions Gate and other independents are counter-programming,
looking for fare that is more intimate, unusual and, though few
want to admit it, appealing to the people who vote on the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never hear the word Oscar again, it will be too soon,''
said Mark Urman , the co-president of Lions Gate Releasing, the
distribution arm of the company. ``Everything we've ever released
is a sort of antidote to Hollywood. That's what we try to think
about. We're doing that again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate is releasing ``Metroland,'' a bittersweet romantic
adventure in which two old friends from London (played by Lee Ross
and Christian Bale) escape their homes during the 1960s, only to
return years later and confront their middle-class origins and
dashed hopes. Emily Watson of ``Hilary and Jackie'' plays a
prominent part.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a sex farce, ``Friends and Lovers,'' and what
Urman described as a classic French romantic farce, ``The Dinner
Game,'' a throwback to the freewheeling French comedies of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest hope for the year is ``The Red Violin,'' a
costume drama with a relatively big budget, if $15 million can be
considered big when Hollywood studios spend on average nearly $50
million a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has an international ensemble cast, including Samuel
L. Jackson, Carlo Cecchi, Greta Scacchi and Sylvia Chang. It is
directed by Francois Girard and has a score by John Corigliano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' follows a famous violin over 300 years and
the events that unfold around it. From Lions Gate's perspective, it
presents a counterpoint to the big studio movies, which tend to be
heavy on action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Urman said, ``the more different you are, the
better off you are.''

MISSOURI TO HOLD REFERENDUM ON LETTING PEOPLE CARRY CONCEALED
WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In what both sides of the gun debate are calling a
momentous showdown, Missouri will be the first state to let voters
decide in a statewide referendum next week whether to allow people
to carry concealed weapons in public.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure have outspent opponents by a ratio of
three-to-one, with the National Rifle Association spending almost
all of the money on the efforts to pass the measure, $2.1 million,
with a blizzard of television ads, including one featuring a victim
of the notorious ``South Side Rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle has drawn high-profile advocates, including Charlton
Heston, the actor and president of the National Rifle Association,
and James Brady, the former press secretary who was wounded in the
assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan. And it has
pitted law enforcement officials against each other, with some U.S.
attorneys opposing the measure and some local police departments
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 states allow some people to carry concealed
weapons, but in many, permits are rarely issued, and only if
applicants demonstrate a need, such as carrying large amounts of
cash in their work.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri measure, which becomes law if passed by a majority
of the voters, falls somewhere in the middle. It would grant
permits to anyone over 21 who has not been convicted of felony and
who takes 12 hours of gun training. But it gives the sheriff in
each county the right to deny any application.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, rural voters are expected to back the measure
strongly, while urban residents, especially blacks, are more
skeptical about it.
</P>
<P>
   In an edgy St. Louis neighborhood pierced by sirens and
pockmarked with boarded storefronts, Korey Davis, a 22-year-old
resident of the North Side neighborhood grimaced at the ballot
measure. To Ms. Davis, who is black and once was held up by ``an
itsy-bitsy boy with a great big gun,'' putting more guns on the
street would turn some urban neighborhoods ``back to the Wild Wild
West.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the state in rural Hickory County, Sherry Jones, a
43-year-old coffee shop waitress, welcomes the measure, which she
believes would simply let law-abiding people protect themselves.
Allowing law-abiding people to arm themselves in public would
simply level the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad guys already have guns, concealed or not,'' she said.
``Why should it be a crime for the rest of us to defend
ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   With the vote scheduled at a time when little else is on the
ballot in Missouri, the outcome will hinge largely on turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Legislature has passed measures allowing concealed
weapons, but the bills have been vetoed by Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the issue to the people for a vote gives the Missouri
campaign an extra weight in the national debate over guns, both
sides agree.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Baker, the chief lobbyist for the NRA, said a victory
at the ballot box would show broad popular support for gun rights,
and could not be dismissed as ``somehow buying off a state
legislature,'' by a powerful lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Handgun Control Inc., the group headed by Brady's
wife, Sarah, said meanwhile that the NRA is desperate to show
strength after a series of losses.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the the election of Charles Schumer, a Democrat
and an advocate of strict gun control, to the U.S. Senate from New
York, and the filing of lawsuits by New Orleans and several other
cities against gun makers. They also note that the NRA lost a
battle over requiring participants in gun shows in Florida to
undergo background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is putting a lot of eggs in this basket,'' said Joe
Sudbay, a spokesman for Handgun Control Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the concealed weapons measure have attacked the
bill as poorly written and full of loopholes. They note that the
bill would allow people to carry weapons into places where liquor
is sold, and to sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Largely for that reason, Missouri's major professional sports
teams _ the St. Louis Cardinals and Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs
and Royals _ have issued statements against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Brett Feinstein, a spokesman for Missourians Against Crime,
a citizens group that is organizing the campaign for the concealed
weapons measure, framed the debate as ``a fundamental right to
self-protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have called in researchers to buttress their claims.
For the concealed weapons proponents, a University of Chicago
professor, John Lott, said that states that issue concealed weapons
permits have seen a bigger drop in crime in recent years than
states that do not. Lott, the author of ``More Guns, Less Crime''
(University of Chicago Press, 1998) said criminals prey on people
they think are defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Giving people the right to carry arms, he says, changes the
thinking among some criminals. ``Some criminals are going to think
twice,'' Lott said, if they have to wonder whether a potential
victim is carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Glick, a researcher for the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, a research group that focuses on gun laws found that
many people issued such permits in Texas, a state with
comparatively loose gun laws, in recent years have run afoul of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 people in Texas who were issued permits to carry
concealed weapons since 1996 have been charged with murder or
attempted murder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 31 states provide concealed weapons permits to persons who
meet certain objective standards, like age and background checks.
Another dozen states allow public officials to issue permits to
people who show a need for them, such as workers who carry large
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the states that allow people to carry concealed
weapons require no gun training. The Missouri measure would forbid
guns to be taken to government buildings, schools, polling places
and churches. It does not forbid guns in taverns but gives bar
owners the right to prohibit them. Carrying a firearm while
intoxicated would remain a felony in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri bill would allow the issuance of permits to people
over 21 who have no felonies in their background and have taken a
minimum of 12 hours of gun safety courses from the state's
Department of Safety. Applicants would also have to submit
fingerprints for background checks by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only law-abiding people are going to be willing to do this,''
said Feinstein. ``Who else would submit themselves to this?''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure say that the bill would not screen
out potentially violent people, since many offenses are pleaded
down to lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for Safer Schools and Workplaces,
a citizens group that opposes the proposition, said putting more
guns on the streets ``increases the likelihood of temper tantrums
to become gun fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted by Missouri newspapers have shown the measure
leading by a wide margin among likely voters, but many are
undecided. But opponents of the bill say they can win with a strong
turnout in urban areas, especially among black voters.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting on the votes of people like Troy Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 37-year-old mortgage banker who considers himself a
political conservative on most issues, says he will vote against
the concealed weapons proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a black man who is 6 foot 7, weighs 270 pounds and wears a
beard,'' Harris said. ``In a dark alley, I'm a suburban white
woman's worst nightmare _ at least I look that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris recounted an episode last year in which he chased a
mugger, finally lunging at the man and tackling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what if somebody with a gun had just turned the corner
and seen this big black guy chasing somebody down the street?'' he
said. ``I worry that they would have pulled the trigger.''

CAPTURED TEXAN DESCRIBED IN HOME TOWN AS BRIGHT AND RESOURCEFUL

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The mother of a young Texan who dropped out
of college to join the Army said Thursday that he and two other
U.S. soldiers were just doing their duty when they were captured
along the Yugoslavia and Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   ``These soldiers _ Steven and the other two _ are not
criminals,'' Rosie Gonzales told a cluster of reporters huddled
into a pavilion near the Walls prison unit. ``They should not be
dealt with as criminals. They are innocent young men over there
doing their duty for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Spec. Steven Gonzales in Huntsville and Palestine,
where he graduated from high school, hung yellow ribbons on doors,
fences and trees on Thursday to show their support for Gonzales;
Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's state news agency reported that the three
servicemen will go on military trial today, a move President
Clinton condemned as a violation of international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' parents said their son will draw strength from his
Christian faith and his professionalism as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very strong, very devoted to the Bible and to God,''
said his father, Gilbert Gonzales, a classification officer for the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the situation over there. We are
concerned about our son. It means a lot to us that he be returned
to us safely.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzales and his wife, Rosie, who also works for TDCJ,
described their son as a bright, strong-willed 21-year-old who
joined the Army over their objections for the adventure and
experience it promised. They shuddered at the thought that Steven,
who gave up an academic scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, might be put on
trial in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzales couple, who have two other sons, Joshua, 8, and
Andrew, 13, were notified shortly before 8 p.m. Wednesday that
Steven was one of three U.S. peacekeepers in Macedonia being held
captive. They asked Americans to join them in Easter prayers for
the safe return of all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, obviously,'' Rosie Gonzales said. ``But we know
that he is strong, stronger than us in a lot of ways. And that will
help him get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   From news photographs of the captured soldiers, Gilbert Gonzales
said it appeared that his son had been ``roughed up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hibbard, Rosie Gonzales' supervisor in TDCJ's substance
abuse treatment division, described the couple as a ``bright ray of
sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are holding up much better than anyone could expect,''
Hibbard said. ``We are all ready to give them any support that they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' former teachers at Palestine High School, 90 miles
north of Huntsville, recalled him as a bright and dedicated student
who ranked 10th among 217 seniors in the 1995 graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more mature than the rest of the class,'' said Tammy
Armstrong, Gonzales' freshman English teacher. ``With Steven, you
trusted him to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Starkey, who was Gonzales' senior advanced placement
English teacher, said, ``He was very clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope he would pull on that and some of his academic
skills now,'' Starkey said. ``I don't remember him being physically
powerful, but there are a lot of physically powerful guys I
wouldn't want to be in a fox hole with. Steven was wily enough to
use his brains and I hope he's doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Physics teacher Andy Jones recalled that Gonzales was diligent
about his high school work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those kids where you look at your rolls, and if
he wasn't in your class, you go out and recruit him,'' Jones said.
``He was never a problem; not too quiet, not too loud _ a very
well-rounded kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also the kind of kid the military needs,'' Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of Gonzales' classmates have left Palestine since
graduation, the current students and faculty observed a moment of
silence Thursday for the captive soldiers, and yellow ribbons
adorned the school's front doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hits you. It's home town _ somebody you really liked. And
now they are in dire straits,'' said chemistry teacher Kathleen
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales attended Texas A&AMP;M for a year, then quit to join the
Army.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said Thursday that he plans to return to A&AMP;M after
his military enlistment ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been so proud of Steven,'' said Rosie Gonzales,
who appeared to sob at times but spoke in a clear and steady voice.
``He always excelled at everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Gonzales said that his son was upbeat when they last
spoke about a month ago, just before the soldier's unit left for
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The parents avoided questions concerning the military operation
in Kosovo and its political implications, saying only that ``people
need to get back to the basics of loving each another.''

REFUGEE FLOW OUT OF KOSOVO CONTINUES UNABATED

   MORINA PASS, on the Albania-Yugoslavia border _ By day, armed
thugs and Serb police menaced the city of Pristina. By night, NATO
bombed the area around them. And by Thursday, the bedraggled
residents of the capital of Kosovo had been driven out completely,
forced by machine gun-toting soldiers to make the tortuous trek to
neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying their crying babies, ethnic Albanian refugees from the
city walked in a 6-mile-long line over the mountainous border to
Albania Thursday, robbed of their belongings, and fearful that the
homes they left behind may already have been burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As of midday, the refugee count in Albania neared 120,000, with
the flow unabated Thursday night. The forced marches add up to the
biggest ``ethnic cleansing'' episode in a decade of brutal Balkan
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pristina is in a catastrophic condition,'' said Dukagjin
Humolli, clutching the tiny hand of his 5-year-old daughter. ``We
are so exhausted. My children have not eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb police and army have been methodically clearing the ethnic
Albanian population out of Kosovo, a pattern seen repeatedly since
the 1992-95 Bosnia war when Serbs coined the term ``ethnic
cleansing.'' But the fall of Pristina marks a critical point in the
fight over the disputed province.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the border Thursday was one of misery,
bewilderment, and shock. Women shivered in the cold mountain air as
they tried to breast-feed their infants. One family huddled over a
small fire. When an aid truck arrived to hand out bottles of water,
children and adults alike crushed up against the vehicle, desperate
to get a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, Europe's poorest nation, has been overwhelmed by the
number of refugees and the speed of their arrival. The government
has been sending buses and trucks to the border to take Kosovar
Albanians over poorly-paved, barely navigable roads to refugee
centers or to the private homes of Albanian families.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of needy is unmanageable, aid workers say, and
the fact that the Pristina refugees arrived mainly on foot makes
the task even more difficult. The few trucks operated by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and private organizations
were lost in the massive crowd of hungry, homeless people. The
trucks were crammed, and on the ground mothers thrust their
screaming children upward, hoping to get them on the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Some families appeared ready to bunk down in the mountain grass
for the night, waiting for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult to handle. It's too much and it's not
very well organized,'' said Mathias Schreiber, a German missionary
and aid worker. ``We need blankets, we need mattresses, we need
diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   A year of fighting in Kosovo had barely touched the capital
until last month. But in the past few days, a number of refugees
said in interviews, Pristina has been a city under siege. On
Wednesday, the siege was broken by masked soldiers who robbed the
Kosovars, threatened to kill them, and bused them out of the city.
Because international observers have withdrawn and most journalists
expelled from the province, it is difficult to get independent
verification of the refugees' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several families said they were sitting in their apartments when
men in black masks and carrying machine guns kicked open or knocked
on their doors. The men told them to leave immediately. A few were
allowed to take their own cars, but only if they paid large sums of
money to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Everybody out! Kosovo is not yours!' '' said Idriz
Abdullah, a 45-year-old economist.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were forced onto the street and made to kneel with
their hands up, said Nuje Ahmeti, 38. When Ahmeti asked why he had
to leave, Serb soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butt of a
gun, Ahmeti said, showing a wound on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands people were herded together near the soccer
stadium in downtown Pristina, refugees said. Soldiers demanded
money, ripped gold necklaces from the throats of women, and hustled
people onto buses.
</P>
<P>
   Three women gave birth during the ordeal, Ahmeti said. ``I saw
it myself. Some people gave them first aid, but the Serbs didn't do
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pristina was burning when the refugees left, they said.
Most of the fires were coming from the area of Dragodan, one of the
wealthier neighborhoods and the area where international
organizations had been located.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of ``Arkan's Tigers'' _ the feared paramilitary
group accused of committing some of the worst atrocities of the
Croatian and Bosnian wars _ increased the fear, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror and ethnic cleansing is taking place in Pristina now,''
said Ahmeti. ``Pristina is almost empty of Albanians now.''

   Saturday is the late columnist  &UR; Herb Caen &LR; 's birthday, an
occasion Personals will mark with a namephreak submitted months ago
by  &UR; Robin Sutherland &LR;  and saved for the occasion:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Canaan Banana &LR; , who was president of Zimbabwe in the '80s, has
been sentenced to 10 years in prison, nine of them suspended, after
dozens of men _ students, aides, soccer players and soldiers _

</P>
<P>
   She's right. The photo of Herb etched on a plaque _ dated June

Arkansas, with no connection of any kind to New York, Hillary has
set her sights on the New York Senate seat and maybe ... probably
... set her sights even higher.''
</P>

BLAIR TALKS OF PROGRESS AS ULSTER TALKS PAUSE, SHORT OF GOAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, Northern Ireland _ Talks to resolve the last
issues blocking the formal start-up of the Northern Ireland peace
plan adjourned inconclusively Thursday, but Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain said he thought they had established a
``satisfactory basis'' for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In statements outside Hillsborough Castle, the official
residence of Britain's secretary for Northern Ireland, Blair and
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland tried to put a hopeful cast
on what was a disappointing end to round-the-clock talks to meet a
deadline of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that the parties would gather again in 12 days after
what he called ``a short pause for reflection to make sure we
finalize things properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern said that while the talks had missed their
deadline, they had produced a framework for clearing the main
obstacle. That is the dispute over whether the Irish Republican
Army must start disarming as a condition for the members of its
political wing, Sinn Fein, to take their seats in a new Northern
Ireland Assembly cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown over arms decommissioning had provoked gloomy
predictions this week that the whole painstaking peace process,
which has passed through many moments of menacing crises, might not
survive this one.
</P>
<P>
   A new declaration by the British and Irish governments that
emerged from Thursday's session sought to balance the Ulster
Unionist Party's demand for IRA disarmament with Sinn Fein's
insistence that there can be no such precondition. It said simply
that ``while there is no precondition to decommission, there is an
obligation to decommission.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on Good Friday a year ago that the parties agreed to the
peace settlement aimed at ending violence between Catholics and
Protestants that has cost more than 3,200 lives in the last three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   That carefully calibrated accord set up a number of new
government panels aimed at giving equal weight to the largely
Protestant desire to keep Northern Ireland British with the
widespread Catholic wish to see it move closer to the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Central to that agreement was the creation of a new Northern
Ireland Assembly that would exercise home-rule powers now in the
hands of the British Parliament in London. That shift of authority,
scheduled to occur Thursday, would have led to the establishment of
a 10-member executive, in which two seats would belong to Sinn Fein
because of the count in an election last June.
</P>
<P>
   Under the formula laid out in Thursday's British-Irish
declaration, guerrilla groups will have a month after the
nomination of new cabinet members to start handing in guns ``on a
voluntary basis.''
</P>
<P>
   This is to be done in a ceremony described in the declaration as
a ``collective act of reconciliation.'' The moment would include
memorial gestures honoring people from both of Northern Ireland's
communities who have lost their lives in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   An existing international panel, headed by the retired Canadian
General John de Chastelain, would verify compliance, and the
nominations would be approved only after paramilitary groups were
certified as complying. This would appear to allow a party like
Sinn Fein to have its two members named to a shadow cabinet but
barred from the real cabinet in the absence of any IRA arms
turnovers that met with the panel's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is hoping that when they reconvene on April 13, the
parties will agree to the declaration and use it as a way of
clearing the disarmament hurdle. He said he knew that some people
would object, but he said they should be disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard them rattling the gates,'' he said, referring to
militant Protestant demonstrators who have been loudly protesting
the talks through the night at the entrance to Hillsborough Castle.
``Those are the people who have never had anything useful to say
about the future of Northern Ireland. They are the people of
Northern Ireland's past.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern about decommissioning has long been a defining issue
in the effort to negotiate a peace in Northern Ireland. One of the
earliest challenges of George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who
was chairman of the talks that produced last year's settlement, was
to get around an initial demand from John Major, then the British
prime minister, that there be disarmament before any talks.
</P>
<P>
   The talks went forward only when Mitchell put into place the
strategy of ``parallel decommissioning,'' making disarmament a
matter for negotiations, not a precondition for them.
</P>
<P>
   While the tactic succeeded in removing the highly volatile issue
as an obstacle to an agreement, it didn't succeed in keeping it
from returning, as it has now, as the central focus.

FENWAY TICKET AMONG THE COSTLIEST, MAGAZINE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Baseball lovers say Fenway Park is one of the best
places to watch a Major League game. But love can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox tickets are the most expensive of the 30 franchises in
Major League Baseball this year, and watching a game at Fenway is
second only to Yankee Stadium in expenses for a family of four,
according to a study released Thursday by a nationally recognized
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The average Sox ticket costs $24.05, 72 cents more expensive
than the average Yankees ticket, according to the Chicago-bsed Team
Marketing Report. That is a 16.6 percent increase over last year
for the Red Sox, compared to an average increase of 9.7 percent
among all of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   A family of four purchasing tickets, parking, four small soft
drinks, two small beers, four hot dogs, two game programs, and two
adult-sized caps will spend $160.21 at Fenway Park _ $6.63 less
than at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, a lot of it is really the park itself,'' said Sean
Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report. ``Winning baseball today
is an expensive proposition, and for the Sox to compete _ as they
usually do _ with such a small park, gets pretty expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenue streams produced by these stadiums are used mostly
to pay for the most expensive aspect of playing major league
baseball _ the players' salaries,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey reveals two other important factors in the current
economics of baseball: A new ballpark does not necessarily make
attending games comparatively cheaper, and watching a winning team
is usually a more expensive proposition than watching a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 10 most expensive stadiums for a family of four, five
are recently new: Atlanta, Baltimore, Cleveland, Colorado, and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And six of the winningest teams in baseball over the past five
years play in stadiums that are among the 10 most expensive:
Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, the Yankees, and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits right into the Red Sox argument for a new ballpark,''
said Larry Moulter, president of Woolf Associates. ``If you want a
winner, you've got to be able to pay for the good players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also shows that the fans never win out,'' Moulter said.
``As you build the new facilities, you have new opportunities for
revenue streams. But you're setting prices to increase your
prospective performance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox management had some complaints about the survey,
saying that it does not take into account that they do not charge a
handling fee for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While Brenner generally agreed with that, he said that because
there is no way of knowing what percentage of tickets at any
stadium is sold with a handling charge, the survey is conducted on
the basis of ticket prices at the box offices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, adding $2.75 cents to all of the other prices would
still hold the Red Sox as the second most expensive ticket in the
game, right behind the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we present a very attractive product,'' said Larry
Cancro, the Red Sox' vice president of sales and marketing. ``Since
1976 and the advent of free agency _ and that's the single greatest
factor, far-and-away, in terms of driving up these prices _ we have
the second best record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, if you take those numbers in the study and look at
them in the proper way, what you see is a very good argument for a
new stadium,'' Cancro said. ``If you take the highest-priced
tickets and realize that a team like the Yankees has many more
tickets to sell at that price level, and if you consider that the
other teams have many more seats of all kinds to sell, what you
realize is that this stadium has given us all that it can. And if
we're going to continue to present a good product, and we will, we
need a new way to draw new revenues.''

IMAGES OF CAPTURED SOLDIERS COULD CHANGE SUPPORT FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, the warfare in Serbia has produced a confusing
collage of television images -- refugees streaming across borders,
allied planes lifting off for bombing runs, assorted demolished
buildings and talking heads pontificating from the safety of the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   The media phase of the conflict came into much sharper focus
Thursday, however, when the battered faces of three captured US
soldiers _ Andrew Ramirez, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M.
Gonzales _ became the dominant television image, dramatically
driving home the concept of real risks to real Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives (the war) a face, doesn't it?'' said Brookings
Institution senior fellow Stephen Hess. ``The media needed it; . .
. you need it to frame a story.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sight of the captured servicemen could increase public
interest in Kosovo, it also conjures up memories of Michael Durant,
the US Army helicopter pilot who was captured and dragged through
the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. Television images of the
injured American captive were widely credited with souring public
opinion on the Somalia mission and US forces pulled out within
months. (Time magazine published a cover story headlined: ``What in
the World Are We Doing?'' next to a picture of a wounded Durant.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is whether pictures of three US prisoners in
Serbia could start prompting the nation to question the wisdom of a
war about which it is already ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of the calculus of how much sacrifice is too much
for something that is important but not vital,'' to US interests,
said Pew Research Center director Andrew Kohut, whose polling
reveals tepid support for the US role in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the story of the captured airmen _ who may stand trial
in Yugoslavia as early as Friday _ quickly moved into the media
spotlight. Their photographs led all three major network newscasts
Thursday evening. CNN's ``Crossfire'' program tackled the topic
with former Vietnam prisoner of war Senator John McCain, from
Arizona. The parents of Steven Gonzales discussed his capture at a
press conference while news reports showed yellow ribbons being
strung around trees in honor of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   With US soldiers suddenly in enemy hands, Thursday's coverage
featured other telling reminders of American foreign policy
debacles. A Fox News Channel report noted that some citizens were
``starting to talk about Vietnam,'' while a participant in CNN's
``Talkback'' program characterized the servicemen as ``hostages,''
a grim throwback to the Iranian takeover of the US embassy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the American media have been treating NATO's war in
the Balkans as a major story. According to network news analyst
Andrew Tyndall, 64 percent of the ABC, NBC and CBS nightly
newscasts last week were devoted to Yugoslavia. That is ``more than
the peak week of Monica,'' he said. ``This is the peak foreign
policy story of the Clinton presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet public opinion does not seem to have crystallized in favor
of or against US involvement in the ethnic strife. By a narrow
margin _ 47 percent to 42 percent _ the respondents to an
ABC/Washington Post poll believed vital US interests are at stake.
A plurality of those polled by the Pew Research Center disapproved
of sending US troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers. When asked if the
United States has a responsibility to do something about ethnic
fighting in Kosovo, the Pew respondents were split right down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important,'' said Kohut, ``is we don't have a
majority...saying what happens in Kosovo is vital to the US.''
People are responding to the war on a humanitarian basis, he added,
but have yet to be convinced it is in the best interests of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Tyndall believes that television coverage of the war to date has
not benefited American policymakers, since ``we see the refugees''
pouring out of Kosovo and it appears that ``the bombing created the
refugee crisis.'' The prisoners make the situation even more dicey,
he added, since ``Clinton's been really leery of anybody in uniform
getting killed ever since Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Kolodzy, a former CNN producer who teaches a course in
international media at Emerson College in Boston, offered the
dissenting view that images of the captives could spark a more
hawkish public response. ``I think it's really going get people
angry,'' she said. ``People feel (the conflict in) Iraq was dragged
out, and I think it could backfire on the Serbs.'' She did
acknowledge, however, that the Serbs may have been emboldened by
what happened in Somalia to use the prisoners for public relations
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut does point out that the lessons of Somalia have been
misinterpreted. ``It was misinterpreted as Americans aren't willing
to accept casualties,'' he explained. ``What's clear is that
Americans won't accept casualties when they don't think our vital
interests are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kohut's own data, the Clinton administration has
yet to convince Americans that our national interest is on the line
in Yugoslavia. Unless he does, painful images of three bruised
American captives could prove to be the loudest shot fired in the
Balkan war.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa
Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110
minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all
funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an
offer you can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in
Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: ``When
I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.''
There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BABY GENIUSES,' starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd and
many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to
get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to
wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen.
Probably not, but it's pretty darn close.
</P>
<P>
   Woefully substandard production values give it a ghastly look,
made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing of young
children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is shrill,
bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through the film
with a performance that just says, ``Hey, it's a living'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder
of Salles' film is all in the telling. As these characters develop
a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them
vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father,
Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that
punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance
was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CORRUPTOR,' starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg.
Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but
above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, ``The
Corruptor'' finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Wahlberg) learning
the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Chow), who has
gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the
questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and
betrayal, although familiar, are still worth bringing up. ``The
Corruptor'' is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma
of Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than ``The Replacement
Killers,'' his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN,' starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat
Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Jackson. Directed by Ulu
Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes). Ms. Pfeiffer gives a fine, affecting
performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn Mitchard's best seller.
</P>
<P>
   And Grosbard carefully delineates its story of a child's
disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that such a
catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and unsentimental, this
astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm between real and
idealized family lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EDTV,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody
Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by
Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively
easygoing satire, Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world
ruled by voyeurism and specious fame.
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter is familiar by now, but this film about a
Trumanesque nobody as 24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd
way of drawing the audience into its web. Permeated by all the
crassness and absurdity inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by
our collective obsession with snoopy trivia, it features a fine
ensemble cast and a dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also
includes Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act
their roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate
Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston.
Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume
drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms.
Blanchett plays the queen as if her principal responsibilities were
being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a
wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama
for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one
dance scene reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up
imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman
afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FORCES OF NATURE,' starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck.
Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's
loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her
anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park
ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other
equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has
nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man thrown together
with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it shows off Ms.
Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage. Affleck fares less
well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the material's many gaps
are filled by special-effects hail and windstorms, which are as
close as the title comes to making any sense (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' (winner of the best foreign film and best
dramatic score Oscars), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(named best actor) (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funny
man dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the
Holocaust, and his risk pays off.
</P>
<P>
   This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its
central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way
through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also
to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber
second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,' starring Jason Flemyng,
Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran.
Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ``The Usual
Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers
in a single film.
</P>
<P>
   And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks
the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials _ actually
an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface
here; what's most entertaining is Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled
storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has
assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and
four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot
straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' Oscar winner for best cinematography,
best editing, best sound and best sound-effects editing. Starring
Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns
and Adam Goldberg. Directed by Steven Spielberg (winner of the
best-director Oscar) (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the
genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war
as if it has not been looked at before.
</P>
<P>
   Tour de force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism,
and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an
extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly
vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable
modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he
did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film
of devastating power (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and
turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TANGO,' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by
Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100
minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the
dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying
dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the
dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Storaro's
dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this
material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango
fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRUE CRIME,' starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James
Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint Eastwood (R, 127
minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since ``A Perfect
World,'' Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption on
its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning almost casually, and taking on growing urgency as it
moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful ending, it tells of a
jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own surprise as much as anyone
else's, finds himself fighting at the 11th hour to save a possibly
innocent man from execution. Eastwood is older than the man he
plays, but not too old to be plausible as the father of an adorable
little girl in the cast; she happens to be his real daughter
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A WALK ON THE MOON,' starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev
Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Pacquin. Directed by Tony
Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on
the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive
as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife
and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) in a torrid
extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a
tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it
tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin).

BOSTON LOSES OUT IN BID FOR WOMEN'S FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Boston's bid to host the 2004 NCAA Women's Final Four
in basketball has been rejected by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, in part for geographical reasons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Final Four will be played in Philadelphia next year
and the NCAA tries to move its championships through different
regions around the country, eliminating Boston, officials
responsible for the bid said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nothing personal,'' said Jack Grinold, the sports
information director at Northeastern University, one of four local
institutions and groups involved in the unsuccessful bid. ``I know
you, and I, and most people do not consider Philadelphia to be the
Northeast, but the NCAA does. And it's their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA announced Thursday that Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,
Charlotte and Memphis are the finalists for both the 2003 and 2004
Women's Final Four. The women's tournament is an increasingly
popular event in college athletics, both in terms of attendance and
television ratings, with players like Chamique Holdsclaw of
Tennessee garnering a share of the national sports spotlight along
with the men's players, every March.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's site-selection committee will visit the final cities
during April and May, and invite a narrowed list of them to make
another presentation, before the bids are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials said that an additional factor weighing against
Boston in their consideration was the high price of hotel rooms,
and the fact that the bids from other cities contained more
financial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``High prices is one thing, but $350 a night is something
else,'' said Tricia Burke, vice-president of championships for the
NCAA. ``We probably could have negotiated that, all other things
being equal, but we also were looking for some better financial
background on the actual host committee in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a matter of being more familiar with the
NCAA process,'' Burke said. ``Some of the other cities were able to
provide that information, and I think it helped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern, Harvard University, the Fleet Center and the
Boston Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau organized Boston's bid.
Officials had expressed confidence that the city would receive it,
especially given what was considered a strong effort in hosting two
early rounds of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other sports bid recently that was not successful was
for the US Figure Skating Championships in 1998,'' said Pat
Moscaritolo, president of the convention bureau. ``So, 8-for-10,
those are Hall of Fame numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned right around and resubmitted that bid, and we got
the US Figure Skating Championships in 2001,'' Moscaritolo said.
``I think you are going to see us turn right around and do
something similar, here. We're interested to see if those same open
dates, now, at the Fleet Center line up for the Frozen Four _ the

 &HT;    Dying tradition? Charlotte may end funeral escorts
 &HT;    By Lyn Riddle
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As hundreds of cars lined up for the short
drive to bury Kenneth Swayney, his widow, Theresa, looked back from
the family car and smiled ruefully. So many cared, she thought,
feeling comforted.
</P>
<P>
   That memory compelled the usually reserved Swayney into a City
Council committee meeting here last week to fight for a dying
Southern tradition: police escorts that enable mourners to form a
procession from a funeral home or church to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police want to stop the generations-old
courtesy of providing funeral escorts, saying the liability in the
event of an accident is too great. City after city has done the
same _ Atlanta, Jacksonville and Orlando, Fla., and Columbia, S.C.,
among them.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, off-duty officers provide the service for a fee of
more than $100. Birmingham and Nashville, Tenn., provide escorts
only for funerals of police officers and public officials. While
providing official escorts for pretty much any family that asks,
the city began charging a token $20 fee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic congestion has spurred the larger Southern cities to get
out of the funeral escort business. But in Charlotte, which has
seen more development than many Southern cities, council members
say they want to find a way to hold fast to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks volumes about a people for them to stop and pay
tribute to someone's passing,'' said City Councilman Don Reid, who
chairs the committee studying the situation. ``If we can't stop for
three minutes, then we've reached a point where we need to look at
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill pending in the North Carolina Legislature would require
motorists to stop for funeral processions but does not remove
liability from cities or police departments. Reid said Charlotte
needs to work with legislators to get that included.
</P>
<P>
   In many Southern towns, it has long been a simple matter of
courtesy for police to escort funeral processions, stopping traffic
at lights so the cortege could pass while other motorists pull to
the side, paying respects to a family in mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Said Swayney, 39: ``I will never ever have anything worse happen
to me than my husband's funeral, and anything that can give a
family comfort should be done. They deserve that respect. It is a
small price to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Swayney's husband was 36 when he died after a car ran into his
motorcycle on a downtown Charlotte street about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as newcomers unaccustomed to local traditions come in
and traffic mushrooms, it is not unusual to see motorists cutting
off funeral processions or even becoming so angry they raise a
finger in vulgar salute.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their argument, Charlotte police say that despite
years of practice, they lack the legal authority to allow hearses
and other funeral cars to run red lights. Only emergency vehicles
have that right under North Carolina law.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, courts in North Carolina and other states
have found cities, and even individual police officers, financially
liable in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   They say traffic here has more than doubled in the past 10 years
and all funeral processions occur during the day, the peak travel
time. And using officers as escorts takes them away from other
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Police records show they work 2,100 funerals a year, and each
one takes about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel compelled to make sure the public understands that
it's not a matter of if, but when, that enormous lawsuit comes
down,'' Deputy Police Chief Bob Shur told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But police could not provide any documentation of how many
accidents have occurred in Charlotte as a result of funeral
processions. One officer told The Charlotte Observer he had
witnessed 10 to 15 in a 28-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Police want funeral homes to provide maps to mourners and allow
them to get to the cemetery on their own, as best they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Police Department just doesn't want to provide
escorts anymore,'' said Swayney, who speculated that more accidents
would occur as mourners hurry to a cemetery that they may not know
how to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're distraught that's not the time to be trying to
read a map,'' she said. ``It shouldn't be stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he thinks the city will find a way to continue the
practice. Some cities have used off-duty officers for processions,
which stop for red lights. Others, like Louisville, Ky., use
three-wheeled vehicles operated by civilians as escorts. Houston
lets off-duty officers use their own motorcycles for processions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not as easy to solve as I thought it would be,'' said
Reid. ``Most people who responded to our survey want to keep this,
but it's a safety issue.

 &HT;    Vidalia growers vow to shun illegal workers
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vidalia onion growers, looking forward to an
above-average crop, are going to be as sweet as their famed onions
this spring to avoid the immigration problems that soured last
year's harvest, says the manager of the Vidalia Onion Business
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growers want to do what's right,'' said Bob Stafford, a
retired agriculture inspector who manages the newly formed council.
``They know they need to cooperate because they definitely don't
want to go through what they went through last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vidalia harvest begins in mid-April and continues for six to
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, part of the $90 million Vidalia crop died in the dirt
after agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service swooped
into South Georgia onion fields during the peak of the harvest to
round up workers suspected of being in this country illegally.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of workers fled.
</P>
<P>
   When the growers agreed to obey laws, the INS allowed the
harvest to proceed. But some of the crop was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Alexander, INS deputy director in Atlanta, said the agency,
in cooperation with county extension offices and the U.S.
Department of Labor, has staged workshops in onion country during
the past few months to educate growers on immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some larger growers also are participating in a much-reviled
federal program called H-2A, designed to make temporary foreign
labor available in the United States when domestic labor is
inadequate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vidalia growers have long complained they cannot find the 4,000
to 5,000 workers necessary to harvest the 15,000-acre onion crop.
But they say the H-2A program, which requires growers to provide
decent housing and worker compensation benefits, is too expensive
and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford said many council members will do their own hiring this
year to avoid using labor contractors who have provided them with
illegal help. They also will open their books to the INS so agents
can cross-check workers' immigration documents, he said. The
council was organized by growers who hope to stabilize onion prices
and provide a top-quality product, Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the INS announced plans this week to deploy
additional agents in quick response teams to Georgia and 10 other
states with growing illegal immigration problems. The Georgia
teams, to be based in Atlanta, Dalton, Albany and Savannah by Sept.
30, will include INS special agents, detention officers and
deportation officers.

POLITICIANS SAY NOW IS THE TIME TO END SALMON DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon
spawning in both Puget Sound and British Columbia rivers,
Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Canada's fisheries minister, David
Anderson, say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries
dispute up and down the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot deal with problems on this coast, what hope is
there for dealing with the crisis of overfishing worldwide?''
Anderson asked Thursday in a Seattle speech to the World Affairs
Council.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the optimism of Vice President Al Gore, who said in a
February interview that the United States will make a major push
this year to reach a long-term fisheries agreement with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And Locke, encouraged by results of interim accords, said: ``It
is time to come to a long-term U.S.-Canada agreement that focuses
on recovery of salmon in all of our rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Locke celebrated a trio of two-way deals that have
made an immediate, positive impact on several of the Northwest's
most imperiled salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch
of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia,
and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound
for the Stuart River.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off Vancouver
Island for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been much higher numbers of adult spawning salmon
_ particularly imperiled spring chinook salmon in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We successfully concentrated on finding a solution rather than
apportioning the blame,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and leaders of local governments in the region face a big
challenge in the recent listing of Puget Sound-area salmon under
the Endangered Species Act. The listing is likely to require
multiple measures to improve spawning habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But, Anderson maintained, money done to nurture salmon in
streams will be wasted drain unless conservation measures are taken
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other half of the equation is to get adult salmon back
from the Pacific Ocean to their spawning beds,'' said Anderson, a
longtime conservationist who represents Victoria in Canada's House
of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the fishing dispute has repeatedly
disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Canada's fisheries ministry slapped a $1,100
``licensing fee'' on Alaska-bound U.S. fishing boats using waters
of British Columbia's Inside Passage.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, British Columbia Premier Glen Clark tried to have
U.S. submarines barred from a torpedo testing range on Vancouver
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997 a blockade by B.C. fishing boats prevented
the Alaska Ferry ``Malaspina'' from leaving the dock in Prince
Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   However, the past year has seen a major change of policy and
attitude in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch
_ U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers
_ Anderson has put heavy emphasis on conservation. He moved last
year to curtail fishing of coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the two-five million coho salmon caught annually by
B.C. commercial fishermen in the mid-1990s, only 100,000 coho were
caught by all fisheries _ commercial, sport and native _ in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontation makes everyone poorer,'' Anderson said Thursday.
``Our constituencies are tired of arguments over who would kill the
last fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's policy has met with opposition from the British
Columbia government and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But his strategy has proven as popular a cause in British
Columbia as the restoration of salmon is south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salmon are a totem of this part of the world,'' he said.
``Salmon are also the canary in the mine as far as the condition of
our environment. If salmon are okay in our streams ... the
environment must be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke agreed, calling salmon ``the very definition of the
Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said technical discussions between Canadian fisheries
experts and their Alaska counterparts ``are going surprisingly well
... I believe we can get to an agreement this year.''

PATRIOTS OPEN AGAINST JETS SEPT. 12 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The NFL does like a little drama, doesn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will open the 1999 season against the New York Jets
at the Meadowlands Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we ain't opening up against Little Miss Magday's
Nursery,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We're right in the
thick of the division right here. The way we have to approach the
schedule is that we have to anticipate that it's going to be tough
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his players, Carroll said, ``We'll definitely have their
attention for the opener.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, in case you forgot, are the defending AFC East
champions, unseating the Patriots, who had owned the perch for two
years, and are coached by former Patriots head man Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will play a fourth-place schedule, which should be
easier than their schedules of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have good records and make it in the playoffs you have to
play strong on the road and New York, Cleveland, Kansas City on the
away games will be pretty crazy places,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
know if it's better to catch Cleveland early or catch Cleveland
when we do (Oct. 3), but it's going to be crazy at that place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will play one Monday night game _ Nov. 15 vs. the
Jets at Foxborough. They'll also host two Sunday night games _
against the New York Giants Sept. 26 and vs. Dallas Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   They play Denver again, but this time at home. They end the
season favorably, with home games against Buffalo and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The team's off week will come right at the midseason mark, after
a Halloween game at Arizona. They return from the break to play the
Jets on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bye comes in the middle and that's good,'' said Carroll.
``You take it where you get it, but you can't ask for more as far
as splitting up the season.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a three-week gap between divisional games at the
start of the season. The Patriots start with the Jets and improved
Colts, then have three games out of the division before hosting
Miami Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The team is scheduled to play four exhibition games, which
haven't been finalized because the NFL is considering the Patriots
for a game in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because the season starts later this year than usual because of
a television conflict with the major college bowl games on ABC, the
Patriots won't start training camp until the final week of July.

<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ Denouncing the Serbs' capture of three American
soldiers, President Clinton vowed forcefully to pursue the Balkan
bombing campaign and appealed to the nation for ``determination and
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world,'' the president said in a speech to hundreds of military
personnel in a cavernous squadron hangar at the Naval Air Station
here on Thursday. ``But just because we can't do everything for
everyone doesn't mean that, for the sake of consistency, we should
do nothing for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip outside Washington since NATO air strikes
began eight days ago, the president spoke emotionally in casting
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as the architect of the
violence in Kosovo and of the refugee crisis spilling across
southeastern Europe. The president also said that America holds
Milosevic and his government responsible for the safety of three
U.S. soldiers captured Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined by Defense Secretary William Cohen and
General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as he
promised that America would do all it could to get the soldiers
back, a signal of resolve to Milosevic as well as to the American
public and a Congress sharply divided over an operation that has
failed in its basic objective of stopping brutalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States takes care of its own,'' the president said,
standing in front of two jet-fighters, an F-18 Hornet and an F-14
Tomcat, and generating applause for the only time during his
25-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp aside directed at Milosevic, Clinton declared:
``There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken. There is no
basis for them to be held. There is certainly no basis for them to
be tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress was scattered for the Easter recess, but several
members of the leadership joined Clinton in calling Milosevic to
account. Others, including Reps. Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, who have
been sharp critics of Clinton's Kosovo policy, were silent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, said in a
statement that Milosevic ``should make no mistake. He will be held
accountable for any harm done to these American servicemen and must
guarantee their safe return. This is not a vague threat from the
pages of international law, but a promise from the people of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For some members of Congress the capture of the three soldiers
raised further doubts about ground troops. Rep. Mark Sanford,
R-S.C., who announced this week that he would sponsor legislation
to provide $25 million to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army, said that
the capture ``strengthens my belief that we shouldn't send in
ground troops. I think America has been lulled into a sense of
complacency about armed conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the steady stream of reported atrocities committed
by Serb troops against ethnic Albanians prompted two New York
Democratic congressmen, Eliot Engel and Jerrold Nadler, to call for
NATO ground forces to create safe havens inside Kosovo for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only troops on the ground can stop the murders and crimes
against humanity,'' the lawmakers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the president said that Milosevic had violated
specific commitments he had given ``to us, to our NATO allies, to
other European countries and to Russia.'' The violence against
Kosovo's Albanians is ``happening to people who embrace peace and
promise to lay down their own arms. They put their trust in us, and
we can't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said to his audience: ``Think how you would feel
if you were part of the half a million people who lived peaceably
in a place, just wanted to be let alone to practice your religion
and educate your children and do your work; if people came to your
house and your village and said, `Pack up your belongings and go.
We're going to burn your property records. We're going to burn your
identity records. And if your husband or your son is of military
service age, we might take them out behind the barn and shoot them
dead' _ just because you have a different religion, just because
you have a different ethnic background. Is that really what we want
the 21st century to be about for our children?''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the administration's foreign policy team said the
speech marked a stepped-up campaign to mobilize public opinion in
support of the Balkan policy and to blunt critics who might seize
on the capture of the three G.I.'s as further proof that the NATO
operation is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't know how it's going to cut politically,''
said the official. ``I hope it makes people mad and I hope it makes
the American public mad. We have to get people to rally around
this. We're in a major significant test of wills between western
civilization and a brutal thug. We have to prevail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said that Clinton still needed to frame the mission,
which at this point has several tangents, in a coherent way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has to pull it all together, and he didn't do it
the first time around,'' Hess said of Clinton's televised address
from the Oval Office last week. ``It wasn't a forceful speech. The
language wasn't forceful. He used too many subordinate clauses.''
But he said the president was unlikely to undertake a ``full-scale
public relations campaign'' because it could back him into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said Thursday's address was not a matter of
getting the speech right but a matter of keeping the objectives
clearly before the public. ``It's not something you do once,'' said
P.J. Crowley, a national security spokesman. ``As it unfolds, you
keep reminding the American people what the interests are and what
the American objectives are.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated much of the history and geography lesson that
he employed in his Oval Office address, underscoring the threat
that Milosevic posed to Europe. He said that Milosevic was
committing atrocities ``at the doorstep of NATO, which has
preserved the security of Europe for 50 years.'' He said that the
kind of ethnic and religious hatred in Kosovo is ``one of the
dominant problems the whole world faces. And this is right in the
underbelly of Europe.'' And he asked: ``Are we, in the last year of
the 20th century, going to look the other way as entire peoples in
Europe are forced to abandon their homelands or die?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech brought a mixed but generally supportive
reaction from those who came to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully support the mission,'' said Paul Brown, 32, a software
engineer who recently completed his Naval service and is now under
contract at the base. ``We can't allow genocide and ethnic
cleansing _ that was the same as World War II and our own Civil
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he said he supported the deployment of ground
troops. ``Ground troops would be more effective because the planes
and ships can't hit every target,'' he said. ``Whether the American
people like it or not, that's what the armed forces is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Burt, 35, whose husband serves on the USS Harry S Truman,
is less enthusiastic. ``It's not our fight to begin with,'' she
said, cradling her 6-month-old son, Thomas. ``There are a lot of
other civil wars we're not involved in, and I guess I don't
understand why President Clinton picked this one. I wish we weren't
involved. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the three soldiers, she said, makes it more
likely the United States will become entangled and not be able to
get out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those likely to go declined to comment on the mission
itself. ``We do what we're told,'' said Capt. Mike Steadman of the
Marine Corps. ``The mission is clear. The question is, how do we
achieve it? A lot of military people say you can't win a war by air
power alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Several said that people in the military were more likely than
others to support the idea of fighting for freedom. ``We pay
attention to what's going on in the world,'' said Steven Argroves,
27, a yeoman first class. ``We understand that his purpose in
sending us is to prevent another world war.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton spoke, he met for about an hour in private with
the families of men already overseas. Despite the mounting war
effort in Serbia, some of those families used their rare time with
the commander-in-chief to complain about low pay and lack of day
care in the military, prompting the President to say in his public
address, ``We know we owe you fair pay, decent housing and other
support.''

N.H. FAILS ONCE AGAIN TO LEGISLATE A REVENUE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire's Senate, desperate to solve the
state's school funding crisis, has passed an $825 million revenue
bill that includes legalizing video slot machine gambling at the
state's race tracks and grand hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Forewarned that passage was imminent, the 400-member House
adjourned briefly for dinner Thursday and then returned to
summarily kill the bill by, 300-14, thus keeping its anti-gambling
track record intact.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire now enters the Easter weekend in violation of a
state Supreme Court order, with no legal source of funding schools
past June, with bond rating agencies breathing down its neck and
with no proposal having anything close to majority support in
either body.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an end game, no one knows what it is,'' said one
lobbyist who has worked for year to find a solution to the
connundrum facing residents of the only state never to have enacted
a broad base sales or income tax.
</P>
<P>
   After a day in which one fragile accord after another formed
only to swiftly burst, the Senate reluctantly embraced gambling as
a component in an amended version of a plan first offered by Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $200 million in new gambling money, that plan
called for increased business taxes and the imposition of the
state's first entertainment tax, an 8 percent surcharge on tickets
to ski areas, movies, concerts and other amusements. In speeches
before the vote, the bill's Senate supporters acknowledged their
offered compromise was doomed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of video gambling marked the third option to be
foreclosed on during New Hampshire's 15-month struggle to find a
replacement for a school funding system that relies on
wildly-varying, and thus unconstitutional, local property tax rates
to pay for public education. Still alive, although without much
enthusiastic support, are proposals for statewide property tax, a
sales tax and a consumption tax that would hit both services and
the sale of goods.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier vote Thursday, the House killed a
conservative-backed bill that would have preserved the existing tax
system by declaring the state Supreme Court's rulings in the
so-called Claremont lawsuits to be ``an unconstitutional violation
of the separation of powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Republican-controlled House passed the
first income tax in the frugal state's history. An amended version
subsequently won approval in the Senate, but with Gov. Shaheen
adamant in her threat to veto any income tax bill, it died upon
return to the House this week.

 &HT;    Big Game tickets flying out of stores
 &HT;    By Bill Steiden
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A giant jackpot means giant sales.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 11 p.m. drawing will be the largest in the history of
the Big Game, with a six-state jackpot of $160 million for a single
winner, up from the $103 million at stake in the last drawing on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were selling at a clip of 5,594 a minute between 3 p.m.
and 4 p.m. Thursday, more than four times the 1,327-a-minute pace
for the same period last week, said Parquita Nassau, a Georgia
Lottery spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Big Game record was $77 million in 1997. If the
jackpot rolls over again _ as it has since Feb. 2, leading up to
tonight's drawing _ the jackpot will almost certainly approach $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the quest for the record prize will become a
part of the growing trove of Georgia lottery lore. Some highlights
of the Georgia Lottery's nearly six years include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest single payout: $21.9 million in a lump sum to Big Game
winner Jim Sheets, 42, of Harrison, Tenn., in February. Sheets,
whose winning sequence included a Big Ball number of 13, promptly
handed over his suburban Chattanooga bait shop business to his son
and began working on his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most controversial winner: Kenny Dukes of Darien, who waited 2
1/2 months to claim his September 1998 record Lotto prize of $31
million. It turned out that Dukes had served multiple prison terms
and had faced charges over the years that included assault, robbery
and fraud. He remains on probation through 2001 for burglarizing
his mother's trailer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most satisfied winner: It's hard to judge this category, but a
top contender would certainly be Pamela Reynolds of Norcross, who
won $11.6 million in early 1997. She promptly sent a photocopy of
her winning ticket to the man from whom she had been divorced a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Luckiest winner: It's also hard to say which Georgia Lottery
winner was most fortunate, but Randell Johnson of Norcross (notice
a pattern here?) has a strong claim on the title. Asked why he had
waited until May 1995 to collect on his $87,000 Fantasy 5 win, he
said it was because he wanted to cool down and avoid a wild
spending spree like the one he went on when he won $131,000 in the
Illinois Lottery in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most modest winner: Mary Marshall of Cleveland, Tenn., who won
$8.5 million in 1995. Though she quit her minimum-wage factory job
and built a cozy three-bedroom house for herself and her husband,
she continued to shop at Dollar General and dine at buffet-style
restaurants. ``I just don't see spending any more money than you
have to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most surprising lottery fact: A 1998 Atlanta
Journal-Constitution/Georgia State University poll found that more
than half of Georgians said they never play the games. At least,
that's what they told us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst chance of winning: Any ticket for tonight's drawing.
Along with the record jackpot go astronomical odds: 76 million to
1.

 &HT;    Hit the jackpot? Don't tell anyone but your shrink
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just shut up. Don't tell a soul, even family members.
Don't cuss out the boss, quit your job, buy that Jaguar convertible
you've long been coveting or hold a news conference to crow and try
not to even smile if you win that $160 million Big Game jackpot
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But do _ please do _ call a shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a checklist of things to do if the big prize comes in:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take your winnings upfront, even though that'll lessen the
prize to a measly $90 million or so, advise Bill Merritt and Lex
Watson, Atlanta estate planners. Taking the prize in a lump sum
gives you more leeway in investing it and setting up untouchable
trusts for family members and charities. Then you can tell people
it's out of your hands, and you won't be lying.
</P>
<P>
   _ But don't collect right away. If you don't already have a safe
deposit box, get one, then slip the winning ticket inside. You've
got 180 days to claim your prize, and that'll give you plenty of
time to protect yourself from predators by retaining reputable
financial professionals, says Ann Salo, an Atlanta estate planner
who's had two lottery winners as clients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unless you're in a stable relationship, Salo advises, don't
even tell your spouse for a while, because some secrets are almost
impossible to keep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get an unlisted phone number, and move to another house,
Merritt says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't tell your boss to shove it, Salo says. Or go on a
spending spree. Or do anything unusual. You don't want to offer any
clues that you've hit it big.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quietly retain a financial planner who charges by the hour,
not one who'll charge commissions, Salo says. The planner will help
you assemble a team of experts to help you minimize the tax bite,
and keep relatives and friends off your back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't put your money into a bank account, which is insured
only up to $100,000, she says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get psychological advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, whoever wins will feel isolated and alone,'' says Dr.
Rick Winer, a suburban Atlanta psychiatrist. ``For people with an
outgoing personality, you might tend to withdraw into a shell
because you're afraid of what everybody else wants from you.''
</P>
<P>
   And you'll be right, Salo says. ``You'll have cousins saying, `I
need $5,000 to get out of a jam,' and they'll resent it, or you
think they will, if you don't put forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Wheeler, a local clinical psychologist, says such a
windfall won't just suck in freeloaders, bloodthirsty relatives,
friends, stockbrokers and bankers, ``but it'll create a vacuum in
your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to look at all the things you've said you'd do if
only you had the resources,'' she says. ``Now your excuses are
gone. This causes instant anxiety and stress, and stress can
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Once your head's on straight, learn to say ``no,'' Salo says.
``All of a sudden, you're going to be the most popular person in
the world. Remember, relatives aren't going to like you anyway
because you've hit it big, and it's better to be disliked than
poor.

CAPTURE OF SOLDIERS BRINGS HOME TO AMERICANS DANGER OF WAR IN
DISTANT LAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The capture of three U.S. soldiers in the Balkans
suddenly brought home to many Americans on Thursday the cost and
dangers of war in a distant land.
</P>
<P>
   With the public ambivalent and Congress uneasy about NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, President Clinton sought Thursday to
reassure Americans about the nation's commitment to the three
soldiers, including Spec. Steven Gonzalez of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Farer, dean of the graduate school of international studies
at the University of Denver, said TV images of the battered Army
enlisted men ``demonizes'' the conflict for Americans who are
trying to form opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does having three of our men seized undermine public
opinion?'' Farer asked rhetorically. ``I think it will harden it.
But it's hard to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Crockett, whose 2nd Congressional District
includes Gonzalez' hometown of Huntsville, said he has been working
with the Pentagon to get information to the serviceman's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really strengthens our resolve,'' Turner said of
the soldiers' capture, speaking in a telephone interview. ``It's
important for us to exhibit our resolve and wait for the airstrikes
to take their toll. I think Americans rally around the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Texas lawmaker took an opposing view. Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Surfside, an outspoken critic of the war effort, said Thursday:
``I would hope this would wake up the American people not just in
terms of money but in terms of lives. I would think public opinion
would be against this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The offices of both Texas senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and
Kay Bailey Hutchison, reported that calls and e-mails are
overwhelmingly against further U.S. involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Gramm reiterated his opposition to the U.S.
presence, but added: ``The three soldiers who were captured had no
role in the operation against Yugoslavia. They should be released
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A previous case of Americans held captive overseas _ 52
Americans seized by Iranian militants at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
in 1979 _ affected all aspects of U.S. policy and ultimately the
1980 presidential election. Republican nominee Ronald Reagan
depicted President Carter as weak and ineffectual, and Reagan won
the election.
</P>
<P>
   L. Bruce Laingen, the highest-ranking foreign service officer
held in Iran, said Thursday of the captive soldiers: ``They'll be
all right physically. It'll be uncomfortable psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   As for broader impact, Laingen said that the episode is ``a
small incident'' that is very different from the hostage crisis in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Laingen, president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, said
his heart goes out to the young servicemen, but ``I do not think it
should affect policy in any way except to deepen anger'' at
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.''

<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. _ When federal immigration agents came to the
fruit-packing warehouses here in central Washington in February,
there were no sudden raids, no emergency deportation hearings, no
buses waiting to take the hundreds of illegal immigrants found
working back to the Mexican border, a thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   When the investigators left, though, there was chaos in the
Yakima Valley. More than 560 people were fired, under orders from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, because they possessed
forged or otherwise improper work documents. The action was part of
a stepped-up enforcement strategy against illegal immigration that
expands on what the agency calls its ``interior enforcement
program.''
</P>
<P>
   As it has done in some places on a much smaller scale, the
agency is auditing workers' documentation in industries across the
country, from the farmlands and fruit-packing plants here in the
Northwest to beef-packing plants in the Midwest to hotels in South
Florida. Unlike the expensive raids of workplaces and the
cumbersome deportations of illegal immigrants, the auditing
approach is intended to cut them off from the goal that brings them
to this country: work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to send a message,'' said Doris Meissner, the
federal immigration commissioner. ``And the intent is to really
change the dynamics, change the climate, and change the
decision-making process of these migrants.''
</P>
<P>
   But with 5.5 million people living illegally in the country, it
may take a long time to send that message. And even the immigration
agency concedes that the policy is creating wrenching dilemmas for
the immigrants, many of whom have quietly held their jobs for
years, have bought homes and have children who were born in the
United States and thus are American citizens. In many cases, their
children have never even been to Mexico, the country from which
most of the workers come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nightmare for so many of us,'' said Mireya Chavez,
who was recently fired after working for nine years in the Yakima
Valley, cutting asparagus, picking apples and packing in the
warehouses _ all the time as an illegal resident, though her two
sons, 7 and 5 years old, are American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for help from anyone,'' she said. ``I just
want a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The firings have created widespread resentment in Yakima _ not
just among the workers, but also among the warehouse owners and
local officials, who are wondering how to deal with the effects of
a federal action that has thrown hundreds of people out of work.
Though the workers are entitled to few government benefits, they
can seek them for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still here, and they still have basic needs,'' said
Steve Hill, the director of community services for Yakima County.
``How do they pay their rent? Where do they get their food?''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Brown, a program manager for the local office of the state
Department of Social and Health Services, said: ``People don't seem
to be saying, `Well, if it isn't OK for me to work here, then I'm
going back home.' They seem to be saying, as a group, `We're
staying here. This is home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the off-season for growing and picking, the dismissals
have not had a major impact on production. Besides, the growers and
warehouse owners said there had been no shortage of applicants for
the jobs. Many did say they were bothered at being told to let go
of good workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is an extremely frustrating situation,'' said
Dick Keller, president of Northwestern Fruit and Produce, who was
recently told to fire 87 workers from his warehouse. ``From the
standpoint of the immigration agents I guess they get it all the
way from D.C., from the president on down. They're told to get out
and get something done. Now they've done something, but it's not
curing the problem, and it's creating a lot of disruption for a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The audits and firings in non-border states are not new, but
under the policy shift, they simply will occur on a much broader
basis than ever before, said Meissner. While the intent of the
expanded strategy is clear, the full impact remains to be seen.
Some of the dismissed workers here say they will simply look for a
new job and take their chances on being caught again.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural work has long been readily available to just about
any migrant in Yakima, and the huge pool of willing workers has
kept wages low. Employers are required to check documents, but
forged employment or Social Security cards are readily available.
In one raid on a warehouse last November in Los Angeles, the
immigration service found boxes with 2 million fake identification
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they ever really go after the farm workers, then the whole
agricultural industry is in deep trouble,'' said David Carlson, the
owner of 2,200 acres of orchards in Wapato, Wash., just outside of
Yakima, who also owns a small packing house that was recently told
to fire nine of its 45 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say the industry shouldn't be employing people
who aren't legal,'' Carlson added. ``On the other hand, everybody
sure seems to like inexpensive food at the grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, the continued prevalence of illegal workers
demonstrates what immigration experts say has been the colossal
failure of the landmark immigration law passed by Congress in 1986.
That measure granted amnesty to about 3 million illegal workers,
but was intended to stem illegal immigration with tough new
sanctions against workers and employers, enforceable with fines and
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of people living illegally in the country is
growing by about 275,000 a year, according to the immigration
service. Employers rarely face sanctions for illegal workers, as
long as they can show that they checked the documents presented to
them. ``It is something you cannot stop, because the conditions
that we come from are so difficult,'' said Teresa Mendoza, 26, who
recently was fired from her packing job and who has two children, a
5-year-old and another 9 months, who are American citizens. ``I am
fighting for my dream for them, and I want to work. I don't want
welfare. I have two hands and two legs, and I want to work. What
kind of bad crime am I committing?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mendoza's crime is that she is here illegally, having
overstayed her tourist visa. But immigrants' advocates insist that
people like her are really the victims of a system that almost
seems to beg them to come here seeking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of undocumented workers in this region has been
common knowledge to all for many, many years,'' said Hector Franco,
executive director of Asociacion de Barrios Hispanos, a Yakima
group. ``It's totally inhuman to come in now and treat them like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,500 people attended a rally here a few weeks ago,
demanding amnesty for the fired workers, and many political
leaders, including Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, have spoken up at
least partly in their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the actions of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in terms of disruption of people, the
families who have been depending on these jobs,'' the governor said
recently at a news conference in Olympia. Locke said there must be
some better system of screening applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been developing such procedures, it said, and has
created a much more more forgery-resistant version of the ``green
card,'' which authorizes non-citizens to work. But with the
immigration service already contending with record numbers of
citizenship applications, there appears to be little political will
for any new amnesty program, and many immigration officials say
that such an approach would send the wrong message to people who
are trying to legally obtain citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration service, said it
is mindful of the suffering caused by the firings, but is simply
trying to fulfill its obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why there is so much controversy when
something like this occurs is that over the past decades, there has
been a significant erosion of respect for federal immigration
law,'' Bergeron said. ``It is to the point where individuals and
certain business interests and other special interests have adopted
an attitude that it is their right to violate these laws, and that
the federal government is conducting some sort of persecution for
simply now enforcing what is the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS says its ``interior enforcement strategy'' is aimed at
industries that often are nowhere near the U.S.-Mexico border,
where the ranks of the Border Patrol have been sharply increased as
part of the more traditional approach toward stopping illegal
immigration. But even effective border actions cannot stop all
illegal immigration: Nearly half of all illegal immigrants enter
the country legally, then overstay their visas.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the immigration service
said that the audits forced the firing of 44,474 illegal workers.
That is only a fraction of the 1.5 million apprehended at the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Yakima, there is considerable skepticism that the audits
would put any serious dent in the numbers of illegal workers, who
remain in such large supply because not employing them would simply
drive up the cost of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to pay a lot more for the American people,'' said a
fired worker named Olga, who would not give her last name because
she was afraid that she and her husband, also recently fired, could
be subjected to further action. ``They can pay $5.50 an hour to us,
while they would have to pay maybe $10 to the others.''

 &HT;    Friends of POW pray for the best
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley

<P>
   AUSTIN _ When Terri Sumrall saw the television image Thursday of
the boy she dated in high school, it looked like a totally
different person. Steven Gonzales is so much taller now. And he
looked so serious. She'd never seen him look serious before.
</P>
<P>
   He'd never been in such a serious situation. U.S. Spc. Gonzales,
just days from his 22nd birthday, was one of three U.S. Army
soldiers taken prisoner by Yugoslav forces as they patrolled along
the border between Macedonia and Kosovo. They are to face criminal
proceedings today in a Yugoslav military court.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, friends universally described the former Texas A&AMP;M
University student as highly intelligent, devout in his Christian
faith, and having an exuberant sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales was graduated from high school in 1995 in the East
Texas town of Palestine. It was there that Sumrall, now a senior at
the University of Texas at Austin, knew him. ``He's just a real
sweet guy,'' she said. ``I had all my honors classes with him. He
liked to joke around and be silly. He's a jokester. He's real
smart, and such a good Christian. He was always asking people to go
to church with him. He never has done anything mean to anyone. I
can honestly say that he has no enemies. I keep imagining what he's
going through and how terrified he must be. He was always there for
me. The worst thing about it is that I can't do anything about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gonzales was in the top 10 percent of his high school
graduating class. He won letters in both soccer and track. He won a
scholarship from A&AMP;M to attend school there. But he quit school
after a year to join the Army. His high school biology teacher, Kay
Stroud, said she believed that the scholarship wasn't enough to pay
all the young man's expenses and that he enlisted to earn money to
go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, where both of Gonzales' parents
work, Steven's father Gilberto Gonzales said his son planned to
return to A&AMP;M under a military program in which he would get a
bachelor's degree and a commission and go back on active duty as an
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Stroud said her former student ``is very level-headed. As
far as the situation he is in, I believe he is going to be able to
take care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Tracy Stroud, a high school classmate of Gonzales'
who works for a property management firm in Austin, agreed. ``He's
the kind of person that no matter what comes up, he'll be able to
handle it. He's very smart, a very rational person. And just
watching the tapes they're showing, he seems calm to me. That's
just how he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Williams, another classmate who's now a student at Texas
A&AMP;M-Galveston, said ``The picture I'm thinking of is how he used to
wiggle his ears. He had big ears and we'd all tease him about them
and he'd wiggle them and make us laugh. That's how I knew it was
him when I saw the pictures on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating because I can't do anything. We have a
prayer network going. We're all saying our prayers and wishing he
could be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven's parents met reporters Thursday afternoon in Huntsville.
They talked with their son before he enlisted about the dangers a
soldier might face, his father said. ``He made the decision himself
to join. He thought it would be beneficial for him . . . He's very
strong . . . very devoted to God,'' Gilberto Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven and the other two soldiers don't deserve this,'' said
his mother Rosie Gonzales. ``They're young men with their whole
lives ahead of them. They were put in a bad situation and we just
pray . . . for their safe return, all three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the criminal proceedings, she said, ``These soldiers
are not criminals and they should not be dealt with as such.
They're innocent young men who were over there as part of their
duty to their country. ``
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gonzales is based in Germany and had volunteered to be
part of the peace-keeping mission in Macedonia. He had been there
for about a month. Castlebury, the TDCJ spokesman, said that
Gilberto Gonzales said his son was to end that temporary duty and
return to Germany ``yesterday, today, any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the family of another captured soldier spoke with
reporters. Tricia Stone and 4-year-old Ryan Stone, the wife and
child of Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich., are living in San Antonio with her relatives. At a news
conference with her mother, Lisa McKinney, Tricia Stone answered no
questions. Her mother read a statement expressing gratitude to
those who have offered support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of Chris and all the soldiers serving our
nation,'' the statement read. ``As a family, we are doing all
right. We are doing our very best to help Tricia and Ryan through
their ordeal until Christopher is returned safely to us . . . .''

FEW WESTERN EUROPEAN NATIONS WILL WELCOME KOSOVAR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The huge numbers of ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo are
raising acute concerns in west European countries about the
potential arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in societies
already strained by high unemployment, sluggish growth and
simmering resentment of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a politically explosive influx, Germany said Thursday
that Kosovo's Albanian outcasts should remain in the Balkans and
stay outside ``western or northern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, where over 4 million people, or more than 10 percent of
the workforce, is jobless, and where 350,000 refugees poured in
from Bosnia during the 1992-1995 war, is particularly concerned.
But France and Italy face similar problems and appear equally
determined to ensure that the refugees do not move west.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, aid officials said, the issue could drive a wedge
between the United States and its European NATO partners because it
illustrates, in blunt form, how broadly destabilizing the conflict
is on the European continent while America has a large buffer, the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the refugees should remain as close to Kosovo as
possible,'' German Deputy Foreign Minister Gunter Verheugen said
Thursday during a brief visit to the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
``Our assumption is that we will soon achieve our political goal
and the refugees will be able to return to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, given the state of the conflict, what led
Verheugen to that assumption. He added that ``acceptance of the
refugees into western or northern Europe'' would send ``a
completely false signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications of a policy of zero acceptance of refugees
appeared fraught with danger for the Balkans. It will mean that
fragile states, with scant resources and, in the case of Macedonia,
a tenuous balance of ethnic groups, will be subjected to enormous
new social pressures if the refugees are unable to return soon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet accepting refugees also involves political risk. Austria, a
country of just over 8 million people which took in 70,000 refugees
during the Bosnian war, has said it will accept refugees from
Kosovo. But on Thursday the party of the Austrian far right-winger
Joerg Haider, who has consistently campaigned against foreigners
and immigrants, attacked the government's decision, saying Austria
had neither space nor ability to cope with the influx. Haider
recently did outstandingly well in provincial elections, and
tensions over Kosovo refugees could further strengthen his party,
already Europe's strongest far right movement, in national
elections in October.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of ethnic Albanian refugees totaling almost
190,000 over the past week alone, the scale of reported ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo in recent days appears comparable only to the
first months of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring and summer of 1992, over 750,000 Bosnian Muslims
were hounded from their homes by the Serbs, using methods of terror
that appear now to have been revived. In just a few days in August
1995, over 150,000 Serbs poured out of Croatia, fleeing a lightning
Croatian attack to take back land seized by the Serbs during the
Croatian war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Verheugen's statement came as Joschka Fischer, the German
foreign minister, on Thursday chaired a hastily convened conference
in Bonn on the plight of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with other European ministers and with Sadako Ogata,
the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Fischer suggested that
western policy should consist of sending money and food to the
Balkans to sustain the refugees there, rather than opening the
doors to them in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany on Thursday pledged $13.8 million to help the refugees
and flew 45 tonnes of goods and medicine to Albania and Skopje.
Spain and France also dispatched a total of 50 tonnes of food.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the refugees close to Kosovo also helps to underpin
statements by ministers in NATO governments that the ethnic
Albanians will _ unlike many of the refugees who fled Bosnia _
eventually go home.
</P>
<P>
   The policy outlined at Thursday's conference was consistent with
that of the center-left government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
which has tried, under fierce attack from the right, to make German
citizenship available to more of the 7 million foreigners living
here, but has been intransigent in saying that there is no room for
new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached the limits, the point where we have to say we
cannot bear any more,'' Otto Schily, the interior minister, said
last year. ``The majority of Germans agree with me: zero
immigration for now. The burden has become too great.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In general, with their social insurance budgets strained by
aging populations and a large number of unemployed, western
European societies have become progressively more closed to
accepting refugees. Although still marginal, rightist movements in
France and Germany have grown by exploiting anti-immigrant
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The huge influx of Bosnian refugees cost Germany over $11
billion and fed resentments rooted in an unemployment level that
exceeds 20 percent in many parts of the former East Germany. Since
the Bosnian war ended, all but 80,000 of the refugees have been
sent back _ some of them forcibly _ but the tensions have not
abated.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has had solid support for its
participation in the bombing of Yugoslavia, 54 years after the
collapse of the Third Reich. But it apparently was not prepared for
the possible social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO governments could also come under severe strain
because of the refugee problem. Greece borders both Albania and
Macedonia, which have received the bulk of the massive influx of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo; Italy is just across the Adriatic
from Albania and Montenegro, the Yugoslav republic that is also
receiving Kosovo refugees. Albania's near-collapse in the past
decade already has sent tens if not hundreds of thousands of its
citizens flooding into Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The German government's current stance of refusing more refugees
appeared certain to anger the more left-leaning fringe of the
governing Green Party, known as the ``fundamentalist'' wing.
Already restive over a sustained bombing campaign that runs
diametrically counter to the party's pacifist roots, these members
of the Green Party back an open-door policy to political refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Christian Stroebele, a Green member of the Bundestag, has
already collected 500 signatures from party members demanding an
end to the bombardment. Some evidence of the strength of this
movement should become apparent this weekend during the so-called
Easter Marches, which traditionally rally German pacifists.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the marches, it is clear that the Greens
are undergoing strains that could undermine the governing
coalition, especially if NATO's bombing continues for weeks, as
some alliance commanders have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading German newspapers have also attacked the Kosovo
refugee policy. ``The Germans' decision to deport Bosnian refugees
back to their homeland was made with the explanation that resources
were needed in case of a new catastrophe,'' the Suddeutsche Zeitung
commented Thursday. ``That catastrophe is here.''

BIOLOGISTS DISCOVER HOW BONE AND SOME TISSUE CELLS DEVELOP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Md. and Mass.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of regenerative medicine _ using the body's own stem
cells and growth factors to repair tissues _ has come closer to
reality with a discovery about the special human cells from which
all bone and connective tissues are derived.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery bolsters the hope that the cells can in principle
be used to repair bone, cartilage, tendon and many other injured or
aged tissues. The cells would in many cases be derived from the
patient's own bone marrow and thus present no problem of immune
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at Osiris Therapeutics, a privately held
biotechnology company in Baltimore, Md., have shown that the cells,
called human mesenchymal stem cells, can be converted into bone
cells, cartilage cells, fat cells and the stroma cells in the bone
marrow that provide support for blood-forming cells.
</P>
<P>
   The company, named after the ancient Egyptian god of regrowth
and rejuvenation, also has identified special factors that can be
used in the laboratory to drive the cells down each of these
distinct lineages. Its work is described in Friday's issue of
Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel R. Marshak, Osiris' chief scientific officer, said
the mesenchymal stem cells could be formulated so that, when
inserted in the right place in the body, they would change into the
appropriate tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Tests in animals show that when the cells are grown on ceramic
and put into bone, they turn into bone-forming cells. If grown in a
gel and inserted into cartilage, they metamorphose into cartilage
cells. If injected into the bloodstream, the cells take up
residence in the bone and turn into stroma cells.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing how soon treatments derived from the
techniques will be available, but a clinical trial is now under way
with breast cancer patients to explore the cells' stroma-forming
abilities. Lack of stroma to support blood-forming cells may be why
the bone marrow transplants given to cancer patients after
chemotherapy are not always successful.
</P>
<P>
   With Novartis AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, Osiris also
plans to test in humans the cells' abilities to form new bone,
tendon and cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The cells can also be converted to fat cells, which could prove
useful in cosmetic surgery and possibly as material for breast
implants.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark F. Pittenger, who identified the various factors needed
to convert the cells into bone, cartilage, and fat, said he is now
working to change them into heart-muscle cells. People are born
with a fixed number of heart-muscle cells and the heart grows by
enlargement of these cells, not by growing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope at the least we could prevent some of the scarring
after a heart attack by implanting new cells,'' Pittenger said.
</P>
<P>
   The human mesenchymal stem cells found in adult bone marrow are
derived from the mesoderm, one of the three tissue types of the
early embryo and the source of all the body's bone and connective
tissue. The adult stem cells evidently retain much, and possibly
all, of the mesoderm's magical plasticity, giving the Osiris
biologists a wide range of tissue fates to explore for the cells.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell biologists independent of the company said the new
report represented a promising advance, even though it remains to
be seen if the clinical applications will work as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David J. Anderson of the California Institute of Technology
said it was a ``very important result'' to have trained the stem
cells to form different lineages in the labortory. Dr. Ronald McKay
of the National Institutes of Health described the Osiris report as
a ``very serious and interesting contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Osiris and Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome
Sciences, have laid trademark claims to the evocative phrase
``regenerative medicine,'' the idea that stem cells and the growth
factors that shape their fate may provide a radically new approach
to healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental concept is that if we learn enough about how
the body regenerates itself, we can use those same mechanisms to
regenerate tissues that are damaged or worn down by age,''
Haseltine said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the body's own repair mechanisms fail, however,
are extra stem cells all that is needed to overcome the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Marshak of Osiris said that often the body may not be able to
get enough of its mesenchymal stem cells to an injury in time,
especially in cartilage, for example, which has no blood supply, or
when a large area of bone is missing.
</P>
<P>
   McKay said the prospects for regenerative medicine and the
clinical usefulness of stem cells were likely to depend on how
deeply the genetic rules for fashioning an animal body are embedded
in the cell's hereditary programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cells have constant access to these rules, then the
answer is that through this door we will go into a universe where
there is real control over reshaping human tissues.''
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to be optimistic about the clinical uses of stem
cells ``but advances are not going to come as day follows night,''
said Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer biologist at the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Weinberg noted that complex tissues
are formed by the interaction of many different types of cell, and
that even though stem cells can be driven down certain lineages in
the laboratory, it is not yet clear that the body will provide the
same cocktail of factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of certain special cell types like skin,
the ability to reconstruct complex tissues is still years ahead of
us, but work like this will be viewed as pioneering five to ten
years down the road,'' he said, referring to the Osiris report.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. _ In the 10 days since a young woman ran
terrified and naked down a gravel street here and told a harrowing
tale of rape, torture and escape, the authorities have repeatedly
hinted at even worse horrors inside the double-wide trailer home at
513 Bass Road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the 45 federal agents and 30 state police officers who
spent much of Wednesday and Thursday searching the property with
shovels and metal detectors have found no bodies, the specter of
serial murder continues to hang over the trailer like one of the
red dust clouds kicked up by the strong winds of springtime in New
Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said they were ``looking into anything and
everything,'' including the possibility of homicides. They are
tracking down leads in Arizona, Texas and Mexico. And New Mexico
Public Safety Director Darren White said what he had seen inside
513 had ``literally made my stomach turn.'' He added, ``This is
very disturbing stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far the authorities have provided few details to explain
the stomach turning and the digging, an information vacuum that has
been quickly filled by mystery and myth. ``We're doing a lot of
rumor control,'' admitted FBI Special Agent Doug Beldon, who is
overseeing much of the inquiry. ``But we simply can't do anything
to screw up future cases.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Beldon said the search at the
trailer home, which has included a cadaver-sniffing dog, would
probably be finished by Friday. He said he was optimistic that
investigators were closer to knowing ``whether we have a
homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of details in the case has frustrated some here in
Elephant Butte and in the nearby city of Truth or Consequences,
known in the area as T or C. ``Why aren't they telling us
everything?'' asked Brenda McCormick, a 39-year-old medical
technician who was having breakfast Thursday in a cafe in T or C.
``That's the scary part.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Landon, 70, a retired medical secretary who lives in
Elephant Butte, said she did not need to know all the details.
``We'll probably learn a lot more than we want to know,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is known about the bizarre case is that on March 22, a
59-year-old state parks employee, David Parker Ray, and his live-in
girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, were arrested and charged with,
among other crimes, kidnapping a young woman in Albuquerque and
driving her 150 miles south to Elephant Butte, a tiny town on the
edge of the sparkling Elephant Butte Lake, a popular recreation
area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal complaint filed against them in Sierra
County District Court, the couple then raped and tortured the woman
at gunpoint for three days until she escaped, a chain and padlock
still dangling from her neck as she ran down the street for help. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days after that escape, a second woman came forward and
said she too had been taken captive the month before when she went
to the trailer to borrow some cake mix. ``Inside the trailer, on
the walls,'' court papers said, ``were numerous restraint devices
and medical tools.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court papers said police had verified that the second woman
had reported in February that she had been attacked, soon after it
was said to have occurred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why the authorities did not act then and possibly prevent the
second attack is unclear. New Mexico State Police Lt. Randy Bertram
said, ``We are investigating what happened, but I can't say
anything else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ray and Ms. Hendy said their clients would enter not
guilty pleas. The couple are being held on $1 million bond each.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Ms. Hendy told an Albuquerque television station
that during a night of drinking Ms. Hendy said that Ray had killed
four to six women and had either buried their bodies in the desert
or dumped them into the middle of Elephant Butte Lake, which is 18
miles long and 300 feet deep in some areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two boats on Ray's one-acre property, which overlooks
the water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beldon of the FBI said that the man had also told the
authorities the same story and that it was being investigated, but
so far there are no immediate plans to drag the lake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hendy, according to court documents, has an admitted problem
with the truth. In 1998, after charging a boyfriend with domestic
violence, Ms. Hendy wrote the judge in the case and asked him to
``please disregard these charges that I have made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry that I lied,'' she wrote. ``I have been in
counseling for manic depression.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also said she had lied before and was going to stop with her
counselor's help. ``I drink too much,'' she concluded, ``and that's
why I'm on medication.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Ray, Jo McClean, the manager of Earl's Shamrock, a gas
station and convenience store here, said he ``was just like any
other person who came here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McClean said Ray stopped at the store every weekday with 6
or 8 co-workers at the Elephant Butte State Park for doughnuts and
lunch supplies and she would give them free coffee. She described
him as ``very intelligent, clean-cut.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But on television, as he was being led off in handcuffs, she
said, ``he looks like a madman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McClean said that when she first met Ray in 1984 he was
married and that he told her that he had left a used car lot that
he owned in Arizona. Arizona and Texas are two of the other states
where federal agents are seeking clues to Ray's activities. She
said Ray left Elephant Butte in about 1987 and then returned in
1990 without a wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ray told her that he and his wife had divorced.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Butte seems an unlikely place for the arrival of what
is now an army of police officers. It is the kind of place where
people come to retire or to escape from the stress of other places.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Butte just became a city last year and is about halfway
between El Paso and Albuquerque, but the closest town with any
significant population is Truth or Consequences, with 6,200
residents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Grimm is one of four members of the Elephant Butte City
Council and he said that one reason the residents supported
cityhood was to control growth and to figure out how big the place
was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know the population,'' he said Thursday. ``We
think it's around 2,000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the population of Elephant Butte explodes with
boaters and on Memorial Day, Labor Day and the Fourth of July there
are as many as 80,000 people in town. ``I can't wait for this
investigation to be over,'' Grimm said. ``The place is full of
rumors and this is not a good way to get our city on the map.'' &QL;

 Gumshoes Stake Out the Workplace
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Move over, Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and Sam Spade.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of investigator has arrived in American workplaces _
outside professionals who are hired by companies to sleuth out the
truth of employee complaints about sexual harassment,
discrimination or embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sleuths are employment lawyers or private
investigators. Others are human resource consultants _ although a
little-known California law says that only those with private
investigator licenses should be doing this kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   There are no numbers available on how big this mini-industry is
becoming. But demand for outside investigators is clearly growing _
spurred by several state and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that stress
the importance of doing a thorough, unbiased investigation of
employee complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The routine bread-and-butter investigations are still being
done by in-house HR professionals, but we're now seeing a cottage
industry of outside experts who do more intense investigations,''
said Brian Ashe, an employment lawyer with Seyfarth, Shaw,
Fairweather &AMP; Geraldson in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole market area of outside investigations is growing,''
agreed David Durham, managing partner of the San Francisco office
of Littler Mendelson, an employment law firm. ``It's got to be one
of the bigger growth markets out there, either in the legal or
nonlegal field.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside investigators are typically hired to look into employee
complaints that could lead to major lawsuits or that are too
politically sensitive for an internal person to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Janie Jensen, a Santa Clara HR consultant who does
investigations, estimates that 70 percent of &LR;   &LR; her cases involve
sexual harassment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Scholick, a former partner at Littler Mendelson who opened
his own investigation firm last year, has looked into a variety of
cases:
</P>
<P>
   _A software saleswoman claimed that her manager raped her in her
hotel room at a trade show.
</P>
<P>
   _A low-level female employee at a startup firm complained about
constant sexual teasing by several managers and said they
retaliated against her when she wouldn't play along.
</P>
<P>
   _Several employees at a security service firm claimed that a
high-level executive in charge of computer purchases was taking
some of the equipment for her own personal use or resale.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 years ago, such complaints would probably have been
handled entirely by in-house HR people or the company's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising number of employment-related lawsuits over the
past decade led many companies to reassess their policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the landmark Cotran vs. Rollings Huding Hall decision in
January 1998, the California Supreme Court ruled that even if a
company came to the wrong conclusion in responding to harassment
charges, it could defend itself by showing the conclusion came out
of a reasonable and good-faith investigation. Several 1998 U.S.
Supreme Court decisions on sexual harassment cases made similar
points.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies figured that juries would be more likely to view
their investigations as reasonable and fair if they were done by
someone not on the firm's permanent payroll.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many law firms began shying away from doing
investigations for their clients: They feared a conflict of
interest if cases went to trial and they had to both argue the case
and testify as a witness about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Companies started hiring outside investigators, at
costs ranging from $100 to $300 per hour. The total bill for an
investigation can range from $3,000 to $30,000, depending on its
complexity _ and the cost often isn't covered by the company's
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   What's involved in a typical investigation?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators usually start by interviewing both the complainant
and the target of the complaint. Then they follow up by
interviewing potential witnesses and examining relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   They end by giving the company a written report that states, as
best they can determine it, what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigators stick to determining the facts. They rarely
tell the company how to respond, although sometimes they will
present a range of possible actions for the company to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The stories and evidence presented to investigators are often
confusing or contradictory. But they still feel obliged to come up
with some kind of a conclusion for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a sexual harassment claim to end up with
little more than `he-said, she-said,''' said Howard Simon, a lawyer
with Landels Ripley &AMP; Diamond who frequently does investigations.
``But you can learn things from people's body language, their eye
contact or their recall of specific details that have a bearing on
who you're going to believe. You really do have to make a
credibility determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Like more traditional detectives, employment-claim investigators
must contend with wily perpetrators who try to throw them off the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Pratt, an Alameda HR consultant who has been doing
investigations since 1986, recalls one sexual harassment case where
the accused employee made casual but calculated references to his
cousin, a famous sports figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was subtle, nothing overt, but it was an attempt to put
himself and me on the same male side dealing with these `whiny
females,''' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside investigators also must navigate the sometimes-fuzzy
boundary line between specific allegations of wrongdoing and
broader patterns of corporate mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run into trouble sometimes when there are different ideas
about the scope of the investigation,'' said Amy Oppenheimer, a
Berkeley attorney who does some sexual harassment investigations.
``Issues come up that the company doesn't want examined but I
really feel need to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with all this, good investigators need excellent
interpersonal skills and an understanding of human relations in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   They must also have a finely honed understanding of employment
law so they don't phrase their reports in a way that could
undermine a client's case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the legal knowledge needed, some investigators feel
that no one but lawyers should really be doing this work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is an HR person, quite frankly, there are a lot of
legal nuances they just miss,'' said Scholick.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people feel that the need for
interpersonal skills makes the job appropriate for anyone &LR;  but &LR; 
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little of what we investigate has to do with something
unlawful,'' said Pratt. ``More often, it's subtleties of
interpersonal relationships. And practicing law often doesn't give
people any experience in being in a functioning work unit, which
they need in order to understand these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of California actually has a law determining who can
do these kinds of outside investigations _ although few
practitioners are aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Consumer Affairs says that independent
investigators like Pratt are required to have private investigator
licenses unless they're lawyers. (HR professionals who are
employees of a firm don't need a license to do investigations
within their company.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are doing it on a contract basis, they absolutely need
to have a license,'' said Jay Van Rein, spokesman for the
department's Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. &UR;  &LR; Van
Rein said unlicensed investigators can face fines of several
thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But HR professionals who have been doing investigations for
years say they've never heard of this law _ or known they might be
in violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are attorneys out there who have been hiring us for
years and years, and they're probably not aware of that
requirement,'' said Jensen. ``I wasn't aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever heard of it,'' agreed Pratt,
``and I've been hired a half-dozen times by state agencies to do
these investigations.''

CHINA HESITATES, THEN CONFIRMS PREMIER'S VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Angered by the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia and renewed
attacks on China's human rights policies, senior Chinese officials
were seriously debating on Thursday whether Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji should postpone his visit to the United States, scheduled to
begin next week, said a Chinese person with knowledge of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But around midnight Thursday, the officials decided that Zhu
should proceed as planned, arriving in Los Angeles on Tuesday
before traveling on to Washington and other cities, the person
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both China and the Clinton administration have expressed hopes
that the visit by Zhu could help repair relations between the
countries. A postponement could add to the deep strains caused by
disputes over trade, American proposals for East Asian missile
defenses, and charges of nuclear espionage, as well as the NATO
bombing and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Zhu's visit was set off on Thursday at a
regularly scheduled foreign ministry press briefing when a
spokesman, Sun Yuxi, surprisingly refused to confirm the dates of
the supposedly imminent trip.
</P>
<P>
   Although the American government had already announced that Zhu
was visiting several cities from April 6 to 14, the Chinese
government had officially announced only that the trip would be in
April. Pressed by reporters, Sun would say only that he had
``nothing to add'' to earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the reticence at the news conference and other signs,
American Embassy officials here sent a cable to Washington
reporting that the Chinese appeared to be having second thoughts
about a visit next week, a senior American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Several issues had converged that would cause the Chinese to
reconsider the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials had hoped to see a breakthrough by now over
China's entry into the World Trade Organization. But it became
clear this week, after a period of intense negotiations, that China
had not yet satisfied American demands for the opening of its
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Clinton administration, under pressure from
Congress, recently announced that it would sponsor a resolution
this month to condemn China's human rights record at a U.N. meeting
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   China has reacted with special fury to the bombing in
Yugoslavia, which it portrays as an illegal act of intervention
inside a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did NATO countries bypass the U.N. Security Council,
where China holds a veto, but in the Chinese view the action also
sets a dangerous precedent. Officials here fear that it could be
used to justify foreign interventions in their own regions of
potential strife like Tibet and the predominantly Muslim province
of Xinjiang, or in Taiwan, which they consider a renegade province
of China.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese argued that it would be humiliating for Zhu to
visit the United States while the bombing continues, especially in
the absence of a trade deal that could cap the meetings in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled news media have painted an extremely
one-sided picture of the conflict in Kosovo, virtually ignoring
evidence of Yugoslav attacks on ethnic Albanians while broadcasting
on television scenes that cast the Serbs in a heroic light.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Only now, as a 53-year-old columnist, do
I appreciate the Easter celebration of my childhood.
 &HT;    Only now do I realize that, although it is the solemn day
commemorating Jesus' triumph over death and His gift to humankind
of eternal life, Easter for most black children in the South was a
time of camaraderie, fun and sweet innocence.
 &HT;    In fact, Easter was a day for children.
 &HT;    And, much like Christmas, half of the fun of Easter was the
activities during the days leading up to it, when our parents
bought, cooked and colored eggs, when lilies were collected. For us
children these were days of excitement and, most importantly, of
going with our parents to shop for new outfits.
 &HT;    We did not see the symbolism _ spring, starting anew _ in buying
new clothes. The boys knew that Easter meant a new black and often
ill-fitting suit, complete with a new white shirt, a new black hat,
and a new skinny black tie. Why black? I think it had something to
do with looking grownup, like replicas of the men in our lives
whose Sunday suits were black. Whatever the reason, we looked like
waiters. More accurately, I know now that we looked like the Blues
Brothers.
 &HT;    And I recall that a group of us would stand around outside the
church, quietly talking trash and lying about our female conquests,
our hands stuffed deeply in our pants pockets, our hats cocked to
one side. And we flirted with the girls _ if they passed without
their parents. It was the ``cool pose'' long before the term was
coined. If the morning was hot, we sweated inside our black suits.
But we did not care. We were having a good time.
 &HT;    The fun would end, though, when an adult, usually a man smiling
knowingly, told us to come inside for service, an event that, to
us, went on interminally.
 &HT;    And the girls? How beautiful they were in their new outfits,
their crinoline-flared, bright-colored dresses. I remember the new
hairdos that made them look so fresh and radiant, their smart
pocketbooks or handkerchiefs in which their money was tied in a
knot.
 &HT;    Like the Resurrection itself, girls were a transcendent mystery.
 &HT;    I asked Jounice L. Nealy, a colleague at the St. Petersburg
Times, what Easter meant to the girls at the time.
 &HT;    She remembers well. ``The excitement of my new school clothes
had long worn off, and even the Christmas gifts were getting a
little old. Oh, but then came Easter. And the hunt was on ....
 &HT;    ``My Easter shoes were always shiny and white, usually with a
strap across the foot. This was usually the time when my Mom
talked, complained, about how much my foot was growing. And, of
course, after we got home, she had to keep me out of those shoes so
I wouldn't scuff them before Sunday.
 &HT;    ``Then there was the dress, which had to be pretty to me. One
year my mom was so excited about a bonnet she bought for me. She
was equally disappointed when I refused to wear it.
 &HT;    ``Mrs. Bell Rogers would wash and press my hair with a
straightening comb, then twirl candy curls on Easter eve. Again,
Mom fussed Saturday night if I played too hard with my big brother.
She did not want me to mess up my curls. When I got in fifth grade,
I got a perm, and Easter became less tense,'' she recollects.
 &HT;    In Crescent City, Fla., where I spent much of my childhood,
Easter afternoon was an oratorical festival, when select children _
I was never among them _ marched to the front of the church and
delivered narratives or poems, some quite inspiring, written for
the ocassion. If a boy made a mistake or forgot some of his lines,
his buddies would fight for dear life to hold back their mirth.
Some of us would give in to the hilarity, of course, causing most
of the congregation to join in the laughter. The victim, always
good-natured, would start over.
 &HT;    For some reason, we never laughed at a girl who stumbled.
 &HT;    My colleague Jounice said that she and her childhood friends
also suffered the pain of the Easter speech. But Jounice and
company did not write their own speeches. ``Easter afternoons
always brought a sigh of relief. Weeks before, either Mrs. Durham
or Mrs. Smith had given us our Easter speeches. Somehow the
speeches my brother and I got always seemed to be the longest. And
we had to memorize our lines and rehearse at the church on
Saturdays.
 &HT;    ``On Easter morning, it was a matter of remembering all the
details: entering the stage from one side, walking to the piece of
tape on the floor, speaking right into the microphone and
remembering all of your lines. And, if I forgot to curtsy, Mrs.
Durham would yell from the audience and remind me,'' she recalls.
 &HT;    When our church service finally ended in the late afternoon, the
real fun began: We would dash home, trade our new duds for regular
clothes and return to the church for the communitywide Easter egg
hunt. We, the boys, would romp and tussle and, when the adults were
not watching, throw eggs at one another. If we mistakenly hit a
girl with one of these missiles, all hell broke loose, as it were,
and the perpetrator was spirited away for a whipping.
 &HT;    After that, order would be restored among the boys, who quietly
snickered and whispered about the poor sucker who got punished.
 &HT;    Later, the entire congregation would enjoy dinner on the
grounds, where tables would be ladened with the best soul food
imaginable. In the evening, we would dress and return to church,
where music would shake the rafters, where the minister would
invoke the spirit of ``He who died on the cross for our sins, who
resurrected and went to heaven to be with his Father.''
 &HT;    All the while, we boys sat _ sullen and anxious _ perspiring and
itching inside our new black suits. Occasionally, someone would
snore. An adult would march over to the miscreant, shake him awake
and point a warning finger in his face. The rest of us would again
struggle to hold back the laughter.
 &HT;    The alert among us sensed exactly when the preacher came to the
part about holy sepulcher and the ascension. At this point, about
9:00 p.m., we knew that soon we'd be going home for the night.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a boy of 8, Easter Sunday meant three things to me:
My mother bought a big white hat to wear to church; it always
seemed to rain that day; and, every year we had a delicious ham
baked under a blanket of pineapple rings. I don't know why we had
ham on Easter Sunday and I don't know why pineapple rings. It
didn't matter; it was a terrific dinner.
 &HT;    The rain always bugged me, for it rains hardly at all in San
Diego. So, why the rain on Easter Sunday? The reason was simple. On
the greatest day of the Christian calendar, the day all life is
renewed, the rain came because the buses hardly ran and my mother
and I had to walk four miles in the downpour to and from Our Lady
of Sacred Heart. Of course it would rain on my mother's new hat!
 &HT;    Easter of 1950 brought a stepfather from central Texas who knew
ham, but pineapple was out of his universe. Not being a Roman
Catholic didn't help him understand why it was so important for us
to be at church on Easter Sunday, but then again, I didn't know
either. Not speaking Latin didn't help. But the Irish priest
managed to explain it to us, despite his brogue being so strong
half of the congregation _ the English-speaking half _ could barely
understand him.
 &HT;    At least, we wouldn't have to walk to and from church anymore _
I thought. Wrong! Rookie cops have to work on Sundays, especially
Easter Sundays, and my stepdad was a cop. It rained that Easter. My
mother's big white hat, almost as big as her umbrella, got wet.
During Mass, I prayed my mother would learn to drive before next
Easter. She didn't.
 &HT;    Easter of 1951 arrived on schedule with low-hanging rain-filled
clouds and the driver of the house having to work. My mother still
didn't know how to drive. This time I had to push a stroller with
my new brother all the way to church and back. Have you ever tried
to push a stroller in a light rain and hold an umbrella at the same
time?
 &HT;    Finally, in 1952, I was able to ride in a car to Easter service.
It didn't rain that day. I still couldn't understand the priest.
But after mass he pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to be an
altar boy. Of course! Of course, I wanted to be an altar boy. I
figured I would be able to understand him because he would have to
speak to me in Latin and that was easier than my learning Irish. I
had to be confirmed first, for a Catholic boy wasn't really
Catholic until he was confirmed.
 &HT;    Confirmation classes were after school, so my days got longer
and longer. I had to study my confirmation lesson book in school
and on the bus on the way to class. There, I learned about Easter.
The priest told me, ``on the Third day He arose from the dead'' and
ascended to heaven. Really? I was 11. Wow, I thought, that Jesus
was really something; he had to be the Son of God, without a doubt.
 &HT;    No wonder Easter is the most important day of the year. The
proof had to be the ham we had on that day, the only time we ever
had ham. Ham cost a lot of money then, a lot of money to us before
my stepdad joined the family with his $300-a-month police officer's
salary. It was very special. The day we had it, had to be a very
special day.
 &HT;    By 1954, I had three younger brothers. When we went to church,
Mother dressed them all exactly alike, complete with bow ties. I
didn't have to wear a bow tie, even on Easter. It was that 1954
Easter that we invited the whole family for Easter dinner. We had
three hams that time. There must not have been a pineapple left in
Hawaii. Everyone had such a good time; the family decided Easter
would be celebrated at our house the next year and the year after
that.
 &HT;    And so it went every year. A beautiful ham, pineapples, mashed
potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, corn, refried beans and
Spanish rice made our Easter dinner. What? Refried beans and
Spanish rice? Well, except for my stepdad, we are Mexican, you
know.
 &HT;    The Easter after I came home from the U.S. Marines, perhaps, is
the most memorable of my life. I had re-enrolled in college and was
working at a new Safeway grocery store in the city's first major
shopping mall. The day before Easter, I went to work and was told
by the smiling store manager to report to the mall office for the
day's work. OK, I said.
 &HT;    At the mall office, the pretty receptionist giggled when she saw
me and called her boss. He laughed as he shook my hand and led me
into his office. There sat a large white bunny rabbit suit;
complete with ears almost two feet high. I stared at it. It was my
size.
 &HT;    It was a great and happy Easter that year. The family dinner was
a riot of laughter. After all, how many families could celebrate
life's renewal and the Ascension with a real live 6-foot-tall
Easter Bunny in their midst?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a boy of 8, Easter Sunday meant three things to me:
My mother bought a big white hat to wear to church; it always
seemed to rain that day; and, every year we had a delicious ham
baked under a blanket of pineapple rings. I don't know why we had
ham on Easter Sunday and I don't know why pineapple rings. It
didn't matter; it was a terrific dinner.
 &HT;    The rain always bugged me, for it rains hardly at all in San
Diego. So, why the rain on Easter Sunday? The reason was simple. On
the greatest day of the Christian calendar, the day all life is
renewed, the rain came because the buses hardly ran and my mother
and I had to walk four miles in the downpour to and from Our Lady
of Sacred Heart. Of course it would rain on my mother's new hat!
 &HT;    Easter of 1950 brought a stepfather from central Texas who knew
ham, but pineapple was out of his universe. Not being a Roman
Catholic didn't help him understand why it was so important for us
to be at church on Easter Sunday, but then again, I didn't know
either. Not speaking Latin didn't help. But the Irish priest
managed to explain it to us, despite his brogue being so strong
half of the congregation _ the English-speaking half _ could barely
understand him.
 &HT;    At least, we wouldn't have to walk to and from church anymore _
I thought. Wrong! Rookie cops have to work on Sundays, especially
Easter Sundays, and my stepdad was a cop. It rained that Easter. My
mother's big white hat, almost as big as her umbrella, got wet.
During Mass, I prayed my mother would learn to drive before next
Easter. She didn't.
 &HT;    Easter of 1951 arrived on schedule with low-hanging rain-filled
clouds and the driver of the house having to work. My mother still
didn't know how to drive. This time I had to push a stroller with
my new brother all the way to church and back. Have you ever tried
to push a stroller in a light rain and hold an umbrella at the same
time?
 &HT;    Finally, in 1952, I was able to ride in a car to Easter service.
It didn't rain that day. I still couldn't understand the priest.
But after mass he pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to be an
altar boy. Of course! Of course, I wanted to be an altar boy. I
figured I would be able to understand him because he would have to
speak to me in Latin and that was easier than my learning Irish. I
had to be confirmed first, for a Catholic boy wasn't really
Catholic until he was confirmed.
 &HT;    Confirmation classes were after school, so my days got longer
and longer. I had to study my confirmation lesson book in school
and on the bus on the way to class. There, I learned about Easter.
The priest told me, ``on the Third day He arose from the dead'' and
ascended to heaven. Really? I was 11. Wow, I thought, that Jesus
was really something; he had to be the Son of God, without a doubt.
 &HT;    No wonder Easter is the most important day of the year. The

 &HT;    
 &HT;    For most people Easter conjures up two images: the religious and
the commercial.
 &HT;    For Catholics and Protestants Easter is the highest of high holy
days. OK, Christmas is also big with Christians, but it doesn't
always fall on Sunday and after all it is a birthday party.
 &HT;    And commercially, Easter has chocolate rabbits, colored and
decorated eggs which are either placed in baskets or hidden in
lawns for children to find. There is the Easter Bunny who, although
pales in comparison to Santa Claus at Christmas, still reigns over
the holiday.
 &HT;    Easter, however, is normally not thought of as a particularly
political scenario. However, two events one current and one
occurring more than 35 years ago, illustrate how political Easter
can be.
 &HT;    The first occurred in Huntsville, Alabama circa 1962. Much of
the country, Huntsville included, were in the grips of various
forms of racial segregation.
 &HT;    My family, like most other black families, celebrated Easter
both religiously and commercially. The religious side consisted
mainly, no, exclusively, of going to church. Folks went to church
who would normally not attend on any other Sunday. The commercial
side of Easter included the baskets, cards, egg-hiding parties and
Easter egg hunts.
 &HT;    But the big commercial impact of the holiday was the purchasing
and donning of Easter outfits for church. It was spring, and we
always got new clothes in which to parade around on Easter Sunday.
There was a great deal of excitement and discussion about your
clothes on Easter. It was almost as if the Easter outfit was
reserved for that sole occasion.
 &HT;    But now a new perspective _ a political one _ dramatically
affected Easter 1962: no one bought new clothes. We all wore blue
jeans to church as part of an organized economic boycott of the
segregated stores in town. The protest was organized by Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. It was both a visible and economic display of
disgust at segregation on not only the holiest of holidays among
Christians, but also the holiday on which African Americans spent
the most money.
 &HT;    Now the year is 1999 and I have moved to the city by the bay,
Oakland, right across the bridge from San Francisco. Now there is
another political action taking place on Easter. Easter 1999 is the
20th anniversary of a gay lesbian bisexual and transgender group of
people who call themselves the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The
Sisters, though small in number _ around 15 _ wanted to celebrate
their anniversary as they have in the past, with a rally on the
streets of the predominately gay neighborhood in San Francisco
known as the Castro.
 &HT;    The Sisters, mainly cross-dressing gay men, dress in nuns'
habits and appear in ``white face.'' They have names like Sister
Reyna Terror and Sister Ann R. Key. In the past they have held
``hunky Jesus contests'' and other such mocking activities. In
addition to their annual Easter parade and rally they also raise
money for charities. But this year because of the power of
newsletters and e-mail in this the information age, many
Christians, particularly Catholics, protested against the Sisters
getting a permit for their Easter parade and rally.
 &HT;    The Sisters prevailed in a 9-2 vote of the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors and have been granted their permit. Catholic
organizations and activists opposing the event state that they are
neither intolerant nor homophobic. These celebrations would be
fine, they say, if they were held on any other Sunday. But they see
Easter Sunday as holy and sacred and certainly beyond ridicule.
Protesters are threatening to boycott the city and county of San
Francisco by not holding conventions there.
 &HT;    Even though the two events are different and almost 40 years
apart, I'm sure most think Easter is not an appropriate time for
protest or rallies of any sort. I was proud to participate in that
`blue jeans' Easter Sunday when I was a child.
 &HT;    I'm not a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and I do
understand why some Catholic groups are upset. However, we do live
in a nation where for the most part freedom of religion and speech
are upheld. Regardless of whether one agrees with the message or
the messengers.
 &HT;    Easter is Easter, and my childhood political Easter looms large
in my memories. Politics and religion can and do mix.
 &HT;    Happy Easter!

 &HT;    Only yesterday I was in my late 40s, still fooling myself that
life was infinite. Then, the future was mine to plan; now, the
future is making plans for me. And now that my seventh decade looms
nearer, I realize that tomorrow may never come.
 &HT;    What happened? Where did she go _ the person who ran off with
time? Who is the new acquaintance inhabiting my old skin?
 &HT;    Perhaps each of us is merely a series of strangers.
 &HT;    Why does each new me disappear just as I start to know her?
 &HT;    Half a century ago, I knew exactly what I wanted for my
birthday. I never thought to wish for a long and healthy life or
parents who live forever or lasting world peace. Instead, when I
was 6, I pined for a Storybook Doll.
 &HT;    Actually, I wanted every single one in the Nancy Ann Storybook
Doll display at Barden's Department Store: Little Betty Blue, Polly
Put the Kettle On, Daffy Down Dilly and One, Two Button my Shoe _
all of them and more.
 &HT;    My nose to the case in the girls' section on the second floor, I
prayed that Mother would get lost in the nearby notions department.
I could never tire of gazing at the 5 1/2 inch beauties, I told
myself. If my parents really loved me, why wouldn't they want to
give me all those polka dot boxes, each one filled with a
diminutive doll in a dainty outfit?
 &HT;    Ginny Vincent seemed to have half the collection lined up on her
bedroom shelves. If I owned that many dolls, I thought, I'd never
want for anything else. I promised myself when I grew up, I'd go
back to Barden's and buy every one _ even the display case, lights
and all.
 &HT;    In the era before Barbie, cars had fewer flat tires and the milk
was delivered by a horse-drawn wagon. Ladies wore hats, as did
well-dressed gentlemen, while girls covered their heads with
babushkas on a cold March day.
 &HT;    Our school desks still bore the holes for long-forgotten ink
bottles, while our classrooms bore the holes of missing students.
 &HT;    Though young, we knew about polio and tuberculosis and an iron
lung machine. Our homes sometimes displayed ``QUARANTINE'' signs in
the windows and received visiting nurses.
 &HT;    When we dreamed about Storybook Dolls, though, we escaped that
world of terror. When we received one of the dolls, we were
transported.
 &HT;    Yet, after the ribbon and wrapping paper were off and the lid
was removed, after we and our birthday guests had oohed and aahed,
we faced a conflict: whether to leave the cellophane seal intact.
 &HT;    I could forever preserve my porcelain doll like a sleeping Snow
White. Still, in the end, after listening to the urgings of my
friends and my inner self, I'd rip off the transparent covering and
seize my new toy.
 &HT;    My hands couldn't resist touching her bisque face, moving her
jointed arms, playing with her lovely hair _ and putting her in a
pocket.
 &HT;    My travels left her scruffy and worse for wear _ flowers fallen
from her hair, a wrinkled dress _ but oh, the adventures we had.
 &HT;    Now some 50 years later, the memory of a Storybook Doll still
hovers: it reminds me that having the experiences, even the
mistakes, is better than remaining intact, never taking risks.
 &HT;    Did I ever receive all the dolls? No, only a few.
 &HT;    Today, even if I wanted to keep my childhood promise and collect
them in one fell swoop, I couldn't find them to buy. Other dolls
are sold, of course, but not those dolls _ all new and lined up in
a case at Barden's. In fact, the store no longer exists.
 &HT;    Nor does the girl who used to dream there.

 &HT;    Facts of officer's fatal shooting elude police
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Police were still trying to figure out on Thursday why
a traffic stop, where an Atlanta cop tried to help a stranded
motorist, ended in the death of one of his fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell ``Rusty'' Stalnaker, a well-liked officer in the Zone
Five mini-precinct downtown, was shot to death doing what he did
best _ trying to help another cop.
</P>
<P>
   Stalnaker, 24, was prounounced dead at 8:01 p.m. on Wednesday at
Grady Memorial Hospital. He received four gunshout wounds from a
9mm handgun, police said. The fatal bullet hit the three-year
veteran in the head; three others lodged in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   A shroud of sadness and disbelief fell over the Atlanta Police
Department on Thursday as dozens of officers _ from Police Chief
Beverly Harvard to the greenest recruit _ asked themselves what
could have made the shooter, identified as Kimani Atu Archie, also
24, get violent with police. Archie is being held in jail, charged
with killing Stalnaker.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, an emotional Harvard, whose eyes brimmed with tears,
recounted the events that began at about 7 p.m. at the intersection
of Pine and Linden streets.
</P>
<P>
   Officer J. Daigle encountered Archie pushing a pickup truck.
Daigle asked Archie if he needed help, even offering to call a tow
truck for him, said Harvard and Lt. Debbie Reese, Stalnaker's
direct supervisor. When Archie firmly refused, Daigle drove away
only to come across Archie a few minutes later at the corner of
Spring and Pine streets.
</P>
<P>
   This time Archie became belligerent, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer told him he could cause an accident and then
called a wrecker,'' Harvard said. ``When the officer saw that
Archie was getting into his truck and would not come out, the
officer then called for back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalnaker and officers J. Price and M. Wiskermann responded,
Reese said. When the officers arrived and confronted Archie, he
began struggling and scuffling with the officers, Harvard and Reese
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archie pulled out a handgun and fired at the officers first,''
Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   As officers returned fire, Archie jumped into a patrol car
parked nearby and sped away toward Peachtree Street, police said.
He abandoned the car and ran to the parking lot of St. Luke's
Episcopal Church at the corner of Peachtree and Pine streets. There
he attempted to steal a woman's car. Rebecca Parker, a St. Luke's
parishioner, said she was that woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started screaming,'' said Parker, 44, director of continuing
education at Columbia Theological Seminary. ``Then he pulled me out
of the car and threw me onto the concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the man then jumped into her car and grabbed her purse.
Realizing she was under the car and fearing she was about to get
run over, Parker scrambled to her feet and ran. As she looked up,
she saw the church security guard and began yelling.
</P>
<P>
   When she turned, Parker said she saw the man run into the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Spenser Simrill, rector of St. Luke's, said he was
sitting in the back of the church with regular worshipers when the
suspect barrelled through the door. It was dark, because the church
was lighted with only candles for the service, but Simrill said the
man did not appear to be wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running pretty good,'' Simrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Simrill got up and joined the security guard in pursuing Archie
down the brick-paved center aisle of the church. There was a table
full of candles about 15 paces in front of the altar. Archie veered
to the right around the table, spotted a doorway, and ran through
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped out of the door and said 'I want sanctuary,' ``
Simrill recalled Thursday. ``I held him,'' Simrill said,
demonstrating a simple embrace rather than any kind of restraining
hold, ``trying to calm him down. I didn't want to escalate this
thing. But I wasn't about to let him go, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Simrill said the suspect also asked for water, which he was
given by parishioners who came back to see what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, Simrill said, ``They kept asking, 'Where's
the gun? Where's the gun?''' The guy told them, `It's in the
car.'''
</P>
<P>
   Archie, originally from Pennsylvania, appeared briefly in
Municipal Court, dressed in a bright red Atlanta corrections
uniform, shackled from head to toe. His face was partially covered
with a mask resembling that worn by a beekeeper. The suspect's
arraingment was rescheduled for April 28 at 4:30 p.m. so that he
would have the opportunity to hire an attorney, police said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 Atlanta officers huddled together in the wooden
pews in Courtroom 3 at the Municipal courthouse in a show of
solidarity for the slain officer. They stared intently at Archie
when he shuffled out of the holding area escorted by two guards.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday whether Archie was intoxicated with
drugs or alcohol when the incident occurred Wednesday night.
Harvard said that was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Georgia Department of Corrections, who keep a
hefty file on Archie for a handful of misdemeanor violations going
back as far as 1994 in Fulton, Cobb and DeKalb counties, were
surprised he acted so violently. However, records from Metro-Dade
Police in South Florida showed Archie was charged with battering a
police officer in 1993 when another traffic stop in Miami went
awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a shock because there was never anything in his
probation file that would have indicated any violence towards
anyone,'' said Larry Anderson, director of the probation unit at
Corrections. ``A person who has been convicted of misdemeanor
offenses is not the one you would expect would do this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictible or not, Lt. G.W. Pierce, a 40-year Atlanta police
veteran and the officer with the most years of service in the city,
said some things are still hard to accept. ``I've been here a long
time and you never get used to seeing one of your own killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Atlanta police Maj. John Woodard, commander of
the Zone 5 precinct, was busy establishing a fund for Stalnaker's
widow, Dana, a schoolteacher in Henry County. The account will be
opened at NationsBank; anyone interested in donating should call
404-658-7054, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl is devastated,'' Woodard said Thursday night. ``We
want to try to help her as much as we can. She's been left on her
own.

 &HT;    Bill Lann Lee deserves to be the assistant attorney general for
civil rights. The former NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer has been
holding the top civil rights post in an ``acting'' capacity ever
since late 1997, but President Clinton recently re-submitted his
name to a hostile Senate in another effort at confirmation of his
choice.
 &HT;    Everybody agrees Lee is better than qualified. He spent 20 years
at the Legal Defense Fund. This branch of the NAACP is the
non-profit group which, under the guidance of the late Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, brought about the end of
segregation.
 &HT;    Nobody suggests that Lee has the type of personal problems which
have affected other nominees. He is so well-regarded that even his
adversaries in lawsuits, such as Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
have endorsed him.
 &HT;    Instead, the attacks on Lee are about a single issue:
affirmative action. Washington lawyer Clint Bolick, an advocate
against those racial remedies as well as all anti-discrimination
legislation, is pursuing Lee with the same zealous inaccuracy that
he used in defeating Lani Guinier for the same job a few years ago.
With help from former Attorney General Edwin Meese, Bolick asserts
that Lee is ``defying the rule of law.''
 &HT;    Bolick is wrong about the law. Furthermore, he is asking
senators to abuse the confirmation process.
 &HT;    To be sure, the Supreme Court is highly skeptical of affirmative
action. It has directed the lower courts to apply stringent
standards in reviewing the programs.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, like Congress and a majority of the public, the
courts have recognized that in exceptional circumstances addressing
racism may require taking into account race. The former presidents
of Princeton and Harvard Universities recently published a
book-length study, entitled ``The Shape of the River,'' offering
copious evidence that affirmative action has been effective in
college admissions. Their work makes it all the more important to
seek compromise on this contentious matter.
 &HT;    As would be expected, Lee agrees with the long-standing White
House policy of ``mend it, don't end it.''
 &HT;    Of course, Bolick and his colleagues have their own arguments.
They ought to make their case in the courts and in Congress or
through ballot initiatives. Perhaps they will prevail through
democratic debate.
 &HT;    However, it doesn't help society resolve persistent problems of
bias and prejudice if one side insists that their opposition lacks
principles. It is absurd, as a few have done, to compare Lee with
someone who believes in Jim Crow.
 &HT;    The anti-Lee campaign continues an unfortunate trend of making
the Senate ``advise and consent'' privilege a partisan contest. The
Senate plays an important role on high-level executive branch
appointments. It isn't supposed to block presidential decisions and
hold up good candidates to show its power though.
 &HT;    During the initial controversy over Lee, former assistant
attorney generals under Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson,
Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Bush wrote an open letter observing, ``if
the test for confirmation is whether a nominee shares the views of
the Senate,'' then the Civil Rights division ``could well have gone
without a confirmed leader during the administrations in which we
served.''
 &HT;    Ironically, Lee symbolizes the success of affirmative action. He
is the son of Chinese immigrants who operated a Harlem hand
laundry. He benefited from a scholarship program for racial
minorities, opening the doors to Yale, from which he graduated
magna cum laude.
 &HT;    As the first individual who is neither black nor white to be
selected for this position, Lee signals that everyone has a stake
in the civil rights movement. As an Asian American representing the
Legal Defense Fund, he gave meaning to the metaphor of ``building
bridges.''
 &HT;    Both before joining the Justice Department and now as one of its
officials, his clients have included people of all identities. The
hallmark of his approach has been resolving difficult disputes
through settlements helping all parties. He demonstrates how
diversity can work.
 &HT;    If the Senate says yes to Lee, it will not only benefit the
people whose civil rights he would protect, but also restore public
faith in the political system.

 &HT;    Bill Lann Lee deserves to be the assistant attorney general for
civil rights. The former NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer has been

   EASTER MEANT FUN, SWEET INNOCENCE _ AND NEW CLOTHES. Although
Easter Sunday is the solemn day commemorating Jesus' triumph over
death and His gift to humankind of eternal life, notes columnist
Bill Maxwell, for most black children in the South it was a time of
fun and sweet innocence. ``Boys knew that Easter meant a new black
and often ill-fitting suit, complete with white shirt, black hat,
and skinny black tie,'' he writes. ``We looked like waiters. More
accurately, I know now, we looked like the Blues Brothers!'' But,
however uncomfortable they were in their new outfits, it was a time
of showing off, flirting with the girls in their pretty new
dresses, and consuming the best soul food imaginable, he says.

   EASTER MEMORIES: MOM'S BIG HAT, RAIN AND THE BEST HAM ON EARTH.
When he was a boy of 8, Easter Sunday meant three things: His
mother's new big white hat for church; rain; and, a delicious ham
baked under a blanket of pineapple rings for dinner, recalls
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``The rain always bugged me, for
it rains hardly at all in San Diego.'' So, why the rain on Easter
Sunday? ``On the greatest day of the Christian calendar, the day
all life is renewed, the reason for the rain was simple,'' he
writes. ``It was because the buses hardly ran and my mother and I
had to walk four miles in the downpour to and from Our Lady of
Sacred Heart. Of course it would rain on my mother's new hat!''

she writes. Read how disgust with segregation, and a boycott
organized by Martin Luther King Jr., made the Easter of 1962 highly
political and one to cherish, and how a gay San Francisco parade,
however controversial, is making the Easter of '99 an affirmation
of freedom of religion and speech.

   EASTER MEANT FUN, SWEET INNOCENCE _ AND NEW CLOTHES. Although
Easter Sunday is the solemn day commemorating Jesus' triumph over
death and His gift to humankind of eternal life, notes columnist
Bill Maxwell, for most black children in the South it was a time of
fun and sweet innocence. ``Boys knew that Easter meant a new black
and often ill-fitting suit, complete with white shirt, black hat,
and skinny black tie,'' he writes. ``We looked like waiters. More
accurately, I know now, we looked like the Blues Brothers!'' But,
however uncomfortable they were in their new outfits, it was a time
of showing off, flirting with the girls in their pretty new
dresses, and consuming the best soul food imaginable, he says.

   EASTER MEMORIES: MOM'S BIG HAT, RAIN AND THE BEST HAM ON EARTH.
When he was a boy of 8, Easter Sunday meant three things: His
mother's new big white hat for church; rain; and, a delicious ham
baked under a blanket of pineapple rings for dinner, recalls
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``The rain always bugged me, for
it rains hardly at all in San Diego.'' So, why the rain on Easter
Sunday? ``On the greatest day of the Christian calendar, the day
all life is renewed, the reason for the rain was simple,'' he
writes. ``It was because the buses hardly ran and my mother and I
had to walk four miles in the downpour to and from Our Lady of
Sacred Heart. Of course it would rain on my mother's new hat!''

   WHERE DID SHE GO _ THE PERSON WHO RAN OFF WITH TIME? Only
yesterday I was in my late 40s, still fooling myself that life was
infinite, muses columnist Kirsten Chapman. Then ... What happened?
Where did she go _ the person who ran off with time? ``Who is the
new acquaintance inhabiting my old skin?'' she wonders. Perhaps
each of us is merely a series of strangers. ``Why does each new me
disappear just as I start to know her?'' she asks. Half a century
ago, she knew exactly what she wanted for her birthday. She pined
for a Storybook Doll. ``But now ... the dolls, and the store where
I used to gaze at them, no longer exist. Nor does the girl who used
to dream there,'' she realizes wistfully.

 Sam Spade Takes on the Workplace
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Employment investigators see the seamy side of work life:
harassment, discrimination, office politics and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, they get to clear up misunderstandings and
help improve working conditions. Here are summaries of three recent
investigations handled by attorney Gary Scholick of Independent
Employment Counsel in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Trade-show rape claim.  &LR; A saleswoman at a software firm went
to a trade show where, she claimed, one of her firm's managers
accompanied her back to her hotel room after an evening of drinking
and raped her. The saleswoman called the police the following
morning, and they arrested the executive.
</P>
<P>
   Scholick was hired within a week to find out the facts for the
company, which wanted its own independent assessment of the
charges. His conclusion? ``It was an unwelcome sexual event. ... I
made a finding of what happened, and then said the company should
discuss the situation with its lawyers.'' He doesn't know if
criminal charges have been filed against the manager, but he's
expecting that his papers on the case will eventually be subpoenaed
as evidence in a civil suit or criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Sexual harassment and retaliation claim.  &LR; A low-level employee
at a startup said she was subjected to unwelcome sexual teasing
from several managers. She also claimed they retaliated against her
by giving her bad assignments. Scholick found that the woman's
claims about the teasing were accurate. ``It took me back to the
'60s or early '70s: The guys almost treated this woman as a
plaything,'' he said. But he didn't find any basis to her
retaliation claim. What happened, Scholick found, was that there
were genuine problems with the woman's work performance that no one
had mentioned to her. When she was denied good assignments, she
assumed it was retaliation _ but it was really performance-related.
``After the investigation, she came around and saw that it wasn't
retaliatory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Equipment theft claim.  &LR; Several employees of a security
service firm wrote anonymous notes saying that a top executive in
charge of computer acquisitions was buying more equipment than was
needed and taking some of it for her own use. Scholick found that
the executive was indeed ordering some equipment that appeared to
be excessive, such as electronic games. And some equipment was
indeed delivered to the executive's home. ``She couldn't answer
questions about why it was delivered to her house, and just said,
`I don't remember,''' Scholick said. Scholick's personal conclusion
was that something was amiss _ but the company disagreed. ``There
was a disagreement between what I believed was happening and what
the company believed was happening,'' he said. Ultimately, the
executive submitted a voluntary resignation.

 Column: When a Good Worker Has a Bad Attitude
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have a small business and one of my employees does his
job better than anyone I've ever seen. He's fast and efficient.
However, he has a bad attitude toward other employees and sometimes
customers. He has also made comments to another employee that he
may leave the company and take some clients with him. I would like
this person to stay with the company, but not with his current
attitude. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Have you voiced any of your criticisms directly to
this employee? If not, it's high time to sit down and have a
serious talk. Let him know how much you appreciate his strengths.
Then explain the problems you see _ and focus on specific comments
or actions rather than making general complaints about his
``attitude.'' Lay out some specific steps he can take to improve,
and set a timetable for follow-up reviews.
</P>
<P>
   You should make very clear to him that teamwork and customer
service are an essential part of his job. But that leads to a
second question.
</P>
<P>
   Have you made crystal clear to all your employees that you
really  &LR; do  &LR; value teamwork and customer service? And do those
values show up in your actions as well as your words _ in parceling
out raises or bonuses, for instance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask yourself if you've really articulated your values,
demonstrated them yourself ... and set up a system where people are
publicly acknowledged for meeting those standards,'' said Jim
Kouzes, a Palo Alto management expert and author of ``The
Leadership Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's return to your immediate problem. If you're worried
that this guy may jump ship and pull your clients with him, take
some preventive action. ``This owner may personally need to go
spend some time with clients, to make sure they're identifying with
the company, not the individual employee,'' Kouzes said.
</P>
<P>
   If this fellow won't shape up, you may have to fire him. Don't
feel intimidated: Your firm will survive without his skills. In
fact, it may even do better without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just as soon deal with a lesser-skilled individual with a
good attitude than a higher-skilled one with a bad attitude,'' said
Donna Shepherd, human resources director at the San Francisco
Marriott. ``The damage to teamwork that comes from a bad attitude
can outweigh all the positive attributes that someone brings to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Language Rights
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two of my co-workers have been told by our employer not to
speak to each other in Spanish. What are the rights of the employer
and employee around this issue?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Employers are generally not allowed to have broad
English-only rules that ban all use of other languages at work,
according to Marielena Hincapi &LR; e &LR; , a project attorney with the
Employment Law Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the courts have ruled that blanket English-only
rules amount to illegal discrimination on the basis of national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   But companies  &LR; can  &LR; have narrower English-only rules that govern
certain work situations, if there's a genuine business reason.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, retail stores can require salespeople to talk to
English-speaking customers in English. And firms can require
meetings to be held in English, if there are English-speaking
employees who otherwise wouldn't understand what was being said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say there's a workplace like an oil refinery where there
are safety concerns, with people shouting orders back and forth
that everyone needs to understand,'' Hincapi &LR; e &LR;  said. ``That's a
situation where an English-only rule might be considered a business
necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers impose broad English-only rules for reasons of
workforce morale: They fear that English-speaking employees will
feel left out and resentful if their colleagues chat in Spanish,
Mandarin or Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   But such employers should think twice. The courts have said that
fears about morale aren't enough to justify an English-only policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an English-only rule is simply to please customers or
co-workers, it's not considered a business necessity,'' Hincapi &LR; e &LR; 
said. ``So it probably wouldn't be legal.''
</P>
<P>
   More questions about English-only rules? The Employment Law
Center has a free language-rights hotline: Call (800) 864-1664.
</P>
<P>
   Clerical Error
</P>
<P>
   Q: A month ,ago my company gave me a letter of promotion that
said I'd be getting a raise of $200 a week. Last week, I received
my paycheck with only a $14.92 addition to my original salary
amount, so I questioned it. Now the boss is saying that I received
the wrong letter because of a clerical mistake. He says that
although I got the promotion, I am only getting a $14 raise. Was
that letter a binding contract?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I hope you didn't go out and buy a new car counting on
that extra $200: You're pretty much stuck with the $14 raise.
</P>
<P>
   Even in binding contracts, the law allows the parties to correct
mistakes _ and it sounds like this was an honest mistake.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the letter promising you the raise most likely
wouldn't have been considered a legal contract, according to Alan
Exelrod, who represents employees with Rudy Exelrod Zieff &AMP; True in
San Francisco. ``It was a unilateral statement, not a binding
contract,'' Exelrod said.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal wage laws do require employers to pay
employees all the money they've been promised for time they've
actually worked. For example, companies can't hire people at $8 an
hour, make them work for 40 hours, and then tell them, ``Sorry,
we're only paying you $6 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   So you might have a valid claim to that extra $200 for the
couple of weeks you worked before being told that the correct
amount of your raise was $14.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be only for the time you've already worked. The
boss has no obligation to continue paying you that extra $200 in
the future.

CAPTIVE SOLDIERS A NIGHTMARE FOR CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-GONZALES and KOSOVO-LEGAL) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bruised, bewildered faces of three young U.S.
infantry scouts staring from the repeatedly run video clip sent a
shudder through official Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In their camouflage uniforms _ and in the hands of the enemy _
the captive soldiers represented one of the Clinton
administration's worst nightmares about what NATO forces face in
the Balkan fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had conditioned itself to the likelihood of
troop losses in the fight with Yugoslavia but was worried about how
many casualties a risk-averse United States would accept.
</P>
<P>
   The engagement's first brush with disaster, last weekend's loss
of an F-117A stealth jet, ended with a sigh of relief. The pilot
was rescued in six hours and returned to his air base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had been denied a public
relations coup early in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   But from the initial report Wednesday night that three 1st
Infantry Division soldiers were missing, the incident had a more
harrowing feel, and the dread was not misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday came the pictures from Serb television: stiff,
grim soldiers, their U.S. insignia, name patches and swollen faces
flashed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The administration reacted with practiced concern and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans are concerned about their welfare,'' President
Clinton told a military audience in Norfolk, Va. ``President
Milosevic should make no mistake, the United States takes care of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``And President Milosevic should make no mistake, we will hold
him and his government responsible for their safety and for their
well being.''
</P>
<P>
   The military echoed the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen their pictures. We don't like it,'' said U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who as supreme allied commander is NATO's
top soldier. ``We don't like the way they're treated, and we have a
long memory about these kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be held accountable,'' Clark told a briefing at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear what, if any, specific action either
Clinton or Clark had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and Brussels, officials also wondered what
Milosevic has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   State Department James P. Rubin was asked if the Yugoslav leader
is interested in using the captured soldiers as a bargaining chip
in halting the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wouldn't rule out any tactic on the part of someone
who's conducted the terrible policies that he's conducted in
Kosovo,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air commander David Wilby said it was not clear if
Yugoslavs were deliberately looking for Americans to use as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully investigating the matter just to try and
determine exactly what did happen, to try and make sure that we get
our soldiers back as soon as possible, and also to preclude any
such event happening again in the future,'' Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three soldiers looked roughed up in some way _
scratches, cuts, bruises. Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles appeared to have a gauze bandage on the back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, Yugoslav deputy prime minister, said at least one
of the soldiers was ``trying to fight physically before being
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, in an ABC-TV interview, said the U.S. soldiers will
be treated in the ``most, best humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon identified the other soldiers as Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville; Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sending regards to the families of captured soldiers, and
they must know for Serbs, captured enemy is not enemy,'' Draskovic
said. ``And they have no reason to be worried about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb television report was apparently aired from Pristina,
the main city of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said the allies have ``a reasonable idea'' where the
soldiers are being held, ``but I couldn't put my hand on my heart
and say exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like soldiers throughout the ranks, Clark was irked by seeing
the men as part of what could be viewed as a propaganda exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Clark noted that after the soldiers' last radio transmission
while on patrol, ``the next we saw, they were badly beaten up there
and shown on television in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
``the signs they have been mistreated are very disturbing.'' He
said a ``strong note'' had been sent to the Milosevic government
through the Swedish delegation in Belgrade, which is handling
diplomatic contacts between the United States and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But, Leavy conceded, the picture from the television screen also
could have been worse: ``We're thankful the servicemen are alive.''

MURDOCK TO BUY OUT MALONE'S STAKE IN REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch is taking a strong step toward increasing his
hold over sports programming, agreeing to buy out the 50 percent
stake owned by John Malone's Liberty Media in a venture that
controls a dozen regional sports networks, according to people
familiar with the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, they said, News Corp. will also double its
stake in the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, Madison Square
Garden and Radio City Music to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Liberty Media is getting $1.4 billion of News Corp.
stock, giving it 5 percent of the company and making it the largest
single outside investor. The Murdoch family owns roughly 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One industry expert who requested anonymity said Thursday that
the deal might pave the way to Liberty Media acquiring up to 10
percent of News Corp., whose stock has been relatively depressed
compared to other media stocks. An investment by Malone certainly
underscores his belief in its inherent value.
</P>
<P>
   A News Corp. spokesman said: ``There is no deal now,'' adding
that he did not comment on rumors. A Liberty spokesperson declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fits the style and interests of both men. Murdoch has
long believed that sports is one of the four key elements in
programming, along with movies, news and children's shows, and has
been willing to spend heavily to add to his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   He already owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Manchester United
soccer team in England, and has options to invest in the Los
Angeles Lakers basketball team and Los Angeles Kings hockey team.
But, he has always preferred to control his own operations and
avoid answering to partners who might hold him back from making
investments he desires.
</P>
<P>
   As for Malone, he has generally preferred to hold stakes in
programming companies that were managed by others. And when
possible, he has preferred to build a portfolio of assets in public
companies that gave Liberty both liquidity and a public valuation
for its investments.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media, which was originally spun off from
Tele-Communications, the giant cable company, has acquired stakes
in a wide variety of media companies. It already owns 10 percent of
Time Warner as well as positions in USA Networks, Discovery
Communications, United Video Satellite and others.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran media expert quipped that Malone sees himself as the
Warren Buffett of the media industry, alluding to Buffett's
strategy of taking large passive positions in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when Malone agreed to sell Tele-Communications Inc.
to AT&AMP;T and took control of Liberty, it was clear that he planned
to expand it, and indeed he has been building a hefty war chest.
</P>
<P>
   That company already has $5.5 billion in cash, about $5 billion
in Sprint-PCS stock and the right to borrow up to 25 percent of its
market capitalization _ $36 billion Thursday _ without getting
permission from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tremendous war chest,'' said John Tinker, who follows
the company for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. That enormous
clout is one reason why Malone may be eyeing a larger stake in News
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between Malone and Murdoch, called Fox Liberty
Networks, has reflected the increasing complexity of sports
programming as cable television has grown. The two companies share
ownership of 12 regional sports television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each has a 20 percent stake in Rainbow Programming,
a venture controlled by Cablevision Systems Corp. The venture owns
eight regional sports networks, the Knicks, Rangers, Madison Square
Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Staples Center arean, which
is now being built in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal, though News Corp. will own 40 percent of the
Cablevision venture, Cablevision will still retain control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regional sports networks acquire rights to carry games of local
teams and integrates those games with national programming. For now
Fox Liberty Networks continues to lose money. It lost $62.1 million
last year. However it had operating income of $57.6 million and a
News Corp. spokesman noted that the bulk of the loss was
attributable to interest costs from borrowings to fund the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's buyout of Malone was reported Thursday in The Los
Angeles Times. While Wall Street clearly expects Malone to become
more aggressive on the deal front, Murdoch may as well. Murdoch has
the right to exercise an option to purchase 40 percent of the Kings
and 9.8 percent of the Lakers. It was not clear whether the
exercise of that option would trigger ownership issues with the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 20 regional networks that are part of the deal, the
two companies also have stakes in five other networks. In these,
there are outside investors, and it was not clear Thursday whether
they were part of this transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The news Thursday pushed News Corp. stock up $1.0625 to close at
$30.56, though it has only risen 12.4 percent in the past 52 weeks
during a bull market. Liberty Media closed at 54.75, up $2.15.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Three American soldiers captured along
the border with Macedonia will appear before a Yugoslav military
court that could charge and try them, the state news agency,
Tanjug, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a judicial officer in the Kosovo
capital, Pristina, said that the court investigation of the three
could begin as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government said a Yugoslav court-martial of the
Americans would violate international law.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, _ were
paraded on Serbian state television Thursday, but the main evening
broadcast led with another news event, an unexpected meeting
between the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and a prominent
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   On the broadcast, the two men, looking relaxed, signed a
document calling for a peaceful end to the Kosovo crisis through
``political means.'' Rugova was a part of the ethnic Albanian
delegation that signed a Western-drafted peace treaty rejected by
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbian forces now driving to destroy the armed Kosovo
Liberation Army and forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the
province, Rugova's seemingly uncoerced meeting led a spokesman for
the ethnic Albanian rebels, Jakub Krasniqi, to call Rugova's action
high treason. But other than the television images, which carried
Thursday's date, there was no confirmation that the men had
actually met on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, who has long advocated a nonviolent political solution
to the problem of Kosovo, appeared relaxed, chatting with an
evidently cheerful Milosevic. But it was only on Wednesday that
Serbian television announced that Rugova had sought the protection
of the Serbian police and showed a nervous Rugova asking NATO to
stop its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three captured soldiers, grim-faced and nervous,
were shown on television here throughout the day, the Serbian
evening news did not even mention them until deep in the broadcast,
and then in the context of a commentary. First, it showed Milosevic
meeting representatives of the Greek Orthodox Church. Then it
showed the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic and the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle all
meeting separately with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, sent here by
Pope John Paul II to call on all sides to observe a week-long
Easter truce that would extend from the Western observance of
Easter, April 4, through the Orthodox observance on April 11, a
suggestion the allies have already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a delegation of Russian parliamentarians was shown meeting
various officials.
</P>
<P>
   Only after all this footage did the announcer mention the
capture of the American soldiers ``on Yugoslav territory,'' as
another event ``casting doubt on the Western interpretation of
events.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one gloating touch when the announcer read: ``The
Western aggressors have over night forgotten the humanitarian
crisis'' that is their ostensible reason for intervention and
``have now directed all their attention to three of their soldiers
who were captured,'' the announcer said. ``This puts the American
Fuehrer in the most uncomfortable position because he is the one
who launched the theory that America would win without a single
casualty.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials were debating Thursday why Rugova might have
met with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said in Brussels
Thursday that Rugova might have been under duress. ``I don't see
that Rugova is freely doing what he is doing,'' Solana said, adding
that he would feel ``much more relaxed'' if he had been able to
speak to Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans originally backed Rugova, who was re-elected
as the leader of the ethnic Albanians last April, his credibility
was sharply diminished by the rise in support for the insurgents of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Unity among the ethnic Albanians has been fragile, and with the
Serbian military trying to destroy the KLA in the current fighting,
some Western diplomats suggested by telephone that Rugova may be
trying both to restore his position and to save what is left of
Kosovo from catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may think that half a state is better than a killing ground
and a wasteland,'' said one Western diplomat who left Belgrade
before the bombings began. He drew a possible comparison with the
Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who has sacrificed Palestinian
claims to parts of the West Bank for a Palestinian Authority likely
to become a state.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whom Rugova now represents. As thousands of
ethnic Albanians are driven out of Kosovo, some will regard him as
a traitor, quisling or worse, while others will regard him as
trying to save something from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said they were concerned that Milosevic might
conduct his own negotiations with Rugova and come up with a plan
for Kosovo's partition or political autonomy along the lines the
West has drawn _ but without the presence of NATO peacekeeping
troops that the West is insisting upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic and Rugova announce a deal that gives political
autonomy, a sharp reduction in Serb forces in Kosovo and protection
for refugees to return, it will be awkward,'' another Western
official said by telephone. ``It will look even more like NATO is
on the side of the KLA.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in another move to shore up his support in the
Yugoslav Army, fired an army commander and seven other generals
based in Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro. He replaced the
Second Army Corps commander, Gen. Radosav Martinovic, with a closer
ally, Gen. Milorad Obradovic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has a more pro-Western government and has tried to
distance itself from Serbia's conflict with NATO. Yugoslav analysts
wondered whether Martinovic might have resisted orders to crack
down on Montenegro's separatist-minded government, or if Milosevic
feared an army coup starting from Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. support for Montenegro, NATO warplanes have bombed
Yugoslav military facilities there, including the airport. The
strikes have undermined President Milo Djukanovic's opposition to
Belgrade's policies and raised concerns that Milosevic may move
against Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   In the air war early on Thursday, NATO struck targets in Kosovo
and destroyed a major bridge over the Danube River in Novi Sad,
Serbia's second city. NATO officials said that military warehouses
line one end of the bridge. Serbian officials said the city's water
supply was badly damaged. The wreckage blocked the Danube waterway,
one of the main passages for trade between Western and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Belgrade's 2 million people, it was a frazzled day, with
rumors flying at warp speed about NATO's plans for bombing
government buildings, for the first time, in the city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   As people lined up to buy an informal ration of two packs of
cigarettes _ one kiosk owner said he'd sold 1,000 packs by noon and
had none left on Thursday _ they exchanged worried talk about where
they lived in town and how close it might be to the defense
ministry or the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A man who would only identify himself as Sasha, who owns a
basement cafe downtown, said his parents were sleeping in the cafe,
and he was considering going out to the suburbs for the night. A
man named Ilija said he would go to his sister's house; others
talked of heading down to the crowded bomb shelters for the first
time in several days.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, Belgrade's deputy mayor, said in an interview
Thursday that there was little more the city could do to prepare
for new bombings. ``We just want to insure there are enough
supplies on both sides of the river in case they destroy the
bridges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 100 yards from the federal and Serbian ministries
for internal affairs is Belgrade's largest hospital complex, the
Clinical Center of Serbia, attached to the university. It contains
4,000 of Belgrade's 5,000 hospital beds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bozic said, there had been ``10 or 11'' civilian deaths
from the bombing in and around Belgrade and 47 people kept at least
one night in the hospital for their wounds. Military casualties are
classified information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Serb said Thursday that he had read on the Internet a New
York Times report that NATO would spare the Presidential Palace
because it had a Rembrandt on the first floor. ``It's good news and
bad news,'' the Serb said he told a friend. ``The good news is
Milosevic's palace will be spared because it has a Rembrandt. The
bad news is that you, unfortunately, do not have a Rembrandt.''

 &HT;    Rooting in the dirt does wonders for respondents, who readily
tout benefits of their earthy passion
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What is it with these people who can't keep their
nails clean _ who would rather plunge their bare hands into
40-pound bags of cow manure than plug in the Dirt Devil or do a
load of wash?
</P>
<P>
   People who don headlamps at 3 in the morning in search of slimy
slugs that in minutes will turn a perfect hosta leaf into a block
of Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   People like Margie Archer, who swears every March she won't work
with such vengeance to cultivate a glorious garden, and already
she's going at it gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere on Earth do I feel more comfortable _ with no makeup
on, hair matted to my head, dirty old torn clothes, beat-up shoes _
than in a garden,'' said the Duluth resident, 52. ``No one ever
told me that the sweat, aches and tears of battling mosquitoes,
worms, bugs, snakes and even spiders could be so much fun!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Archer and most of the other 2,629 readers who responded
to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's February survey of gardening
habits, the hobby is about far more than just growing the brightest
jonquil or juiciest tomato. It's about a passion, an addiction _
even a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds wrote of the therapeutic benefits reaped from being
outdoors. Their gardens are gyms for those who dislike exercise,
brightly lit bars for drowning their workday stress, psychologists'
lounge chairs for coming to grips with a spouse's death.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lee's garden in Cedartown proved a salvation after her
40-year-old son's death from brain cancer four years ago. She had
to do something. As a memorial, she placed a large birdbath with an
angel on top in the center of her yard. ``From that, many wonderful
things began to happen,'' the 74-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives brought plants and seeds. Grandchildren
donated bird feeders and wind chimes _ all in tribute to Steve Lee,
an Alpharetta (Ga.) veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garden has helped me deal with it all _ and still does,''
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   For Wanda Jackson, gardening is a link to her mother, who gave
her dozens of plants when she moved into a new home in Kennesaw
(Ga.) two years ago. The plants now represent hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother disappeared Oct. 23, 1998. I pray for her safe
return, and I want to show her all the new things I've added to my
garden,'' wrote Jackson, 41. ``If she has gone on to heaven, I want
her to be with me in my garden and share the beauty that I learned
from her.'' Her mother's car was found abandoned, and Tennessee
authorities are investigating, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long five months,'' said Jackson, whose father
recently drove from Chattanooga to help her plant ivy _ an excuse
perhaps to get close to the missing wife and mother. ``It's amazing
what gardening can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's the simplest rewards. ``I'm a celibate,
perimenopausal 50-year-old divorced mom of a teenage boy. I don't
drink. I don't smoke,'' wrote Janan Henry of Morningside (Ga.). ``I
dig. I push. I pull. I water. I plant, I sweat. I ache. And then
some little green frond pokes up through the dirt, and my son says,
`Mom, that's so pretty.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is an icebreaker in meeting new friends, finding a
date or getting to know neighbors. In John Hampton's North Augusta,
S.C. neighborhood, exchanging vegetables, cuttings and advice has
brought families, black and white, to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garden talk has really helped us to become friends way
beyond the racial lines,'' said Hampton, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   That's because gardening knows no barriers among color, economic
means or age. Since the '80s, baby boomers have become the largest
group to hone in on horticulture, and as the millennium approaches,
nostalgia plays a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been born some time during the era of James
Madison, when growing vegetables was a requirement for sustaining
life,'' wrote Rodney Petty, a Marietta middle school teacher. ``I
garden for some of the same reasons I drive a four-wheel-drive
Jeep, cut and split my own firewood, keep honeybees and sculpt
dough bowls from oak and poplar. It is important for me to know I
have this sense of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, gardening is a matter of community pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my yard looking like Billy Joe Six-Pack lives
there,'' wrote George Kaulbach of Stone Mountain (Ga.). ``Second, I
hate it when my neighbors complain. Third, I have a wife. Need I
say more?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Henderson didn't know beans about gardening until she
bought her first house in Grant Park and decided to spruce up the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a mattock one day and just starting digging out all this
terrible clay,'' the 34-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   After losing her share of plants, she began to buy gardening
books and learned about amending the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Henderson, a lawyer, began to see signs of hope.
``I got so excited I couldn't figure out how I hadn't gotten into
this before,'' she said. ``Then I really got caught up in hunting
for certain colors and kinds of plants.''
</P>
<P>
   What's been most rewarding, she said, is her sudden awareness of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at plants before, and now _ I can't help it _
I'm constantly seeing them, identifying them on walks, while
driving,'' she said. ``Once I dug up that one little corner in my
yard, I was sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing is as much a part of gardening as digging, as Christine
Vogt learned over the years from ``a little old Italian lady named
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt said the 74-year-old Lawrenceville (Ga.) resident ``runs
around wearing a dress tucked in long pants, an unbuttoned
long-sleeve shirt (none of which match), topped off with Army boots
(size 7) and a hair net that often finds its way onto a low branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary shares her garden with neighbors, sometimes dropping off
a basket for those in need, who are ill or just because. She
delivers thank you's to friends, doctors and nurses and her vet,
signed in produce, just to let them know that she appreciates their
efforts and kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt signed her tribute, ``With love to Mary, from her daughter
Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   For true gardeners, though, sharing isn't just a basket of
home-grown corn or freshly cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   For Debbie Missroon, the sharing brought someone to fill the
void in her life after her 81-year-old grandmother died 2 1/2 years
ago. ``I suffered from depression after her death,'' said the
35-year-old Roswell resident. ``One day I was driving past a yard
that always seemed to be in bloom when I noticed the most beautiful
tree I had ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she noticed an elderly woman pruning plants who
``really reminded me of my grandmother,'' Missroon recalled. The
woman, 93-year-old Mattie Smith, told her the plant she had admired
was an angel trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I knew it, she was showing me around her yard, giving
me seeds from marigolds,'' Missroon said. ``I felt as if an angel
had sent her to me to ease the pain of losing my grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Missroon's depression began to lift. The two became
friends and now share gardening information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see her every week or spend hours with her on the
phone, but I know she's there,'' said Missroon, who is moving to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   She's giving her surrogate grandmother some of her own plants.
``I just wanted to give something back,'' she said. ``I'm so
grateful to my `angel gardener.' ''

 &HT;    `It's become a way of life' and a $76 billion industry
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Antoinette Suarez has a dirty, expensive habit. She
has no idea how much she's invested, just that it's gotten out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am continually buying plants, books on plants, fertilizer
for plants, plants to go with other plants, plants for shade,
plants for sun, plants for partial shade, plants that bloom in
spring, plants that bloom in fall, plants that bloom in summer,
and, oh, yes, plants that bloom in winter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez of Atlanta is among the 70 percent of Americans who have
latched on to gardening with a grip stronger than kudzu on guy
wires, one that reaches a diverse $76 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   She's also among the 2,630 readers who responded to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's February survey of gardening habits. Nearly
50 percent were between the ages of 45 and 64, and 76 percent were
female, hailing from Dalton to Valdosta.
</P>
<P>
   Some 76 percent consider themselves ``die-hard diggers,'' a
majority of whom spend from $150 to $1,000 on plants and materials
every spring.
</P>
<P>
   One-third said they devote six to 10 hours per week in the
garden, while another 33 percent spend 20 hours per week. ``That's
some heavy-duty gardening,'' said Walter Reeves, the Georgia
Extension Service's horticulture educator.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are reflective of nationwide trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is growing not just because of the flood of
households but because they're spending more and more on this
hobby,'' said Kip Creel of P K Data Systems, an Atlanta marketing
research firm that tracks national garden industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   Americans average seven to 10 hours per week gardening, Creel
said, and about 50 percent of all households hire a professional
lawn care service or landscape contractor. Wholesale nursery
revenues alone totaled $10.9 billion in 1997, up 42 percent from
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industry impact has been from baby boomers, who in
the '80s traded happy hour for happy homemaking, and the desire to
improve their surroundings outweighed a night on the town. Having
the disposable income didn't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   For most survey participants, their big investment is a mix of
trees, shrubs, annuals and perennials, designed so there's
something in bloom every season. ``They want color longer and are
more conscious of how they can get that with trees and
perennials,'' said Pete Pike, founder of Pike Family Nurseries,
which has 25 stores in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on another level, about 25 percent said their motivation to
garden is far greater than the desire to create something beautiful
or edible. The rewards are exercise, emotional therapy and the
opportunities for getting close to nature and improving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms gardening is a lifestyle,'' said Sherry
Loudermilk of the Georgia Green Industries Association, which
includes 850 wholesale nurseries, landscape contractors and retail
garden centers. ``It's become a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's gardening survey found:
</P>
<P>
   51%
</P>
<P>
   spend from $150 to $1,000 on seeds and plants each spring, and
39 percent spend a comparable amount on compost, fertilizer and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   47%
</P>
<P>
   spend from 10 to 30 hours a week gardening each spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   21%
</P>
<P>
   would prefer a pile of composted cow manure to a department
store gift certificate or a night out on the town.

   BRUSSELS, Brussels _ Western officials are discussing a plan
under which NATO troops would escort ethnic Albanians back into
Kosovo after Serbian forces there have been routed by bombing, and
would set up a self-governing enclave under allied protection, a
senior NATO diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have repeatedly ruled out an invasion force to
halt the brutal campaign by President Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian
forces, which has driven almost 190,000 ethnic Albanians from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials say that NATO ground troops may be called
in if airstrikes eventually succeed in driving back the Serb
military to bring back the refugees and to set up what the official
called a ``protectorate.'' They say this might be possible even if
a formal peace agreement with Belgrade has not been reached, as
long as it was clear that the Serbs could not mount serious
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations on the plan are still in the early stages and
still under discussion in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official in Washington said in a telephone
interview that much would depend on whether the ground force will
be able to enter Kosovo without facing serious military resistance
from remaining Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line that has not been crossed in Washington is whether we
would deploy such a force in anything but a permissive
environment,'' the official said. ``That is, an environment in
which hostile forces have been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, NATO has continued to back the plan presented to the
Serbs and ethnic Albanians at the Rambouillet Castle in France,
under which Kosovo would remain a Serbian province, but with
extensive autonomy for its Albanian majority. But officials have
privately acknowledged that the proposal, which was rejected by the
Serbs, is no longer applicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo within Yugoslavia is becoming more and more difficult
to conceive of, even with the maximum degree of autonomy involving
the Rambouillet package,'' the diplomat said. ``It may still not be
too late to go back to that, but it is becoming more and more
remote. So a protectorate, independence with international
guarantees, these are at least coming into the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussions over a protectorate _ an independent entity
whose security would be guaranteed by the international community
but whose status would be less than a state _ reflects a major
change in the long debate over how to bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Rambouillet approach, NATO was to send 28,000
peacekeeping troops only after both the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians had accepted the autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
   But with the plan rejected by the Serbs, and with their forces
on the march in Kosovo, there is a growing sense among diplomats
that the coexistence between the Serbs and Albanians is no longer
viable.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some diplomats say, the Albanians would find it
difficult to live again under Serb authority, even with the
autonomy projected by the Rambouillet agreement. Additionally,
President Clinton has warned Milosevic that his campaign against
the ethnic Albanians was jeopardizing his right to govern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even NATO Secretary General Javier Solana suggested in an
interview earlier this week that the Rambouillet accord would
probably need to be modified but did not say how.
</P>
<P>
   The plan under discussion by diplomats here, to turn Kosovo into
a NATO protectorate, also reflects a resistance to make Kosovo an
independent state _ no NATO nation has formally called for it _ or
to make Kosovo part of a greater Albania, for fear that such steps
could destablize the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many critical details of how a protectorate might work remain to
be worked out. The basic thinking is that weeks of bombing would
cripple the Yugoslav military and force Serbian soldiers and police
units to retreat from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ethnic Albanians refugees would begin to return under the
protection of NATO troops. The refugees would be allowed to return
to all of Kosovo. The province would not be partitioned.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force would function more like a protection force than
a peacekeeping presence. It might be sent even if Belgrade did not
agree to the presence of NATO forces in Kosovo, though probably not
in the face of determined Serb resistance. Diplomats could try to
work out a peace accord afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sequence used to be full political agreement, followed by
an international peacekeeping force,'' the senior NATO diplomat
said. ``The question that will have to be answered now is whether
the international presence is so indispensible to the return of the
refugees that one has to look at a different sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how large such a NATO force might be. While air
strikes would have reduced Serb threats, the force would have to be
substantial enough to protect not only the ethnic Albanians, but
the international officials and workers that would likely be
involved in the reconstruction of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security risks to the force might be less but the task
would be very different,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the senior allied commander, hinted Thursday
in a press conference that contingency planning was being carried
out for using ground forces in new ways. But he refused to provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials reiterated, however, that there was no
consideration of using ground forces to invade Kosovo. NATO
officials also pointed to the difficulties in dispatching ground
troops as part of a effort to create ``safe areas'' in Kosovo for
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, the U.N. force there established
``safe areas'' for Muslim populations under attack by Bosnian Serb
forces in places like Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces under Gen. Ratko Mladic later attacked Srebrenica
and killed thousands of civilians, with U.N. forces unable to stop
them even with NATO bombing behind them.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, a NATO military officer said, ``We must not
establish anything like safe areas in Kosovo unless we can
absolutely guarantee the safety of the people who are within
them.''

COMMENTARY: BOMB AND CALL IN GEORGE MITCHELL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever played one of those video arcade games where you
try to shoot as many targets as you can in a set period of time?
When you start such a game a little sign flashes up and asks: ``One
Player or Two?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Clinton team's approach to the Kosovo crisis reminds
me of such a game. The U.S. put a quarter in, pressed ``One
Player,'' and took aim against the Serbian armed forces.
Unfortunately, it forgot that war is an interactive game and that
somebody else was playing _ someone able to run up the score on us.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO air power has no doubt inflicted enormous damage on
the Serb army, and while the NATO allies were well-intentioned,
they clearly did not anticipate Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic's mendacity and ability to drive out thousands of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo. In doing so, Milosevic has run up the score
on NATO and built up a huge counterpressure on the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb leader has in effect said to NATO: ``You may think you
have all the time in the world to shoot at my forces like fish in a
barrel. But time is not just on your side _ because I am saddling
you with Kosovo refugees (and now POW's) faster than you are
degrading my army. As long as you rely on air power alone, you are
a hostage to the weather and the time that air power takes to
destroy an entrenched army in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But I have no such problems. My forces rely on low-tech terror
that can force Albanians out of Kosovo, no matter what the weather,
and much faster than you can cripple me. You wanted to help the
Kosovars, well now you can _ you've got all 1.8 million of them in
your lap. I've got Kosovo and you've got the Kosovars. As they say
in the video arcade: Game Over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO has a serious problem. All these refugees have
fundamentally changed the equation. We are losing now, folks, and
that means America needs to look at its four options in a much more
clear-eyed way.
</P>
<P>
   Option one is to bomb Serbia into the Stone Age until it accepts
the Rambouillet peace plan _ which gave the Kosovo Albanians
autonomy in Kosovo, under NATO protection, for three years and then
hope for independence. The only problem is that by bombing Serbia
into accepting Rambouillet, the U.S. is undermining any prospect
the plan could work.
</P>
<P>
   It is going to be very difficult now for Kosovo Albanians _ who
have just been expelled and savaged by the Serbs _ to return to
Kosovo and live as an autonomous community under Serb sovereignty,
even with NATO protection. It is going to be even harder now for
any Serb leader to swallow NATO troops on their soil. At best, NATO
troops would be serving as ``peacekeepers,'' not between two
contented factions, but between two factions thirsting for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Option two is to invade Kosovo with NATO ground troops, drive
out the Serbs and create an independent Kosovo-Albanian state that
would be a NATO protectorate. The human, military and diplomatic
cost of this would be enormous, and it would fracture NATO. In
victory would lie defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Option three is to declare victory and leave, while letting the
Red Cross tend to the Kosovo refugees. This would be an unthinkable
moral sellout, and it would leave floating around the Balkans an
angry, highly destabilizing refugee population.
</P>
<P>
   Option four is to intensify the bombing of the Serbs, while also
dangling before them a peace plan that Milosevic might be tempted
to accept. It would have to be a modified version of Rambouillet _
an end to the air war in return for the Serbs allowing a return of
all refugees, some form of permanent autonomy for the Kosovo
Albanians and a non-NATO observer and protection force.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar nationalists may not like this tactic, but if it can
get the refugees back home and enable the Serbs to accept some
foreign peacekeepers in Kosovo, it would be the least bad option
and could still achieve our basic goals. We should be doing this
now: Bomb and call in George Mitchell to negotiate a solution with
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But those are our options: Beat the Serbs until they learn to
love the Kosovars. Invade Kosovo and own it forever. Cut and run
and bear the stain forever. Or bomb and talk and hope to build a
messy diplomatic solution from the ashes of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's a fifth option: Put your hands together and pray
that the Clinton team knows something that you don't.

COMMENTARY: WRITING A SCRIPT, INSTEAD OF POLICY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by their role in helping turn a Balkan civil war into
shivering, desolate, crowds of refugees, a political booby trap for
America unmatched since Vietnam, a perversion of NATO purpose and a
planning debacle, the 15 nations of the European Union are now
trying to export their collective political wisdom to shape the
Mideast, which may God in Heaven forfend.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the European Union did have great assistance in the
Kosovo tragedy _ the abominable thug who is Serbia's dictator, and
a Kosovo Liberation Army with a yearning itself for ethnic
expulsions, of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important has been President Clinton. He was
elected nude of experience in or feeling for foreign and military
matters. But in six years in office he has reached new heights of
ineptitude, exhibiting the attachment to truth and candor that
became his trademark at home.
</P>
<P>
   Still the EU came up with ideas guaranteed to bear fruit _ of
tragedy. Europe's mind-set about the Mideast is pretty much the
same that brought the fall into the pit of Balkan war. They are
telling Israel that all of Jerusalem, not merely what Palestinians
claim as their capital for the while, is a corpus separatum,
separate international entity, not an inch of it legally under
Israeli control. They are telling Israelis and Palestinians that
nobody has the right to try to stop the establishment of a
Palestinian state.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian independence and Jerusalem are supposed to be
decided during the final series of Israel-Palestinian talks. So
there is not much reason to go ahead with it, is there? Just let
the two sides fight it out to the death, while the European Union
thinks up more great ideas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised at these proposals _ the European nations
simply are selecting a time that could do most damage to disinter
their old vicious gambit that the U.N. partition resolution of 1947
still stands.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jews agreed to partition and an internationalized Jerusalem
in desperate pursuit of acceptance of their homeland by the Arabs.
The Arabs rejected the resolution and fell on the Jews then and
throughout the next half a century. Israel declared the resolution
nullified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why do the Europeans commit this act of public grave-robbing
now? One _ Europe's mercantile policy toward the Arabs: oil and
weapons contracts in feudal Arab countries are put far above
profits to be made with high-tech Israel. Centuries of warfare
among European tribes have dulled their brains. Two _ they don't
care for Israel very much.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Likud and Labor told Germany, current president of
the EU, to stuff these proposals. But Palestinians already are
using them as a pressure point against Israel. If they go on too
long, they will kill negotiations permanently and invite war.
Kosovo will seem a merry little place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have no ``plan'' for Mideast agreement. Neither do
they, NATO or Washington have one in Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Trainor, retired Marine lieutenant general, put it best
on MSNBC: all they have in Kosovo is a script. So, when the Serbs
did not follow the script by surrendering and instead drove more
Albanians out of Kosovo, NATO spokesmen looked all sad and hurt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where were the supplies for the refugees that should have been
stockpiled? Coming; show check in mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The script treats Serbs as inferiors who would docilely give up
under bombing _ which neither they, nor the British nor the
Russians did in World War II. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will the world be upset about Germans bombing children and
grandchildren of the million Serbs the Nazis killed? Drop bombs,
cut upset shot.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbs lose Kosovo they will return to combat soon. They may
prefer to fight on somebody else's land for a change _ like
neighboring Hungary. Now it is a NATO member entitled to full NATO
protection _ ``full'' meaning including nuclear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to show? Nothing; cut from script.
</P>
<P>
   What about from our minds? Shut up. Bill Clinton, not golfing
today, says carry on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Write new scene. Bring in troops, persuade some refugees to
return, guard them. But for how long, chief?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could we show us helping others attain some liberty _ Iraqis,
Kurds, Tibetans, Sudanese? Please, please, could we show a policy?
Then we could have an honest plan. But what does a policy look
like? I forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shut up and get on the team.

CAPTURED U.S. SOLDIERS MAY FACE MILITARY TRIBUNAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: KOSOVO-CLINTON, KOSOVO-CAPTURED, KOSOVO-LEGAL and
KOSOVO-GONZALES, which will move shortly.) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three captured U.S. Army soldiers, including one
from Texas, were displayed on Serb television Thursday, and the
official Yugoslav news service said they will face a military
tribunal, perhaps as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen were captured, apparently by Serb forces, on the
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border Wednesday during what the Defense
Department said was a routine reconnaissance mission as part of a
NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken,''
President Clinton said in a speech to military personnel and their
families in Norfolk, Va. ``There is no basis for them to be held.
There is certainly no basis for them to be tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon identified the captured soldiers as Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville; Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of
Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO leaders said detention of the servicemen, however
unreasonable, will not deter a continued allied air assault to curb
violence by forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic against
ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission I have asked our armed forces to carry out with
our NATO allies is a dangerous one,'' Clinton said. ``We will
continue to carry out our mission with determination and resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance ``remains
united and remains determined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After one week of air operations, I am confident that we are
having a major impact on Belgrade's criminal war machine,'' Solana
said. ``The ring is closing around the Yugoslav forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the three captured soldiers
were being ``illegally detained'' and pledged: ``We will do
everything in our power to secure their safe return.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon described the detainees
as ``prisoners of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a court martial-like proceeding heightened
American outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a trial is obviously ridiculous,'' said State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin. A trial, he said, ``would be in violation
of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by state-run Tanjug news service quoted a judicial
officer in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, who suggested that the
initial proceeding could be like a grand jury hearing to determine
if charges should be brought against the U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute erupted over where the servicemen were picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, Yugoslav deputy prime minister, contended the
soldiers were ``captured deeply in Serbian territory,'' but NATO
air chief David Wilby said the soldiers ``certainly were in
Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department, which had initially contended that
the three soldiers were in Macedonia, said the issue was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
that after the men's Humvee was surrounded and had been fired on,
it was unclear ``whether or not they later had escaped from that
and had driven in the wrong direction or whether they were fleeing
on foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia officials said the border in the rough, hilly region
where the incident occurred was not clearly marked.
</P>
<P>
   In the NATO air assault Thursday, allied missiles knocked out a
major Danube River bridge in Novi Sad near a military warehouse.
Shipping sources told Reuters news service that shipping was halted
in both directions on the key waterway between central Europe and
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Another Danube bridge, near Beska on the road from Belgrade to
the Hungarian border, sustained minor damage, Serb television
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the bridge attacks were intended to ``make force
mobility more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope and tempo of our operations are increasing all the
time,'' Solana said in Brussels. ``We are degrading (the Yugoslav
force's) ability to carry out the current acts of violence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of our campaign will be increasingly cumulative,''
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Cohen had ordered 13 additional U.S. F-117A stealth
fighters to the campaign against Yugoslavia. One of the planes is
to replace the plane downed over Yugoslavia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Solana insisted the NATO goals were unchanged: halting Yugoslav
aggression and demanding a cease-fire to be policed by an alliance
force.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said Yugoslavia was engaged in ``a just battle,
defending its citizens ... and will never give up its land and
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended against reports that the White House, in
seeking the NATO attack, had ignored reports from military planners
and intelligence sources that the assault was likely to increase
Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not acted, the Serbian offensive would have been
carried out with impunity,'' Clinton said in Norfolk. ``We are
determined that it will carry a very high price indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, three trains with thousands of refugees pulled up to
the Macedonian border, reported Judith Kumin, a spokeswoman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Two more trains were reported
en route.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen defended the military operation from criticism, such as
the claim of Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a leading Republican
spokesman on foreign policy that, ``We are losing the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said allied ``forces are doing a magnificent job in the
face of expected strong resistance. The president and all of his
advisers knew that achieving our military goals would be difficult,
it would take time, and it would pose a risk to NATO forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also faced new calls, including one from two of
the most liberal members of Congress, to use ground forces against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Eliot Engel, both New York Democrats,
said in a joint statement: ``It is now clear ... that the use of
air power alone cannot and will not prevent these atrocities. Only
troops on the ground can stop the murders and crimes against
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic met in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, with Kosovar
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and, according to Serb television,
agreed ``problems can be resolved successfully and long term only
through political means.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Rubin questioned whether Rugova
attended of his own free will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have an opportunity to discuss directly with him and
make sure that he has freedom of movement and his family has
freedom of movement ... I just have no way of assessing that
situation,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied sources pointed out that the comments attributed to
Rugova contrasted with views he expressed in an interview in the
current issue of the German magazine Der Spiegel, including a call
for immediate use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO needs to give its all and if necessary threaten a
complete destruction of Serbia,'' Rugova said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the White House rejected a call by Pope John Paul II to
halt the aerial attack in Easter week.

COURIER, MARTIN TO CARRY US FLAG AT DAVIS CUP MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ Todd Martin told his captain, Tom
Gullikson: ``Get over it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' was the hope that somehow the extremely self-centered No.
1 Pete Sampras would put himself out for a weekend and indulge in
Davis Cup for the United States against Great Britain. The
best-of-five first-round series between the original Cup
antagonists of Boston 1900 commences Friday at the National Indoor
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither Sampras nor another figment of Gullikson's once
hopeful imagination, Andre Agassi, has been seen walking beside the
barge canals that snake through central Birmingham, the American
singles starters are the shopworn but historically reliable Jim
Courier and Martin, currently planetary Nos. 54 and 8. Countering
are the higher regarded Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, Nos. 7 and
11.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the more quixotic, capricious corners of sport for a
century has been the Davis Cup, where the branding of guys with
their nationality either sears them into the trembles or heats them
into sky-high performers. Greats have fainted. Remember Sampras in
the losing 1991 final to France? Nonentities can become
kings-for-a-day like No. 285 Hugo Chapacu, beating the US for
Paraguay in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson has gotten over it, thanks to Martin and Courier. ``We
put the full-court press on Pete and Andre. Both Judy Levering (US
Tennis Association president) and I visiting them, going over the
positive aspects of playing for their country,'' he said. ``That's
never happened before, the president going to see guys, making a
personal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said at The Lipton last week, ``Tom understands. I have
other goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson doesn't understand. He and his late twin, Tim
(Sampras's coach), would have killed to play Davis Cup themselves.
A good sport publicly about ``Pete's indifference to the Cup,''
Gullikson is hurt. He told a friend, ``How can Pete look at me and
not see my brother, who would have been really upset about his not
playing?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a free country. Sampras isn't unpatriotic. But he is
un-Pete-riotic for a guy who says he reveres tradition, idolizes
Rod Laver, and wants to be considered the all-time champ. Laver,
acknowledging Sampras's brilliance, merely rolls his eyes when the
subject of Pete and Davis Cup arises.
</P>
<P>
   Time to move on. Martin shook friend Gullikson out of his
revery, expressing some tough love: ``Those guys don't want to
play. Courier and I do. We're committed. We're gonna win for you''
_ possibly saving Gullikson's job in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to have guys who do want it, instead of twisting
arms,'' Gullikson concedes. ``Todd and Jim are cool under pressure,
and this is the highest form of tennis pressure. They've been here,
been on winning teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Courier, who leads off against Henman, and helped win
the Cups of 1992 over Switzerland and 1995 over Russia, has never
played in a losing series. The US has been 12-0 with him in the
lineup. Martin, at 6 feet 6 inches the tallest American Davis Cup
participant ever, has a tall order in 6-4 fireballer Rusedski, but
has always played better on the road, a cog in the Moscow victory.
His maybe problem: abdominal muscles strained at the Australian
about which he's ``cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not want to play for your country?'' is as far as
Martin will go in badmouthing Sampras. ``We're playing for
ourselves, our team, and our country. I don't know of a better
combination. For me, Davis Cup _ losses as well as wins _ has meant
more than any other big victories I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier seconds the motion, and grows chilly when anybody calls
this the B team or the jayvees. ``We are the team, America's team,
and we came to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though no longer the player who stood No. 1 in 1992, winner of
four majors, Courier said, ``I'm better than I have been in a long
time.'' True. ``Todd and I are capable of beating these guys. We
have beaten them.'' My hunch is they will again, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are capable _ despite local bookies' naysaying,
7-to-4 for the home side _ it will spoil a grand party to be played
out before 9,400 in the long sold-out building, and the rest of
Britain hanging on the telly.
</P>
<P>
   While this is hardly a breath-holder back in the Colonies, it's
one of the bigger British sporting occasions in 20 years. Not since
rookie John McEnroe beat the Brits in the 1978 final at Mission
Hills, Calif., has Davis Cup meant so much in this land where the
game was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've been laughingstocks in tennis, and that's been
an incentive for me,'' said the slim, stylish 24-year-old Henman.
``We were rock-bottom when Greg and I joined the team in 1995 so
this has been a mission for us. The Americans may have been around
in Davis Cup, but we haven't. There's an edge on it for us. Sure
we're nervous, but we've got a lot of people behind us. Of course
this is a very difficult first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Choke or charge? That's the question.
</P>
<P>
   After years in the boonies, the Brits have worked their way back
from the third division sub-basement to the 16 country World Group
from which they were booted in 1992. Their captain, David Lloyd,
said justifiably, ``We should have been seeded as the Americans
are, and not be facing them at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said with a smile, ``it may be kismet. How nice in
this 100th year of Davis Cup to have the two teams that started it
going head to head. It might not have happened if we'd been seeded.
We're happy to play the Yanks. We haven't beaten them since 1935.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, a British team showed up at Boston's Longwood Cricket
Club to challenge for the sterling crock donated by a Harvard kid,
Dwight Davis. Davis, the playing captain (well, it was his Cup),
and chums bageled the visitors. Few beyond The Bean and London
noticed. But presently the entire world (129 countries this year)
was in on it.
</P>
<P>
   The US returns to Longwood (July 16-18) either very much in the
quarterfinal chase for the Cup _ or in a last-gasp battle to avoid
the pits of relegation that Britain has just escaped. B team or the
team? Birmingham, site of James Watt's inventing the steam engine
in 1769, is where the US will pick up steam or run out of it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission on
Thursday accused both Yugoslav and Albanian forces of committing
numerous killings and other atrocities in Kosovo before NATO began
its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Dienstbier, a former foreign minister of Czechoslovakia,
gave the U.N. group, which is holding its annual meeting here, a
report on Kosovo that strongly criticized Yugoslav forces, noting
that he was alarmed at ``consistent disregard by Serbian state
security forces of both domestic and international standards
pertaining to police conduct and treatment of detainees.'' Kosovo
is a province of Serbia, which with neighboring Montenegro forms
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Dienstbier said, however, that human rights violations by both
the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians were common. ``It happened in
Kosovo many times for both sides,'' Dienstbier said, citing
abductions, murders and arbitrary arrests. He has been
investigating human rights in Yugoslavia, Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he said, ``concentrations of corpses and evidence of
massacres, including massacres of civilians,'' were discovered. The
badly mutilated bodies of 14 Kosovo Albanians, including six women,
six children and two elderly men, were found in a forest in the
Drenica region, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, on the other hand, which is fighting
for independence for the ethnic Albanian majority in the province,
conducted paramilitary tribunals and was believed to be responsible
for the abduction and execution of civilians and police officers,
he said. In two locations, Klecka and Glodjane, there were more
than 40 bodies that Yugoslav authorities said were Serb civilians
who had been kidnapped and killed by the KLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And all over Serbia, he said, ``persons are arbitrarily detained
by the police for questioning or held in pretrial detention longer
than the period mandated by law.'' Such detainees are routinely
denied access to lawyers, Dienstbier said, and also to personal
doctors, a practice that he said is significant because
state-employed physicians do not report injuries sustained during
police questioning and also do not provide sufficient medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia gave the
commission what it called ``information on terrorist activities and
provocations by the Albanian separatists in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Branko Brankovic, a representative of the Yugoslav government,
said that between Oct. 13, 1998, and Feb. 21, 1999, there had been
827 attacks and provocations in Kosovo, including 290 against
civilians and 537 against officials. These attacks, he said, killed
99 people, including 80 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rambouillet peace talks, he said, people have been
killed and wounded daily except for the period from Feb. 11 to Feb.
17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the fighting and brutality in Kosovo in the past
weeks, Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said
Thursday that a special investigation would begin next week to
assess the reports of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson said she would send Dienstbier to investigate
``reports of a vicious and systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing
conducted by Serbian military and paramilitary forces in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gravity of these reports underlines the need for impartial
verification of the allegations,'' Ms. Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors are also being reassigned and sent
immediately to interview refugees to evaluate the human rights
situation in the battered province, she added.

 &HT;    ATM fees in Georgia on par with nation's
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bank customers in Georgia pay an average of $2.53 in
automated teller machine fees, mirroring national figures in a
study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group study was released on
the third anniversary of the decision by the two largest automated
teller networks _ owned by Visa and MasterCard _ to allow banks and
other ATM operators to impose surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who use another bank's ATM often end up paying two
surcharges: one to the bank operating the ATM, plus a fee to their
own banks.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the national average for surcharges is $2.57.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia banks' ATM fees ``reflect a disturbing trend that
virtually all consumers in Georgia are being charged twice to use
ATMs once,'' said Bob Pregulman, PIRG's Southern field director.
</P>
<P>
   In general, larger multistate banks charge higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Credit unions and smaller, local banks tend to have lower ATM
fees, Pregulman said.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank and SunTrust banks charge noncustomers $1.50 to use
their ATMs, spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found more than 90 percent of banks charge people to
use their ATM machines if they aren't customers of the bank, up
from 71 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's bankers say the surcharges are outweighed by the
24-hour convenience and are needed to make the machines profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, consumers have more choices than ever to get cash when
and where they want it,'' Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president
of the American Bankers Association, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the surcharges ``have led to an explosion of new ATMs in
places that previously couldn't support them due to low usage, such
as theaters, hospitals and neighborhood markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey by PIRG covered 336 banks and 31 credit unions in 23
states and the District of Columbia, out of some 9,000 institutions
nationwide.

 &HT;    Latino group stresses need for participation in census
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stand up and be counted in census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative _ remaining undercounted _ could result in the
loss of some of the economic gains Latinos have made in recent
years, said Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``We cannot
afford to be undercounted,'' Hernandez said Thursday at the second
annual regional Latino Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The one-day summit, organized by the Latin American Association
in Atlanta, was designed to help companies, government officials
and educators reach and understand the growing numbers of Latino
consumers. More than 250 people attended.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures help companies determine marketing strategies,
hiring, what services are needed and where. In particular, the
numbers help corporations ``realize the economic power of the
Latino community,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged some Latinos' wariness of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service hinders the effort to count them for the
census. The result is companies don't get an accurate estimate of
the size of the Latino market.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez estimates Latinos were underrepresented by 5 percent
in the 1990 census because of such fears. The summit covered such
topics as marketing to the Latino community, how to recruit and
retain Latino employees, the impact on the community health care
system and how to improve communication between the metro area's
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jose de la Cruz, a human resource executive with Pfizer Inc.,
said most companies are still woefully behind in managing
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, companies are just talking,'' de la Cruz
said. ``Even those who have made great strides have a long way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, progressive companies are hiring Latino
recruiters and offering bonuses for employee referrals. De la Cruz
suggested going to churches, flea markets, community-based and
Latino professional organizations, and using radio advertising in
Latino media to reach potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   Getting tips like those are among the reasons Matt Reyer,
associate director of human resources for Kraft Food Inc., attended
the summit at the Swissotel. Learning ways to recruit Latino
workers was also a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly part of our overall business strategy,'' Reyer
said. ``We value diversity, and we understand that we need a
diverse work force to accomplish our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they have had such an overwhelming response to
the summits that they plan to have a two-day program in 2000.

 &HT;    Cell phone customer base up 25% in year
 &HT;    By Bill Husted and Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cellular phone _ a status symbol restricted to a
handful of executives and salespeople just a decade ago _ has
become standard equipment these days, especially in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association
released Thursday says the largest one-year cellular subscriber
growth ever was recorded in 1998. There are now 69,209,321 cellular
customers, a gain of 13,897,028 over 1997 and a 25 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The association does not break out cellular statistics by city
or region, but almost all experts agree Atlanta is one of the
nation's top five cities when it comes to cellular telephone
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Every third person within the reach of metro Atlanta is a
subscriber to wireless service, according to Lee Bailey, a
consultant with the Strategis Group, a Washington, D.C.-based
consulting and research company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth and cell phone penetration generally go
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the top five _ a group he said was too close to
rank _ are Orlando, Fla., Charlotte, N.C., Hartford, Conn., and El
Paso, Texas, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sheer numbers _ and not just market penetration
_ Atlanta remains in the top 10, according to Tracy Ford, editor of
RCR magazine, a trade publication covering the wireless industry.
Roughly 1.4 million people in metro Atlanta have wireless phones,
according to projections based on RCR's 1998 studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some previous projections of Atlanta put the penetration of
wireless use at better than 40 percent. However, estimates of
wireless use _ especially for a particular city or region _ tend to
vary, depending on who is doing the estimating. Nationally, the
penetration of wireless is about 25 percent, according to the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler of the association said there was ``a tremendous
surge in subscribership during the last half of 1998. During the
last six months of the year, more than 45,500 individuals signed up
for service each day.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were just about 2 million cellular customers
in the entire nation.

 &HT;    Delta hits Internet jackpot
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest red-hot Internet stock, Priceline.com, is
making a fortune for Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Delta this winter became the biggest airline yet to offer seats
through the online booking site, whose pitchman is former ``Star
Trek'' star William Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Atlanta-based Delta got warrants to buy 18.6 million
Priceline.com Inc. shares at 93 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   The stock went public this week in one of the hottest initial
offerings ever. It hit the market at $16 and zoomed as high as $92
before settling back. It closed Thursday at $80.50, down $2.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Delta's warrants, which work like stock options,
worth $1.48 billion on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The warrants are exercisable only when Delta meets certain
booking volume targets or in seven years, whichever comes first,
Priceline.com financial filings show. So Delta's actual gain
depends on its participation and Priceline.com's future success.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet companies, the Stamford, Conn.-based firm has
yet to make money, posting a $114 million loss last year.
</P>
<P>
   The site invites air travelers to name their price for flights.
It then tries to match the bids with seats made available at a
discount by participating airlines. To generate initial business,
the firm has sold many bookings below what it pays the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But volume is rising. The site handled 103,000 bookings in
January and February vs. 135,000 in the previous nine months. It
also sells hotel rooms, new cars and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to believe the company's early market position
will pay off as e-commerce matures.
</P>
<P>
   The airline service works best for fliers with flexible
schedules who missed advance-purchase deadlines and want to avoid
high walk-up fares. The airlines get revenue for seats they don't
expect to sell otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage heavy use by business travelers, which would
dilute the airlines' most lucrative passenger base, bookings are
nonrefundable and don't earn frequent flier points.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers involved are Northwest, TWA, America West and
Midway, along with numerous foreign airlines. Delta is the only one
with such a potentially lucrative stock stake.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com founder Jay Walker _ himself sitting on a $5
billion stake after the IPO _ said the deal was worth it to entice
a carrier as big as Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys took a brilliant risk in joining with an unknown
Internet company,'' said Walker. ``They said if they were going to
do it they also wanted to participate on the equity side.''
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokeswoman declined to comment on the financial
arrangement but said the carrier is ``very satisfied'' with its
participation in Priceline.com thus far.

 &HT;    ISS Group splitting its stock 2-for-1
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ISS Group, a network security software company,
announced a 2-for-1 split of its common stock Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The split, approved by the ISS board this week, takes effect
when the stock market closes May 19. ISS shareholders of record as
of May 5 will receive one additional share for each share owned.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Macchia, ISS chief financial officer, said the company had
been looking at a stock split for a while. ISS was one of the stock
market's stronger performers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The split, Macchia said, indicates the board believes in the
company's strategic direction and its prospects for future strong
performance.
</P>
<P>
   After a second public offering early last month at $59, ISS
shares have climbed to close Thursday at $79.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lower share price makes it more accessible to potential
investors who often like to buy smaller blocks,'' he said. ``It
makes it more affordable to those investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Macchia said last month's secondary offering of 2.4 million
shares of ISS stock was an effort to increase the number of large
institutions investing in ISS by making a larger number of shares
available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 million ISS Group shares are on the market. About 9
million of those are held by venture capital partners or ISS
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million shares held by the public, 70 percent to 80
percent are held by institutions, which are considered more stable
than individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   ISS founder and Chief Technology Officer Christopher Klaus is
the largest single ISS shareholder, with 3.1 million shares,
representing about 17 percent of the shares outstanding. The
25-year-old Klaus' stake was worth about $246.5 million, based on
Thursday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   ISS makes and markets a group of adaptive network security
software products. The products detect, respond to and monitor
intrusions to a computer network. ISS is the market leader, but the
market is a nascent one.
</P>
<P>
   ISS has yet to make a profit. In the calendar year that ended in
December, ISS lost $4 million, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of
$35.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter before, ISS lost $791,000, or 5 cents a share.
Without a one-time charge of $802,000 tied to the purchases of
March Information Systems and DbSecure, ISS would have turned its
first profit, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ISS earnings for the quarter ending March 31 are due to be
released April 21.

 &HT;    Yahoo! purchase prepares it for high-speed users
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo!, the No. 1 search engine and portal site on the
Web, took a giant step toward preparing for the broadband future
Thursday with the formal announcement of an all-stock deal _
estimated to be worth about $5.7 billion _ to buy multimedia audio
and video company Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close at the end of Yahoo!'s third
quarter ending Sept. 30 and is subject to the usual regulatory
approvals and the approval of Broadcast.com shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mallett, Yahoo! chief operating officer, said in a
conference call that the company had owned an equity stake in
Broacast.com since 1997. Dallas-based Broadcast.com will remain a
stand-alone company called Yahoo! Broadcast Services.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadcast Services unit will continue to produce live audio
and video events for consumers and commercial clients. The
Broadcast.com management team will remain in place with Chief
Executive Officer Todd Wagner reporting to Mallett.
</P>
<P>
   For Yahoo!, already a popular destination for those with
high-speed access through the At Home and Road Runner network,
Broadcast.com's multimedia will make the site compelling in the
high-speed world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rapid shift up and to the right for multimedia
content,'' Mallett said. ``It puts us in the position to define the
future. The demand for broadcast services are clearly on the
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett also said Yahoo! will continue to remain an independent
aggregator of Web products and won't stake a claim to any
particular high-speed platform such as DSL access over phone lines
or cable television modems. ``Distribution continues to be
important for us _ but we know nothing is locked up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said the decision to acquire Broadcast.com is based on
Yahoo!'s strategy of acquiring ``best of breed'' companies in any
given area. He said Broadcast.com had positioned itself as a leader
in multimedia. ``This will become even more important as broadband
access grows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! plans to include multimedia in its news, sports, shopping
and financial areas as well as offer multimedia advertising
opportunities to its advertisers. Both Mallett and Wagner said they
were excited about the possibilities of bringing multimedia to
consumers as well as advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Yahoo!'s potential broadband strategy, Mallett said
the Broadcast.com deal uniquely positions Yahoo! for today's
broadband customer. Broadcast.com was developed for the
slower-speed connections of dial-up customers, and its technology
will only improve as more and more consumers eventually make the
move to the higher speeds offered by broadband.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mallett stressed that multimedia content will be just
one component of the Yahoo! service. ``Consumers are going to
expect integrated components,'' he said, ``and we can deliver them
in multiple facets. Sometimes you want a quick check-in of scores
or stocks, and sometimes you want video of a local news event. It's
about today and setting ourselves up to be in a good position for
tomorrow. Broadcast.com understands the world of rich media
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! ``wants to be the only place you need to go for anything
and everything you need on the Web,'' said Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
analyst Henry Blodget.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, with its combination of video streaming for
business and its consumer events such as live concerts and the
infamous Victoria's Secret fashion show, is already available to
workplace users accessing the Web through high-speed T1 lines.
``Our ability to reach more people during the day than traditional
media is now even stronger,'' Wagner said. ``We can scale our
business immediately to reach new users.''

six games and the division title.
</P>
<P>
   10. Alex Rodriguez is the best No. 1 pick in fantasy-league
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   11. Second best: Mike Piazza.

everywhere else in the world.

</P>
<P>
   14. Another manager is fired for lying about his military

</P>
<P>
   15. The 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron's 715th home run _ April
8 _ receives too little attention from the sports TV networks. Not
enough videotape of the event. Besides, TV is too busy putting

</P>
<P>
   16. Kevin Brown is hailed as Man of the Year by the National
Society of Emergency Plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   17. Gary Sheffield's split personalities have a meeting and work
everything out.
</P>
<P>

crowd-pleasing trick, sticking out his tongue and wiggling his
fingers in the direction of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   19. Mark McGwire continues to refuse to answer questions about
how many home runs he'll hit. He almost falls for, ``How many hits
do you expect to have, and of those, how many do you expect to be
singles, doubles and triples?''
</P>
<P>
   20. McGwire belts between 62 and 69 home runs and is asked to
account for the disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   21. Sosa is second again in the home-run race but wins
two-thirds of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   22. Because the Cardinals and Cubs miss the playoffs, McGwire
and Sosa finish 201st and 202nd in the MVP voting, behind all the
players whose teams did make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   23. NL MVP: Barry Bonds. Cy Young Award winner: John Smoltz.
Rookie of the Year: J.D. Drew, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   24. AL MVP: Albert Belle. Cy Young: Roger Clemens. Rookie: Gabe
Kapler, Detroit (causing ``Welcome Back'' to be played more than
``Glory Days'' on ballpark PA systems).
</P>
<P>
   25. Anybody who tries to do !ital!anything!off! for 56 straight
days _ shave, eat breakfast, read a newspaper _ will gain renewed
awe for Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   26. Every manager agonizes over his choice for No. 5 starter.
Every No. 5 starter goes 7-10 with a 5.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   27. Chan Ho Park outpitches Kevin Brown and demands his next
contract be worth at least as much as Mrs. Brown's airplane

cancer surgery to manage the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   29. May 2: It's a miracle _ Raul Mondesi draws a walk.
</P>
<P>
   30. Major-league umpires, ordered to enforce the traditional
knees-to-armpits, plate-wide strike zone, assert their
individuality by calling anywhere from two to four outs per inning.
</P>
<P>
   31. Broadcaster Rick Monday crosses up a radio interview subject
by asking a concise, provocative question instead of making a
rambling statement to set up a short reply.
</P>
<P>
   32. Broadcaster Joe Morgan is hailed as the best baseball
analyst in the business again for his creative use of the same word
or phrase 42 times in one sentence.
</P>
<P>
   33. The Expos will do better than everybody expects. The
Diamondbacks will do worse than everybody expects.
</P>
<P>
   34. I'll complete elaborate scoresheets, pitch by pitch and
color-coded, for all the games I attend this season. I'll keep them
all in a protective folder so that one day I can pull them out and
relive my ballpark experiences.
</P>
<P>
   35. One day this season I'll pull out those scoresheets and
relive last season _ if I ever figure out where I put the folder.
</P>
<P>
   36. I'll find a reason to hate the Yankees again. I'll find a
reason to love the Dodgers again.
</P>
<P>
   37. The Dodgers improve on last year's 83-79 record, and manager
Davey Johnson's analytical mind proves to be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   38. The proof comes in August when the Dodgers struggle while
Johnson is sidelined with a computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   39. Fifteen Yankees tie for the team lead with 20 home runs, 70
RBI and .290 averages. It's believed to be a major-league first.
</P>
<P>
   40. Yankees, four games to one, over Houston in the World
Series. &QL;

VISUAL THRILLS, MARKETING SAVVY PROPEL `MATRIX' TO RECORD OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First-day grosses of ``The Matrix'' smashed a
6-year-old record with $4.8 million at 2,704 theaters on Wednesday
as the science-fiction thriller dominated the nation's box office.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, featuring never-before-seen special
effects and starring Keanu Reeves as the leader of a rebellion
against computers, opened Wednesday to take advantage of spring
break for many teen and young adult moviegoers. Distribution chief
Dan Fellman said Thursday that exit polls showed strong positive
response from audiences, who were mostly male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people say the movie is mind-blowing and the special
effects are a cross between `Terminator' and `Blade Runner,' ''
Fellman said. ``We're extremely excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' which has received mixed reviews, easily broke
the $2.9 million mark for an Easter week Wednesday opening, set in
1993 by Paramount's ``Indecent Proposal.'' About 145 theaters will
be added today.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, credited the studio for a strong trailer, smart scheduling
and offering a unique look at virtual reality. ``There has not been
a hard action film aimed at young men since `Enemy of the State,'
so there's not a lot of competition and the effects are very
unique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a distant second on Wednesday was Disney's opening of
teen-comedy ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' loosely based on
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' with $1.2 million at
2,271 theaters. Paramount will open ``The Out-of-Towners,'' a Steve
Martin-Goldie Hawn comedy, today at 2,102 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' may energize overall box office before May 19's
opening of ``Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace.'' Year-to-date
domestic grosses have hit $1.3 billion, down 8 percent from the
``Titanic''-driven equivalent period of 1998.

CAPTURED US SOLDIERS FACE MILITARY COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Struggling on the ninth day of NATO airstrikes to
define an increasingly blighted military campaign, President
Clinton issued another impassioned appeal for support of the Kosovo
effort Thursday, at the same time strongly denouncing Serb forces
for the capture of three US soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials were investigating whether the Army unit had
accidentally crossed into Yugoslav territory on Wednesday during
training exercises in Macedonia before coming under attack.
Yugoslav officials, branding the men ``invaders,'' said they would
be hauled before a military court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite unsettling video shots of the bruised American
soldiers on Serbian TV _ alongside images of thousands of ethnic
Albanian refugees continuing to flood from the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, into neighboring regions _ both US and NATO officials
denied accusations the mission was veering off an already
ill-defined course. Clinton, speaking at the Norfolk Naval Station
in Virgina, justified the campaign in dramatic, domino-effect
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we are doing to try to avoid in the 21st
century the kind of widespread war, large American casualties and
heartbreak that we saw too much of in the century we are about to
leave,'' Clinton said. ``So this is not just about a small piece of
the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   The public entreaty came as the Pentagon announced plans to
launch a new round of fighter planes to Kosovo. Thirteen F-117A
stealth fighters, including a replacement for the F-117 downed last
week, will join the more than 200 US planes already in service in
Yugoslavia, defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt was also on its way toward
the Adriatic Sea, equipped with some 70 planes that are likely to
join the battle over Yugoslavia in the coming days. Three other
ships from the Roosevelt battle group _ a Navy cruiser, destroyer
and attack submarine, each capable of firing Tomahawk missiles _
have been authorized to take part as well, an official told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NATO airstrikes continued through the day and
into the night, with defense officials reporting a new batch of
destroyed ground targets, including a fuel storage center and a
Yugoslav army unit in central Kosovo. A key bridge over the Danube
River in the town of Novi Sad was also blown apart, and its debris
created a traffic jam in the important commercial route to the
Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Such dual-use targets important for both commercial and military
use are expected to play an increasing role in NATO strategy,
Senator John W. Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said after meeting with military officials Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can expect in the next 24 to 72 hours a broadening
of targets,'' Warner said, ``namely, targets used for both the
military and possibly some civilian use, like bridges and the
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO airstrikes began nine days ago, about 180,000 ethnic
Albanians have fled the country _ at least 100,000 to Albania,
31,000 to Macedonia and 30,000 to Montenegro, said UN spokesman
Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   Trains packed with 10,000 refugees arrived on the Macedonia
border, where UN officials described scenes of panic.
</P>
<P>
   The captured Army unit, based in Skopje, Macedonia, had been on
a training mission with two other Humvees near the border of
Yugoslavia at approximately 3 p.m. local time Wednesday. The three
men _ Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.,
Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and Spc. Steven
M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas _ detoured from the group on
a civilian road, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they were surrounded by small-arms fire. After
frantically radioing, ``They're all around us... We can't get
out,'' according to a Pentagon transcript, the patrol fell silent.
By the time NATO and local police forces launched a massive hunt,
the three had disappeared into the rugged terrain, presumably taken
at gunpoint by a Serb or Yugoslav force.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Yuk Draskovic said the troops
tried to fend off their captors, saying they ``tried to fight
physically before being captured.'' Black bruises and facial cuts
on all three were the result of that tussle, not later abuse by
Serb troops, Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was notified Wednesday afternoon of a possible capture,
just before taping a TV interview. He he did not mention the
missing soldiers in the CBS interview, but he did voice opposition
to sending in ground troops, saying he was worried about ``the
prospect of never being able to get them out.'' Pentagon officials
released news of the missing men several hours later, when it was
clear the search mission had all but failed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after images of the battered soldiers had been beamed
across Serbian TV, Clinton voiced outrage at their capture: ``There
was absolutely no basis for them to be taken. There is no basis for
them to be held. There is certainly no basis for them to be
tried.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially saying the men had been ``illegally detained,''
Pentagon officials upgraded their status, placing them in the
category of prisoners of war, which means their treatment will be
governed by the Geneva convention of 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, POWs must be treatedly humanely by their
captors, who can be tried as war criminals if they do not comply.
POWs are also required only to hand over their name, rank, serial
number and date of birth, and can be held captive until the
conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said POWs are not required
to stand trial under any circumstances, and in responding to
Yugoslav comments that the prisoners will appear in court, he said
defense officials are ``outraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said: ``President Milosevic should make no mistake:
We will hold him and his government responsible for their safety
and their well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the capture, Serbian TV showed footage of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic meeting with Ibrahim Rugova,
a leader of the ethnic Albanian majority. It was unclear whether
Rugova appeared with Milosevic voluntarily, and there were no
reports the two had reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders from several corners of the world stepped up
their pleas for the bombings to end. Russian leaders, who are in
the process of dispatching a warship to the Mediterranean, demanded
an emergency meeting of the Group of Eight industrialized nations,
with the unlikely hope of pushing a diplomatic exit strategy. Other
G-8 nations did not agree to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II repeated his plea for a weeklong
cease-fire starting Easter Sunday. In Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law
said he and the seven other US Roman Catholic cardinals were urging
Clinton and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a
ceasefire and return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric and actions of war will not bring all the parties
to a negotiating table without further, incalculable loss,'' Law
said.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO and the Clinton administration remained steadfast in
its refusal to consider a break in the airstrikes, pointing to a
broken string of promises by Milosevic during his decade-long
diplomatic history. Instead, Clinton dispatched Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott to the neighboring countries to check on their
stability and continued his own efforts in selling the mission back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world. But just because we can't do everything for everyone doesn't
mean that, for the sake of consistency, we should do nothing for no
one,'' Clinton said to the military families in Norfolk. ``We've
been doing this for seven days now, just seven days. Our pilots
have performed bravely and well in the face of dangerous conditions
and often abysmal weather. But we must be determined and patient.''

   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ It was around 4 p.m. Wednesday when the
three-man American reconnaissance unit radioed in to base to say
they had come under fire. The message went back: ``This is not a
joke?'' They replied, ``No, this is not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not have time to say where they were,'' said Lt. Col.
Eric Kersabiec, ``so we took it seriously.'' Kersabiec, commander
of the main NATO base here, said he then ordered out search parties
and sent up a helicopter with night vision to scour the border
region through the night.
</P>
<P>
   They found nothing. Thursday morning the American soldiers
turned up on Yugoslav television looking bruised and exhausted,
captives of the Belgrade authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The men, all cavalry scouts, were Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez,
24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich., and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The three, from the 1st Squadron, Fourth Cavalry of the First
Infantry Division, were among only 350 American soldiers in
Macedonia. Until recently they were part of the U.N. mission in
Macedonia, but in the last two weeks they have been used for
reconnaissance work along the border with Yugoslavia, watching for
incursions or any hostilities aimed at the NATO forces based not
far from the border.
</P>
<P>
   The men were on a routine patrol close to the Yugoslav border,
some 10 miles northeast of Kumanovo in an area of Macedonia
predominantly populated by ethnic Serbs. Their patrol would have
brought them up to the one-kilometer buffer zone before the border.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt among fellow soldiers on the ground that
they were seized by armed Serbian villagers who were cooperating
with Yugoslav forces across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong Serb minority that feels very close to
Serbia,'' Kersabiec said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said,
``Of course the Yugoslav Army obtained information from locals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the locals took them,'' said a European officer
leading a reconnaissance unit in the area. He said he suspected
that the Serbs would have been watching the soldiers and when they
spotted three men on their own, had moved in to seize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man in this area has a Kalashnikov in his house,'' he
said. ``We are in hostile territory here. We know that the threat
is not from the north, but it is all around us.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer was leading a reconnaissance unit of four armored
vehicles topped with heavy machine guns. His men were all armed
with automatic rifles, and wore heavy duty bulletproof vests,
although only some bothered with helmets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO soldiers in the area all said they had encountered
hostility from villagers who hurled stones and bricks at their
armored vehicles. One French unit was parked near a bridge where
``NATO Go Home'' was daubed in red paint.
</P>
<P>
   How the capture actually happened remained unclear Thursday. The
three men were patrolling in a Humvee, an armored vehicle that is
fast and versatile on rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fully armored and weighs about seven tons,'' said a
spokesman at the unit's base at the main airport just outside
Skopje, the Macedonian capital. The men must have been outside the
vehicle when they were apprehended, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good soldiers,'' he added. ``You don't want that to
happen to anyone, but especially when they are your friends.'' The
three men had arrived only on Feb. 16 from the squadron's base near
Wurzburg, Germany, for a six-month tour of duty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officers here made no reference to reports that the men had
been separated from a larger patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The region where they disappeared is full of curving valleys
between craggy cliffs and ridges. Small farming villages with
red-tiled houses nestle in the valleys. At the village of Pelince,
just a mile short of the border with Yugoslavia, half a dozen armed
policemen were standing outside a white-washed building.
</P>
<P>
   Several others, dressed in camouflage fatigues, disappeared
quickly inside. The men outside were Macedonian policemen, but one
man on the edge of the group had a Yugoslav flag on the sleeve of
his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Most were ethnic Serbs and clearly sympathized with their
neighbors across the border, who less than a decade ago had been
their countrymen in the old Yugoslavia. They spoke out angrily
against the NATO bombing in Serbia. ``We hear the planes and hear
the explosions as they bomb,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that they knew nothing of the missing American
servicemen but that they had seen them come through regularly on
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, working so close to the border, that the men
simply got lost, a NATO officer said. ``If you are right on the
border, you just have to turn a corner and you are in Serbia,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could have led to their capture is their
transformation overnight from being a U.N. peacekeeping task force,
to becoming, or being perceived as, the main actor in the war next
door. Their original role as a U.N. force may have made the U.S.
unit vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   American troops have been in Macedonia for three years as part
of the U.N. mission, sent in to secure the Macedonian border and
watch for any potential spillover from the wars in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.N. mission ended on Feb. 28, after China refused to
agree to further extend the mandate in Macedonia, the task force is
being dismantled. The American troops who took part in the mission
have continued their reconnaissance duties under American command,
continuing the U. N.'s job of patrolling a half-mile zone between
the border and the French and British NATO forces, based in
Kumanovo.
</P>
<P>
   The American troops are, however, not part of the NATO
peacekeeping force assembled to keep order in Kosovo in the event a
political settlement is signed. ``These guys are not used to having
trouble,'' a NATO officer said. ``They are not used to being
threatened. We, on the other hand, arrived ready as a fighting
force.''
</P>
<P>
   At the squadron's base at Skopje's airport that is all too
clear. It still looks more like a U.N. base than a U.S. Army one,
with its white vehicles and containers still bearing the U.N. name.
Soldiers were working on a line of Humvees and armored troop
carriers, newly painted a dark military green for their new
mission. The paint is still fresh and the sign at the entrance
still declares that this is a U.N. mission.

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ &UR;  &LR;  The parents of U.S. Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, one of three American soldiers captured by Serb forces,
faced cameras _ and the world _ Thursday to warn Yugoslavia not to
harm their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to consider the consequences very, very carefully,''
Rosie Gonzales said in addressing the ominous pledge to try the
captive soldiers in military court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven and these other two soldiers are not criminals and
should not be dealt with as criminals,'' she said, fighting back
tears. ``They are innocent young men over there as a duty to their
country, and it's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. servicemen, part of a United Nations peacekeeping
force, were captured Wednesday after they were surrounded by
Serbian forces as they patrolled the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has condemned the planned military trial, set
to begin Friday, as a violation of international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-minute news conference at Texas Department of Criminal
Justice headquarters, Rosie and Gilbert Gonzales, both prison
system employees, described the relief they felt when they saw a
televised video of their son and the other captives, Staff Sgt.
Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thrilled,'' the soldier's mother said. ``We had been
informed that he was missing, but we didn't know anything at all.
It was a great relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bittersweet relief,'' added his father, alluding to
the apparent beating the captives suffered at the hands of the
Serbs. ``He looked roughed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huntsville soldier's parents said he had been aware of the
danger in his military assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it in-depth,'' said Gilbert Gonzales, who
works in TDCJ's classification division.
</P>
<P>
   But though the young man discussed his desire for a military
career before dropping out of Texas A&AMP;M University in 1996, his
father admitted he still was perplexed by the decision. Although
the elder Gonzales' uncle was awarded a Purple Heart for service
during World War II, he said his family has no military tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and forth about it,'' Rosie Gonzales said. ``We
were opposed to it. But he said the big thing was the
opportunities, the travel, the acquired experiences he would not
have otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales enlisted in September 1996 and re-enlisted for two more
years in 1998. He was deployed to Germany in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Gonzales said she last spoke with her son Feb. 21, three
days before he shipped out for Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very sad,'' Rosie Gonzales said. ``But he's a
true Christian and a strong person _ stronger even than we are. I
think he will deal with it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales is the eldest of the couple's three sons. Andrew, 13,
is a middle-school student; Josh, 8, is in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzales' parents spoke with the media, TDCJ workers tied
oversized yellow ribbons to the iron railing in front of The Walls
Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood around the Gonzales' mobile home also was
adorned with yellow ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show support, for them to know that our
thoughts and prayers are with them,'' said neighbor Doug
Williamson. ``These are simple reminders that they're not the only
ones pulling for him to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gonzales' friends and former classmates were shocked to
learn what had happened to the popular young man universally
described as bright, athletic and funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those kids you went out and recruited to be in
your class,'' said Palestine High School science teacher Andy
Jones, who taught Gonzales chemistry and physics. ``You wanted a
whole class of students like him.''
</P>
<P>
   A soccer player and member of the school's cross-country team,
Gonzales was vice president of the National Honor Society, and was
on the school science team that won first place in the district in
1995, according to his former teachers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating 10th in a class of 220, he attended Texas A&AMP;M
University in College Station, where he planned to major in
engineering, former classmates added. He dropped out of college
after his freshman year to earn money to pay the remainder of his
college bills. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Kelly Williams, a former high school classmate and now a senior
in marine biology at A&AMP;M's Galveston campus, was one of the first
to alert family and friends about Gonzales' capture when she saw
the televised reports. Although authorities had not yet released
the identity of the soldiers, Williams had no doubt about Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to wiggle his ears for us and make us laugh,'' she
said. ``I recognized him immediately, because his ears were
wiggling as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the scariest feeling I think I ever had,'' she added.
``We're thousands of miles away and there's nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his family, perhaps the most concerned about Gonzales is
the soldier's boyhood friend, Tommy Russell. Friends since the
fourth grade and just six days apart in age, they joined the Army
in September 1996 under the buddy system.
</P>
<P>
   Russell talked Gonzales into joining the Army when both faced
financially tight times trying to pay for college, said Russell's
mother, Debbie McKinney of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty upset, more in shock,'' said McKinney, who
talked with her son _ who is stationed in Germany _ by phone
Thursday morning. ``He feels responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her son's unit is on alert in Germany, ready to be sent
to Kosovo on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to go over there now and fight,'' McKinney said.
``He wants to go get him out.''

ANGELS HAVE VAUGHN, BUT HE'LL NEED HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angels have experienced enough highs and lows to last a
season _ and opening day isn't until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life with the Angels, who opened camp with optimism only
to be forced to realize that it's never easy in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn to a six-year,
$80 million contract on Nov. 25 started the excitement. Then they
signed free-agent pitcher Tim Belcher to a two-year, $10.2 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those two additions to a team that had a healthy Tim Salmon, Jim
Edmonds, Gary DiSarcina, Darin Erstad, Garret Anderson, Chuck
Finley, Todd Greene and Troy Percival had the Angels thinking about
October and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then reality hit. On Feb. 21 _ days before position players were
required to report to spring training _ shortstop DiSarcina was
struck by coach George Hendrick's fungo bat, breaking a bone in
DiSarcina's left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, DiSarcina was expected to miss four to six weeks and
be ready sometime in April. A week before opening day, an
examination showed the bone had not healed to expectations and
surgery was recommended. DiSarcina, the club's most valuable player
in 1998, will miss three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Sheets, acquired in a trade with the Padres, will be the
Angels' opening-day shortstop. He's no DiSarcina, but the Angels
still have reason to think they can improve upon consecutive
second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup of Erstad, Edmonds, Vaughn, Salmon, Anderson and Greene
taking up the first six spots in the batting order is imposing. And
it is Vaughn in the heart of the order _ and clubhouse _ that is
expected to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these years we've been undermanned, but we were still
right there at the end,'' said Percival, who had 42 saves last
season. ``We've been one player away. If we make a deal, it might
put us over the top. Well, we've made that deal. Now I guess the
pressure's on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Vaughn gives the Angels a definitive leader. He
was the American League MVP in 1995. He's hit 40 or more homers in
a season twice in his career, while no Angel _ present or past _
has ever hit 40.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn can't _ and won't _ do it alone. He's not the savior,
manager Terry Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say this is something we had to have,'' said Collins,
about to begin his third season as the club's manager. ``But it's
part of the total package. He knows what it takes to win and
demands it from everybody around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those around Vaughn are plenty solid.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade, the Angels will go forward with their outfield
rotation, alternating one of the four as the designated hitter.
Anderson is the wild card because of his ability to play all three
outfield positions. He'll get the most starts at DH.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon (right field) and Edmonds (center) won't be moved around.
Erstad primarily will play in left.
</P>
<P>
   On the infield, Vaughn will man first. Randy Velarde, although
36, is in great shape and will handle second base. This week's
trade of Dave Hollins means the time is now for 22-year-old Troy
Glaus at third base. Glaus has hit well this spring and is good
with the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck, Charlie O'Brien and Greene will share the catching
duties, providing a mix of offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   As it is most years with the Angels, it's not offense that
causes Collins to run for the antacid. The team's success _ and
hopes of surpassing the Texas Rangers and holding off the Seattle
Mariners in the AL West _ hinges on the arms of its pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Belcher to the starting rotation gives the
Angels a solid top three when joined with Finley and Ken Hill,
who's coming off surgery. The Angels need No.4 starter Steve Sparks
and No.5 starter Omar Olivares to produce like they did last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have three very good No.2-type guys,'' Collins
said of Finley, Belcher and Hill. ``You're talking about
durability, guys that give you innings. That means a lot. All three
guys can keep us from having losing streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scarcity of pitching these days _ Texas failed to land
a No.1 starter in the offseason and Seattle lost its ace, Randy
Johnson, last year and has remade its nuclear bullpen _ that may be
enough to advance to the playoffs for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A strength of the pitching staff is the bullpen, which is
anchored by Percival. Shigetoshi Hasegawa has become Percival's top
set-up man. Former Royal Mike Magnante joins Mike Holtz as the
lefties. Ex-Cardinal Mark Petkovsek _ who can also start, if needed
_ is another newcomer to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the guys stay healthy, we're going to win, we're going
to the playoffs,'' Salmon said before DiSarcina's latest setback.
``I don't think this team will finish second. We're that kind of
team.''

<P>
   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ A bold attempt to right past wrongs and bring
hope to an entire region was launched as Thursday began and the map
of Canada was redrawn to make room for the new territory of
Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, with the wind chill here hovering around 45 below
zero, Ottawa divided the old Northwest Territories in two, and
Nunavut, which means ``our land,'' was created from the eastern 60
percent of the region, with this remote city of 4,500 residents
becoming the capital of the new territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we affirm today, with the stroke of a pen, is the end of
a very long road,'' said Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who came to
Iqaluit Thursday morning from Newfoundland, which is celebrating
its own admission to Canada 50 years ago _ the last major change in
the country's map before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Chretien called Nunavut a ``rare and precious
opportunity,'' other Canadians criticized it as a waste of money
and, worse, a dangerous precedent for fostering racial tribalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-fifth of Canada will be put under a government whose
purpose it is to represent one ethnic group,'' The Ottawa Citizen
said in a recent editorial. ``Canada will have its first Bantustan,
an apartheid-style ethnic homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Nunavut (NOO-na-voot) caps a notable
transformation not only for northern Canada's residents but for all
Eskimos in polar regions around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   With Nunavut firmly in the hands of Eskimos, a people also
called Inuit, roughly two-thirds of the estimated 150,000 Eskimos
on earth, including about 7,000 in Alaska, have won some degree of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now like a chain stretching from Greenland to the
Russian Far East,'' said Oran R. Young, director of the Dickey
Institute of Arctic Studies at Dartmouth College, ``and Nunavut is
a huge link in this chain.''
</P>
<P>
   What is even more remarkable about Nunavut is that by
conventional measures of political influence, like the votes they
control or the funds they have access to, the new territory's
27,000 residents _ 85 percent of them Eskimos _ would have been
considered almost powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, over a generation, using a mixture of patience and
compromise that reflected traditional Eskimo ways, they have made
notable strides that are being watched by indigenous groups around
the world. And what they accomplished they did without the court
battles, angry protests or sporadic violence that has marked
movements for American Indian rights throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to suggest the process of creating Nunavut was
easy or painless. The first Eskimo call for a new territory came in
1976, and the law creating Nunavut was not enacted until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That law also settled the largest native land claim in Canada's
history, giving the Eskimos _ who had never signed a treaty with
the Canadian government _ outright title to 135,000 square miles of
their traditional territory, with mineral rights in about one-tenth
of that space.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the Eskimos surrendered claim to all other
land in the north and accepted a financial settlement that will
exceed $1 billion over 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut encompasses 770,000 square miles of ice and snow that
becomes a riot of mud and color in the brief spring and summer.
Roughly equal in size to the land mass of Mexico, its southern
boundary roughly follows the tree line above the province of
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   It stretches north to the very top of the world. On the east it
is bounded by Quebec's Ungava Peninsula. Nunavut's uneven western
boundary was drawn to exclude the city of Yellowknife and the newly
opened diamond mine near Lac de Gras.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Nunavut is a territory like Yukon and the Northwest
Territories, which have smaller populations and fewer taxing powers
than Canada's provinces. Nunavut's nonpartisan government is open
to every resident, Eskimo or not. But demographics make this an
Eskimo territory now and will see that it stays that way for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the first local Parliament, sworn in Thursday at the local
high school, 15 of the 19 legislators are Eskimo. And although some
critics worry that Nunavut will exclude non-Eskimo, the first
premier of Nunavut, Paul Okalik, a 34-year-old Eskimo lawyer, made
clear Thursday that that would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have established a public government that will represent
all the people of Nunavut equally and democratically,'' Okalik said
during a ceremony introducing Nunavut's new flag.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other critics question the need for one more layer of
government. ``The federal government has committed $1 billion to
Nunavut,'' said Mike Scott, an opposition member of the federal
Parliament from British Columbia and Indian affairs critic for the
Reform Party. ``That is a staggering price-tag for some
questionable gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rump state that remains in the West will continue to be
called the Northwest Territories. Its population is more racially
mixed than Nunavut's. After division, 52 percent of its 40,000
residents are nonindigenous, 10 percent Eskimo and the rest from
various Indian nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut's challenges are enormous. It starts out with some of
Canada's highest rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance
abuse, and suicide. More than 90 percent of its annual budget comes
from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   There are few industries and even fewer roads. At least at the
beginning, Okalik, the new premier, believes the government itself
will be the engine of economic growth, the contemporary equivalent
of the transcontinental railroad that brought opportunity to the
West a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the 56 percent of Nunavut's people who are under 25 years
old, Nunavut represents a new world. ``Inuit power!'' said Darcy
Kablalik, 23, who came to attend the ceremonies from Rankin Inlet.
``We've been waiting for this for a long time.''

BATTLE OF LEGALISMS RAGES OVER CAPTURED U.S. SOLDIERS 

</HEADLINE>

and KOSOVO-NATO.)

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The capture of three U.S. soldiers Wednesday by
Serbian forces has ignited a debate over legal semantics between
the United States and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon on Thursday called Spc. Steven M. Gonzales and
Staff Sgts. Andrew A. Ramirez and Christopher J. Stone ``prisoners
of war.'' But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has refused to
call them war prisoners, saying Yugoslavia has not declared war on
the United States or its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has threatened to put the three men on trial as early
as Friday, but has not said what the charges would be.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the balance in this battle of legalisms is the
responsibility that Milosevic has under international law for the
captives' safety.
</P>
<P>
   By calling the three Americans prisoners of war, the United
States has insisted that Yugoslavia comply with the Geneva
Convention, a 1949 international agreement that applies rules to
the conduct of war. The accord prohibits captors from mistreating,
even insulting, prisoners of war, and requires that injured and
sick captives receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The convention also requires that prisoners placed on trial have
an opportunity to present a defense and be represented by a
``qualified advocate or counsel.'' Prisoners are obliged to provide
only their first and last names, ranks, dates of birth and serial
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But by classifying the servicemen as war prisoners, the United
States has also given Yugoslavia legal authority to hold the
soldiers until the armed conflict ends, said international law
expert Scott Silliman, a Duke University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's classification of the three soldiers as prisoners
of war followed Defense Secretary William Cohen's description of
them earlier Thursday as ``illegal detainees.``
</P>
<P>
   As illegal detainees, Yugoslavia would have been obligated to
release them immediately. In addition, Milosevic would have had no
legal authority to investigate the soldiers' activities or to put
them on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider them to be prisoners of war and covered by the
Geneva Convention,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said several
hours after Cohen's comments about detainee status.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's updated classification removed a seeming
contradiction in the way the United States wanted the servicemen to
be treated. Even as Cohen declined to call the three men prisoners
of war, he and State Department spokesman James Rubin insisted that
Yugoslavia extend Geneva Convention protections to the captives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're prisoners, clearly,'' Rubin said. ``We're not in a
state of war, but nevertheless, the international lawyers advise me
that the requirements that they be treated humanely, that they get
the necessary medical attention, that they're protected from any
form of coercion, that they get the adequate food and clothing,
that they get access by ... the International Committee of the Red
Cross still pertain.``
</P>
<P>
   Silliman agreed with the State Department that Milosevic has a
duty to safeguard the Americans. He said the captives are ``at the
very least'' protected by the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The convention protects the three men, even though the United
States has not declared war, because it applies to members of armed
forces not only in war but in the wider category of armed conflict,
added Silliman, executive director of Duke's Center on Law, Ethics
and National Security.
</P>
<P>
   The professor also said that the Pentagon and State Department
had a very strong argument that the captives were illegal
detainees, not prisoners of war. The soldiers, arguably, were not
combatants but part of a U.N. peacekeeping force to protect
Macedonia from the spread of the Yugoslav conflict, Silliman said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers operating under orders not to fire except in
self-defense are not considered combatants under international law,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   That peace effort officially expired Feb. 28, after China vetoed
a U.N. Security Council proposal to extend the mission, but the UN
flag under which the soldiers were operating reportedly had not
been taken down by the time of their capture.
</P>
<P>
   The legal question that arises is whether the mission ended Feb.
28 or if the troops continued to enjoy U.N. protection because the
organization's flag was still flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time they were captured, who owned them and what was
their legal status?'' Silliman said, noting the unresolved issue of
whether the soldiers were still on the U.N. assignment when they
were taken. ``It's a very, very unusual fact situation that we're
trying to sort out.``
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, despite calling the servicemen prisoners of war,
is investigating the circumstances of their capture _ an
examination that could lead to a change in their classification,
University of Houston law professor Jordan Paust said. The
Pentagon's investigation will focus, in part, on establishing
whether the Americans were taken in Macedonia or captured in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   If they were taken in Macedonia, a neutral country and the site
of the U.N. operation, their capture was clearly illegal and they
must be returned immediately, Paust said. But if they were captured
in Yugoslavia, a nation embroiled in an armed conflict with the
United States, they might well be regarded as prisoners of war,
added the professor, an expert in international law.
</P>
<P>
   An incursion by Yugoslav troops into Macedonia would be a
violation of that country's ``territorial integrity,'' and
Macedonian leaders would be justified in pressing Yugoslavia to
release the Americans, Paust said. President Clinton should enlist
the help of the Macedonian government in seeking the soldiers'
freedom, the professor added.
</P>
<P>
   But if the U.S. troops were in Yugoslavia on a reconnaissance
mission, Yugoslav forces would be justified in capturing the
Americans and holding them as prisoners of war. However, if the
soldiers mistakenly wandered into Yugoslavia, they should be
immediately released because their presence there would have been
related to the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Paust said.
</P>
<P>
   In such a circumstance, Clinton could urge UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to press Yugoslavia to release the captives, the
professor added.
</P>
<P>
   Paust also took issue with Yugoslavia's decision to televise the
three Americans shortly after their capture, saying such a public
display might qualify as the type of ``insult'' of war prisoners
that the Geneva Convention expressly prohibits. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO expanded the scope of its raids on Yugoslavia
Thursday, attacking a military unit whose armored personnel
carriers were involved in the killing of ethnic Albanians in
central Kosovo, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American warplanes also destroyed a bridge over the Danube, the
first target, the officials said, that could disrupt the lives of
ordinary Serbs, not just the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of having three American soldiers captured and shown
on Yugoslavia's official television did not affect the pace or
intensity of Thursday's raids, officials here and in Europe said.
The weather, however, did, once again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air and missile strikes began nine days ago, American
and allied fighters and bombers have had only one day largely
uninterrupted by rain and fog, that makes striking targets on the
ground infinitely more difficult, even for pilots flying the most
advanced airplanes and firing the most sophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   American officials provided scant details about Thursday's
bombing. They declined to say which targets were hit in central
Kosovo or whether the attacks were carried out by cruise missiles
or warplanes. They also did not explain why NATO left intact one of
the two bridges that cross the Danube River in the Yugoslav city of
Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   The United States reacted angrily Thursday to reports from
Yugoslavia that the soldiers might be put on trial, saying this
would be a violation of international law. The Pentagon asserted
Thursday night that the captured three Americans, who were seized
near the border between Macedonia and Yugoslavia, should be
considered prisoners of war and treated according to the rules of
the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than a day after the soldiers disappeared, there was still
considerable confusion about the circumstances of their capture,
with conflicting reports on their location and mission along a
rough, hostile border with little firepower backing them up.
American and NATO forces in Macedonia did not call off the search
for the three until they were seen, looking battered and bruised,
on Serbian television.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials acknowledged that the Serbs were pressing
ahead with their attacks in Kosovo, and one said that Belgrade had
already achieved many of its military objectives. But the officials
said that in recent days, the air attacks had begun to diminish the
Serbs' ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said at the alliance
headquarters that the the strikes had already caused ``substantial
damage'' to the armed forces involved in the crackdown against
ethnic Albanians, who make up most of Kosovo's population. NATO's
secretary general, Javier Solana, said that while NATO's raids have
been hampered, they were having a cumulative impact on the forces
of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ring is closing around the Yugoslav armed forces,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat said that after nine days of bombardments
there were indications that the Yugoslavs were having problems
receiving ammunition and fuel, though refugees continued to leave
their villages and head for Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and
Albania. American and NATO forces have struck several depots used
to stockpile supplies, including another fuel depot in Kosovo
Thursday, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a briefing on Capitol Hill, the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, said that in the last
48 hours there had been ``positive signs that this air campaign is
causing problems for Milosevic's deployed troops conducting ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tanks and other military vehicles are running short on
fuel,'' the Virginia Republican said. ``Food and ammunition is
running short. And we're having, I think, a considerable success
rate in destroying their supply depots.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the NATO commander, said the air war now included ``a
slightly larger array of targets,'' including some of Yugoslavia's
civilian structures, which have nominal military uses. He dismissed
Serbian charges that NATO was targeting civilians, but said NATO's
forces would pound any target thought to aid Yugoslavia's military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as it's drawing reinforcements and supplies and extra
materiel and so forth from throughout Yugoslavia,'' he said, ``the
routes throughout Yugoslavia are legitimate targets. And when we
deem it appropriate, then they will be struck.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge over the Danube, Europe's longest waterway, was
struck before dawn in the city of Novi Sad, northwest of Yugoslav's
capital and far from the crackdown in Kosovo. The steel suspension
span was one of two that cross the river near Novi Sad's center. A
squadron of American F-15 strike jets left it a crumpled mass in
the river.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday night why NATO forces did not attack
Novi Sad's other bridge or major transit points in other parts of
Yugoslavia, though officials said much of the decisions on striking
targets swung with the fickleness of Balkan weather. They did not
rule out that the other, older bridge in Novi Sad could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   Senior NATO and American officials said the expansion of targets
would accelerate as the weather cleared, which forecasts predict it
will by the weekend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NATO's political leadership approved the expansion of targets at
a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials have repeatedly said they have the
forces they need to wage the air war against Yugoslavia, the United
States and other NATO powers, including Britain and France, have
bolstered the number of aircraft in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the United States dispatched five B-1 bombers.
Thursday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered 13 more F-117
``stealth'' fighters to Italy. They will join 11 others that have
been taking part in the raids. A 12th F-117 was shot down over
Serbia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Navy warships _ the Ross, a destroyer, and the Vella
Gulf, a cruiser _ entered the Mediterranean Thursday loaded with
cruise missiles and are expected to join the assault soon. The
aircraft carrier, Theodore Roosevelt, is expected to arrive by the
weekend, bringing with it some 75 aircraft, 50 of them combat jets.
</P>
<P>
   The question remained: would they arrive soon enough? A senior
Pentagon official said that Milosevic's forces, although pummeled,
appeared to be wrapping up a campaign to carve out a Serb-enclave
in Kosovo, having cornered the last remnants of ethnic Albanian
rebels known as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically got every objective he wanted,'' the official
said, citing intelligence reports from Kosovo. ``He's destroyed the
KLA and chased everyone else out.''
</P>
<P>
   American warplanes have flown 60 to 70 percent of the strikes,
largely because the United States has more aircraft suited to foul
weather and able to evade radar, a Pentagon official said. But the
allied contribution has been significant, making up at least half
the total missions flown.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has repeatedly refused to quantify how many missions have
been flown in the air war or break them down by country or
distinguish between bombing runs and support activities such as
refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's raids were overshadowed by the seizure of the
Americans, something that the White House and the Pentagon,
recalling the capture of American troops in Somalia in 1993, had
deeply feared.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in Norfolk, Va., initially described the three soldiers
as ``illegal detainees'' rather than prisoners of war, but by the
end of the day, the Pentagon described them as POWs and demanded
that they not be brought before a military trial in Kosovo, as the
Yugoslav authorities threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday evening that
depending on the circumstances of their capture _ namely whether
they were inside Macedonia or had strayed into Serbia _ the three
``may be'' entitled to immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, pending an investigation and, ideally, the direct
questioning of the three, ``our belief'' is that they did not
violate the Yugoslav border. ``The soldiers should be released
immediately,'' he said at another point, contending that ``at a
minimum'' they were entitled to the protections of the Geneva
Convention, which calls for the humane treatment of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the border tensions of the situation, some critics
questioned whether the three soldiers observed regulations and
should have been better protected by operating within some larger
formation better able to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded,'' said a retired senior Army officer familiar
with the Balkans. ``In Bosnia, we figured one of our
vulnerabilities was a hostage snatch or an ambush.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said their capture raised questions. He said the United
States had been on ``full notice'' that the Serbs ``would like to
seize'' a NATO serviceman. ``And that's precisely what happened,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon declined to say whether lax procedures might have been a
factor, but said an investigation was underway. ``I don't think
I'll second-guess what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said a possibility was that the Americans inadvertently crossed the
border while fleeing an ambush by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that among the many unknown factors was
whether they were captured by Yugoslav troops or border police or
by some of the many local Macedonian Serb villagers who are armed
and openly sympathize with the Yugoslav Serbs. Scores of troops and
several helicopters, Bacon said, were dispatched in a ``massive''
search for the three in poor weather, without result. The Americans
armored vehicle _ a Humvee _ remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that three Humvees had been on patrol, then split up
``to do some individual training exercises'' that he did not
otherwise describe. They had been working near a border observation
post inside Macedonia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would hold the Yugoslav authorities responsible
for their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen their pictures,'' he said. ``We don't like it.
We don't like the way they're treated. And we have a long memory
about these kinds of things.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A coyote was first spotted Tuesday night in Central
Park by an alert police officer. The next night, he was spotted
again, and dozens of officers were called in to join the search. As
a police helicopter buzzed overhead, he emerged from the brambles,
running furiously. Then, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Far from an April Fool's joke, it almost seemed that some
character out of the Old West had stormed into town and a posse had
mobilized to bring him to bay. In fact, the coyote was a terrified
fugitive, and after the police were able to corner him, he was
tranquilized, captured and left to await his fate: a short stay at
the Bronx Zoo and a trip to the wilds upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials say that coyotes have become an increasing
presence in New York City, particularly in the Bronx, but how one
got onto the island of Manhattan _ and more specifically, into
Central Park in the shadows of some of New York's grandest
apartment buildings _ remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   At first, parks and animal care officials were not sure the
animal was a coyote, and not some scruffy mutt. But he matched the
basic descriptions: a burnished silver coat with black detailing,
legs and snout the color of a bad sunburn. His tail, which he held
low as he ran, was classic coyote.
</P>
<P>
   After his capture, animal care officials verified his identity,
and said that he would get a full physical examination Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, coyotes lived only in Western states, but they have
spread to every state except Hawaii. Despite determined efforts by
ranchers and others to eradicate them, there are believed to be
about twice as many as there were in 1850, according to the
May-June issue of Audubon magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes are spreading not just in ranching country but in
metropolises nationwide, from the suburbs of Los Angeles to the
streets of New York City,'' the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Stern, the city's park commissioner, said that in recent
years, coyotes have been regularly sighted in the Bronx, in Van
Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn Cemetery. A coyote that was found dead
on the Major Deegan Expressway is now on display _ in a stuffed
state _ in the Arsenal, the Park's Department's headquarters in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials think it most likely Thursday's coyote came from
the Bronx, probably crossing the Henry Hudson Bridge. Adding
credence to this theory was a report from a Parks Department office
worker that she saw an animal that could have been a coyote on
Saturday, at 149th Street and Riverside Drive, a possible route
down from the Bronx. How it then may have navigated through the
West Side remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. Thursday, a small army of reporters had shown up at a
news conference, drawn by the story of the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Stern emphasized the coyote was probably not dangerous, though
he suggested people might not want to unleash their dogs, alluding
to his current crackdown on dogs who are allowed to run loose. The
news conference came to an abrupt end when word arrived that police
and park workers had the coyote cornered in the Hallett Nature
Sanctuary, a four-acre preserve that is fenced and closed to the
public except for occasional guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who had gathered at the Bethesda Fountain, just north
of 72nd Street, raced to the southeastern corner of the park,
joining police cars, park enforcement vehicles and ambulances. The
coyote charged in and out of view, as the police repeatedly fired
tranquilizer darts that fell well behind the speedy animal.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, the animal dived into a nearby pond. He swam
furiously, finally pulling himself onto a rock. He was hit by a
tranquilizer dart, then another. He tore off, finally slowing seven
blocks away near a World War I monument. He staggered, then
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   For all the excitement, most Central Park visitors seemed
oblivious. Joggers jogged, ice skaters skated and people lined up
for hot dogs. A man with a golden cocker spaniel asked what all the
commotion was about, then nodded and walked silently on.

<P>
   A dreaded symbol of war began to mark the landscape in three
communities Thursday, as friends and family of the American
soldiers captured along the border of Macedonia and Kosovo hung
yellow ribbons on their clothing, in their yards and along the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers, who are members of the U.S. First Infantry
Division that has patrolled the border for several years, were
taken prisoner on Wednesday by Serbian forces. The sight of the
soldiers appearing bruised and scarred on Serbian television came
as bittersweet comfort for their families, who had earlier received
word that they were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's alive,'' a half-relieved Gilbert Gonzales said of his
son, Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas.
``He's blinking his eyes. But we don't know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, whose forces have
been the target of NATO bombing since last week, has announced that
a military inquiry will determine whether to try the three men. The
other two soldiers being held are Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In the prisoners' hometowns, friends and relatives recalled the
days when the three soldiers were growing from boys to men. Mario
Rios, who lives two doors down from the modest, well-kept East Los
Angeles home where Ramirez grew up, described him as a child who
stayed out of trouble and was determined to follow in the footsteps
of his older brother, Steven Ramirez, who served in the Army and is
now a member of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Steve liked, Andy liked,'' Ms. Rios said. ``He wanted to
be just like his brother, and everything that the brother wanted to
do, he wanted to do.'' After graduating from Schurr High School in
nearby Montebello in 1992, Ramirez enlisted in the Army that year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither his brother nor parents were available for comment on
Thursday. Relatives said that Ramirez's parents were separated, but
that his father still lived in the house where he grew up. No one
appeared to be home there Thursday, but friends and relatives
gathered at the house throughout the day, praying and placing
bouquets of flowers at the doorstep, and hanging yellow ribbons and
American flags throughout the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home, Robert Carcano, a cousin of Ramirez and an
officer with the Montebello police department, said the news of the
capture sickened him. ``It's family _ it really hit home,'' he
said, adding that he still supports the NATO involvement in Kosovo.
``I'm behind what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, Texas, where both parents of Gonzales work for
the Texas Department of Corrections, yellow ribbons were hanging
outside the entrance to the prison's infamous Wall Unit, the
execution site for death row inmates. Inside one of the prison
buildings, the parents, surrounded by colleagues with yellow
ribbons pinned to their clothing, held a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Rosie Gonzales, decried the Yugoslav government's
suggestion that the three men may be put on trial. ``These soldiers
are not criminals, and they should not be dealt with as
criminals,'' she said. ``They are innocent young men who are over
there as part of their duty.''
</P>
<P>
   His father commented on the apparent condition of the soldiers
after seeing them on television. ``They looked in pretty good
spirits,'' Gilbert Gonzales said. ``They were standing tall with
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who was an honor student and athlete at Palestine High
School in Palestine, Texas, attended Texas A &AMP; M University for one
year before deciding to join the Army in 1996. He had just
re-enlisted, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good student,'' recalled Andy Jones, a physics
teacher at the high school, which is 60 miles north of Huntsville.
The family moved to Huntsville after Gonzales graduated in 1995.
``I'm sure whatever the military has taught him, he knows very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another teacher at the school, Richard Sylvester, agreed. ``This
kid has all the discipline he needs to get through about any
situation in life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, some of Stone's relatives gathered at a
candlelight prayer vigil near the Michigan town of Capac, the
rural, tight-knit community where he grew up. ``At first we thought
he was dead,'' said Dianna Stone, Stone's 29-year-old sister. ``We
had some mixed emotions when we saw him on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's wife, Tricia, and 4-year-old son, Ryan, are living in
the San Antonio, Texas, area, and could not be reached. Stone's
mother died when he was young and his father lives near Capac,
which is located 80 miles north of Detroit. Another sister, Dawn
Reliford, 31, also attended the prayer vigil, along with her
husband, Mike Reliford, who described his brother-in-law as ``a
smooth talker'' who ``could talk his way in and out of any
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members had just received a letter from Stone last week,
which he wrote prior to the start of the NATO bombing. In the
letter, he was in good spirits and said that he expected to come
home soon. ``I know he'll tough it out, no matter what they do to
him,'' said Reliford. ``He'll be strong and he'll be a good
American soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach and history teacher at
Capac High School, said that although he was an average student and
an average athlete, he had one superior quality. ``He never quit,''
Marzka said. ``He'd be behind by 15 or 20 yards and finish as
strong as he could without ever giving up.'' Stone graduated from
the school in 1991 and enlisted in the Army the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Ellis, 18, a senior at Capac High School, said that
students there Thursday were stunned by the news of Stone's
capture. ``We thought it was an April Fool's joke,'' she said. She
and other students spent the afternoon on Main Street in Capac,
hanging yellow ribbons on lamp posts, trees, and storefronts.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The capture of three U.S. soldiers in the Balkans
suddenly brought home to many Americans on Thursday the cost and
dangers of war in a distant land.
</P>
<P>
   With the public ambivalent and Congress uneasy about NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, President Clinton sought Thursday to
reassure Americans about the nation's commitment to the three
soldiers, including Spec. Steven Gonzales of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Farer, dean of the graduate school of international studies
at the University of Denver, said TV images of the battered Army
enlisted men ``demonizes'' the conflict for Americans who are
trying to form opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does having three of our men seized undermine public
opinion?'' Farer asked rhetorically. ``I think it will harden it.
But it's hard to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Crockett, Texas, whose 2nd Congressional
District includes Gonzales' hometown of Huntsville, said he has
been working with the Pentagon to get information to the
serviceman's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really strengthens our resolve,'' Turner said of
the soldiers' capture, speaking in a telephone interview. ``It's
important for us to exhibit our resolve and wait for the airstrikes
to take their toll. I think Americans rally around the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Texas lawmaker took an opposing view. Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Surfside, an outspoken critic of the war effort, said Thursday:
``I would hope this would wake up the American people not just in
terms of money but in terms of lives. I would think public opinion
would be against this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The offices of both Texas senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and
Kay Bailey Hutchison, reported that calls and e-mails are
overwhelmingly against further U.S. involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Gramm reiterated his opposition to the U.S.
presence, but added: ``The three soldiers who were captured had no
role in the operation against Yugoslavia. They should be released
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A previous case of Americans held captive overseas _ 52
Americans seized by Iranian militants at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
in 1979 _ affected all aspects of U.S. policy and ultimately the
1980 presidential election. Republican nominee Ronald Reagan
depicted President Carter as weak and ineffectual, and Reagan won
the election.
</P>
<P>
   L. Bruce Laingen, the highest-ranking foreign service officer
held in Iran, said Thursday of the captive soldiers: ``They'll be
all right physically. It'll be uncomfortable psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   As for broader impact, Laingen said that the episode is ``a
small incident'' that is very different from the hostage crisis in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Laingen, president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, said
his heart goes out to the young servicemen, but ``I do not think it
should affect policy in any way except to deepen anger'' at
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.''

<P>
   One perception driving the Clinton administration's strategy of
carrying out punishing NATO airstrikes against Slobodan Milosevic
is the idea that the only language he understands is force.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, this view goes, a NATO bombing campaign compelled
Milosevic and his Bosnian Serb allies to end the three-year war in
Bosnia. Another round of airstrikes might therefore break the will
of the Yugoslav leadership and force Milosevic to halt his attacks
on Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnia and Kosovo are very different. And it was not NATO
bombing alone, but a mix of politics, diplomacy and military
pressure that brought Milosevic to the negotiating table over
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things these conflicts have in common is that they're
in the same geographic area,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military
expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. ``What was going on in Bosnia was completely different
politically, historically and emotionally from what is going on in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that they did take the differences
into account. Where they miscalculated, they said, was in
predicting Milosevic's behavior. ``I don't think people, because
most of us are human, expected it to be quite as brutal as this,''
said a Pentagon planner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The
fact that it has been as broad and deep as it has been has been a
bit of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO did unleash a two-week bombing campaign against the Bosnian
Serbs in August and September 1995 that played a pivotal role in
bringing peace to the region, experts said. But it was in
conjunction with a successful Croatian army offensive in western
Bosnia that bit into Bosnian Serb holdings, and it was preceded by
months of diplomatic negotiations with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO strikes began in Bosnia, Milosevic had already
been saying that he was ready to make peace, as chief negotiator
Richard Holbrooke notes in his memoir. The problem, Milosevic had
told Western diplomats, was the recalcitrance of Bosnian Serb
leaders Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the 1995 airstrikes, Milosevic won a key
concession from Karadzic _ the right to represent the Bosnian Serbs
at peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes then continued for two more weeks until the Bosnian
Serbs, in particular Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb
army, agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a joint offensive by Bosnian Muslim and Croatian forces
dramatically shifted the distribution of key Bosnian territory,
making it easier for negotiators to draw the complex maps that
eventually divided the country into a Bosnian Serb republic and a
Muslim-Croat Federation loosely united under joint federal
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pape, a Dartmouth College professor and expert on air
power, said that unlike the situation the Serbs face today in
Kosovo, actual or threatened NATO bombing in 1995 was backed by a
credible threat from ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, the air power and the Croatian and Muslim ground
forces were working as a hammer and anvil,'' he said. ``Right now,
there is only a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo today is
the pressure now on the alliance to succeed before Milosevic's
forces sweep a majority of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could wait for good weather in Bosnia,'' said Michael
O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution. ``In this case,
we're racing against the ethnic-cleansing clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo also represents far more to Milosevic than the
Serb-controlled chunks of Bosnia and Croatia did. When some of
those lands were lost in 1995, Milosevic had little to fear from
opponents in his power base in Serbia proper, where few people were
prepared to die or suffer on behalf of Bosnian or Croatian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbs view Kosovo as the birthplace of the Serbian nation.
Milosevic rose to power by supporting the cause of Kosovo's Serbian
minority. He has apparently concluded that it would be politically
fatal to relinquish it _ and, if so, then only in a destructive
fight with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   That has left the Clinton administration scrambling. ``From
beginning to end, Milosevic was seen as someone who would negotiate
in terms of brinkmanship,'' Cordesman said. ``It is patently
obvious that we did not plan for this.''

   TIRANA, Albania _ A spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army
said Thursday that guerrillas in Kosovo are aiding NATO forces in
their bombing campaign of Serbian targets in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist insurgents are cooperating with NATO air-raid
operations in targeting, Jakub Krasniqi, a spokesman for the
rebels, said at a news conference here. Krasniqi gave no specifics
on how the guerrillas are helping NATO forces to pinpoint targets
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ethnic Albanian rebels on the ground, severely
outnumbered and underarmed, have not tried any offensives against
Serbian forces since the bombing campaign began. He asked that NATO
ground troops intervene in Kosovo. If not, he said, the West should
arm the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi's remarks were aimed at buoying the morale of his
movement, which is badly shaken by Serbian attacks and the
widespread reports of Serbian looting and burning of villages and
the forced flight of tens of thousands of civilians. The rebel
movement was also dealt a blow Thursday by a joint appearance in
Belgrade of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and one of
the best-known leaders of Kosovo ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova,
who called for a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that he was coerced, and that the statement was
extracted by force, or because he was afraid, Krasniqi said. But if
he made the declaration voluntarily, he said, then he has committed
high treason.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi, who was accompanied by Xhavit Halitaj , a member of
the political directorate of the rebels' general staff, arrived in
Albania last night from the Kosovo capital, Pristina, traveling
over hard mountain paths. He appealed emotionally for arms and
assistance for the beleagured rebels, saying, ``We demand the
intervention of ground forces in Kosovo.'' He added: ``If NATO
troops will not go in, then they must immediately arm the KLA. If
they do not arm us, then NATO must go in.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel spokesman said the peace agreement that the Kosovo
negotiators signed at Rambouillet has lost its sense. He said the
United States, the international community and the European Union
should recognize the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And to that end, he also said the rebels had ordered ``a general
mobilization among Kosovar men, to defend the dignity and survival
of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night the rebel army issued a statement that was
broadcast on Albanian television, ordering all Kosovo Albanian men
between the ages of 18 and 50 to join its ranks within one month.
The statement said the rebels are setting up training camps in
Kosovo for new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   If the men refuse to join the rebel army, the general staff
warned that its military police ``will act even outside Kosovo,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much coercion had been used to persuade men
and boys to leave their families and report to makeshift camps,
which the rebels maintain in the Albanian hills a few miles west of
the border. Kraniji declined to discuss the recruitment campaign,
saying only that those who are ordering the mobilization are also
giving thought to training.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that some travelers said they had
seen rebel soldiers taking men off buses that have been ferrying
refugees from nearby Kukes to other towns and cities in Albania for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, in the tent city where 2,000 Kosovo refugees have
been sheltered under Albanian Army tents, supporters of the rebels,
like Albanian and Italian evangelical Christians who are handing
out bibles and Christian pamphlets to Muslim refugees, are free to
mingle with the refugees and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Agron Ramai, a 22-year-old refugee from a village near Pritzen,
said he was well aware of the call to arms, and said he would
comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to get my family safe and settled,'' he said,
``and then I will go back. Kosovo has to be liberated and nobody
else can do it but us.''

 Column: Individual Shareholders Have the Power With New Web Site
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
You may not know Mark Coker, but he's in your corner.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old public relations executive from Los Gatos has
launched a Web site that is intended to bolster the rights of
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   The site,  &LR; www.BestCalls.com &LR; , is a free directory listing
thousands of company teleconference calls, and it could become a
revolutionary tool in the small investor's battle against selective
disclosure of material information.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists the schedules and access information for analyst
telephone conference calls, which often are closed to mom-and-pop
investors. By registering at the site, investors can have e-mails
sent to them telling when companies whose stock they own have
scheduled such conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't created a Web site, we've created a cause,'' Coker
says.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial Coker bootstrapped the site's startup, using
his own cash and employees from his small public relations firm.
While he doesn't charge companies or users of the site, he hopes to
sell advertising to fund the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the site is already running high. It's no secret
that the playing field isn't always level between Wall Street's big
guns and the little guy. And one of the advantages that major
shareholders often enjoy is access to telephone conference calls
that companies conduct shortly after reporting their quarterly
financial results, usually after the market has closed.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations often invite a select audience to listen to their
chief executives and chief financial officers explain their most
recent performance. The clubby group often includes sell-side
financial analysts from brokerages, buy-side analysts and portfolio
managers from institutional investors such as mutual funds,
individuals with big stakes in the company and sometimes members of
the press.
</P>
<P>
   An immense amount of information is sometimes exchanged during
these briefings, which usually are toll-free with the companies
picking up the tabs. Analysts are encouraged to ask questions while
individual investors, when allowed to participate, are not. The
press is sometimes allowed to listen but usually banned from asking
questions (which is appealing to some, I suppose).
</P>
<P>
   Interesting tidbits that aren't included in press releases often
are revealed during these sessions. And Coker wants all
shareholders to be able to hear the information at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it's a mixed bag. Some companies, such as Yahoo and
Inktomi, open their conference calls to all shareholders and the
press. Others, meantime, allow only Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some companies provide free taped-delay versions
via telephone or the Internet at scattered times after the
briefing. Proponents of this approach argue that every investor
doesn't need to hear the briefing live because the markets are
closed, and all shareholders have plenty of time to digest the
information before the next day's opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some companies allow investors but ban the
press. Or, conversely, others prohibit small investors from
listening to the calls but allow news organizations instead.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is
vague on the issue, which leaves companies scratching their heads.
Some advisers, such as securities lawyer Boris Feldman of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto, advocate letting the press
act as a proxy for the rest of the market. As long as most of the
sell-side financial analysts and major wire services are on the
call, the marketplace is getting the information in a fair and
efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman says companies aren't obligated to include investors in
conference calls, suggesting that it's better policy to exclude
them because mass audiences can sometimes cause conferences to
``become too bland.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to let the Guy from Boca on the call? Absolutely
not,'' Feldman recently told a group of investor relations
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to be ready to get flamed'' by the unhappy
individual investors, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman contends that too many investors on a call actually
inhibit management from being very forthcoming and encourage
executives to dribble out juicier information later in private
one-on-one situations with influential analysts and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That sometimes spurs a deeper degree of selective disclosure,
which is precisely what companies should try to avoid, Feldman
argues. (For those interested in learning more about disclosure
issues and conference calls you can read several of Feldman's
articles on the subject posted on his firm's Web site at
 &LR; www.wsgr.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   But Coker, who has been investing since he was a teenager, sees
it differently. If he has his way, someday all public companies
will open their investor teleconferences to everyone. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to blow the door wide open,'' Coker says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OOPS: &LR;  Looksmart, an Internet directory of Web sites, said that
its recent private placement was one of the largest rounds of
funding by a private Internet media company. In Wednesday's column,
Street Smarts wrongly reported that it was the largest round raised
by such a company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Street Smarts runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Mark

 Regulators Tussle Over PG&AMP;E
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Two investigations of the December 8 blackout that paralyzed San
Francisco and parts of the Peninsula have exposed cracks in the
state regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Utilities Commission and a new rival
quasi-public agency acknowledged this week that they have been
having a dustup over who has authority to investigate Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. over the power failure.
</P>
<P>
   The grid-operating Independent System Operator said it has
jurisdiction because the incident began with transmission line
failures. The PUC said the matter is in its domain because it
involved the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   They still haven't sorted it out. Both organizations issued
reports Wednesday analyzing the event and suggesting improvements
PG&AMP;E should make.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco officials want the agencies _ or the state
Legislature _ to sort out the jurisdictional question quickly and
make sure whoever is in charge has proper police powers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Klein, general manager of Hetch Hetchy Water and Power,
said he's gone to both the PUC and ISO to find out who's in charge
and who's going to do something to improve San Francisco's power
supply and reliability. Since it appears everyone is in charge,
he's concluded no one is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, if the mayor is concerned about reliability, whose
desk does he pound on?'' Klein says he asked the organizations.
``The more I heard, the more I concluded the only desk he has to
pound on is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it was clear who was in charge. The PUC was the
big cop, wielding a baton that gave it the unquestioned authority
to inspect utility books and equipment, issue citations and levy
fines.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of the electric industry stripped the PUC of its
authority over the high-voltage transmission system and vested it
in a new grid operator. But the Legislature didn't give the ISO
rights equal to the PUC because it's a nonprofit corporation, not a
state agency.
</P>
<P>
   It wears a cop's uniform, in effect, but doesn't have a badge or
gun.
</P>
<P>
   That's looking more and more like a problem. The issue of
regulatory gap seems certain to come up, across the country, as
states deregulate their electric industries and strip their
utilities commissions of century-old powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're now seeing is a structural weakness in the new
deregulated system,'' says Theresa Mueller, a deputy city attorney
for San Francisco who's concerned about the agencies'
investigations of the blackout. ``We now have a system where the
utilities aren't as accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The ISO can ask utilities to open their books and records but
can't order it. It can't put utility executives under oath. And it
can't issue citations or fines unless it gets special permission
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Winter, the ISO's chief executive, says his team got
complete cooperation from PG&AMP;E in pursuing its investigation of the
December power failure. He thinks he got all the information he
needed, speedily and truthfully. But he admits the ISO isn't in a
particularly powerful position going forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got into a case where people didn't cooperate, what
authority would I have?'' asks Winter. ``I'd have to say very
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the PUC investigative team said its efforts to get
information on the December power failure from PG&AMP;E were hampered,
at times, by the ISO and its overseer, the California Oversight
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Chong Chiu, head of the PUC investigative team, says he got the
information his 14-person team needed during the first two weeks of
his investigation. But that information dried up for a month when
the ISO instructed the utility that it didn't need to cooperate
fully with PUC investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said yesterday he thought some of the PUC questioning was
inappropriate. They were asking questions he'd already gotten
answered and he was willing to share with the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I was telling them what they could or couldn't
ask,'' Winter said. ``It was more like PG&AMP;E had already answered
the questions so don't bug them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schulte, director of the Consumer Services Division that
commissioned Chiu to prepare the independent report, said he didn't
want jurisdictional issues to stand in the way of a thorough
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we could sort that stuff out later,'' he said. ``I
felt it was crucial to have an independent investigation and I
wanted it to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say they find the regulatory vacuum
appalling, especially since power supply is as much a matter of
public safety as public convenience. Legislators need to take a
hard look at what they've created, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not regulation anymore,'' says Nettie Hoge, executive
director of the consumer group The Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco. ``It's peer pressure.''

A MEXICAN GOVERNOR DROPS FROM SIGHT IN DRUG INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Federal authorities have intensified a drug
investigation that is focusing on the governor of the state of
Quintana Roo, calling him for new rounds of questioning and warning
that protests by his allies will not halt the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Mario Villanueva Madrid has dropped from public view.
He failed to show up for questioning on Saturday. The attorney
general's office said in a statement issued late Wednesday that
prosecutors did ``not know Villanueva's whereabouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Villanueva has not been charged with a crime, his
failure to respond to a citation for questioning was, at worst, a
minor infraction. But Attorney General Jorge Madrazo informed the
governor last month that he was a target of an investigation and on
Wednesday noted that Villanueva had enjoyed constitutional
protection against arrest as a sitting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as this situation continues, it is not possible to
move ahead with criminal prosecution,'' Madrazo said in his
statement. Left unsaid was that Villanueva will lose that immunity
when his term ends on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Hendricks Diaz, who is also from President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and was
elected in February to succeed Villanueva, will take office on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has repeatedly denied involvement in drug or other
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Because official statements here are usually shrouded in cryptic
diplomatic niceties, the attorney general's blunt words led
immediately to widespread speculation that Madrazo was preparing to
ask a federal judge for Villanueva's arrest after he had left
office.
</P>
<P>
   One of several criminal lawyers retained by Villanueva, Rafael
Heredia, said Thursday that the governor had not been in touch with
him in recent days. Most official business in Mexico has halted
because it is the week before Easter, schoolchildren are on
holidays, and thousands of bureaucrats are vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   The federal inquiry, which has lasted more than a year, has
shaped up as a personal showdown between Madrazo, a bespectacled
former human rights lawyer, and Villanueva, a back-slapping
old-style politician who has enjoyed considerable popularity in
Quintana Roo despite the often authoritarian tactics that he has
brought to bear on opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In Villanueva's administration, Quintana Roo has become a major
transport hub for loads of Colombian cocaine headed toward the U.S.
border, and some of the state's hundreds of luxury hotels have been
used to launder drug profits. Several major Cancun hotels were
seized by the narcotics police last fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Villanueva learned in late 1997 that several traffickers
had accused him of using the Quintana Roo police to protect and
even coordinate drug shipments, he met the attorney general to
proclaim his innocence. Madrazo responded by urging the governor to
submit to questioning by prosecutors, and Villanueva was infuriated
to find that the federal inquiry only seemed to accelerate despite
his offers to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   After he was notified last month that Madrazo was aiming at him
in the inquiry, Villanueva's allies began organizing displays of
support for him in Quintana Roo, and Villanueva accused Madrazo of
pursuing baseless charges against him as part of a political
vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization of protests, marches, public demonstrations,
strikes or threats,'' Madrazo said in his statement on Wednesday,
will not stop federal prosecutors in carrying out their legal
responsibilities.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: PROTECTING DiMAGGIO'S DIGNITY  
 (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio once had a question for Morris Engelberg, his
lawyer who lived next door to him in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris,'' he asked, ``what makes you tick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking into Yankee Stadium behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg meant hearing the cheers that always welcomed the
Yankee Clipper to the Stadium, but the next time they arrived
there, DiMaggio took his lawyer's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris,'' he said, ``you're not behind me now.''
</P>
<P>
   And ever since Joe DiMaggio's death March 9, it's as if Morris
Engelberg were still walking arm in arm with him. After having been
his lawyer for 15 years, Engelberg is now entrusted with protecting
DiMaggio's name and likeness, which means protecting the image
DiMaggio developed for privacy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe once told me, `I don't want my name abused,''' Engelberg
was saying from his Hollywood, Fla., office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy when he was alive, because people feared him. He
was the most honorable man I've ever known. If he agreed to
something, that was it. But if you double-crossed him, you were
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg wouldn't talk specifically about offers he has refused
for DiMaggio's name in this quick-money society, but he said,
``There won't be any Joe DiMaggio watches,'' nothing that might be
tacky. He's also involved in exposing any memorabilia promoters
falsely advertising DiMaggio's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the signatures are forgeries,'' he said. ``Joe
wouldn't sign everything. Somebody wanted him to sign a 1996 Yankee
pennant, but he said: `That's not my pennant. That's their
pennant.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-acre park where DiMaggio often read the newspapers near
his home in Hollywood, Fla., will be named for him, and the West
Side Highway in Manhattan will be renamed the Joe DiMaggio Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the idea of changing the West Side Highway to the Joe
DiMaggio Highway first came up quite a while ago, Joe told me,
`That has a nice ring to it,''' Engelberg said. ``He never liked
the idea of changing the Major Deegan Expressway, because he didn't
like taking somebody else's name off it.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's memory was honored a week ago at a candlelight
ceremony at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Rizzuto, Reggie Jackson and Gov. Jeb Bush spoke,''
Engelberg said. ``Reggie was wonderful. He should be a preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio will be remembered in New York on Friday, April 23, at
a memorial Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. On Sunday, April 25, at
Yankee Stadium, a DiMaggio monument will be unveiled in Monument
Park beyond left-center field, joining those for Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Yankees talked about putting up his monument a few
years ago, Joe said, `Are they burying me already?''' Engelberg
said. ``That was the end of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg also sifts through anywhere from 50 to 75 letters a
day, some for business offers for DiMaggio's name, some from
memorabilia collectors, some from people who just want to tell
their own memories of DiMaggio. Like the letter received here the
other day from Dick Caime, who grew up as a Yankee fan in the
Ridgewood section of Brooklyn, but now lives in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one particular series against the Red Sox in Fenway
when Joe D was coming off the bone-spur heel operation when I
prayed on hands and knees for his comeback and success,'' Caime
wrote. ``My friends, mostly Dodger fans, laughed at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I went to confession that Saturday (we would go even
with nothing to confess, especially if we had nothing to confess),
I told the priest what I was praying for. He smiled that Bing
Crosby/Barry Fitzgerald Irish smile and said, `Can't you think of
something more important to pray for?' and I said, ``Like what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``His laughter shook the whole church, &QC; St. Bridget's. I was
embarrassed to go out of the confessional. He said, `Oh, we'll pray
together,' and we did, right then and there. I found out later the
priest was a Dodger fan. Joe D had a great series.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Yankees' sweep of that three-game series in 1949,
DiMaggio hit four homers, drove in nine runs and scored five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got a chance to tell Joe D my story,'' Caime's letter
ended, ``but I continued to pray for him throughout his life. I'll
tell him someday.''

</P>
<P>
   Three American Army soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces on
Wednesday while patrolling the Macedonia-Kosovo border will face
military trial as early as Friday, Yugoslav state television
reported. President Clinton said there was no basis for their
seizure and demanded their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMBAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth day of the NATO bombing campaign, allied warplanes
destroyed a bridge over the Danube River at Novi Sad in northern
Serbia, blocking a key shipping route to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Thursday
that the ethnic Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo are aiding NATO
forces in their bombing campaign of Yugoslav targets in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was considering air drops of relief assistance
to the KLA, at the rebels' request, a State Department spokesman
said. He declined to comment on reports that the rebels had also
asked for heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve more F-117 stealth fighter jets like the one downed
recently in Yugoslav territory will be deployed, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YUGOSLAV POLITICS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic was shown on state television
meeting with Ibrahim Rugova, a prominent leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians. The two men signed a document calling for a peaceful end
to the Kosovo crisis through ``political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic removed Montenegro's army commander and seven other
top generals, in what was widely seen as an effort to tighten
Serbia's control over Montenegro, the smaller of Yugoslavia's two
republics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REFUGEES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops loaded thousands of ethnic Albanians onto a
train to the country's frontier, then forced them to walk the final
miles across the border into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was considering an airlift to help the more
than 180,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled to Macedonia, Albania
and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Japan pledged $15 million in aid for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Germany held talks with its Western European partners and
Yugoslavia's Balkan neighbors to discuss how to cope with the
refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIPLOMACY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin appealed for foreign ministers
of the Group of Eight industrial countries to convene an emergency
meeting on the Kosovo crisis and said he was considering sending
more warships to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II urged the United States, Yugoslavia and NATO
to observe an Easter truce between April 4 and 7. The Vatican's
chief foreign affairs official arrived in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
with a personal message to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   American Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox religious leaders
appealed for a halt in the violence in Kosovo and for a resumption
of peace talks as their congregations began Easter observances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which is still integrating the oil giant Amoco,
officially announced its planned acquisition of Atlantic Richfield
Co. on Thursday and said it would cut about 2,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would put BP Amoco in the league of a merged
Mobil-Exxon and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. It would produce more
oil than either of them and would have 59 percent of the refining
capacity in the United States and 28 percent in Europe. It would
control 13 percent of the nation's retail gasoline market and 9
percent in Europe. It would be the largest oil and natural gas
producer in the United States and Britain and would be a major
petrochemical company.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and European Union regulators must
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boards
of both companies, stockholders of ARCO will receive 0.82 American
depository share of BP Amoco for each of their shares. Based on
Wednesday's closing prices, that is a 13 percent premium and values
the deal at about $26.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of BP Amoco fell $5.8125 Thursday, to $95.8125. ARCO fell
68.75 cents, to $72.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the job cuts will come from ARCO's headquarters in Los
Angeles, which will be eliminated, and others will come in Texas
and Alaska. Not all the cuts will come from ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Thursday between analysts and company executives in
London and at the Pierre Hotel in New York, some analysts
questioned whether ARCO management had negotiated hard enough for a
company that has vast reserves of oil and natural gas and is the
largest retailer of gasoline in California.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO chairman and chief executive Michael Bowlin told the
analysts that with the uncertain future of oil prices and the
pressure coming from larger and leaner oil companies, it was a good
deal for ARCO stockholders to get shares in BP Amoco, whose share
price can hold up better under low crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowlin said that ARCO could have remained independent,
some analysts were worried that unless crude oil prices recovered
the company would see its earnings decline and have trouble paying
its annual dividend.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of just how much pressure lower crude oil
prices have put on medium-sized oil companies over the last year,
executives of both companies said that the initiative for the
takeover came from Bowlin.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Chase, the deputy group chief executive of BP Amoco,
recalled in an interview Thursday that Bowlin came to the company
headquarters in January and to the shock of BP Amoco chief
executive Sir John Browne and himself, proposed that ARCO be
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bowlin made it clear that he and other top
executives would not ask for a role after a takeover, assuming that
the overall deal was to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that Bowlin would not have a position once ARCO was
taken over. Except for its brand name at its 1,760 gas stations on
the West Coast, the ARCO corporate identity, whose history goes
back to the 1860s, will also disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Under Browne, BP Amoco is already in the process of cutting
10,000 jobs over the next year as part of an effort to save $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday that the goal was to save an additional $1
billion after ARCO was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The task of merging so much at first gave the top executives at
BP Amoco pause when Bowlin came with his proposal. ``He caught us
off guard,'' Chase said, and there was concern about taking on
another major acquisition while still trying to integrate Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   The more they looked, the more they realized that ARCO was a
good fit, with strong positions in natural gas in Indonesia and
China, where BP Amoco wants to expand.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Alaska, where both companies made major
discoveries, rode the good times of huge production and struggled
in recent years to stem the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said the goal in Alaska was to combine operations and cut
the cost of production by about 80 cents a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   He said this would make it more attractive to invest in the
fields of Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk, which now produce about 800,000
barrels a day for both companies. That argument has been used to
persuade officials in Alaska to support the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will have to return to the state about 300,000
acres that they hold under leases and have not explored to comply
with limits of how much land can be held at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ARCO has built up a huge refining and marketing
system that uses Alaskan crude. The low transportation costs of
using the Alaskan pipeline and a plentiful supply made it one of
the lowest-cost producers of gasoline in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the stations there are older, have not
installed much of the pay-at-the-pump technology that exists
elsewhere and still rely on cash and debit cards, they are in one
of the prime gasoline markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chase described the West Coast as the ``crucible of the world''
as far as selling gasoline, and acquiring ARCO's assets filled a
gap in BP Amoco's ability to compete nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He added that about $3 billion in assets could be sold as a
result of the takeover, but no decisions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The early phase of ARCO's integration will be overseen by Dr.
Byron Grote, a mathematician who got his start at Standard Oil of
Ohio and then came up the ranks to become executive vice president
at BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the man in charge because top ARCO executives will
have to survive based on their talent and whether they fit in the
new organization.
</P>
<P>
   An executive involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said of Bowlin's approach: ``This was not
him saying that it was about me and my job but about the
shareholders and the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive added that Bowlin had seen several years ago that
the industry would consolidate and that the opportunities would
diminish the longer he waited.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing concerns about the ability of a British company to
manage such a huge operation in the United States, Chase said that
both he and Browne had spent long periods in the United States,
adding: ``We feel very comfortable here. This is a place we are
familiar with.''

 &HT;    CLINTON WARNS YUGOSLAVIA AS THREE CAPTURED AMERICANS FACE TRIAL
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Pentagon voiced outrage after Yugoslavia said
it would open a military trial Friday to prosecute three American
soldiers, and President Clinton put Belgrade on notice that it
would be held accountable for the captives' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for the prisoners' immediate release, as
state-run television in Yugoslavia broadcast grim footage of the
U.S. infantrymen, at least one of whom appeared to have been
severely beaten about the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen their pictures. We don't like it. We don't like
the way they're treated, and we have a long memory about these
kinds of things,'' said U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO
commander who is running the allied bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia's military.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know very well what the right way to treat people is,''
Clark told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels. ``They know
what the law is, and...they will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, there were as many questions as answers about
the circumstances surrounding Wednesday's capture of the three
soldiers near Macedonia's border with the embattled province of
Kosovo. The Pentagon, for instance, could not say precisely where
the troops were captured, where they were being held or even who
was responsible for the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied pilots slammed Yugoslavia with a ninth day of
air raids on Thursday, as the Pentagon dispatched 13 additional
B-117 stealth bombers to the region, bringing to roughly 220 the
number of U.S. warplanes there.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks Wednesday night hit Serb army forces in central Kosovo,
blew up an ammunition depot in the province and destroyed a major
bridge across the Danube River at Novi Sad, a city of a half
million people northwest of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The routes throughout Yugoslavia are legitimate targets,''
said Clark, ``and when we deem it appropriate, then they will be
struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Matching raids with rhetoric, Clark called on Yugoslavia's
military commanders to unseat Milosevic, as NATO forces struck at
the military and security underpinnings of his authoritarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should stop the inhumane treatment of their own
citizens,'' Clark said, referring to what he said is an ongoing
Serb campaign of shelling civilians, torching homes and otherwise
terrorizing the ethnic Albanian community across Kosovo. ``They
should look at the source of illegal orders and take the
appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, however, remained defiant, announcing that ``criminal
proceedings'' would begin Friday against the captured soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outraged by that,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon. ``They're covered by the Geneva Convention. The Geneva
Convention says that prisoners of war should not be tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
lodged a protest through the Swedish mission in Belgrade, but
offered no further details.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon identified the captives as Staff Sgt. Andrew A.
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25,
of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of
Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They were on what the Pentagon described as a routine
reconnaissance patrol when they were ambushed, fired on, surrounded
and captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken. There is
no basis for them to be held,'' said Clinton. ``There is certainly
no basis for them to be tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a pair of attack jets at the Norfolk Naval
Station in Virginia, Clinton told a crowd of military families that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must ensure the prisoners'
rights and protections as set forth in the Geneva Conventions, the
basis for international law concerning captured troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic should make no mistake: The United States
takes care of its own,'' Clinton said. ``We will hold him and his
government responsible for their safety and for their well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva Conventions a set of four agreements developed
between 1864 and 1949 form the basis for international law
regarding the protection of civilians, the humane treatment of
prisoners and the care of the wounded during times of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   No formal declaration of war is necessary for the conventions to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   If the captives are treated as prisoners of war, however, the
conventions permit them to be held in custody until the cessation
of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States recognizes their status as prisoners
of war would revolve in part around the circumstances of their
abduction. As of Thursday, there were more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, for instance, exactly where the men were when
their Humvee army vehicle was surrounded by gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The men were last seen on patrol inside Macedonia, about three
miles from the border of neighboring Kosovo, the embattled southern
province of the Yugoslav state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade alleged that the Americans had crossed over into
Kosovo. Bacon said U.S. officials simply did not know whether the
Humvee had wandered across the border in the mountainous terrain or
whether it had been ambushed on Macedonian soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were patrolling an area in which they had partolled for
some time,'' said Bacon. ``They were familiar with the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also couldn't say whether the Americans, who were
armed with M-16 infantry rifles, returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that they were trying to take escape (cq) and
evasive action,'' said Bacon, ``but obviously that failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Pentagon say with certainty who captured the
troops whether it was Serb military or police units operating in
the area, for example, or paramilitary troops who later turned them
over to Serb regular forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an investigation going on, and that will answer all
these questions,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   When they were ambushed, the troops radioed to two other Humvees
patrolling nearby. Troops in the two other Humvees set off
searching for their fellow soldiers, but couldn't find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reported being under fire and being surrounded,'' said
Bacon. ``At that point the radio broadcast broke off. That's all
the information we have.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO forces conducted what Bacon called a ``massive''
search and rescue effort involving more than 80 American troops on
the ground and in a Blackhawk combat helicopter. They were joined
by more than 60 French troops, two British helicopters, French and
Italian helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also at one time had an aircraft up with some infrared
capability to try to find the Humvee,'' said Bacon. ``But the
weather was very bad last night and the search was difficult. And,
of course, in the end it was unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Gonzales and Stone were part of a small contingent of
American troops in Macedonia providing support to a NATO force of
between 10,000 and 12,000 soldiers, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force has been patrolling Macedonia's border with
Kosovo in part to prevent violence in that province from spilling
over into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force would be the vanguard of a larger peacekeeping
force, should a cease-fire be reached in Kosovo.

 &HT;    Braves home for preview
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves are back. Atlanta plays the Orioles at 7:10
p.m. today in an exhibition game at Turner Field and the Indians at
1:10 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of interleague play, the excitement of
seeing American League teams in the ballpark isn't the same. So
what does a pair of glorified spring training games in Atlanta have
to offer?
</P>
<P>
   For the fans, it's a first glimpse of the 1999 edition of the
Braves. It'll give them a look at Ryan Klesko at first base, Bret
Boone at second, Brian Jordan in right field and Otis Nixon, in his
return to Atlanta, in left. Mark Wohlers is scheduled to pitch
tonight, giving Atlanta fans a chance to witness his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz will pitch against Scott Erickson of the Orioles and
Kevin Millwood faces hard-throwing Bartolo Colon of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   For Braves players, it's a chance to spend several nights at
home after spending seven weeks in Florida, get in some final work
before the season starts and reacquaint themselves with Turner
Field. For Jordan and other new players, it's a chance to get a
feel for their new home park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets you in front of the home crowd, gets the adrenaline
and emotions started,'' Jordan said. ``That's a tone-setter.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones said, ``It's knowing the regular season is right
around the corner, it's your own fans that watch you religiously,
and it's good we go in and kind of get your feet wet before that
first pitch against (Philadelphia's Curt) Schilling on Monday.
We're looking forward to it. We've got two good teams coming in and
they'll be two good games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won three of four this spring from the Indians.
The Atlanta pitchers have faced one of baseball's best lineups, one
that makes Cleveland a heavy favorite to win its fifth AL Central
title in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles slumped last year trying to defend the East and fell
to fourth, in part because of injuries in the starting rotation and
a disappointing year by the bullpen. Gone are Roberto Alomar and
Rafael Palmeiro, but the Orioles added Albert Belle and catcher
Charles Johnson. With Mike Mussina back to health, the Orioles
expect to contend.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Braves are glad to be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can go home and get guys on the home field for
two games, it's good,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We'll get three
extra nights there. We've got a long road trip right out of the
chute (April 12-26), so at least we get to go home for a little
bit.

 &HT;    Busch, truck series on tap
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most Winston Cup drivers are enjoying a rare weekend
off for Easter, but racing fans still can watch action in NASCAR's
other two series.
</P>
<P>
   A few Cup drivers will be competing in Saturday's BellSouth
Mobility 320 at Nashville Speedway, 2 p.m. CBS. Among the drivers
attempting to qualify for the Busch Grand National race are Cup
regulars Geoffrey Bodine, Buckshot Jones, Kevin Lepage, Sterling
Marlin, Joe Nemechek and Elliott Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a Winston Cup rookie from Tucker, will replace Larry
Pearson in the No. 00 Pontiac. Pearson injured his lower back in
last week's Busch race at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Craftsman Truck series will be celebrating the 100th race in
its five-year history in Saturday's NAPA Card 200 at Evergreen
Speedway in Monroe, Wash., 4:30 p.m. on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers _ Rick Carelli, Ron Hornaday, Butch Miller, Joe
Ruttman and Jack Sprague _ can collect a $100,000 bonus by winning
the race. They're the only drivers who have competed in every event
since the series' inception in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raced for $100,'' Ruttman said. ``If we won, we paid our
expenses and were able to race the next week. It wasn't a lot, but
we did it for fun. That's why we still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior's back
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legend Junior Johnson, who won 50 races in 14 seasons,
1953-66, returns to racing as a consultant for Sasser Motorsports,
which makes its debut at Nashville this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who sold his Winston Cup team to Brett Bodine in 1995,
doesn't have a financial investment in the venture and won't be
involved in the day-to-day operations. But Johnson says he'll help
the team in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some great offers to get back into racing,'' Johnson
said. `` ... I just thanked them for remembering me and said, `No,
thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cook will drive the No. 65 Chevy of Sasser Motorsports,
which plans on racing in five events this year and adding a second
car next season.
</P>
<P>
   Injury list
</P>
<P>
   Several Winston Cup drivers can use the open date. Mike Skinner,
who fell from first to ninth in the points standings the last two
races, cracked his right shoulder blade in a hard crash last week
at Texas. It's the same shoulder Skinner injured at Texas a year
ago. He's undergoing physical therapy this week, and owner Richard
Childress will have a relief driver standing by at Bristol on April
11.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has sore ribs and a badly bruised shoulder coming
off the worst finish of his career. Jimmy Spencer complained of
soreness after the Primestar 500 and skipped a testing session at
Bristol.

 &HT;    Monday mania: Falcons in prime spots
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons lost the Super Bowl, but won the hearts of
TV executives.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL released its schedule Wednesday, and Atlanta will play
three games on ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' and an ESPN prime
time Sunday game, and two other games will be part of Fox national
doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it was announced that the start time for ``Monday Night
Football'' will return to 9 p.m. after a year at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is just 5-15 on Mondays and has lost seven in a row
since a 31-30 home win over Minnesota in 1981. The Falcons' season
opener will be a Sunday, Sept. 12, rematch of the NFC Championship
Game, in which the Falcons beat the Vikings 30-27 in overtime. The
second game will be Monday, Sept. 20, at Dallas, and the season
finale will be Monday, Jan. 3, against NFC West rival San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Atlanta has a Monday night road game at Pittsburgh
(Oct. 25) and four road games in five weeks in the second half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part of the schedule will be right after the bye
week (Nov. 14),'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Again, to get the
Falcons organization back on `Monday Night Football' is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the NFC West earned Atlanta a schedule that includes
three division champs _ Minnesota, Dallas, Jacksonville _ and six
playoff teams.

 &HT;    Potential draftees begin visits soon
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the NFL draft set for April 17, some 20 college
players tentatively are scheduled to visit Suwanee in the next 10
days or so for interviews with Falcon officals.
</P>
<P>
   They include cornerbacks Antoine Winfield (5 feet 8 5/8, 176
pounds, Ohio State), Fernando Bryant (5-10, 183, Alabama), Fred
Vinson (5-10 5/8, 177, Vanderbilt) and safety/corner Antwan Edwards
(6-0 1/4, 210, Clemson); defensive ends Patrick Kerney (6-5 5/8,
266, Virginia) and Lamar King (6-3, 299, Saginaw Valley State); and
defensive tackles Anthony McFarland (6-0 1/2, 299, LSU), Reggie
McGrew (6-1 7/8, 307, Florida).
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackles slated to visit are Georgia's Matt Stinchcomb
(6-6, 306) and Chris Terry (6-4 7/8, 291), Kris Farris (6-7 7/8,
313, UCLA), Soloman Page (6-4 3/8, 306, West Virginia), Jon Jansen
(6-6 3/8, 305, Michigan) and Lonnie Shelton (6-5 1/2, 341, Eastern
Michigan). Others slated are wide receivers Peerless Price (5-10
7/8, 180, Tennessee), Kevin Johnson (5-11 1/8, 194, Syracuse), Troy
Edwards (5-9 1/2, 191, La. Tech) and fullback Rob Konrad (6-3, 251,
Syracuse).
</P>
<P>
   Schedule notes
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will play 10 regular-season games in domes next season.
Last season, the Falcons were 13-0 in domes, including the
playoffs. . . . Next fall will be the third time the Falcons have
played three Monday night games. They were 1-2 in 1979 and in 1981.
. . . Atlanta's opponents for next season were a combined 126-130
last season. Last season's opponents were 106-150. Last season's
nondivision opponents were 54-74. Next season's nondivisional
opponents were 74-54.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have about $1.5 million left under the salary cap. .
. . Rather than waive free safety Eugene Robinson, which would
create $1.55 million more in cap space, the team could ask him to
take a cut in his $1.8 million base salary. . . . Several weeks
ago, the Falcons and free-agent cornerback Ashley Ambrose were $1
million per year apart. But Ambrose, who was seeking $4 million per
year, knows the market is drying up and is talking about playing
out a one-year contract. Atlanta remains interested. . . . Atlanta
has 60 players on the roster before re-signing deep snapper Adam
Schreiber. The Falcons can take 81 to training camp. . . . Former
San Francisco and Miami wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke, a free
agent, worked out in Suwanee this week.

 &HT;    Driesell again top state coach
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia State coach Lefty Driesell, who last fall
joined Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp and Bobby Knight among those with
700 career wins, will be one of many figures from high school and
college basketball to be honored Saturday in the annual Atlanta
Tipoff Club Naismith Awards banquet at the Cobb Galleria Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tribute to our players and our coaching staff,'' said
Driesell, selected state Division I coach of the year for the
second consecutive year. ``Hopefully, it says that we're serious
about basketball and about trying to develop a strong and
respectable program.''
</P>
<P>
   In Driesell's second season at Georgia State, the Panthers' 17
wins set a school season record. Georgia State has gone 16-12 and
17-13 under Driesell.
</P>
<P>
   The Naismith national college players of the year are sophomore
forward Elton Brand of Duke and Tennessee senior Chamique
Holdsclaw, while the coaches are Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and
Carolyn Peck of Purdue. Peck led Purdue to a 34-1 record and the
NCAA women's championship, and Krzyzewski led the Blue Devils to
the national title game before losing to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Andy Landers, whose Lady Bulldogs (27-7) made the
Final Four before losing to Duke, is Georgia Division I women's
coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Others to receive state honors include Georgia Tech's Niesha
Butler (women's Division I) and Jumaine Jones of Georgia (men's
Division I); Kennesaw State's women's coach Colby Tilley and Owls
senior Dion Thornton (Division II); Augusta State coach Gary Tull
and senior guard Kavossy Franklin (Division II); Georgia
Southwestern coach Randolph Barksdale and Hurricanes senior Ernest
Scott (NAIA), and North Georgia women's coach Buffie Burson-Watson
and Lady Saints junior Morey LeFeve (NAIA).
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Perimeter College men's coach Alfred Barney and shooting
guard Derrick Lyons, along with Middle Georgia women's coach Greg
Wilson and Lady Warriors standout Latasha Jackson, will be awarded
junior college honors.

   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ It was around 4 p.m. Wednesday when the
three-man American reconnaissance unit radioed in to base to say
they had come under fire. The reply came back asking if the message
was a joke. But the unit was not joking. ``We're taking direct
fire, they said. ``We're trapped ... They're all around us ... We
can't get out ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not have time to say where they were,'' said Lt. Col.
Eric Kersabiec, ``so we took it seriously.'' Kersabiec, commander
of the main NATO base here, said he then ordered out search parties
and sent up a helicopter with night vision to scour the border
region through the night.
</P>
<P>
   They found nothing. Thursday morning the American soldiers
turned up on Yugoslav television looking bruised and exhausted,
captives of the Belgrade authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The men, all cavalry scouts, were Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez,
24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich., and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The three, from the 1st Squadron, Fourth Cavalry of the First
Infantry Division, were among only 350 American soldiers in
Macedonia. Until recently they were part of the U.N. mission in
Macedonia, but in the last two weeks they have been used for
reconnaissance work along the border with Yugoslavia, watching for
incursions or any hostilities aimed at the NATO forces based not
far from the border.
</P>
<P>
   The men were on a routine patrol close to the Yugoslav border,
some 10 miles northeast of Kumanovo in an area of Macedonia
predominantly populated by ethnic Serbs. Their patrol would have
brought them up to the one-kilometer buffer zone before the border.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt among fellow soldiers on the ground that
they were seized by armed Serbian villagers who were cooperating
with Yugoslav forces across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong Serb minority that feels very close to
Serbia,'' Kersabiec said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said,
``Of course the Yugoslav Army obtained information from locals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the locals took them,'' said a European officer
leading a reconnaissance unit. He said he suspected that the Serbs
would have been watching the soldiers and when they spotted three
men on their own, had moved in to seize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man in this area has a Kalashnikov in his house,'' he
said. ``We are in hostile territory here. We know that the threat
is not from the north, but it is all around us.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer was leading a reconnaissance unit of four armored
vehicles topped with heavy machine guns. His men were all armed
with automatic rifles, and wore heavy duty bulletproof vests,
although only some bothered with helmets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO soldiers in the area all said they had encountered
hostility from villagers who hurled stones and bricks at their
armored vehicles. One French unit was parked near a bridge where
``NATO Go Home'' was daubed in red paint.
</P>
<P>
   How the capture actually happened remained unclear Thursday. The
three men were patrolling in a Humvee, an armored vehicle that is
fast and versatile on rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fully armored and weighs about seven tons,'' said a
spokesman at the unit's base at the main airport just outside
Skopje, the Macedonian capital. The men must have been outside the
vehicle when they were apprehended, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want that to happen to anyone, but especially when
they are your friends,'' he added. The three men had arrived only
on Feb. 16 from their squadron's base near Wurzburg, Germany, for a
six-month tour of duty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officers here made no reference to reports that the men had
been separated from a larger patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The region where they disappeared is full of curving valleys
between craggy cliffs and ridges. Small farming villages with
red-tiled houses nestle in the valleys. At the village of Pelince,
just a mile short of the border with Yugoslavia, half a dozen armed
policemen were standing outside a white-washed building.
</P>
<P>
   Several others, dressed in camouflage fatigues, disappeared
quickly inside. The men outside were Macedonian policemen, but one
man on the edge of the group had a Yugoslav flag on the sleeve of
his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Most were ethnic Serbs and clearly sympathized with their
neighbors across the border, who less than a decade ago had been
their countrymen in the old Yugoslavia. They spoke out angrily
against the NATO bombing in Serbia. ``We hear the planes and hear
the explosions as they bomb,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that they knew nothing of the missing American
servicemen but that they had seen them come through regularly on
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, working so close to the border, that the men
simply got lost, a NATO officer said. ``If you are right on the
border, you just have to turn a corner and you are in Serbia,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could have led to their capture is their
transformation overnight from being a U.N. peacekeeping task force,
to becoming, or being perceived as, the main actor in the war next
door. Their original role as a U.N. force may have made the U.S.
unit vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   American troops have been in Macedonia for three years as part
of the U.N. mission, sent in to secure the Macedonian border and
watch for any potential spillover from the wars in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.N. mission ended on Feb. 28, after China refused to
agree to further extend the mandate in Macedonia, the task force is
being dismantled. The American troops who took part in the mission
have continued their reconnaissance duties under American command,
continuing the U. N.'s job of patrolling a half-mile zone between
the border and the French and British NATO forces, based in
Kumanovo.
</P>
<P>
   The American troops are, however, not part of the NATO
peacekeeping force assembled to keep order in Kosovo in the event a
political settlement. ``These guys are not used to having
trouble,'' a NATO officer said. ``They are not used to being
threatened. We, on the other hand, arrived ready as a fighting
force.''

BOEING OFFERS DISCOUNT IF AIR FORCE BUYS MORE C-17 TRANSPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a bold move that would extend production of its
C-17 military transport plane out to at least 2007, The Boeing Co.
has offered to cut the price of the $195 million plane by 15
percent if the Air Force buys 60 more.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is under contract to build 120 of the planes for the Air
Force, and delivered the 49th last week. Without new orders, the
production line in Long Beach, Calif, would shut down in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing President Harry Stonecipher personally delivered Boeing's
proposal to the Air Force Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is conducting a study to determine its long-range
air lift needs. It will be later this the year before the Air Force
completes that study and it will then make a decision on Boeing's
offer, said Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday in Washington, D.C., to announce
details of the company's unsolicited bid, Stu Thomson, Boeing's
vice president for business development, told reporters Boeing
wanted to have its best price for the C-17 ``on the table'' while
the Air Force study is under way.
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing will spent $275 million of its own money on
cost-savings initiatives to make the C-17 more affordable for the
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing C-17 spokesman Rick Fuller said the Boeing initiative
would yield about $3 in cost savings for every $1 expended.
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 is Boeing's most profitable airplane, with
significantly better margins than the company's flagship 747,
according to aerospace analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Air Force is the only customer for the C-17. In
addition to the 120 planes on order, the Air Force is seeking about
$3 billion from Congress to buy 15 more of the transports for
special operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the price of the C-17 could also help Boeing win foreign
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has so far failed to win a single foreign order for the
C-17, in part due to its high cost. Boeing recently submitted a
C-17 proposal to the United Kingdom's defense ministry, which wants
to lease four military cargo jets with the capability of the C-17
for delivery beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   With the current order backlog, production in Long Beach will
peak at 15 planes a year beginning in 2002. McChord Air Force Base
near Tacoma will get the first of 48 C-17s in July. They will
eventually replace the aging fleet of C-141s.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THROWS COLD WATER ON CUSTOM OF SIESTA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexico's age-old custom of taking a siesta after a big lunch
ended Thursday as the government caught up with a fundamental shift
that's been catching on for decades in this society.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is just now implementing the new work
hours, most companies in Mexico have long given their workers only
a 60- to 90-minute lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of the siesta saves the government $192 million
annually in electric bills, just as Mexico is trying to privatize
its electric industry.
</P>
<P>
   The change also makes the government's work schedule more
compatible with the nation's biggest customer, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the siesta, most business between Mexico and the United
States came to a halt at 2 p.m., when workers took their breaks.
Since few small businesses in Mexico have answering machines, U.S.
business people often would find themselves calling again and again
until someone answered.
</P>
<P>
   But that's usually not until 5 p.m., when Americans end their
work day.
</P>
<P>
   Compatible offices hours are seen as a plus for trade. That's an
important consideration at a time when rising exports have kept the
Mexican economy growing while low oil prices have battered its oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced last month, is not popular with the
government's 1.5 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that, the government eased into the change by having
the rule take effect on Holy Thursday, when nearly all employees in
Mexico have the day off. Workers won't return to work until Monday,
when the law finally will be felt.
</P>
<P>
   For government officials, eliminating siesta changes their
entire work day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of a 12-hour day that often ended at 8 p.m. and
included a two- to three-hour lunch break, workers must take a
one-hour lunch and leave work no later than 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mexicans deny that they actually sleep during their lunch
breaks, understanding that the image of taking a nap during a
midday siesta is considered lazy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The siesta is a Speedy Gonzalez myth,'' said Juan Manuel
Solana, the consul of economic affairs for the Consulate General of
Mexico in Houston. ``Siesta no longer exists in the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The hectic schedules of Mexico City's 25 million citizens,
coupled with massive traffic jams, gave people little time to
squeeze a 30-minute nap into their two- to three-hour lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more fiction than reality,'' said Jorge Gonzalez,
associate professor of economics at Trinity University in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The siesta tradition began centuries ago because of Mexico's hot
climate. It continued because not all homes or buildings,
especially in small villages, have air conditioning today.
</P>
<P>
   The catnap followed the biggest meal of the day, a leisurely
lunch that often includes soup, salad, main course, dessert and
sometimes several alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Lunches that could stretch into four hours became commonplace
and most employees returned to work after 5 p.m., if they returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a temptation not to go back to work,'' Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 5 percent of companies in Mexico City still take a
siesta, said Dolores Puron, the office manager for the state of
Texas' office in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The siesta became a casualty of a modern, internationally
oriented society; only residents of small villages close shop
during their siesta hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe that here in Mexico City a company exists
that gives siesta,'' said Bernardo Garcia, director of Edelman
Public Relations.
</P>
<P>
   But as a former government employee, Garcia said he took two- to
three-hour lunches. ``I didn't have reason to return earlier,'' he
said, because no one else was working.
</P>
<P>
   And while it may save the government millions, it could hurt the
restaurant industry because of the loss of the long midday meals
now that government workers only have an hour for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lunch business will be diminished dramatically,''
Gonzalez said, ``but perhaps their business at night will
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurants in Mexico City contacted have not had time to
see the impact of the new policy and they minimize the effect it
will have on their business.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Sanborn's, a popular Mexican diner chain, manager
Leticia Cano said her business was good Thursday, especially
considering that most of the country took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here, eat quickly and return to work,'' Cano said.
``We don't have the luxury'' of eating for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant offers meals for less than $5 a plate and serves
a middle-class clientele.
</P>
<P>
   At the trendy Villa Maria in the city's Polanco district,
manager Alberto Paz Bellefane said the end of the siesta won't hurt
his restaurant, which caters to the sort of executives who don't
feel limited by lunchtime rules. The average price of lunch there
runs $15 per person, an expensive tab in a country with a minimum
wage not much higher than $3 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who come to this restaurant are only the upper
class,'' Paz said. ``They don't have hours. An executive, they're
not going to tell him he only has one hour to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mexicans eliminate the siesta, sleep experts and companies
in the United States now encourage naps, especially during this
week's National Sleep Week.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexican officials said the move would make workers more
productive, the National Sleep Foundation said the effects of sleep
loss cost U.S. employers $18 billion in lost productivity annually.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific Railroad implemented
30-minute naps for most of its train crews and it plans to expand
the program this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see people that are doing it right go the other way
with it,'' said Denny Holland, director of alertness management for
the railroad.

FIRST OF A&AMP;E'S `HORNBLOWER' SERIES SETS THE STANDARD HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidently, the people who made ``The Duel'' aren't practiced in
the wily ways of Hollywood. There isn't a female with a speaking
role in the entire cast. No Elizabeth Hurley lookalike to romance
our hero, Horatio Hornblower. No secondary love story to keep
things afloat between the trimming of mainsails and swashing of
buckles.
</P>
<P>
   What were they thinking? Do they not remember the first day of
Action/Adventure Filmmaking 101, when everyone learns that war is
hell and war without women is hell on reels? See what it got
``Private Ryan?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the first of four ``Horatio Hornblower'' films produced by
A&AMP;E Television Networks and England's United Broadcasting &AMP;
Entertainment _ the same team that did the dreamily romantic ``Jane
Austen's Emma'' _ bravely persists in its guy-centricity.
</P>
<P>
   And surprise! It works splendidly because of a fine cast, a
brisk pace and a commanding performance by Ioan Gruffudd (yo-IN
GRIF-iths), who may be remembered by some keen-eyed moviegoers as
Fifth Officer Lowe in James Cameron's ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair, all you lovers of Jane Austen. Hornblower will
eventually rub elbows with the opposite sex (in films three and
four). But Sunday's first installment in this quartet of
stand-alone dramas is notable for staying true to the goal of
establishing Hornblower as a peach-fuzzy boy struggling to stay
afloat in a gene-typing pool brimming with machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Welshman Gruffudd, still a newcomer to cinema, brings to the
character of Hornblower the uncertainty, exuberance and courageous
impetuousness of youth. It is the late 18th century, the Napoleonic
Wars are thrusting England into war with France. As the 17-year-old
son of a physician who seems completely at sea about being at sea,
Hornblower is at once eager and frightened, appreciative and
appalled to be a midshipman in the king's navy. His thoughts even
turn to suicide _ briefly _ and Gruffudd is equal to the test,
expressing every emotion appropriately: sometimes subtly, sometimes
not, but always with the upper lip stiff.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Duel,'' Hornblower's nemesis isn't so much the French
as it is another English midshipman. This oafish fellow, Jack
Simpson by name, is everything Hornblower is not: boastful, mean,
manipulative, dishonest, insensitive. He's the schoolyard bully,
the big-talk guy at the staff meetings who never, ever delivers but
always manages to skate by.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's a coward in warrior's clothing, too, and Dorian
Healy is so thoroughly slimy in the role you might have to wipe an
oil slick from the screen as the credits roll. But Simpson is also
the catalyst for Hornblower's hasty metamorphosis from callow sea
scout to crafty seafarer, a sea change that might be implausible in
another context but hits convincingly as cannons thunder and
yardarms splinter.
</P>
<P>
   When Hornblower first boards the frigate Indefatigable, his
commanding officer, Captain Pellew, dismisses anything he might
have heard about the untested Hornblower, saying, ``I judge a man
by what I see him do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornblower himself is a manchild of principle. Thanks in large
part to deft cinematic touches by director Andrew Grieve (and
director of photography Neve Cunningham), Hornblower's deeds speak
louder and land harder as he gains the confidence and trust of
those serving with him. Near the end of the film, Pellew says, ``I
see something in you, Mr. Hornblower. ... A great future awaits
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Gruffudd and Healy, with an assist to Robert Lindsay as
the unflappable Captain Pellew.
</P>
<P>
   For lovers of C.S. Forester's ``Hornblower'' books, all four
films in this A&AMP;E series are based on ``Mr. Midshipman
Hornblower,'' published in 1950. With generous embellishment, ``The
Duel'' encompasses the first five chapters. Subsequent films,
airing on successive Sundays, are ``The Fire Ships,'' covering
chapters seven through nine; ``The Duchess &AMP; The Devil,'' chapter
10, and ``The Wrong War,'' chapter six.
</P>
<P>
   If they're as good as ``The Duel,'' viewers are in for a
delightful month of Sundays on A&AMP;E. A word of warning, though:
``The Duel'' is occasionally violent and bloody, and it includes a
scene involving rats that will turn more stomachs than a
storm-tossed ride on HMS Indefatigable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if parents are looking for a sumptuously produced,
smartly told story about a young person's acquisition of leadership
and character under trying circumstances, they won't be
disappointed by the outcome of ``The Duel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duel. First of four ``Horatio Hornblower'' films based on
the character created by C.S. Forester and airing on consecutive
Sundays in April. ``The Duel,'' starring Ioan Gruffudd, Dorian
Healy, Robert Lindsay, Paul Copley and Sean Gilder, premieres
Sunday on A&AMP;E. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

MARV TO LAKERS? YE ... NO!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So I'm having this recurring fantasy about Marv
Albert. (Nah, it's not what you think.)
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Chick Hearn who, God bless him, decides to
retire. The Lakers throw him a big teary-eyed party. Then they
close the refrigerator door. The search begins for a new
play-by-play man _ one for TV, one for radio, as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   And here comes Marv. End of daydream?
</P>
<P>
   Seems so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coming to the West Coast, and one of the nice things
about games in L.A. is the climate, but . . .'' Albert said.
</P>
<P>
   The best Albert can do is show up for TNT tonight at 5 p.m. to
call the Lakers-Suns game in Phoenix. It'll be his first national
exposure _ and (begin ital)there's(end ital) a word we're not sure
is wise to use _ since NBC fired him in the fall of '97, when
assault charges were brought up as revelations about a kinky
personal lifestyle were reported.
</P>
<P>
   There were times in the last year-and-a-half when Albert, long
considered not just the voice of the New York Knicks but of the
NBA, didn't know if he'd ever get a chance to do one of these
coast-to-coast broadcasts again.
</P>
<P>
   He admits in the months when he was putting his life back
together he never thought about uprooting New York and making a
complete change of scenery in forgiving Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so ingrained in New York and my family and so many
friends are here,'' Albert said. ``I'm so comfortable here in New
York, and I love the city. And the Madison Square Garden network
has been so terrific to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what Chick has accomplished over the years . . .
(coming to L.A.) is not something I even think about. It doesn't
enter my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But with TNT's coverage going head-to-head with KCAL's, viewers
might not automatically click onto Chick tonight; many could listen
instead to Albert with analyst Reggie Theus and sideline reporter
Cheryl Miller.
</P>
<P>
   This will be is the only game involving the Lakers that Albert
has on his six-game TNT assignment sheet. He's been doing selected
radio play-by-play on Knicks games (although he didn't make the
team's Western trip that included a stop at the Forum last Sunday)
as well as hosting the week-night studio show for the Madison
Square Garden cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's eased back into TV work and continues to field media
questions about his progress with counseling and a new marriage,
Albert realizes it's all ``part of the process and in many ways a
good thing for me to express feelings I have. Being part of the
media, I understand what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He says fans in New York and elsewhere have ``been terrific''
toward him. TNT executive producer Mike Pearl says there's been no
negative mail, e-mail or phone calls about the hiring. And when
Albert attended a network advertising photo shoot in New York about
two weeks ago and had time to talk basketball with Theus, Hubie
Brown, Dick Stockton, Doc Rivers and others, Albert said he felt
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going into this game without having done games with
the Knicks already this season, I'd have a lot more anxiety,'' said
Albert, who actually made his TNT debut as a studio analyst last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Theus, the Lakers' pregame show regular on Fox Sports West, says
he's been listening to tapes of games that Albert has done recently
to get in tune with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Marv said was important for us was to just have
fun,'' said Theus. ``I'm excited. This man is synonomous with the
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert on Rodman: One of the sidelights to tonight's game is
what kind of opinions Albert might have about the antics of Lakers
forward Dennis Rodman. Albert was asked about that on a conference
call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make a judgment on someone's lifestyle,'' Albert
said rather ironically. ``I don't know if what we see publicly
takes place privately. . . These days, there seem to be other
standards for guys who can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Albert, who has had the media spotlight turned on him,
raise those issues on the air?
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have (on MSG) and I would on a telecast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN World Tour: After pulling off a telecast from Cuba last
weekend, ESPN's Sunday Night baseball opener from Monterrey,
Mexico, between Colorado and San Diego this week seems simple for
coordinating producer Tim Scanlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Cuba game was the most difficult remote I've ever been
part of, not just on the technical limitations but from all the
interested parties involved in the game taking place,'' said
Scanlan of the contest between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban
national team.
</P>
<P>
   All of ESPN's expenses in Cuba had to be cleared through the
State Department in advance, Scanlan said. ESPN brought in four
cameras plus its own production truck to add to an eight-camera
set-up already in place by Cuba's national broadcast network. The
transmission of the pictures also went through the Cuban state-run
ministry; ESPN floated over a transmitter from ABC News in Miami as
a backup in case things didn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the technology advances, it's shared worldwide
immediately,'' said Scanlan. `So with all the cultural and language
differences, it came off a lot better than it could have.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 5 p.m. game in Monterrey, ESPN has a most costly
production, having to bring through customs two mobile units and
four huge lighting vehicles to brighten up the stadium. The
downside?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not able to broadcast in stereo,'' said Scanlan.
``That's a luxury we often take for granted.'' &QL;

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_Considering that former Dodgers pitching great Sandy Koufax says
this was only his second extended interview with TV since he
retired in 1966, ESPN's Charley Steiner pulled off quite a feat
convincing him to do the sitdown for tonight's ``SportsCentury''
telecast (7:30 p.m.). Koufax came up No. 42 on the list of the
greatest athletes by the ``SportsCentury'' project voters, of which
Steiner is one. Koufax is also the only pitcher in the top 50,
ranked better than Walter Johnson (60), Satchel Paige (63), Bob
Gibson (67) and Cy Young himself (77). ``(Koufax) is a person who
wants his privacy because he wants to live a normal life, and he
can't do it if his face is on TV all the time,'' said Steiner,
allowed into Koufax's circle after an extended dinner with him last
spring in Florida set up by former broadcast partner Kevin Kennedy.
After explaining to Koufax that his inclusion was an honor, Steiner
said he didn't have to beg too much further for the interview.
``But he did want to take a day in case he changed his mind if he
wanted,'' said Steiner. Thankfully, Koufax didn't. &QL; 
_ESPN's ``SportsCentury'' free interactive mall tour, by the way,
continues through Saturday at the Glendale Galleria. One of the
neat things to do is to make the call of a classic sporting event
and take home a free video of it. &QL; 
_Dodgers broadcaster Ross ``Dress for Less'' Porter gave a lovely
thank you on the air to all the people at Vero Beach, Fla., during
the ninth inning of what could be the team's final game Wednesday _
and then launched into a Ralph Nader-like review about how the
Touch of Class dry cleaners (``Touch of Class . . . that's a
misnomer,'' said Porter) lost $500 worth of his clothes and
wouldn't replace them. Next time we're in Vero, we'll know not to
go there. And we're telling everyone else, too. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_If she wanted to, Fox reporter and former ESPN employee Bonnie
Bernstein could probably raise a pretty big stink about the last
episode of ABC's ``Sports Night,'' which hit awfully close to what
viewers could interpret as her home. The newest character on the
dramedy was an anchor named ``Bobbie Bernstein'' (Lisa Edelstein)
who was upset that she had to work with Dan (Josh Charles) because
he didn't remember her from a one-night stand years ago. Hmmmm.
Does that mean next week, someone named ``Lucy Kolber'' will be
caught making out with Dan in the janitorial supply room? &QL; 
_Within minutes of Duke's Final Four win over Michigan State last
Saturday, KCBS-Channel 2's ``Sports Central'' had its Vegas guy,
Caesars Palace bookie Vinny Magliulo, on the air with Jim Hill to
announce that Duke would be a nine-point favorite against UConn in
Monday's final. Now, that's quick service. But is it appropriate,
even to bring Magliulo back on Monday's pre-game show to rehash the
line again? At a time when CBS decided that its own Web site, CBS
SportsLine, had to disconnect a link to an on-line betting service
because it didn't want to appear to be promoting gambling of an
event it was covering, CBS's L.A. affiliate doesn't seem too
bothered by bringing on a guy named Vinny to discuss how bettors
were reacting to this spread. Hill justifies putting on Magliulo
because, in Hill's words, ``everyone's asking right now, what's the
spread?'' after the semifinals. For the record, this newspaper runs
daily point-spread information on the scoreboard page. But when a
network has a serious financial partnership with an event _ where
the underdog eventually wins _ that doesn't look like such a wise
bet.

INVESTIGATORS SEEKING CLUES TO WHO SENT E-MAIL VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal agents hunting for the author of the Melissa computer
virus obtained a court order Thursday seeking background
information from America Online, one day after seizing a computer
from a Florida Internet access provider that may contain clues to
the origin of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus, which emerged last Friday, can spread
exponentially because it automatically sends itself from one
recipient's e-mail account to as many as 50 others. It has spread
more quickly than any other computer mutation in history, infecting
more than 100,000 computers in five days, computer security experts
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the creator of the virus has focused on a small
group of virus writers who use monikers including VicodinES and
ALT-F11. Those nicknames have been associated with several key
aspects of the release of the virus and with virus-creation in
general.
</P>
<P>
   The Web page for VicodinES touted the ability of its author as a
``noted virus researcher,'' and cited several viruses he had
created. It was published on a computer kept at Access Orlando, a
small Internet service provider in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, or Web server, held a loose collection of sites
called SourceofKaos, which included dozens of other sites of virus
writers and collectors. Access Orlando does not own the computer,
but leases space to its owner, Roger Sibert, for $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, FBI agents asked Access Orlando to remove the
server for the Internet as a way to preserve any evidence of
Melissa's origin that it might contain, according to Ron Spohn,
projects manager for Access Orlando. Spohn said he acceded to the
FBI's request after it showed him documentation that it was illegal
to tamper with data that may be used in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Spohn said the FBI later confiscated the computer. ``They were
going to look for clues on the actual machine itself,'' Spohn said,
referring to digital evidence preserved in the computer's logs that
could be traced to VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   Sibert, the operator of the SourceofKaos sites, said he did not
personally know VicodinES, but had exchanged e-mail with him in the
past. Sibert said that he allowed people with unpopular views to
use his Web server to post sites on the Internet and that many of
the roughly 80 sites belonged to virus writers or virus collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI declined to comment on Access Orlando or on any other
aspect of the investigation, except to confirm that it is
conducting one.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said Thursday that it had received a court order
regarding the Melissa virus from a federal law enforcement agency,
but declined to specify the information sought by the court order.
``Our policy is to cooperate when presented with a formal
request,'' said Wendy Goldberg, an AOL spokeswoman. The FBI
declined to confirm that it was the agency that obtained the court
order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computer security experts searching for VicodinES said it
appeared that he used an AOL account last Friday morning in first
posting the virus to the Internet. The AOL account belongs to a
Seattle-based civil engineer, Scott A. Steinmetz, who said his
account was apparently broken into to post the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Steinmetz, 36, said he was not the subject of an FBI
investigation. ``It sounds like somebody took my password and has
been trashing me on the Internet and has also created a notorious
computer virus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since his account was identified as a possible source of the
virus, ``every hacker in the world has sent me an e-mail,'' he
said. ``Some of them congratulated me and some of them had nastier
things to say.'' He said he was ``stockpiling'' the messages for
investigators if they want them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Global Connection, a small Internet provider in
Kingsport, Tenn., said they also received a call from the FBI on
Thursday in connection with the Melissa investigation. Global
Connection is the company that hosted the Web site of
Codebreakers.org, an organization that includes some virus writers
and to which VicodinES apparently once belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Potts, sales and marketing manager for Global Connection,
said the company had already decided to disconnect the Web page
from the Internet on Tuesday to ``err on the side of caution.'' He
said the company had read news reports and received e-mails that
connected the site to the Melissa virus.

AIR FORCE WANTS MORE BOEING KITS TO MAKE DUMB BOMBS SMART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Air Force wants Boeing to speed up production of a
guidance kit that turns dumb 2,000-pound bombs into smart ones in
case the service runs short during what could become a long bombing
campaign over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   These bomb kits, known as Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM,
are built in St. Charles, Mo., and have been used for the first
time in combat during Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   They have so far been fitted to 2,000-pound bombs dropped by the
stealth B-2 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The B-1 bomber, which has been sent to the region, will also
drop the Boeing bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The smart bombs are dropped up to 15 miles from targets and
signals from the global positioning satellite system help keep them
on track.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force not only wants to accelerate production of the
JDAM kits under an existing contract with Boeing, but wants to buy
about 1,100 more, Air Force spokesman Gloria Cales told the
Post-Intelligencer Thursday. She did not know how much additional
money that might mean for Boeing. The kits cost about $18,000 each.
Including production and support the Air Force is paying about
$23,000 for each.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Tom Downey in St. Louis, headquarters of the
company's fighter and missile programs, confirmed Boeing is talking
with the Air Force, but he declined further comment and referred
questions to the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Cales said the Air Force wants Boeing to increase production of
the JDAM kits from 110 a month now to 200 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is supposed to provide the Air Force information before
the end of the week on how rapidly and at what cost it could ramp
up production, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Defense Daily, Joseph Diamond, Air Force
program executive officer for missiles, said he believes Boeing
could reach the higher production rate within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at now is a ramp that is consistent with
production plans already in place, just accelerated,'' he told the
publication. ``They (Boeing) are going to increase their capacity
sooner or later anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombs fitted with JDAM kits can be used in all kinds of weather,
which makes them more effective than traditional laser-guided smart
bombs in Yugoslavia, where many NATO bombing missions have been
hampered by poor weather.
</P>
<P>
   JDAM is still in low-rate production. Of the first lot of 937
kits, Boeing has delivered all but 108 to the Air Force, Cales
said. The second lot is for 2,202 kits, followed by a third lot of
2,500 kits.
</P>
<P>
   Given NATO's plans to increase bombing missions over Yugoslavia,
the small number of JDAM-equipped bombs so far produced by Boeing
for the Air Force could soon be gone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. _ Whizzing down Crescendo and cutting across
Swinger, hot-shot skiers and snowboarders on these intermediate
slopes now run into a speed trap on snow. Yellow banners suddenly
caution: ``Speed control in progress'' and ``No Warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of this new ``slow skiing zone,'' Caroline Elliott, a
Breckenridge Ski Resort employee, recently called out to two
speeding young men, ``Please make some turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the slope, linked by radio, members of the ski
patrol stood waiting, armed with wire clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to be confrontational, and let the
four-letter words fly, I just take their pass,'' said William A.
Jensen, the resort's chief operating officer, who also skis patrol
duty. ``Very few policemen will allow you to go 100 and not give
you a ticket. We don't give you a ticket. We pull your ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   This hard line on reckless skiing comes after a hard winter in
Colorado. Even though the number of lift tickets sold is down this
season, Colorado resorts have recorded 12 skiers and snowboarders
killed in collisions _ double the season average and the highest
number since record keeping began 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Breckenridge has been the hardest hit, recording five of the
fatalities during one month in midwinter. Now, Breckenridge is the
most visible in an industrywide effort to improve skiing safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been far and away the worst year for the recreational
skier in Colorado,'' said Jim Chalat, a lawyer who represents the
family of a 13-year-old Texas boy who died March 21 after skiing
into a boundary rope at Beaver Creek. ``For hitting trees,
collisions, at the major ski areas it has been just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's spike in skiing and snowboarding deaths does not seem
to indicate that these sports have become any more dangerous than
before, and ski experts largely consider Colorado's bad winter as a
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 33 people have been killed this year, the same
number as the annual average for the last seven seasons. This
fatality rate makes skiing and snowboarding more dangerous than
bicycling and slightly safer than swimming. Statistics indicate
that driving to a ski resort is riskier than skiing there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 25 years, the rate of skiing injuries requiring
medical attention has dropped in half, to about 1 injury for every
400 lift tickets sold, said Jasper E. Shealy, who has been studying
ski injuries for almost 30 years, most recently for the Rochester
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond a search for safety, the speeding crackdown here and
elsewhere _ highly popular among women and older skiers _ also
reflects the realization by resort operators that their bread is
increasingly being buttered by the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's resorts do not make their money selling lift tickets.
Indeed, because of poor snow and a weak Canadian dollar, the
Colorado ski industry expects a 5 percent drop in ticket sales this
season. Instead, the big money is now in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, Breckenridge unveiled plans to build 853 ski-in
ski-out condominiums. A few peaks to the east, Keystone Resort
plans to build almost 1,700 single-family homes and condominiums
over the next five years. Building lots will start at $300,000, and
condominiums will be priced as high as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles to the west of here, Copper Mountain Resort in
February sold $53 million worth of second home real estate in seven
hours. Even at Winter Park, long a bargain area for day trippers
from Denver, ski condominiums have pole vaulted in price to $425 a
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   With 51 years the average age for an American to buy a second
home, ski resorts do not want testosterone-crazed young skiers to
rule the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the destination resorts, their principal clientele is from
the baby boom generation, the `gold coasters,''' Michael Berry,
president of the National Ski Areas Association, said, referring to
affluent skiers who fly here from New York and Los Angeles. ``That
clientele wants a more managed environment.''

 BRECKENRIDGE: managed environment.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Colorado, the nation's most popular state for skiing, skiers
and snowboarders are increasingly older and wealthier than before,
according to a recent survey for Colorado Ski Country USA, an
industry group.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of five winters, the median household income of
Colorado ski area patrons jumped by 57 percent, hitting $87,200 in
the 1998-1999 winter. The segment earning $200,000 almost tripled,
hitting 18.3 percent last winter. Skiers aged 45 to 54 years, the
prime age group for buying a second home, increased slightly, to
almost 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Colorado Rockies, resorts that cater to wealthy
out-of-state skiers and snow boarders are cracking down on reckless
speeding. Aspen Skiing Company, which prides itself on charging the
highest lift ticket price in the nation _ $63 _ recently adopted
the Tuck Buster Program.
</P>
<P>
   Ski patrols there target skiers, usually young men, speeding
down the mountain in a racing crouch, giving out warnings or in
some cases taking away lift tickets.
</P>
<P>
   By this spring, many of Colorado's rowdier young athletes had
learned the new rules of the game. Snowboarders increasingly
congregate around obstacle courses known as terrain parks.
Daredevils disappear into the black diamond expert slopes or into
the back mountain expanses known as ``bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, males have accounted for all this winter's fatalities in
Colorado ski resorts. A study of Colorado's ski area fatalities
from 1990 to 1996 found that 80 percent were men, 68 percent were
Coloradans, and 62 percent were under 35. Most were killed speeding
on intermediate, or blue, slopes. On these smoothly groomed slopes,
radar studies indicate that skiers average 25 to 40 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At Breckenridge, the program is popular on the three heavily
trafficked blue slopes where slow skiing is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see them trying to control the other skiers who are
whizzing by me,'' said Betty Shea, a 62-year-old beginner who was
trying her first intermediate run in a slow skiing zone. She added
cryptically, ``I wish there was a place for the snowboarders.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as highway patrolmen try to keep vehicles moving at roughly
the same speed, ski patrollers do the same with skiers and
snowboarders of all abilities. A mix of speeds leads to passing
and, on congested slopes, collisions, ski patrollers say.
</P>
<P>
   Others attributed accidents to high-speed chairlifts that
deprive skiers of needed rest and on helmets and the new-shaped,
parabolic skis, which can give a skier a false sense of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' Lisa Cowan, a 39-year-old from
Orlando, Fla., taking a break on a slow zone here, said of the
crackdown. ``It is the first time I have skied when I didn't think
people were zooming by me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the mountain, Jensen reflected on the new
safety program, clicking his wire clippers for effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compliments and thank you's are running 10 to 1 to the
complaints from the people who are going too fast,'' he said. ``I
get letters from 50-year-olds who want us to do it on all 163
runs.''

 &HT;    Land deal sets South Florida record
 &HT;    By Ava Van de Water
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANALAPAN, Fla. _ In one week, builder Frank McKinney leaped
from a record house proposal to a record land sale. And McKinney
still will build a mansion on the Manalapan property _ a custom
home for the buyer, instead of the $39 million ``spec'' house he
planned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McKinney and partner Thomas Melone sold the
8.66-acre oceanfront property for $26.45 million. Half of the land
was slated for a 61,318-square-foot house that would've been built
before a buyer was found.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the partners' land deal set a record for a residential
property in South Florida. McKinney and Melone received almost $10
million more than they paid for the land in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Title to the property went to James Rutledge as trustee. Malcolm
Healey, owner of Mill's Pride kitchen cabinets, is believed to be
the buyer. Through Rutledge, Healey has contracted with McKinney to
build a house on the land. McKinney says he doesn't know whom
Rutledge represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a house similar to the $39 million spec house
approved by the town of Manalapan on the site,'' McKinney said
Thursday. ``I do know the intent of all parties is to carry forward
what has already been approved. We've already gone through a
one-year permitting process.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how big the house will be and whether it will be the
only structure on the property is uncertain. McKinney and others
involved in the deal are bound by a confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, through his Manalapan Development Co., and investor
Melone, as trustee, paid $17 million for the property, just south
of Manalapan Town Hall at 700 and 750 S. Ocean Blvd. On the north
half of the property, McKinney had planned to build the spec house
with glass-domed rotunda big enough to seat 150 people for dinner,
a 5,000-square-foot master bedroom suite, movie theater with
popcorn stand, and a game room the size of most people's houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't necessarily mean that what we have will not be
built on another lot, although it is much more difficult now to
find the inventory on which to build,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no documents to show who the mysterious buyer is, but
it is believed to be Healey, whose Mill's Pride kitchen cabinets
are sold at Home Depot stores. Healey owns a beautiful
9,100-square-foot oceanfront house and 4,600-square-foot guest
house on 2 acres in Palm Beach, but he's been looking at property
in the Manalapan area.
</P>
<P>
   Healey appears to like a lot of land. Last year, after netting
nearly $373 million by selling one of England's largest kitchen
companies, he paid about $67.8 million for an 11,000-acre historic
estate in England. The estate, once owned by the Marquis of
Normanby, includes 63 houses and cottages, a school, store and post
office, according to the Daily Mail in England. Healey is traveling
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This latest record-setting sale is a further sign that
Manalapan, once a quiet vacation retreat for wealthy Europeans, is
evolving into a mega-mansion mecca. Just down the road from
McKinney's property is the former Howard Vanderbilt estate, which
owner and mall magnate Mel Simon expanded to 40,000 square feet.
Then there's Lois Pope's expanded 30,000-square-foot manse on the
market for $18 million, and billionaire William Ziff's
47,000-square-foot mansion, now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The sale also proves Frank McKinney _ whose last spec house sold
for $9.5 million, including furnishings _ is on target with his
multimillion-dollar ideas, said real estate broker Clark French,
who marketed the property for McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, everybody said, 'You're crazy,' and he says, `No,
I'm not,''' French said.

 &HT;    Gas prices take leap
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The good ol' days at the gas pump are
over.
</P>
<P>
   When adjusted for inflation, gas prices this year had fallen to
their lowest level in history. But during the past two weeks,
prices in Florida jumped an average of almost 11 cents per gallon,
according to a special survey by the Tampa-based AAA Auto Club
South.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in
Florida was $1.10 Wednesday, according to the survey. Prices
haven't been that high since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely noticed it going up,'' said Linda O'Hare of
Boca Raton as she filled the tank of her black Ford sedan at a
Shell gas station in Delray Beach. She paid $1.18 a gallon for
regular unleaded. ``The only thing you can do is try to find the
best deal when you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami, where a gallon cost an average of $1.13, had the
second-highest prices in the state after Jacksonville, where it
cost $1.14, according to the survey. Miami prices are usually on
par with the rest of South Florida, said Yoli Buss, who monitors
gas prices for AAA.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest gas, at $1.07 a gallon, can be found in the Tampa
area, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in gas prices is largely due to a recent decision by
the 11 oil-producing nations in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries to slash production and reduce the world's oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   It was that glut that had kept prices so low.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC was responding to those low gas prices we've enjoyed all
year,'' Buss said. The auto club, which usually releases its price
reports in mid-month, conducted the special survey after OPEC's
decision. ``They couldn't afford to keep them that low.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Foley, a retired Lake Worth resident, believes the oil
industry's actions are just another attempt to unfairly squeeze
money from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as OPEC announced the cut in production, prices went
up instantly, before the cuts even took effect,'' Foley said as he
filled the tank of his Honda motorcycle with $1.19-per-gallon fuel
at a Texaco gas station in Boynton Beach. ``It's another rip-off of
the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices also are rising in anticipation of spring and summer
travel and weather, Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see people using their air conditioners more, and then
we'll hit the heavy summer travel months,'' she said. ``That is all
having an impact on gas prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The upswing in gas prices is not a surprise to energy experts,
who have been predicting an end to the heyday of fuel prices since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been waiting for OPEC's move,'' Buss said. ``It
was just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time gas prices jumped as quickly was in 1990, at the
onset of the Persian Gulf War. The price of a gallon leapt more
than 20 cents then, sparked by concerns over the oil supply in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Will prices continue to rise? It's all up to OPEC, Buss says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they continue to cut production, we'll continue to see
steep hikes,'' she said. ``If not, we'll see some increase but
nothing too dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida residents can take some pleasure in knowing that gas
prices are even higher in some other states.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, which has some of the highest gas prices in
the nation, motorists are shelling out $1.61 per gallon, according
to AAA of California.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Brussels _ Western officials are discussing a plan
under which NATO troops would escort ethnic Albanians back into
Kosovo after Serbian forces there have been routed by bombing, and
would set up a self-governing enclave under allied protection, a
senior NATO diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have repeatedly ruled out an invasion force to
halt the brutal campaign by President Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian
forces, which has driven almost 190,000 ethnic Albanians from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials say that NATO ground troops may be called
in if airstrikes eventually succeed in driving back the Serb
military to bring back the refugees and to set up what the official
called a ``protectorate.'' They say this might be possible even if
a formal peace agreement with Belgrade has not been reached, as
long as it was clear that the Serbs could not mount serious
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations on the plan are still in the early stages and
still under discussion in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official in Washington said in a telephone
interview that much would depend on whether the ground force will
be able to enter Kosovo without facing serious military resistance
from remaining Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line that has not been crossed in Washington is whether we
would deploy such a force in anything but a permissive
environment,'' the official said. ``That is, an environment in
which hostile forces have been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, NATO has continued to back the plan presented to the
Serbs and ethnic Albanians at the Rambouillet Castle in France,
under which Kosovo would remain a Serbian province, but with
extensive autonomy for its Albanian majority. But officials have
privately acknowledged that the proposal, which was rejected by the
Serbs, is no longer applicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo within Yugoslavia is becoming more and more difficult
to conceive of, even with the maximum degree of autonomy involving
the Rambouillet package,'' the diplomat said. ``It may still not be
too late to go back to that, but it is becoming more and more
remote. So a protectorate, independence with international
guarantees, these are at least coming into the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussions over a protectorate _ an independent entity
whose security would be guaranteed by the international community
but whose status would be less than a state _ reflects a major
change in the long debate over how to bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Rambouillet approach, NATO was to send 28,000
peacekeeping troops only after both the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians had accepted the autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
   But with the plan rejected by the Serbs, and with their forces
on the march in Kosovo, there is a growing sense among diplomats
that the coexistence between the Serbs and Albanians is no longer
viable.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some diplomats say, the Albanians would find it
difficult to live again under Serb authority, even with the
autonomy projected by the Rambouillet agreement. Additionally,
President Clinton has warned Milosevic that his campaign against
the ethnic Albanians was jeopardizing his right to govern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even NATO Secretary General Javier Solana suggested in an
interview earlier this week that the Rambouillet accord would
probably need to be modified but did not say how.
</P>
<P>
   The plan under discussion by diplomats here, to turn Kosovo into
a NATO protectorate, also reflects a resistance to make Kosovo an
independent state _ no NATO nation has formally called for it _ or
to make Kosovo part of a greater Albania, for fear that such steps
could destablize the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many critical details of how a protectorate might work remain to
be worked out. The basic thinking is that weeks of bombing would
cripple the Yugoslav military and force Serbian soldiers and police
units to retreat from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ethnic Albanians refugees would begin to return under the
protection of NATO troops. The refugees would be allowed to return
to all of Kosovo. The province would not be partitioned.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force would function more like a protection force than
a peacekeeping presence. It might be sent even if Belgrade did not
agree to the presence of NATO forces in Kosovo, though probably not
in the face of determined Serb resistance. Diplomats could try to
work out a peace accord afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sequence used to be full political agreement, followed by
an international peacekeeping force,'' the senior NATO diplomat
said. ``The question that will have to be answered now is whether
the international presence is so indispensible to the return of the
refugees that one has to look at a different sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how large such a NATO force might be. While air
strikes would have reduced Serb threats, the force would have to be
substantial enough to protect not only the ethnic Albanians, but
the international officials and workers that would likely be
involved in the reconstruction of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security risks to the force might be less but the task
would be very different,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the senior allied commander, hinted Thursday
in a press conference that contingency planning was being carried
out for using ground forces in new ways. But he refused to provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials reiterated, however, that there was no
consideration of using ground forces to invade Kosovo. NATO
officials also pointed to the difficulties in dispatching ground
troops as part of a effort to create ``safe areas'' in Kosovo for
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, the U.N. force there established
``safe areas'' for Muslim populations under attack by Bosnian Serb
forces in places like Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces under Gen. Ratko Mladic later attacked Srebrenica
and killed thousands of civilians, with U.N. forces unable to stop
them even with NATO bombing behind them.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, a NATO military officer said, ``We must not
establish anything like safe areas in Kosovo unless we can
absolutely guarantee the safety of the people who are within
them.''

COURT PERMITS STATE AUDITS THAT GIULIANI TRIED TO BAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani exceeded his authority when he
blocked state auditors from reviewing how effectively the city's
government is managed, the state's highest court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the state Court of Appeals was the
second this week that took the mayor to task for overstepping his
powers. The court ruled Tuesday that Giuliani could not lease a
city hospital to a private company without first obtaining changes
in state law.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Thursday, the court upheld a lawsuit by state
Comptroller Carl McCall that sought to compel city agencies to
cooperate with McCall's auditors, who were trying to examine how
effectively the city delivered services. The court said that the
state constitution and state laws clearly give the comptroller the
authority to conduct such reviews, known as performance audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude that the comptroller has authority to perform such
audits,'' wrote Chief Judge Judith Kaye in the decision, which
affirmed two lower court rulings. Afterward, McCall said he would
pursue the audits and Giuliani said he would make available most,
if not all, of the information sought by the Comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The decision settled a bitter dispute that began two years ago
when McCall set out to review the performance of a half-dozen city
agencies and to verify how accurately they had been reporting
significant improvements in cleaning the streets, reducing crime
and moving people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a Republican who was facing re-election when the
audits were initiated early in 1997, had accused McCall, a
Democrat, of being politically motivated and seeking to embarrass
him in an election year. Giuliani ordered city agencies to stop
sharing most information with the state comptroller's auditors and
he ordered the auditors evicted from the offices of two city
agencies, the Health Department and the Human Resources
Administration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor had previously indicated that he thought McCall was
partisan, and he occasionally cited that as a reason why he had
declined to meet with McCall for more than four years. The two men
finally met last Saturday for breakfast at Gracie Mansion as part
of an effort by Giuliani to reach out to black elected officials
after two months of turmoil over the fatal shooting by four white
police officers of an unarmed West African immigrant, Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   After efforts to mediate the dispute over performance audits
failed, McCall issued 17 subpoenas in April 1997 to obtain records
and other information from six city agencies, including the Police
Department, the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the Administration
for Children's Services and the Department of Finance. The city
ignored the subpoenas, and McCall went to court to have them
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed that the state comptroller had the right to
conduct traditional financial audits of the city. But Giuliani
argued that McCall lacked the statutory and constitutional power to
perform broader reviews of the efficiency and management of city
government, as well as its compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In their court filings and in oral arguments before the Court of
Appeals in February, city lawyers contended that the language of a
1925 amendment to the state constitution should be interpreted
narrowly when it said that the state comptroller was responsible
for supervising ``the accounts'' of political subdivisions in the
state. That meant that the comptroller had the authority to review
only a municipality's finances, the city's lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals rejected that interpretation. ``We find
the city's argument unpersuasive, concluding both that the
constitution permits delegation to the comptroller of the authority
to conduct performance audits of political subdivisions, and that
in exercise of that authority, the Legislature has empowered the
comptroller to conduct such audits of city agencies,'' Judge Kaye
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said in a prepared statement that he was pleased by the
decision and was hopeful that, after meeting with Giuliani last
weekend, he and the mayor would work more cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with the mayor so that my auditors
can resume auditing New York City agencies in a cooperative and
productive manner,'' McCall said. ``The legal battles have cost us
two years of providing New Yorkers with vital information about how
their tax dollars are being spent. There is much time to be made up
and much work to be done. Let's get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he disagreed with the court's interpretation, but
would abide by the ruling. The mayor noted several times at a news
conference yesterday, though, that in the last paragraph of the
decision, the court said it had ruled only on the broad principle
of performance audits and not on any objections that the city might
make about specific aspects of the proposed audits.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had expected the court to rule as it did.
``And we are ready to comply with it, although it does say _ and we
are thankful for that _ that we can raise other objections beyond
the objection of performance audit,'' he said. ``So there may be,
in some cases, other grounds in which there are objections, so we
have to reserve that right. But they will get most of the
information, if not all.''

 &HT;    Bush becomes object of political egg hunt
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after announcing he has collected more
than $6 million for his probable presidential campaign, Gov. George
W. Bush on Thursday found himself in the cross hairs of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has not said he is definitely running, is running
scared, according to Joe Andrew, the DNC's national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Bush afraid of? That reporters have only seen the
sunny side up until now?'' Andrew said as part of an effort to
portray Bush as a side-stepping know-nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush, insisting the current Texas Legislature
is his top priority, has declined to take specific positions on
some national issues. Critics say he is ducking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiding more than Easter eggs?'' the Democrats asked in a
Thursday release.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say he is working on answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he gave us some clear pictures and answered some
pretty direct questions,'' said Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Alan
Novak, who met with Bush here Wednesday. ``I think he convinced us
he has good instincts, that he knows what he still needs to learn
and he is committed to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has raised more than $6 million for his campaign, said
his image as a candidate who is not fully known by the voters has
reached the joking level with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised at the support he amassed though some
people know little about him other than his lineage, he said, ``Are
you referring to the time my mother called me after (a poll showing
him running atop the pack) and said, `Son, I love your strategy:
Don't let them get to know you.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he believes supporters do know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people would write a check like that unless they
knew where my heart is, what my intentions are. I believe I've
shown the people that I know how to lead. I'm the governor of the
second-largest state in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to the Democratic National Committee, leaves him
far short of qualified for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare him with Democratic candidates who are
running, he is not even close,'' said DNC spokesman Rick Hess. ``He
lacks experience at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two Democratic presidential contenders _ Vice President
Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley _ have that
experience. The most recent two Democratic presidents _ Bill
Clinton and Jimmy Carter _ did not. Clinton was governor of
Arkansas. Carter was governor of Georgia. Neither held federal
office before getting the top job.
</P>
<P>
   But Hess said Clinton ``had a lot of experience running a state
for four terms,'' and dabbled in foreign relations when riots broke
out among Cuban refugees held in Fort Chafee, Ark. In 1980,
Clinton, then governor, called out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is a couple of months into his second term as
governor,'' Hess said of Bush, grudgingly giving Bush some points
for picking up some foreign policy expertise as a border state
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Bush is untested, according to Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a candidate who has never been in a Republican primary
before. He was elected in 1994, which was a watershed year for
Republicans, and re-elected in 1998. He has never run in a
presidential year,'' said Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's landslide win last year over Democrat Garry
Mauro, Hess said, ``I don't think it was a good test.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes accused the Democrats of ``trying
to reinvent history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, Ann Richards (the Democratic incumbent Bush ousted
in 1994) is an easy candidate to beat and Garry Mauro, who was a
16-year incumbent (state land commissioner), was not a very good
candidate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an excruciating exchange of Easter-related one-liners, the
Democrats and Hughes shelled each other Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. George W. Bush is again taking eggs-traordinary steps to
avoid discussing his political positions with members of the
media,'' the DNC said in a release rapping him for ``barring''
reporters from last week's Easter egg hunt at the Governor's
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, the Democrats have their facts all scrambled,'' said
Hughes, noting that Bush has had two press conferences in the past
10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The egg hunt was off-limits to reporters at the request of the
legislative spouses who sponsored it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not want the Easter egg hunt, intended for little
children, to be turned into a news conference on the presidential
campaign,'' Hughes said. ``And the governor agreed.

ONE YEAR LATER, DOPING SCANDAL RESURFACES IN BELGIUM AND FRANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Belgium, Italy)  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The drug scandal in professional bicycle racing erupted
on two fronts Thursday, with Belgian police yanking the top-ranked
professional team out of a race and an announcement in France that
a top cycling official is under criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented police intervention in the Three Days of La
Panne race came after a Belgian newspaper reported that the
authorities were investigating a case involving amphetamines seized
at the Brussels, Belgium, airport. Five flasks of the drug had been
traced to the hotel where Mapei, the Italy-based racing team, was
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that they could not wait until Thursday's competition
ended, the police stopped Thursday morning's road stage after two
kilometers and took the Mapei riders and officials to Kortrijk for
questioning. In a show of support, the other racers refused to
continue the day's first of two races.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities later exonerated the Mapei team members, but it
was too late for Tom Steels, a Belgian who had been leading the
event. While Mapei's riders were in custody, the final stage, a
14-kilometer (8.68-mile) time trial, was run as scheduled. Frank
Vandenbroucke of Belgium won the stage for the Cofidis team, and
Peter Van Petergem, another Belgian who rides for TVM, won the
overall title.
</P>
<P>
   In Lille, France, Daniel Baal, head of the French Cycling
Federation, was accused of complicity to facilitate and incite
doping, his lawyer, Paul Mauriac, said. In French law, being placed
under formal investigation is a step short of being indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Baal insisted that he has tried to prevent doping, which marred
last year's Tour de France by overshadowing the racing. He said he
was shocked by what he called an unjust decision to investigate
him.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after he was questioned Thursday by
Magistrate Patrick Keil, who is leading the investigation that
began last July and nearly caused the cancellation of the Tour de
France, the sport's most prestigious race. The Festina team, then
No. 1 in racing, was expelled from the Tour after its officials
admitted the systematic use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour, was also
questioned by Keil and announced afterward that he had not been
placed under investigation, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
   Keil ``declared himself satisfied with the replies I had
given,'' Leblanc said. ``As a consequence, I have not been put
under formal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Keil is moving up the sports hierarchy in his investigation.
This week, Roger Legeay, president of the French league of
professional cycling and Baal's deputy at the federation, and
Richard Virenque, the former leader of the Festina team, were both
placed under formal investigation. A dozen others, including
officials, riders and doctors, have also been placed under formal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the case in Belgium, The Associated Press reported that
Belgian news media said that the flasks had been discovered in a
videocassette box. The package was bound for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mapei riders in the La Panne race _ considered a tuneup for
this weekend's Tour of Flanders _ included Michele Bartoli, ranked
No. 1 among world professionals; Johan Museeuw, a former world
road-racing champion, and Steels, the Belgian champion.
</P>
<P>
   The team's hotel was searched and sealed off, and a Belgian
television network said the riders had been taken to the courthouse
in Kortrijk for further questioning after initial questioning near
the race site. The team's director, Patrick Lefevere, a Belgian,
and two other team officials were already in Kortrijk for
questioning, the network said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Denecker, a prosecutor, said the authorities had intended
to intervene after the race but changed their minds and stopped the
race after news of the inquiry appeared in the Het Laatste Nieuws
newspaper.

EDITORIAL: A MOON FOR THE MISINFORMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 2,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   So now it turns out that the ``blue moon'' that appeared
Wednesday _ supposedly the second blue moon of the year _ really
wasn't. In fact, the first blue moon of the year, spotted back in
January, really wasn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as one of those remarkable years in which two
blue moons were to lighten the skies will actually end up as a year
in which not a single blue moon emerges.
</P>
<P>
   We know all this thanks to a timely confession by Sky &AMP;
Telescope magazine, which made a careless error half a century ago
that has reverberated ever after among astronomy buffs. The term
``blue moon'' to these people has come to mean the second full moon
to appear in any calendar month. But when a Canadian folklorist
tried to trace the origins of this meaning, he had a horrendous
time. He tracked it back through a 1986 Trivial Pursuit question,
which was based on a 1985 children's almanac, which may have gotten
it from a 1980 radio broadcast, which was based on a 1946 article
in Sky &AMP; Telescope, which cited the 1937 Maine Farmers' Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble was, Sky &AMP; Telescope now acknowledges, the
original almanac never said a blue moon was the second full moon in
a month. That interpretation was mistakenly inferred by a
contributor to the magazine. The almanac itself apparently decided
that, if there were four full moons in a three-month season, the
third should be called a blue moon. By that reckoning, there will
be no blue moons this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only cause for joy is that we can now get back to the deeper
meanings of ``blue moon,'' which never quite fit with the
two-in-a-month definition anyway. The common expression ``once in a
blue moon'' has always meant ``once in a very long time.'' Yet the
appearance of two full moons in the same calendar month is not all
that rare, occurring about once every two and a half years or so,
on average.
</P>
<P>
   Lyricists think that blue moons are sad moons that see us
``standing alone ... without a love of my own.'' But the term
``blue moon'' goes back more than 400 years, with meanings that
range from absurdity (much like saying the moon is made of ``green
cheese'') to actual visual descriptions of moons that looked blue
when viewed through the dust kicked up by huge volcanic explosions
or forest fires. Such cataclysmic events really do occur rarely, or
``once in a blue moon.''

EDITORIAL: PATIENCE AND TENACITY IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   As the setbacks mount in Kosovo, including the capture of three
U.S. servicemen, it has become clear that this conflict will not
produce another lightning military victory for the United States.
For a superpower lately grown accustomed to swift, decisive and
relatively bloodless military ventures abroad, the war in Kosovo
seems likely to require great patience and a high tolerance for
uncertainty. That is especially true for President Clinton and his
advisers, who must resist the temptation to react to every
battlefield reversal with an instant, improvised escalation of
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has proved to be a cunning
and cruel opponent who has exploited the limitations of NATO's air
assault by sending his troops on a rampage across Kosovo. U.S. and
NATO commanders underestimated his endurance and savagery. But that
is no reason to rush wildly into some new phase of warfare. The
smarter course in an admittedly dismal situation is to give the
strategy of targeted bombing time to grind on Milosevic's resolve
and the patience of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Steadiness is especially important because every new misfortune
in Kosovo increases the pressure on Clinton to direct more
firepower against Serbia. In addition to the wrenching images of
thousands of frightened refugees streaming across the border to
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, there is now the harrowing
television picture of three U.S. soldiers with bloodied faces held
captive by the Serbs. Whether the men strayed into Kosovo or were
abducted from Macedonia, they must be treated humanely by
Milosevic. A military trial of the soldiers, threatened by Serbian
authorities, would be repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   But bombing military targets in downtown Belgrade, which has
been approved by NATO and could commence at any time, will not help
the three Americans or advance NATO's interests. The Serbian
capital is an old and densely populated city of two million people,
many living and working near government buildings. Numerous
civilians could be killed by the most accurate missile or bomb
attack, rallying support for Milosevic within Serbia and generating
sympathy for his cause in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Both public and congressional opinion need to be consulted about
decisions so grave as bombing a European capital or sending ground
troops into Kosovo. Neither step would immediately end the Serb
sweep across Kosovo. It would take days to prepare for a limited
invasion of 30,000 troops aimed at establishing safe havens in
Kosovo for ethnic Albanians. A month or more would be needed to
assemble the tanks, helicopters and 200,000 soldiers required to
evict Serbian forces altogether from Kosovo. Either strategy could
produce large numbers of NATO casualties, and must be coordinated
with a political plan for the future of Kosovo that Washington and
its allies have not yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the most appropriate military response to the Serb
assault is to locate and bomb Serbian forces in Kosovo, to disrupt
their supply lines and communications networks and to hit command
posts and other military targets outside Belgrade. Inadequate NATO
planning and bad weather have restricted such attacks so far.
Augmented air strikes cannot prevent Serbian atrocities, but they
can slow the Serbian advance and may eventually drive Milosevic to
seek a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In warfare, disappointment and frustration can produce
impulsive, defective decisions. Clinton seemed to recognize the
danger Thursday when he told a Navy audience in Virginia that ``We
must be determined and patient.'' He and his aides should be guided
by that view as they manage what promises to be a long and
difficult conflict with Serbia.

EDITORIAL: THE DIALLO CASE UNFOLDS

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Amadou Diallo case has moved into the courts with
the arrests of four white policemen, a calm should begin settling
over the streets outside New York City's government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, who have been venting their anger over Diallo's
death in a barrage of 41 police bullets, have made their mark,
elevating their fears about local police tactics into a national
issue. Minorities have sent City Hall a clear message that no one
in their neighborhoods should be forced to exchange the fear of
crime for a fear of police.
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir,
this relatively quiet moment offers an opportunity to carry through
on their plans for adjusting behavior not only at the Police
Department but also at City Hall. Among those worthy promises are
an energetic drive to recruit minorities in the police force, an
overhaul of the Street Crimes Unit where the four police officers
charged with the Diallo shooting worked and a beefing up of the
cadet program that draws more minorities into the 40,000-strong
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the most important statements made in the wake of
the Diallo case is Giuliani's observation that he needs to build
bridges to the communities that feel most abused by police, even as
they enjoy the benefits of a lower crime rate in their
neighborhoods. Giuliani last weekend seemed to demonstrate his
desire to develop better relations with black and Hispanic leaders,
but such relationships require a patience and tempering of rhetoric
that the mayor apparently has difficulty displaying.
</P>
<P>
   His emotional speech Wednesday in defense of city police
strategies brought support to the thousands of admirable
law-enforcement officials whose efforts to lower crime deserve his
encouragement. But when he fumes that police are sometimes
``second-guessed by some of the worst in society,'' the mayor only
ignites tempers, making it even more difficult for moderate blacks
and Hispanics to help him and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has made a start at bridge building and shown great
empathy with the police. Now he needs to prove he understands the
rest of his citizenry with the same depth and compassion. He can
succeed by continuing his police reforms and by meeting with black
and Hispanic leaders not merely to debate but also to listen.

GRAENUM BERGER, 90, ORGANIZED AIRLIFT OF ETHIOPIAN JEWS TO ISRAEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ethiopia, Israel, N.Y., Va., Mo.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graenum Berger, an American who campaigned long and successfully
for having Ethiopia's Falashas, who are also called Ethiopian Jews,
transported to Israel, died Wednesday at his home in New Rochelle,
N.Y. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, a social worker by profession, worked for years for the
Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York and was concerned
with Jewish community center programs in New York state, in Israel
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   His horror at what he saw as the poverty and bigotry besetting
the Falashas in Ethiopia led to his becoming, as The Jerusalem Post
said last year, ``unequivocally responsible for a remarkable
achievement in recent Jewish history: Fifty thousand Ethiopian Jews
were rescued and brought to Israel largely because of Berger's
passionate and single-minded advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   He founded the American Association for Ethiopian Jews more than
a quarter century ago and began his campaigning years before the
Falashas' main exoduses took place, in 1984-85 and in 1991. He said
in 1993: ``We're not trying to claim credit for ourselves. We
brought out about 1,200 ourselves. But when the Israelis and world
Jewry decided to take over, they did what we always hoped. They
could do the job, dramatically and heroically.''
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Israel in 1955, he met a few Ethiopian Jews who
were studying there and became fascinated by what has been called
Ethiopia's Jewish tribe. .
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the Falashas in Ethiopia in 1965, he was dismayed. In a
1998 interview, he recalled having seen ``extreme poverty, the
worst in the world, where people earned $65 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced the Falashas should go to Israel, he thought American
Jewish leaders would want to help. He told them what he had seen.
But, he reported in the 1998 interview, ``They didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Berger gave lectures about the Falashas to
American audiences and became his association's energetic first
president. A favorable development followed: in 1975 the Israeli
rabbinate gave legal recognition to the Falashas as Jews.
</P>
<P>
   That validation was important because there were doubts about
the Falashas' brand of Judaism. The Encyclopedia Judaica, first
published in 1971, said they were an ``ethnic group in Ethiopia
which claims to be of Jewish origin and which is attached to a form
of the Jewish religion based on the Bible, certain books of the
Apocrypha, and other post-biblical Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rabbinate's validation of the Falashas, as the
journal The Jewish Week has put it, ``It was only after Berger went
public in calling for Israeli action _ in defiance of pleas to keep
the issue secret for fear of jeopardizing the Falashas _ that
Jerusalem began to rescue several dozen Ethiopian Jews every few
months from the Sudan, where they had fled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by Berger's association continued, aimed at members of
Congress as well as Jewish groups. Then, in 1984 and 1985,
Operation Moses, a secret, large-scale airlift of Falashas to
Israel, was begun _ but was stopped prematurely after Israel
officially acknowledged its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in 1991, further thousands of Falashas were
airlifted to Israel in Operation Solomon. In 1993, the executive
director of Berger's association, William Recant, said: ``It is our
belief that all of the Jews are out of Ethiopia, that any
stragglers are free to come and go as they please. There's a
50,000-strong Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Gloversville, N.Y., Berger received a bachelor's degree
in 1930 from the University of Missouri and a master's degree in
1932 from the Graduate School of Jewish Social Work, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, the former Emma Finestein; a
son, Col. B. Michael Berger of Vienna, Va.; five grandchildren, and
four great-grandchildren.

STARS READY TO GET DOWN TO NITTY-GRITTY BEFORE PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars' training room is filled with injured
bodies, including leading scorer Mike Modano. The power play is in
its worst slump in two seasons. And the Stars' detail game has
been, in a word, sloppy, forthe past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So with eight games remaining in the regular season, how much
work do the Stars have to do to get ready for the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We have a lot of
work to do to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the good news: The Stars have the time and the schedule
to be perfectly prepared. In fact, Hitchcock said the schedule
couldn't have set up better for the Stars in their stretch run to
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have solid competition that should keep us focused and we
have plenty of time to rest and practice,'' Hitchcock said
yesterday after taking the Stars through their most intense
practice in more than two months. ``We had to suffer through a lot
in the past month or so, but now we're reaping the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, benefits might be too strong a word to grasp, what with
Modano out seven to 14 days with a groin strain and Richard
Matvichuk (knee), Shawn Chambers (hip) and Brian Skrudland (chest)
not expected to return until next week. But the potential for
benefit is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that we can straighten out in our
game right now,'' winger Pat Verbeek said. ``We have to be serious
about the details, all the little things that can help us be a
better team. You can't just flip a switch and expect it to be there
for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those details are a little shaky, but with good reason. The
Stars played 16 games in March, including 10 on the road. At one
point, the Stars played nine games in 15 days, with seven of the
nine on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the two home games felt like road games,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stars had a 4-3-2 record in that stretch, it was
clear the details of their game had eroded. They weren't passing
the puck well, they had miscommunications like offside calls and
bench minors for illegal substitutions, they allowed opposing
players to get open in front of their net, and they couldn't
stretch leads once they got them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to complain, but by the Anaheim game \Ra 5-1 loss
March 26\S, I could feel it,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   With Matvichuk and Chambers out, the Stars were forced to pile
more minutes on Ludwig and fellow defensemen Derian Hatcher, Sergei
Zubov and Darryl Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think we really saw it affect their game,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hitchcock is hoping for the return of his injured
defensemen and also is looking to provide more rest for his healthy
players. What's more, the extra practice time will be crucial in
finding the timing and the puck handling that have been missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of skill, and you have to practice if you're
going to have skill,'' Hitchcock said. ``I know the players aren't
always happy with practice, they want to just get right to the
playoffs, but I think they also know they need the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, the Stars had the most detailed game in
the NHL. Players tracked hard on specific forechecking assignments
to force opposing team's defensemen to cough up the puck. When the
Stars went to the offensive net and missed on a scoring chance,
forwards backchecked hard to prevent an outmanned rush going the
opposite way. If a Stars' defenseman decided to push hard into the
offensive zone to help create a scoring opportunity, a forward
always would rotate back into the defenseman's spot and cover
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's anyone's guess as to whether a player will be there.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency with the power play also has been a problem.
As recently as Feb. 1, the Stars had the dominant power play in the
NHL. They had hit for 51 goals with the man advantage and had a
20.7 success rate. Since then, however, the power play has scored
15 goals on a 12.5 percent success rate. The Stars now rank sixth
in success and trail the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (76 goals) by 10
goals in overall power-play production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we have to fix,'' Modano said. ``When it's
scoring, it's like we get an extra goal a game. Right now, we're
fighting for every goal we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The good side to that struggle is the Stars have won a lot of
close games. They are 23-6 in one-goal games and are 12-2-5 when
tied after two periods. Although there have been some third-period
struggles, the Stars are showing they don't mind playing in
high-pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's playoff hockey,'' Ludwig said. ``That's what we're used
to. We're not afraid to have a one-goal lead and we're not afraid
to win a game 1-0. Those are things that should help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Stars wouldn't mind giving themselves a little
breathing room. That's one reason Hitchcock is going to err on the
side of caution when it comes to returning his injured players.
(Modano likely will be out the longest, Hitchcock said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be hurt right now, but we should have everyone healthy,
knock on wood, with at least three games left in the season,''
Hitchcock said. ``And three games should be enough to get anyone
ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, just think what the Stars can do with eight
games. regular season, where postseason preparation is the target.

IN DIALLO CASE, ALL SIDES SEE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AS CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: NY-DIALLO-TRIAL)  
(DW) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four
police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already
taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and
experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based
on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole
incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often
fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a
crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing
questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in
fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting?
How quickly did he fall? Is there anything at the crime scene to
explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed
man?
</P>
<P>
   The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent
in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an
extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing
range.
</P>
<P>
   _ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington
who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced
bullet trajectories with lasers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene
specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the
prosecution's experts propose.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has
led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was
shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his
initial wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is
the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the
credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a
lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil
suit in the case. ``You can question their story based on common
sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard. But
none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective,
irrefutable scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same
irrefutable science to argue a opposite position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen
Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four
accused of second-degree murder. ``What the forensic evidence will
not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body.
Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely,
the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired
at a standing person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case
will hinge on forensic evidence. Assuming the officers testify,
their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in
the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive
factor.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses
will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric
calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to
contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one
conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice. ``But what often happens is that one
side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets
polluted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on
details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial. But
the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually
constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing
the civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers'
assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had
been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him. There are
apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account,
although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said
they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version
as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr.
Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was
knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord
severed,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the
alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does
not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body
when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people
who have reviewed the report have said.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the
front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate
points. Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's
conclusion that he was paralyzed. Wecht's analysis that those shots
came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of
blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said
the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is
impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the
chest were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said.
``You can't tell which is first and which is second. Any medical
examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross
examination.''
</P>
<P>
   A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot
also figure to be a source of debate. The city's autopsy indicates
that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the
calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a
second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe
``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was
shot after he had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the
incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no
chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired
subsequent rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as
the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they
heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward
McMellon fell down while firing.

SMOKING BY MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS DROPS SHARPLY IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One year after Florida started a statewide educational
campaign against tobacco, directed at teen-agers, smoking among
middle-school students has declined by the largest margin observed
in the United States in almost 20 years, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study that will appear in Friday's issue of the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report, the centers cite a survey conducted by
the Florida Department of Health showing that the number of
children in grades six through eight who reported using cigarettes
this year fell to 15 percent from 18.5 percent, a decline of 19
percent from a year ago, when students were last surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also charts more modest declines in cigarette and
cigar smoking among high school students. The decrease was steeper
among non-Hispanic white students than among Hispanic and black
students, the survey showed, but non-Hispanic whites still had the
highest rate of cigarette use as a group.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which were gathered from a sample of almost 23,000
students in 225 schools around Florida, were hailed by national
health experts after years of reports showing little or no decrease
in cigarette smoking by teen-agers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is a pleasant surprise,'' said Dr. Michael
Eriksen, the director for the Office on Smoking and Health at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta.
``There is no question that the reduction in Florida is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Although further study is needed to determine the cause for such
a steep decline, Eriksen added, the results are most likely due to
Florida's aggressive anti-tobacco campaign, which has been hailed
as one of the most effective in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's campaign, the Tobacco Pilot Program, is financed by a
$13 billion settlement reached between the state and the tobacco
companies in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the survey's results come at a time when the survival of
Florida's anti-smoking initiative faces challenge by the state's
policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   In his appropriations request to the state Legislature, Gov. Jeb
Bush trimmed the amount of money the program spends on enforcing
laws against underage possession of tobacco, requesting $61.5
million for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. Last year, the
state spent $70 million on the program. The budget is currently
under committee review.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton said Thursday that the
survey results showed ``why every state should have a comprehensive
program to reduce youth smoking and why I oppose any legislation
waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds
without making a commitment from the states to fund such efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Florida's anti-smoking initiative is a
campaign called ``Truth'' that has launched aggressive television
and radio advertisements in which angry teen-agers accuse tobacco
companies of lying.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Pilot Program doubled its enforcement efforts,
imposing fines or community service for thousands of teen-agers
caught smoking, and going after retailers who sold cigarettes to
minors. In schools around the state, teachers received special
training to conduct workshops where middle-school students engaged
in discussion and role playing to learn how to overcome peer
pressure to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the price of cigarettes nationally over the past
year may have also contributed to lower rates of smoking among
middle-school children, but it is unclear how much this may have
helped lower the Florida smoking rates, Eriksen said. Although
tobacco companies have raised the price of 20-cigarette packs to
wholesalers by about 60 cents nationwide, they have also offset
some of the ensuing lower demand through special promotions that
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said it was unlikely that results as statistically
significant as those made public Thursday would be replicated as
other states begin to release their smoking data for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has a unique program,'' said Kathryn Kahler Vose,
director of communications for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids
in Washington. ``They have one of the most aggressive and
comprehensive programs in the country. You don't see these kinds of
numbers in other states. Most spend very little money on tobacco
prevention.''

   ATHENS, Ga. _ Had Vince Dooley been in his office rather than on
a Civil War battlefield in New Market, Va., Thursday when he got
the news Jim Harrick wanted to return to Rhode Island, the Bulldogs
would have named their second basketball coach in 24 hours on

basketball coach. That it happened on April Fools Day was a cruel
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of waffling that would make Bobby Cremins blush,
Harrick left Georgia, returned to Rhode Island, then returned to
the Bulldogs all in one day. The former UCLA head coach remained in
Providence, R.I., Thursday night but was to return to Athens this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley and his grandson were on a vacation retreat in Virginia,
where they were touring Civil War battlefields. Therefore, when
Dooley got the call from university President Michael Adams that
Harrick had backed out, he was unable to call his next coaching
prospect, believed to be Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, I didn't have my phone numbers with me,'' Dooley
said.``Otherwise, I might have made another commitment, who
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in four years that Georgia has been the
victim of a coach's indecision. The Bulldogs hired football coach
Glen Mason from Kansas on Dec. 18, 1995 to have him back out of the
job on Christmas Day. That same day, they named Jim Donnan as
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dooley said he called Donnan to offer him the job
without ever laying down the telephone. Fortunately for Harrick,
Dooley was not in position to do the same thing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley said the only reason Georgia took Harrick back was
because the source of his decision was his unwillingness to leave
his family, many of whom had moved to Rhode Island just to be close
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been for any other reason, I don't think I would
have understood it and we would have gone in another direction,''
Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick did not return repeated phone calls to his cell phone
Thursday. Georgia officials said they hoped he would be available
for interviews sometime today.
</P>
<P>
   According to Adams, who handled the crisis in Dooley's absence,
Harrick called him at 9:30 Thursday morning to tell him he was
having second thoughts and was considering a return to Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick met with Adams and Georgia senior associate athletics
director Dick Bestwick for more than an hour. Harrick left the
meeting to return to Providence and said he would call them back
with a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m., Harrick informed Adams he indeed planned to stay
at Rhode Island, at which time Georgia set forth its public
relations machine and prepared a release. Rhode Island also called
a 7 p.m. press conference to discuss Harrick's return.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Harrick then called him again at 5:30 p.m. to say
he'd changed his mind yet again, but now was completely committed
to join the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I told him I could not tell him that he could
still be the coach because that had to come from the athletics
director,'' Adams said. ``I called coach Dooley and he called coach
Harrick and they worked it out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the embarrassment Harrick's indecision caused the
university, Adams said: ``Sometimes in this business, you get into
a no-win situation and I do believe that was the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley insisted the whole incident was not an embarrassment
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's the case,'' Dooley said. ``It's not good.
If it were not a case where it was because of family, it could have
been an embarrassment. But it was because of his family and that's
something we can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Harrick actually had a job to return to at Rhode Island
is unclear. Georgia's Adams assured that he did. But Harrick
definitely will not be welcomed back in Providence if he
about-faced again.
</P>
<P>
   At what was supposed to be the press conference to announce
Harrick's return to Rhode Island, URI vice President Robert Beagle
read the following statement: ``It's clear to all of us that coach
Harrick is troubled. President (Robert) Carothers has indicated to
us we should announce that it is clear that coach Harrick is not
capable of coaching the University of Rhode Island basketball team
at this time.

SETTING A SCHEDULE IS THE NEXT LEGAL STEP 
</HEADLINE>
 DIALLO-TRIAL-NYT  (Eds: See also Diallo-Shooting) (DW) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that the four police officers charged with
killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the
legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers
and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a
schedule for the pretrial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting is set for April 30 at the state Supreme Court in
the Bronx, before Acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers will be given a timetable in which to make their
motions, or requests to the court. Prosecutors will be given
deadlines to respond to those motions. If the matters are likely to
be contested, the judge might set dates for hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer representing Officer Sean
Carroll, said Thursday that in addition to standard motions like
those for discovery _ in which lawyers ask prosecutors to hand over
the information they have collected _ he expected defense lawyers
to ask the judge to review the grand jury minutes to decide if the
indictments were supported by the evidence. A request for a change
of venue is also possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg also said he plans to ask the court to review grand
jury attendance records to make sure that a quorum were present
each day, and that the grand jurors who voted to indict the
officers were present to hear all the evidence presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they weren't present, or there wasn't a quorum, these
indictments may be dismissed on motions,'' Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including
whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether
the officers waive their right to a jury trial. Police officers in
criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case,
fearing that juries would be unsympathetic.

SANTA ANITA LOSERS CAN BE KENTUCKY CONTENDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ If you want to see the next Kentucky Derby winner,
look behind the Santa Anita Derby winner on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson of the past two Santa Anita Derbies, which
sent runners-up Silver Charm and Real Quiet on to victories in
(begin ital)the(end ital) Derby four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Aberrations?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Since Sunday Silence won both Derbies and the
Preakness in 1989, Santa Anita Derby winners have gone on to only
one victory in a Triple Crown race, A.P. Indy's Belmont Stakes in
'92. In those 10 years, Santa Anita Derby losers Tabasco Cat
(second in '94), Timber Country (fourth in '95), Silver Charm and
Real Quiet have accounted for seven victories in Triple Crown
races.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Churchill Downs failures by Santa Anita heroes can
be blamed on injury (Dinard, A.P. Indy, Larry the Legend) and bad
racing luck (Brocco breaking slowly, Cavonnier taking a whip in the
face).
</P>
<P>
   Also, Santa Anita losers outnumber winners, so of course the
chances are good that some loser will turn the tables in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, in the 61 years that the Santa Anita Derby has
served as the West's major Triple Crown prep, winners have gone on
to 17 victories in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont;
losers to only 13.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenal success of Santa Anita Derby losers in the
1990s shouldn't be ignored. It's instructive for the 30,000 to
35,000 fans who will attend the $750,000 race in person and
everybody else who will watch on television Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before assuming the winner is the best 3-year-old in California,
consider possible reasons one of the horses chasing him or her to
the wire might be better:
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck: The 1[-mile Santa Anita Derby typically is a cleanly
run race in which post positions have little obvious effect, but a
loser might get an uncharacteristically slow start, be caught in
traffic or disadvantaged by an unusually fast or slow pace. Try to
imagine whether the horse could have won without the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Running style: Because the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont
are each longer than the Santa Anita Derby, horses who exhibit
stamina in defeat should be respected. No horse who needed more
than 133/5 seconds to run the final eighth of a mile has gone on to
win a Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   Most future winners covered the last furlong at Santa Anita in
about 13 seconds. Tabasco Cat and Timber Country came home in 12
1/5 in losing efforts to signal their affinity for greater
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who understand pedigrees have an even better chance of
guessing each horse's distance capability.
</P>
<P>
   Track condition: It almost never rains on Southern California's
Derby, but if the track is wet Saturday, that might help General
Challenge (who has won on ``wet-fast'' and ``good'' surfaces) while
providing an easy excuse for losers.
</P>
<P>
   Even a ``fast'' track might subtly favor one kind of horse,
perhaps a front-runner, over another. On Santa Anita Derby day in
'98, horses with early speed went on to win more than their share
of the races, and viewed in that context, Real Quiet was impressive
in rallying from sixth to second behind winner Indian Charlie. Real
Quiet went on to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Take note of any Santa Anita Derby horse who puts up a good
fight against an apparent track bias, even if it's not enough to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Maturity: ``They're 3-year-olds and they're changing as they
come into the spring,'' said Richard Mandella, who trains Desert
Hero. ``They're starting to mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Downgrade the winner if he has raced only a handful of times,
leaving him too inexperienced to withstand the rough and tumble of
the Kentucky Derby, or if he has raced too many times, leaving
little room for improvement. Indian Charlie is the latest example
of an underseasoned Santa Anita winner. He ran third in Kentucky
and was soon retired with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's field, Charismatic has raced a whopping 12 times,
while High Wire Act and the filly Honest Lady have raced just three
times and Desert Hero only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrade a loser who has shown ability in the past and might have
benefited from the Santa Anita Derby experience. Maybe he learned
to take a little dirt in the face. Or maybe he needed the race to
get in shape. Silver Charm got a late start on his 3-year-old
campaign because of illness. Running second to Free House sharpened
him.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber, who goes into Saturday's race as the nation's No.1
Kentucky Derby contender, got a late start this season and should
continue to improve. Capsized missed a week of training with a foot
injury before his third-place finish last time out and could regain
momentum Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Derby winner will earn a $450,000 check, a lot
of prestige and all the attention. But a bigger prize might await
one of the losers.
</P>
<P>
   An odd choice: Desert Hero is a 5-2 favorite _ General Challenge
3-1, Prime Timber 7-2 and the filly Honest Lady 4-1 _ on a
questionable morning line set Thursday by Santa Anita's Jeff Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of press-box handicappers found nearly unanimous belief
that Prime Timber will be favored and Honest Lady's odds will be
higher than 4-1. Desert Hero overcame a troubled trip to defeat
Prime Timber in their only meeting. But that was Prime Timber's
first start in 2{ months and he's No.1 in national 3-year-old
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The other surprise Thursday was the entry of Walk That Walk, a
maiden-race winner trained by Michael Whittingham. He was made the
30-1 long shot in the eight-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: Santa Anita will offer its second _ and probably
last _ guaranteed $1 million pick-six pool of the season on
Saturday's 11-race program. It'll start with the sixth race, the
race (begin ital)after(end ital) the Derby. &QL;

MCCAIN PUTS 2000 RACE ON HOLD; SAYS GROUND TROOPS MAY BE NEEDED IN
KOSOVO 
  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH AND JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Just after calling for complete victory in
Kosovo, even if it means using U.S. ground forces, Arizona Sen.
John McCain announced Thursday that he's temporarily suspending his
presidential campaign because of the escalating military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate at this time to launch a political
campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the 62-year-old Republican senator stressed that McCain
was not having second thoughts about his bid for the White House in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Howard Opinsky, McCain's press
spokesman. ``There's a war going on.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's announcement that he was postponing next week's
presidential announcement tour came just after he made some of his
harshest comments to date concerning the Clinton administration's
handling of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly recommend that we not rule out the option of ground
troops,'' McCain said Thursday during a news conference at Sky
Harbor International Airport. ``Which is what the administration,
for all intent and purpose, has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic should not be given any
assurances that ground troops wouldn't be used, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it caused U.S. casualties _ ``and pain to American
families'' _ ground troops should be used if that what it takes to
win, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of failing to win this conflict are severe
and would then entail a much larger sacrifice of American blood,
not only there but in other parts of the world,'' McCain said.
``They pay attention in Pyongyang, North Korea, and Baghdad, Iraq,
and other places in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   American credibility is at stake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent CNN poll showed that 57 percent of Americans opposed
using U.S. ground troops in Kosovo and that 54 percent approved so
far of how President Clinton is handling the situation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Clinton has failed to explain to the public the
importance of the conflict and why U.S. ground forces could be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make the American people aware that this is a very
difficult situation we are in now,'' McCain said. ``There are no
good options. . . . You have to go to the American people and
explain to them what is at stake here, then I believe the American
people will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain said he did not think the military campaign has
been achieving its goals, the bombing should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it until it has lost any effectiveness that it might
obtain, and at the same time plan to, if necessary, send in ground
troops,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The world's only remaining military superpower should not be
intimidated into holding it army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a formidable adversary,'' McCain said. ``The
Croatian Army defeated the Serbian Army a few years ago. So this is
not some overwhelming force we are facing. In fact, Yugoslavia is
the size of the state of Connecticut. The United States has
superior force. We need to use it.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that similar statements were made by U.S.
officials during the 1960s about Vietnam, but he said there were no
real parallels between the two conflicts. He said communist powers
supplied North Vietnam during that war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this week there was at least one similarity for McCain, a
POW during the Vietnam War. He reacted strongly to the capture by
Serbian forces of three American servicemen assigned to
peacekeeping duties along the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is an affront to all of us,'' he said.
``We will not allow such a thing, and we will make it clear to
Mister Milosevic and his government they are in trouble now, and
they will be in a lot more trouble if they are not returned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the servicemen were part of U.N. peacekeeping operation
along the border _ participating in the armed conflict _ and should
not be put on trial, as Serbian leaders have threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they were somehow viewed by a great stretch of the
imagination of having been captured in combat, they are subject to
the Geneva Convention, which expressly prohibits them being placed
on trial,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us remember the Vietnamese threat during the Vietnam
War to put American pilots on trial. They were told in no uncertain
terms that if they did such a thing, they would pay a very heavy
price. Mister Milosevic has to be told the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he can understand what the servicemen are going
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a certain anguish because the most difficult period of
the prisoner of war experience is the initial period, the
adjustment to mistreatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain warned Serbian leaders that if they harmed the three
service men, a war crime trial would be in order after the conflict
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could speak directly to these three young men,'' McCain
said, ``I would say, `You are well-trained. You are professional.
You are the finest fighting men in world. We are proud of you, and
we are completely confident that you will behave in a manner in
which you and your country will be proud.' '' &QL;

LAKERS' NO. 2 UNIT IS FIRST-RATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Survey some of the Lakers' biggest scoring runs of
the last week, and at their core you'll find a familiar threesome:
the steady point guard, the hyperactive power forward and the
quick-scoring small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, Rodman and Rice? Try Fisher, Horry and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers' starting five _ Derek Harper, Kobe Bryant,
Glen Rice, Dennis Rodman and Shaquille O'Neal _ continue to start
games at half speed, the second unit has been providing the early
scoring punch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it shouldn't be such a surprise. The first group of subs _
Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Rick Fox _ were all starters for the
Lakers last season. For the last three games, that trio has entered
the game simultaneously, late in the first quarter, and with either
Bryant or O'Neal still on the floor, the combination has been
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Against Sacramento last Friday, the Fisher-Horry-Fox unit (with
Bryant and J.R. Reid) keyed a 20-point burst in four minutes to
turn a deficit into a 30-20 lead by the end of the first quarter.
Against New York on Sunday, the trio combined with O'Neal and
Bryant for an early second-quarter run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mix that was good for last year.... It's good to know
that if that's the second unit that can pull away from teams,
that's an asset,'' Fox said. ``I know it felt comfortable because I
knew those guys. It was like last year's starting lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of incorporating new players and tinkering with the
starting lineup and rotation, coach Kurt Rambis has settled on a
more consistent substitution pattern. The consistency has helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all three of us are just feeling more comfortable with
our roles,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Kurt and his coaching staff credit to get us back
together since we played so well together last year,'' Fox said.
``I like the results and the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   It's led to an offensive resurgence for Fox, who's averaging
13.0 points in 20.0 minutes in the last three games. Rambis has
been running plays lately for Fox, a scorer most of his career, and
Fox has been able to take advantage of his part-time role as a
shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm posting up two-guards, who are way too small, and in 20
minutes, I can get you 15 quick points if plays are run for me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis won't commit to a permanent rotation pattern yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not completely sold that that's my final situation,'' he
said, ``but I'm happy with what all those players are doing when
they do get substituted in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher hopes the current arrangement will stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's working, definitely,'' he said. ``I think all
three of us just bring a total change from the first group to the
second group. Robert and I try to bring some energy and some spark
to the defense, and then Rick, when he's shooting the ball well, he
brings some spark to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depth that you have and the guys coming off the bench are
just as important as those guys that start the game. So we have to
keep that in mind and understand that our roles are just as
vital.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Horry practiced Thursday for the first time since
injuring his hip in Monday's game against Vancouver. He's listed as
probable for tonight's game at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, still suffering from a cold, sat out a second
straight day but is expected to be available tonight.

 R.F. Chandler, AGRONOMIST WHO LED FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER N ASIA, DIES By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Flint Chandler Jr., a retired agronomist with the
Rockefeller Foundation and a leader in the fight against hunger in
Asia, died on March 23 at Waterman Hospital in Eustis, Fla. He was
91 and lived in nearby Mount Dora.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler joined the foundation staff in 1954 and soon afterward
received worldwide recognition as a field commander in the ``Green
Revolution'' that helped to feed populations in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   That agricultural initiative led to the development of the first
high-yield grains and earned Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, a plant breeder
and head of the celebrated Mexican wheat team, the 1970 Nobel Peace
Prize. Chandler was posted to the Philippines to take charge of a
similar project there.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1972, he directed the new International Rice
Research Institute in Manila, sponsored by the Rockefeller
Foundation. The institute developed more than two dozen varieties
of rice and devised methods for farmers to grow them. The objective
was richer harvests to keep up with population growth, and its
success had rice-exporting countries like Thailand concerned about
a possible glut of the rice market.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler moved on to Taiwan, where he led the Asian Vegetable
Research and Development Center until 1975. Later he was an
international consultant and wrote two books to add to the numerous
articles he published, ``Rice in the Tropics: A Guide to National
Development'' (Westview, 1979) and ``An Adventure in Applied
Science: The Early History of the International Rice Research
Institute,'' published by the institute in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became the institute's founding director, Chandler had
a distinguished career in academia. A native of Columbus, Ohio, he
graduated with a degree in horticulture from the University of
Maine in 1929 and received a doctorate in pomology, the science of
fruit cultivation, from the University of Maryland in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   He taught about forest soils at Cornell University and rose to
the rank of professor. From 1947 until 1954 he was dean of the
University of New Hampshire College of Agriculture and then
president of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was decorated by the governments of the Philippines,
Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Kenya and received the World Food
Prize in 1988 and the Presidential End Hunger Award in 1986. He was
a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chandler is survived by his wife, Sunny; two sons, David, of
Goodyear, Ariz., and Ralph, of Rochester, N.H.; a daughter, Sara,
of Lewiston, Me.; two sisters, Audrey Woodman, of Kittery Point,
Me., and Esther Chandler, of Hull, Mass.; and seven grandchildren.

W.H. DIAL, WHO WHO HELPED ORLANDO AREA BECOME TOURIST MECCA, DIES
AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Henry Dial, a lawyer, banker and civic leader in Florida
who helped reinvent Orlando, a little town of citrus groves, as a
vacation and convention mecca known the world over, died on March
23 at his home in Orlando. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Dial played a pivotal part in the 1960s in helping the Walt
Disney Company assemble thousands of acres of land near Orlando,
quietly and at low cost, for what became Disney World. He also
pushed successfully to have the Florida Turnpike routed through
Orlando so that tourists might converge on the new attraction. He
helped persuade the Martin Company, now Lockheed Martin, to build a
large plant in Orlando in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was born in Lake City, Fla. He worked his way through
college and law school selling men's suits. He received his law
degree from the University of Florida in 1932 and settled in
Orlando to practice. Most recently he was of counsel to the firm of
Akerman, Senterfitt &AMP; Eidson.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his contributions as a banker that established his
reputation in his community and central Florida. Early in his
career he started doing legal work for the First National Bank of
Orlando; then, he stopped active practice to become its executive
vice president in 1958 and president in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He guided First National through a period of robust growth as it
turned itself into Sun Banks Inc., one of the region's largest
financial institutions. He served as board chairman and then
chairman of the executive committee from 1967 until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Now known as Suntrust Banks of Florida, it became a subsidiary
of the Atlanta-based Suntrust Banks Inc., one of the biggest
banking companies in the country. After he left banking, Dial
returned to his law firm. He retired about eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of two books, ``Florida Banking Code'' and
``History of the Banking Laws of Florida,'' both published in 1953.
He was a past chairman of the United Appeal of Orange County and a
deacon in the Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Dial's wife, Grace Franklin Dial, died in 1991. The Dials were
married 56 years. Dial is survived by two daughters, Joan D.
Ruffier and Patricia D. Vig, both of Orlando; six grandchildren,
and four great-grandchildren.

CALL IT THE DETOUR SERIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Freeway Series has been reduced to the Freeway
Game. By next year, the annual Dodgers-Angels preseason get
together in SoCal could be extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors could put an end to the long-standing tradition,
including the Dodgers' desire to play exhibition games outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said the club is looking
into playing an exhibition game _ or games _ next year in either
the Dominican Republic, Mexico or Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've explored that in the past and we'll do it again,''
Graziano said. ``It all depends on the logistics of the situation,
and what other teams are doing. It could be done (next year) if
there was something that made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Angels have played in the Freeway Series each
year since 1981, and have played all but three times since 1962.
Tonight (7:05 p.m.) the teams play at Anaheim's Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers elect to play exhibition games against another
country's all-star team, it would follow the path blazed by the New
York Mets and Baltimore Orioles this spring. The Mets traveled to
the Dominican Republic to play an exhibition game last month while
the Orioles played in Cuba last Sunday, marking the first time a
U.S. team had played in Cuba in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Dodgers' history with the Dominican Republic, Mexico
and Asia, it would make sense for them to play there. The Dodgers
are considered pioneers in developing players in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   Campo Los Palmas, the Dodgers' baseball academy in the Dominican
Republic, is entering its 13th season. The Dodgers have tapped into
the Asian baseball market with the signings of Hideo Nomo and Chan
Ho Park. And Fernando Valenzuela's success during the '80s linked
the Dodgers to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had surface talk,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``We'd be interested in exploring those opportunities, but we
haven't really looked into it in any detail. It could be worked
out. I think we'd be interested in doing that again. We haven't
talked about any details, but we would be interested in exploring
those opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers played the Milwaukee Brewers in an exhibition game
in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1991 and took postseason trips to Japan
and Taiwan to play in a Friendship Series in 1993. The club made
frequent trips to the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the structure of upcoming regular-season schedules
will dictate, largely, what the Dodgers do. It wouldn't make sense
to travel to Asia for exhibition games unless the Dodgers open the
season on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers' possible spring training move is another
factor in continuing some form of the Freeway Series. If the
Dodgers move from Vero Beach, Fla., to the Fort McDowell Indian
Reservation near Phoenix, the two teams would play several times in
the Cactus League.
</P>
<P>
   Already, much of the luster has been taken off the preseason
series because of interleague play. The teams play six times during
the regular season. Graziano said that's part of the reason the
Dodgers opted out of two of the three Freeway Series games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it's something we're going to have to
revise,'' Graziano said. ``I didn't want to put an end to the
Freeway Series, but at some point you're going to have to look at
it and see if it's better to play exhibition games (with other
teams).
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the alternatives are, and we found out this
year there can be some pretty attractive alternatives. But we want
to make sure there are alternatives on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will host the defending World Series champion New
York Yankees on Saturday and Sunday. The Angels play the
Aguascaliente Railroadmen of the Mexican League on Saturday at
Edison Field and then host Cal State Fullerton on Sunday.

 WASHINGTON: the weekend. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATO's political leadership approved the expansion of targets at
a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials have repeatedly said they have the
forces they need to wage the air war against Yugoslavia, the United
States and other NATO powers, including Britain and France, have
bolstered the number of aircraft in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the United States dispatched five B-1 bombers.
Thursday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered 13 more F-117
``stealth'' fighters to Italy. They will join 11 others that have
been taking part in the raids. A 12th F-117 was shot down over
Serbia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Navy warships _ the Ross, a destroyer, and the Vella
Gulf, a cruiser _ entered the Mediterranean Thursday loaded with
cruise missiles and are expected to join the assault soon. The
aircraft carrier, Theodore Roosevelt, is expected to arrive by the
weekend, bringing with it some 75 aircraft, 50 of them combat jets.
</P>
<P>
   The question remained: would they arrive soon enough? A senior
Pentagon official said that Milosevic's forces, although pummeled,
appeared to be wrapping up a campaign to carve out a Serb-enclave
in Kosovo, having cornered the last remnants of ethnic Albanian
rebels known as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically got every objective he wanted,'' the official
said, citing intelligence reports from Kosovo. ``He's destroyed the
KLA and chased everyone else out.''
</P>
<P>
   American warplanes have flown 60 to 70 percent of the strikes,
largely because the United States has more aircraft suited to foul
weather and able to evade radar, a Pentagon official said. But the
allied contribution has been significant, making up at least half
the total missions flown.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has repeatedly refused to quantify how many missions have
been flown in the air war or break them down by country or
distinguish between bombing runs and support activities such as
refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's raids were overshadowed by the seizure of the
Americans, something that the White House and the Pentagon,
recalling the capture of American troops in Somalia in 1993, had
deeply feared.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in Norfolk, Va., initially described the three soldiers
as ``illegal detainees'' rather than prisoners of war, but by the
end of the day, the Pentagon described them as POWs and demanded
that they not be brought before a military trial in Kosovo, as the
Yugoslav authorities threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday evening that
depending on the circumstances of their capture _ namely whether
they were inside Macedonia or had strayed into Serbia _ the three
``may be'' entitled to immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, pending an investigation and, ideally, the direct
questioning of the three, ``our belief'' is that they did not
violate the Yugoslav border. ``The soldiers should be released
immediately,'' he said at another point, contending that ``at a
minimum'' they were entitled to the protections of the Geneva
Convention, which calls for the humane treatment of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the border tensions of the situation, some critics
questioned whether the three soldiers observed regulations and
should have been better protected by operating within some larger
formation better able to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded,'' said a retired senior Army officer familiar
with the Balkans. ``In Bosnia, we figured one of our
vulnerabilities was a hostage snatch or an ambush.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said their capture raised questions. He said the United
States had been on ``full notice'' that the Serbs ``would like to
seize'' a NATO serviceman. ``And that's precisely what happened,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon declined to say whether lax procedures might have been a
factor, but said an investigation was underway. ``I don't think
I'll second-guess what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said a possibility was that the Americans inadvertently crossed the
border while fleeing an ambush by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that among the many unknown factors was
whether they were captured by Yugoslav troops or border police or
by some of the many local Macedonian Serb villagers who are armed
and openly sympathize with the Yugoslav Serbs. Scores of troops and
several helicopters, Bacon said, were dispatched in a ``massive''
search for the three in poor weather, without result. The Americans
armored vehicle _ a Humvee _ remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that three Humvees had been on patrol, then split up
``to do some individual training exercises'' that he did not
otherwise describe. They had been working near a border observation
post inside Macedonia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would hold the Yugoslav authorities responsible
for their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen their pictures,'' he said. ``We don't like it.
We don't like the way they're treated. And we have a long memory
about these kinds of things.''

MORTGAGE COSTS COULD AMBUSH THE U.S. ECONOMY

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Gradante and his wife, Lee, were on the verge of
refinancing their co-op on Sutton Place in Manhattan late last
year, but a big remodeling project so consumed them that they
failed to get around to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just let the thing slide, and before I knew it, interest
rates started to run up,'' said Gradante, a 52-year-old consultant
to hedge funds. ``I didn't pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Gradantes have shelved their refinancing, one of many
early casualties of a bounce in interest rates this year.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the couple could lock in a 7 percent rate for 30
years on their superjumbo $700,000 mortgage. Today, they would have
to pay 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are sticking with their current loan, which
carries a fixed 7 percent rate for seven years but can then adjust
annually for 23 years. If they refinanced at 7.25 percent now, they
would have to pay an extra $146 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1998, mortgage rates have been crawling upward _
now an average of about half a percentage point higher nationally.
The first effect has been a decline in home refinancings, which has
put extra dollars in the pockets of consumers and helped fuel a
torrid consumer spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   But if mortgage rates continue to rise from their current levels
_ still quite low in historical terms _ sales of homes will drop
off as well, as fewer people can make the monthly payments.
Furthermore, a significant increase in interest rates would weigh
on stocks and could provide some drag on the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the second week of March, the average commitment rate on
30-year mortgages had climbed to its highest point in nine months _
7.11 percent plus 1 percent of the sales price for loans up to
$227,150 _ according to Freddie Mac, the government-chartered
company that buys loans from lenders and packages them as
securities for investors. Bigger loans, like the Gradantes'
mortgage, tend to run about a quarter point higher.
</P>
<P>
   Rates have since receded a bit, to 6.98 percent this week, but
the possibility of a resurgence hangs over not just the real estate
market but the stock market and the booming American economy.
Friday's report on job creation in March could prove crucial
because each sign of robust economic growth revives fears of
inflation and the possibility of higher interest rates in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   If interest rates were to jump significantly, by perhaps a
percentage point, ``it would be a disaster, the worst thing that
could happen,'' said Robert J. Froehlich, vice chairman and stock
strategist at Kemper Funds in Chicago. ``You could see the stock
market easily give back 15 to 20 percent of its value.'' He remains
optimistic, however, that rates will remain largely in check.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates make the bond market a relatively more
appealing place for investors to put their money than does the
stock market. Higher rates also raise companies' costs both in
conducting everyday business and in investing in operations,
putting pressure on corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbling stock prices could in turn chill consumers who have
been driving an economy that grew at a blistering 6 percent pace in
the final three months of 1998 and shows only modest signs of a
long-anticipated slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a significant extent, the highflying stock market is
responsible for the consumer spending spree and the lowest savings
rate since 1933,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo
&AMP; Co. in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Sung noted that 48 percent of families now have some kind of
stake in the stock market, compared with 32 percent a decade ago _
a fact ``amplifying the impact of the sizzling stock market'' on
household spending.
</P>
<P>
   While higher rates would certainly take some of the steam out of
the housing market and, therefore, the economy, said William C.
Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman, Sachs, much would depend
on what caused the rise.
</P>
<P>
   It they rose because of a global economic recovery, corporate
profits would also benefit, and the net effect might be a wash, he
said. On the other hand, if rates rose because of intensified
upward pressure on American wages, that would imply a return to
inflation and would be more problematic, he said.

</P>
<P>
   Although rates on long-term Treasury bonds plunged as low as 4.7
percent last October as foreign turmoil prompted many investors to
scurry for safety, average mortgage rates did not fall as sharply,
bottoming at about 6.5 percent. Similarly, this year's upturn in
Treasury rates has had a more modest impact on mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rates on many other forms of consumer borrowing, including
automobile and education loans, have been virtually unaffected so
far but would be swept upward by a sharp rise in interest rates.
Credit card rates tend to be less sensitive to rate fluctuations
because administrative costs account for the bulk of their
relatively high rates.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage rate increase of late, though, is starting to bite.
Applications to refinance home loans fell 11.7 percent the week
ended March 26, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America
reported on Wednesday, and stood 22.2 percent below the level four
weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refi business has definitely slowed up,'' said Melissa
Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Co., a leading broker in
the New York City area, even as the rise pushes fence-sitters into
action for fear rates could move out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancings accounted for just more than half all new mortgages
in 1998 and are projected to slip to 40 percent of the total this
year, according to Paul S. Reid, executive vice president of the
Mortgage Bankers Association. Total lending is expected to decline
18 percent to a still-robust $1.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers are also shifting to adjustable-rate mortgages, which
means lower payments for now. The rates on one-year adjustable
mortgages are running about 1.2 percentage points lower than the
rates on a fixed 30-year loan, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
At the latest tabulation, the number of applications for adjustable
mortgages was 54.5 percent more than it was a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many financial analysts are far from convinced that rates
are headed much higher.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management, sees no reason to believe that current economic growth
must lead to inflation. Actually, low inflation is fueling economic
growth, he said. ``And what inflation indicator has moved up to
make you think that we should have a 6 percent interest rate?'' he
asked. The 30-year bond now yields about 5.7 percent; the
Treasury's 10-year note that is the main benchmark for pricing
mortgages, yields 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tightest labor market since the 1970s, inflation has
remained tame. Consumer prices have risen just 1.6 percent the last
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   And most people think it would take some pickup in inflation to

no action at its meeting on Tuesday, not even announcing a tilt
toward higher rates in the future.

of Home Builders, said that even if rates rose further, his
industry and its suppliers were likely to be spared a direct hit.

<P>
   ``If people decide they don't want to lock into the higher
yield, they'll go for adjustable-rate mortgages,'' he said. ``It
would soften the blow.'' &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has teamed up with a Republican
colleague, Charles Grassley of Iowa, to address a nagging affront
to open government _ the bar against televising federal court
proceedings. Their newly proposed ``sunshine in the courtroom''
bill would give federal trial and appellate judges discretion to
allow unobtrusive cameras to cover proceedings in their courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Present law prohibits televising federal criminal proceedings,
and few federal appellate or trial courts have taken advantage of
local rules giving judges flexibility to allow cameras into civil
proceedings. Yet Americans have a strong interest in seeing the
machinery of justice at work. Moreover, the favorable experience of
states that allow cameras and the successful pilot program run in
federal courts several years ago suggest that with sensible
safeguards and firm oversight by a judge, broadcast coverage can
enhance justice and educate the public about significant legal
issues without sacrificing fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts can only gain in dignity and respect if the
cloak of secrecy is lifted,'' Schumer says. That message deserves
prompt attention in Congress. It also deserves attention closer to
home. At the moment, New York is one of only three states to deny
any televised access to its courts.

ARNOLD P. COHEN: COMPANY KILLER OR RETAIL GURU? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As 1997 began, J. Peterman, &UR;  &LR; the catalog retailer known for its
quirky merchandise, seemed poised for big things. For starters, in
an astonishing public-relations windfall, the super-sitcom
``Seinfeld'' was featuring even more episodes in which the
character Elaine worked for the company. Peterman had also just won
the rights to sell reproductions of the clothes and jewelry worn in
the movie ``Titanic,'' soon to be a monster hit.
</P>
<P>
   To bring it all together, the company hired a new president and
chief operating officer who seemed the perfect complement to the
creative but not especially business-minded co-founder, John
Peterman. When the effusive new executive, Arnold P. Cohen,
arrived, he spoke of a golden future, predicting that sales would
rise 50 percent by the following year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, who headed the charge to expand beyond catalogs into
stores, was not quite able to deliver. In January, J. Peterman
declared bankruptcy, and early last month its few remaining assets,
mainly its name and the lease on an enormous store in Grand Central
Terminal, were sold to Paul Harris Stores Inc. for $10 million. The
company lists $14 million in debt in its last court filing, but
that is unlikely ever to be collected.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first of Cohen's ventures to run into trouble in
recent years. In less than a decade, he has played a leading role
at three well-known clothing firms _ London Fog, Today's Man and J.
Peterman _ as each has descended into serious financial trouble or
gone bankrupt. As J. Peterman's co-founder, Don Staley, sees it,
Arnold Cohen is nothing less than ``a serial killer of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailing is a tough business, and Cohen can certainly not be
blamed for all these companies' ills. In fact, from Cohen's
perspective, he is mostly guilty of signing on to run firms that
were in much worse condition than he first thought. Asked recently
to look back at his career, Cohen says simply, ``I wish in
hindsight that I hadn't selected some of the companies I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his story may offer a cautionary tale in an era enamored
of executive visionaries. Cohen is a charismatic salesman who works
at a frantic pace _ traits that have repeatedly made him attractive
to companies looking for management talent. But in each of these
cases, Cohen has persuaded his superiors, and apparently himself as
well, that daring initiatives to expand or reorganize would lead
inexorably to success. Each time he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After learning his trade at Gucci America and Bloomingdale's,
Cohen, 42, came to prominence in the late 1980s as president of J.
Crew Group Inc. In his five years at the company, he helped to
refine its trademark all-American style and more than doubled its
sales. These achievements quickly established Cohen as a first-rate
executive _ a rare commodity in an industry notoriously short of
talent at the top.
</P>
<P>
   And his reputation has stayed with him, even as he has moved
from disaster to disaster. As late as last year, one colleague
said, he bragged that he was one of the two greatest merchandisers
in the country. Cohen does not deny making the remark. ``It is one
of my great strengths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even at J. Crew, all was not idyllic under Cohen. In 1992,
he left without having another job lined up. Cohen says he left
because he had ``more than achieved my personal goals'' and it was
time to move on. Cohen says he was also looking for a business
where he could have a significant equity stake, something J. Crew
founder Arthur Cinader did not give him.
</P>
<P>
   Cinader was not available for comment, but a former associate
says that Cohen made mistakes during the catalog company's rapid
expansion into store-based retailing. For example, Cohen signed
long and expensive leases for outlets that the associate says were
too big to display merchandise effectively. To this day, the source
says, several J. Crew stores have to wall off and leave unused
large sections of floor space.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, however, disputes that point. ``I am proud of my rollout
of the J. Crew stores, they served the brand well,'' he says. ``I
am not aware of any stores that opened during my tenure that did
not do well. There is only one store that I know of when I left
that we felt was too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was only when Cohen had the opportunity to run a
business unchecked by a powerful overseer like Cinader that he ran
into serious trouble. Cohen took the helm of London Fog Co. in
September 1993, at a time when the company, a venerable
Maryland-based raincoat maker, was facing a slow decline. Cohen,
hired to give the staid brand a jolt, promised a turnaround,
including a doubling of sales to $700 million from $350 million
within three years. He set about cutting costs by, among other
things, closing five American factories.
</P>
<P>
   While that move was necessary, former colleagues say, Cohen
moved too quickly, causing quality and delivery glitches. Cohen
would not comment on the record about the transformation, but even
his allies said it was not well paced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnie has great ideas,'' said Chris Fiore, who worked under
him at London Fog. ``He needs to learn patience. Organizations just
cannot absorb all the initiatives that he wants to accomplish on
his schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cohen began another unusual policy, a notable
instance, former colleagues say, of his assertiveness. He forbade
stores to mark down the brand's merchandise until Dec. 8 of that
year, saying his aim was to reestablish London Fog's elite image.
But the move infuriated retailers, who traditionally do their best
raincoat business during promotions around Thanksgiving. William
Crain, who was part of the team that came in to resuscitate the
company from near-death a year later, said the policy ``clearly
alienated the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the unintended and costly consequence,'' he added, ``of
shifting orders to the company's lower-priced, lower-margin brand,
Towne.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen disagrees. ``The campaign was strategically
appropriate, it won critical acclaim.'' He adds in his defense,
``Many of the strategies we applied to rebuilding the brand are
still in force today.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grayson, a retail veteran on the board of London Fog as well
as a personal friend of Cohen's from Westport, Conn., argues that
the company was in worse shape when Cohen took over than anybody
knew. ``Critical financial information was not made available to
the new management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen took some of the blame. Eleven months later, with
London Fog hemorrhaging cash and its debt swollen to $425 million,
Cohen was out of the company. He quickly rebounded, though not to
the same heights. He was hired in the spring of 1994 by Today's Man
Inc. as executive vice president for merchandising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to his abilities as a salesman, he not only
negotiated a mid-six-figure compensation package but persuaded
David Feld, the chairman and founder, to buy his Westport home out
of his own pocket for several million dollars so Cohen could afford
to move to the Philadelphia area to be near the company's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen arrived, Today's Man was booming. Less than two years
later, in February 1996, it filed for bankruptcy. Certainly, there
were forces at work well beyond Cohen's control, including a poor
retail season in 1995 and an overexpansion that was started before
Cohen's tenure. Still, executives at the company say he was a key
mover behind decisions that resulted in inflated advertising
budgets and ballooning inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Johnson, the chief financial officer at Today's Man then
and now, characterized Cohen's tenure gingerly: ``Certainly he was
a member of the management group during the period of time that the
company went through a serious financial crisis. He made decisions,
but those did not occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gross, who was president of Today's Man when Cohen was
there, is still a big fan. He said, ``Arnie has a tremendous feel
for merchandise.'' But he admits his subordinate took a lot of
careful watching. ``He can be overly aggressive, push too far to
the edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cohen says that he was in ``no way responsible''
for what happened at Today's Man and that the heavy advertising and
promotions he engaged in ``were the kind of actions people take
when they need to raise sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was out again by spring 1996. By this time he had
apparently decided it might be wiser to be his own boss. He started
shopping around for a company and made a bid for a job at J.
Peterman. Peterman turned him down at first, but after a year of
negotiations hired him to be president and chief operating officer.
The company's sales, which had been rising steadily, were $65
million in 1997, but the poorly run firm had almost never made a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen envisioned raising sales to $90 million by the end of 1998
by expanding into as many as 70 retail outlets. To reach this
explosive goal he spent lavishly, especially for a company as small
as J. Peterman. He hired a slew of expensive executives, paying
generous six-figure salaries in addition to pricey fees to
headhunters. He himself earned $500,000 a year in salary plus $1
million in stock options (which are now worthless).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former colleagues say, Cohen insisted on opening a
Hollywood office for J. Peterman, paid for large groups to go on
far-flung trips and started two brand new catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when Staley, who co-founded the company and was on its
board, suggested running an ad during ``Seinfeld'' simply to inform
viewers that there was a real J. Peterman, Cohen instead suggested
in all seriousness having his lawyers contact NBC and demand that
the show flash J. Peterman's toll-free number every time the
company's name was used on the air, Staley recalls. It was
laughable, he says. (Cohen says he made that suggestion as part of
a brainstorming session and that he never tried to act on it.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to cut costs, Cohen began using cheaper materials for
the clothing line. As soon as customers received the new items,
they began complaining about low quality. Catalog sales started to
plummet. Cohen says J. Peterman was a victim of an industry-wide
slump in sales. Still, the loses were real and the lenders began to
panic. Both Cohen and Peterman say the business was destroyed by
lack of credit at this key juncture. But even Cohen's booster, Bob
Grayson of London Fog, admits there were errors in judgment.
``Should we have seen this coming over our shoulder?'' he asked.
``Yes. Should we have been expanding so aggressively? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnie,'' he added, ``is not a crisis manager.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, Peterman confessed to Staley that Cohen had
run through $16 million and the company was in dire straits. Soon
after, the firm declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen now works as a retail consultant. He says he has clients,
but declined to list any. He admits that he is ``disappointed''
with how J. Peterman turned out. ``But,'' he added, with
characteristic optimism, ``I think it was a learning opportunity.''

   CBS TO BUY KING WORLD FOR $2.5 BILLION IN STOCK
</P>
<P>
   As expected, CBS announced that it had agreed to buy King World
Productions, the syndicator of television hits like ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show,'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy,'' for $2.5
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has long been looking to extend its control over programming
for its owned-and-operated stations. King World not only has $800
million in cash on its balance sheet, but it requires little
capital expenditure and carries no debt, so it will contribute
immediately to the bottom line of CBS.

 &HT;    Doctor was pill pusher, federal agents say
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Coral Springs physician was arrested
Thursday by federal agents after a four-year investigation into
alleged fraud and illegal dispensation of prescription drugs _
drugs, officials say, used in the overdose deaths of as many as 20
people, including a Boca Raton man.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Mazzella, 61, was charged with eight felony counts
and was being held Thursday at the Federal Detention Center in
Miami, said a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Mazzella's in-house pharmacy ranked first or
second among the nation's ordering pharmacies for several drugs,
including the depressants seconal, tuinal and hydrocodone. Her
office's pharmacy served only Mazzella's patients _ a ``highly
unusual'' and profitable situation _ according to an affidavit
filed Thursday by the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents seized records Thursday from Mazzella's office as
part of an investigation led by the Drug Enforcement Administration
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzella _ whom state regulators have cited at least three times
since 1993 _ is charged with mail fraud, health care fraud and
making false statements to private health insurers and the federal
Medicare program, the affidavit said. She also is charged with
conspiring to illegally dispense controlled substances _
prescription narcotics, barbiturates and stimulants _ and illegally
dispensing the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Mazzella prescribed addictive drugs to patients
who came to her with real or fabricated medical complaints. Some
patients reported becoming addicted and up to 20 died of overdoses,
federal prosecutors said. While many deaths were ruled suicides,
several were deemed accidental, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reported Mazzella was billing private insurers and
Medicare for injections, X-rays and office visits that hadn't
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mazzella faces up to $4 million in fines and life
in prison, prosecutors said. Her office could not be reached for
comment late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzella received her bachelor's degree from Fairleigh Dickinson
University in New Jersey in 1964 and received her medical degree
from the University of Rome in Italy in 1969, according to state
records. She also has a registered nurse degree, records show.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1974, according to records she gave the state, she
served a residency in internal medicine in Englewood, N.J. Florida
granted her a license to practice medicine in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993, state regulators filed an administrative
complaint against Mazzella, accusing her of ``gross malpractice.''
Two years later, Florida's Board of Medicine reprimanded Mazzella
for not giving adequate care to patients who died, but did not fine
her, according to state records.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 27, 1996, the board fined Mazzella $3,500, reprimanded
her and ordered her license suspended for six months, according to
state records. But Mazzella's license was not suspended because the
board allowed her to fulfill a one-year probation term instead,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was during her probation that Richard Bransdorf, 36, of Boca
Raton, went to see Mazzella for treatment of depression, according
to his father, Marvin. Bransdorf had been married for seven years,
had a 5-year-old son and managed his father's Madison Avenue Shoes
store in Mizner Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzella's office billed Bransdorf's insurance company for 12
visits from July 1995 to March 1996, the family said. At each
visit, he was given multiple prescriptions for the pain relievers
Percocet and Lorcet, the anti-anxiety drugs Xanax and Valium and
cough suppressant Tussionex, according to the affidavit. On his
last visit on March 22, 1996, he was given Tussionex, 90 Valium
pills, 30 Xanax pills and 90 Lorcet pills. Both Lorcet and
Tussionex can be addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Bransdorf died the next day of an overdose of the combined
drugs, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner. His
death was ruled an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bransdorf's father said the family hadn't had enough evidence to
sue Mazzella over the death of his son, one of four boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wasn't on drugs, he was everybody's best friend,'' he
said. ``He was the life of the party.''

<P>
   EAST LOS ANGELES -- Yellow ribbons and American flags flew in
the East Los Angeles home of captured Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, a
soldier who represents the best of the neighborhood, family and
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just a good American boy. He went in for his country,
and he is very patriotic,'' said Frank Jasso, great uncle of
Ramirez, one of three Americans captured Wednesday near the
Macedonian-Yugoslavian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what he was sent in to do. I think we're doing the
right thing. They're going in to protect the people in Kosovo. Why
should people take it upon themselves to go in and kill women and
children? War is for men against men, not against women and
children,'' Jasso said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood friend of the 24-year-old soldier said he was
shocked to see how Ramirez looked on the Serbian television
broadcast of the three captured servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked scared that he was going to die, that they're going
to hurt him,'' said John Hernandez, who lives two houses down from
the Ramirez home. ``The way he looks on his face, he looks really
scared. We just wish that we could hear that he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet other friends and neighbors said they believe Ramirez, a
wiry high school wrestler raised in a tough neighborhood, has
enough discipline and smarts to make it through this ordeal alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew is serving his country. That is his desire, to always
serve his country,'' said a cousin, Leo Rodriguez, holding back
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what he wanted to do _ and he's a tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Army officials came by the Ramirez home 10 p.m. Wednesday to
notify the family that he had been captured.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's brother, Steven, an Army veteran and Los Angeles
police detective, was in seclusion Thursday with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he said: ``I am extremely appreciative of the
concern from everyone, and will be spending time with my family to
deal with this difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Dave Kalish said he had spoken with the detective
and offered him and his family the support of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a very difficult time for him and his
family. He told me that he loves his little brother very much, and
is very worried,'' Kalish said. ``But he told me that this brother
is a brave soldier and he's confident that he'll be strong through
this entire ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was particularly appreciative of Mayor (Richard) Riordan,
who personally called him this morning, expressing concern and
support of all Angelenos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's neighbors and friends gathered at his childhood home
on Eastmont Avenue to offer comfort to family members and recall
him as a friendly man who liked to work on his cars and play with
his dog, Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just rocked us,'' said Armando Camarena, his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours ago, I found out there were POWs. Less than
12 hours ago, I found out it was my nephew. I was viewing it from
the outside. Now we are riding in the center of a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   A second cousin, Olivia Rodriguez, a receptionist at the family
parish St. Alphonsus, prayed for Ramirez's safe return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear people say that you don't think that it's
going to ever touch your family, but it does. Who in the world
would have thought?'' Rodriguez asked.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends alike spent Thursday watching newscasts and
waiting for any word of his condition. They were stunned to see him
displayed on television by the Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is shocked. We can't believe it. They said they were
going to be tried tomorrow, for what? I hope they just go over
there and get them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From age 16, Ramirez couldn't wait to graduate high school so he
could enter the Army and serve his country, he told his family.
</P>
<P>
   Arlina Montez, a secretary at Schurr High School, remembered
Ramirez as a good student with a quick smile and a love of cars.
``He would always ask if I wanted him to fix my car,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He took gifted and talented classes his sophomore year. ``He
made the honor roll junior year,'' she said. ``I guess he cared
about our country. He took a lot of history and American
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduating Schurr High in 1992, Ramirez enlisted for what
would be the first of two tours.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez served in Bosnia, an experience that cousin Virginia
Hernandez said was frightening for him. ``He saw bodies and
carcasses in Bosnia and it was devastating to him, yet he liked
helping people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After his first tour of duty, Ramirez re-enlisted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he had the opportunity to leave the military but
he just loved it and talked about it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   On leave in December, he returned as he always did to the
close-knit neighborhood of modest homes. He told Virginia Hernandez
how he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his brother Steve, 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling me how thrilled he was with the Army, and he
wanted to become a police officer like his brother,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez' parents are divorced. His father is a computer
programmer, and his mother works at Kmart in Montebello and as a
teacher's assistant at Eastmont Intermediate School.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Wilkinson, store manager where Ramirez's mother worked for
about 10 years, said he remembers the two boys. ``They are are
all-American boys _ real clean cut, real polite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's mother knew the dangers of having a child in the
military, he said, adding, ``She was concerned but real proud of
her boys.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of Ramirez, Mike Lara, 46, said Ramirez used to take
care of his mother's dogs when she was ill years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what they'll do to him? NATO wants these POWs to be
released. How can they expect that to happen when we're over there
bombing their country? They're going to use that as revenge,'' Lara
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel torn both ways. I know we're there and it's right but
when it strikes home, it makes you wonder why we're there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Ramirez household, sisters Henrietta
Ozuna and Amparo Lopez could only think of Ramirez as a young boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy. This morning I saw the pictures on
TV. I thought, Oh my God. It's little Andy,'' Ozuna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very serious but friendly and hard-working. It's very
devastating. We started crying. We're just praying that everything
goes right,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends brought baskets of flowers with Easter
lilies and roses to the doorstep of the home.

ON THE JOB: LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 4) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The workplace can be pretty grim. But there is an antidote:
humor. Applied in the right doses, it can transform a job into a
joy.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a rabbi in the Philadelphia suburbs, Robert Alper
faced a problem. An emotional issue was coming up for a vote, and
the synagogue's trustees were divided. How could he calm the
passions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was teaching a course in Judaism at a nearby Catholic
college,'' writes Alper, now a rabbi in East Dorset, Vt., where he
also practices stand-up comedy. ``The dean of our department was
friendly and curious about the workings of a synagogue, so I
invited her to see us `up close and personal' at a meeting of our
leadership. She attended on that perilous night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In full nun's habit. It was the most polite meeting in our
congregation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Brostek of New York City, director of special events at
Queens College, used to work for Continental Can Co., organizing
management meetings. At one meeting, he noticed that 10 of the 300
attendees were named Robert. ``Suspending diversity guidelines, I
put them all at the same dinner table,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver, he said, resulted in instant camaraderie that
``spread through the room and lasted for the three-day meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every jest is taken as intended. Charles
Kazanjian of New York City was entering data for the Census Bureau
in 1990 when a supervisor asked what was done when the information
was incomplete. Hoping for a laugh, Kazanjian said, ``We make it
up.'' End of data-entry tasks. Beginning of filing duties.
</P>
<P>
   A syllabus from Luke Barber, a professor of philosophy at
Richland College in Dallas, says, ``I am very committed to laughter
and play.'' And, he writes, so is his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call our annual convocation of faculty, administrators and
support personnel the feast of fools. We discuss serious goals;
however, we do so by also lampooning our most sacred objectives.
One year, the college president arrived on stage by swinging in
like Tarzan on a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video lampoons have included a poke at our efforts to make
registration easier for students. `Drive-Through Registration'
showed students ordering, `I'll have one English (hold the poetry),
a philosophy and two histories.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, co-author of ``Work Like Your Dog: 50 Ways to Work Less,
Play More and Earn More'' (Random House Villard, 1999), said: ``We
spend more of our time thinking about working, driving to and from
work and working than any other waking activity. If we can't have
fun at work, then when are we going to have fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, PHH Vehicle Management Services of Hunt Valley, Md.,
holds seminars for clients _ ``your basic snooze-a-rama,'' says
Dick George, a marketer for the company. To add spice to a recent
meeting, George impersonated the television detective Columbo. It
was such a hit he decided to do an encore.
</P>
<P>
   So a month later, he found himself in a rumpled trench coat,
pacing outside a meeting room, cigar in hand. Inside, he said, a
senior vice president was ``explaining the glories of our new
product to 100 of our biggest clients and all our senior brass.''
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed moment, he barged in, muttering: ``Oh, excuse
me, just a minute, if I could. I'm sorry to interrupt. I really am.
I just feel terrible. But I was trying to get out of my parking
space, and somebody's got me blocked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he glanced around the room. ``Evidently my impression more
closely resembled your basic psychopathic killer,'' he said. ``Some
people appeared to be looking for the emergency exits. One client
sitting nearby _ an ex-Marine _ told me later he was thinking of
`taking me out.' I don't think he meant a date.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the tension ebbed, and Columbo asked, ``Does anybody here
have a red Ford Taurus?'' He squinted at a paper and turned it 180
degrees. ``A blue Chevy Blazer, license number OM 1367 D?'' There
were titters. He headed for the door as the vice president
continued his talk, saying a new Internet tool called PHH
Interactive could search fleet data by vehicle identification
number, by driver or by license number.
</P>
<P>
   ``By license number?'' Columbo said, coming back into the room.
``Would you check OM 1367 D?''
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president demonstrated the product, Columbo
jumped up and summarized what he had heard. The vice president
responded, ``That's right, Lieutenant, and it can do all those
things in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real time?'' Columbo asked. ``I'm confused. What other kind of
time is there?'' The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little humor,'' George writes, ``made it a lot easier to
absorb a message that was important to our company.''

COMPTON PROUD OF WILLIAMS SISTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMPTON _ A cultural landmark sits near the corner of Compton
and Atlantic Boulevards. Dreams were built here, from the ground
up. And yet this is not a registered treasure like the Watts Towers
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find no sign anywhere explaining its significance. You
probably would have driven right past it had a local historian not
kindly directed you to the spot where the tennis careers of Venus
and Serena Williams were born.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses on the 15100 block of S. Atlantic Blvd. turn over
like numbers on an odometer. Amid the constant change what remains
are plenty of people who remember watching the Williams sisters
chase down tennis balls on the two city-owned courts at East Rancho
Dominguez Park in the late 1980s. That was long before they became
the most successful African-American sister act that L.A. has had a
hand in raising since basketball players Pam and Paula McGee at
USC.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, the girls' father, had a vision. He was not
unlike Simon Rodia, the Italian immigrant of modest means and no
architectural training who took that which was at his fingertips _
tiles and glass and rocks and the like _ and working intuitively,
created 100-foot towers of breathtaking beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Rodia needed 33 years to build his legacy; Williams has been at
it less than 20 and already it appears his life's work is just
about complete; 18-year-old Venus, who defeated her younger sister
in the final of a tournament in Miami last weekend, has risen to
No.6 in the world. Seventeen-year-old Serena is No.11 with a
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, bullets. They are, like the shells imbedded in Rodia's
sculpture, part of the mosaic Williams has created. He speaks often
of how the sisters once dodged gang gunfire on the courts, diving
for cover right on the very spot where you're now standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses lived a few blocks from these courts for eight
years, moving to Florida in 1991. It was the memory of these mean
streets that pulled Richard Williams out of his seat Sunday in the
middle of the Lipton Championships final between his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He left the stadium to keep from crying. As he later told
reporters, he grew teary-eyed contemplating how far Venus and
Serena had come from the cracked concrete courts and gang-infested
neighborhoods of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the treacherous terrain that Richard Williams
remembers seems rather sleepy save for staccato sounds coming from
behind the courts, where an outdoor basketball court once stood
that drew both players and provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is gone, like the Williamses. Going up in its place is a
gym that is scheduled to be completed by the end of the summer, one
of many projects borne of the community's resolve to fill kids'
idle time.
</P>
<P>
   Things are definitely getting better here, says 18-year-old
Ernando Solis, who has grown up in the neighborhood. ``When I first
moved here, it was really bad,'' he says. ``But not anymore. It's
changed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Solis lived two blocks from East Rancho Dominguez
Park. He used the tennis courts to tell time by. He'd walk past
them every weekday morning; if the Williams sisters were out there
hitting balls, he could be pretty certain it wasn't yet 8 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand exactly why they were doing that every
day,'' Solis tells you. ``You'd see them all the time working hard.
Now I see them sometimes on TV. It kind of inspires me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one you talk to here begrudges the Williams sisters their
success. There is no Venus envy that you can see, just palpable
pride that two kids who once were part of the community are forcing
people to re-think some tired old stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   What does bother some of his old neighbors is that Richard
Williams continues to get mileage out of some of these same
stereotypes, at their expense. Where does he get off, these
longtime residents wonder, emerging from the family's gated
compound in posh Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., to talk about the
bullet-riddled streets and the gang-filled neighborhoods and the
unkempt courts of Compton as though it were just yesterday that he
fled the city?
</P>
<P>
   Cities, like tennis players, can improve dramatically in a few
years' time. If the old neighborhood's progress hasn't kept pace
with that of the Williams sisters, well, it's not for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people get a biscuit above starvation and they
forget,'' Anquanetta Walker says with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   She is speaking from the senior community center across the
street from East Rancho Dominguez Park. She remembers Richard
Williams, from the tennis courts. She says a man so devoted to his
daughters isn't easily forgotten in a day and age when too many
girls grow up never knowing their daddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you hear about are gangs and fighting and shooting,''
Walker says. ``So you think of Compton, you think of the ghetto.
But overall, you've got a lot of good people here. You look at what
the Williamses have done, coming from here. It says to me there's a
lot of good in Compton, a lot of talent sitting here waiting to be
drawn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Williams shouldn't knock the city now that he's got
his millions of dollars. He got it because he invested his time in
his daughters. Instead of telling people how bad it is here, I wish
he'd come back, talk to all the absent fathers and be a mentor to
some other man's daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams donates equipment and a large chunk of change to the
longstanding after-school program at the Rancho La Cienega Sports
Center in South Central L.A. But you get the feeling some of his
old neighbors aren't impressed. They'd rather see him give more of
his precious time, like Juan Sayles is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles is on the court next to you, hitting tennis balls with
his 14-year-old niece Keisha. He taught Keisha how to play tennis
when she was 6. Now he says people will stop him at the gas station
or in the liquor store and ask, ``Did you see the girls from
Compton on TV?'' in a way that lets him know they hope his niece is
next.
</P>
<P>
   The next ghetto Cinderella, if you believe Richard Williams. &QL;

ADVERTISING: AGENCIES USING WIDE RANGE OF FORMULAS TO SET
PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 15 percent commission on media spending that
clients pay advertising agencies as their fee was once standard in
the advertising business. Now it is about as dead as the
three-martini lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is turning away from billings-based
commissions in large numbers, and many now routinely look at a wide
range of new formulas that can be custom &UR;  &LR; tailored for a client's
needs. The new methods of agency payments may include anything from
straight hourly fees for labor to performance incentive fees to
fixed retainers, or a variety of combinations .
</P>
<P>
   Driving the changes are two key factors: belt-tightening clients
who began cutting commissions more than a decade ago, and vast
changes in how ad agencies reach consumers that go way beyond
network TV advertising. The commission formula tends to encourage
costly media buys and has been criticized for overlooking important
emerging mediums such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Together it amounts to a sea change in how agencies are paid,
which is underscored by the fact that giants like Young &AMP; Rubicam
and DDB Needham Worldwide, a unit of Omnicom Group, now oppose the
structure that once made Madison Avenue very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top two advertisers, the General Motors &UR;  &LR; Corp &UR; . &LR; 
and , are both moving away from billings-based compensation plans.
GM spent $3.09 billion in advertising and promotion in 1997, and
P&AMP;G spent $2.74 billion, according to Advertising Age, the industry
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble now pays media commissions but will soon change
that. In July, the company will institute a series of tests around
the globe that will determine how ``to link financial rewards of
our agencies to increased sales revenue'' at P&AMP;G, said Gretchen
Briscoe, a P&AMP;G spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional commission does not reward increased sales or
development of holistic marketing plans,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``We
want a system that's media neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has been using a variety of compensation programs over the
last decade, ranging from traditional commissions to straight fees
to performance incentives. The auto giant is now working toward ``a
performance-based fee compensation'' system with agencies ``where
we don't already have one,'' said Philip Guarascio, GM's vice
president for advertising and corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   One key advantage to performance fees is that they encourage
agencies to think about how to promote as broadly as possible,
utilizing every marketing resource available from web site design
to Internet marketing, Guarascio said. It also requires the
discipline to set and later evaluate very specific goals that keep
both the agency and the client on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about doing the work, it's about how well the
work is done _ that's what accountability is about,'' Guarascio
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 35 percent of advertisers paid their agencies
based on media commissions, down from 61 percent three years
earlier, according to a study by the Association of National
Advertisers Inc., a New York-based trade group. Meantime, the study
showed just 9 percent of respondents paid agencies 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though that would seemingly be bad news for ad agencies,
especially the giants that routinely handle accounts that spend $50
million in media and more (translation: $7.5 million in
commissions), DDB Needham says the opposite is the case: the
changes are not happening fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Reinhard, DDB Needham's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the old system undervalues an agency by paying a flat
rate that is not based on merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous because it doesn't talk about quality,''
Reinhard said. ``If we're going to be brand architects and
strategists, we have to figure out a way to get paid for our
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission system was developed in the last century as a way
to attract agents to place ads in newspapers, said Robert Lundin of
Jones-Lundin, the Chicago-based consultancy that conducted the
trade group study.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent figure was ``picked out of a hat'' and never well
loved among clients, Lundin said. But it was not until the
mid-1980s that cost-conscious clients began reducing commissions en
masse, creating something of a panic in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts ``tapped into a pent-up anger clients had about paying
15 percent, whether an agency performed or not,'' said Edward H.
Vick, Young &AMP; Rubicam's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Madison Avenue fashion, agencies have since turned
clients' lemons into lemonade, by coming up with new formulas that
can earn an agency even more than a 15 percent commission, said
Lundin. Last year, DDB Needham made some $6 million in additional
compensation beyond its base fees for reaching client objectives,
Reinhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the 15 percent commission's demise has actually
benefited some small agencies because commissions on small media
budgets often do not adequately pay agencies for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of work you do for a client with a $4 million or $5
million budget is very often the same amount as the client with the
$10 million or $15 million budget,'' said Adam Stagliano, president
of Weiss Stagliano Inc., a New York shop with about $100 million in
billings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means more than a 15 percent commission.
Ciociola &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co., a $50 million shop also in the city, often takes a
guaranteed fee with a provision to take the greater of either fees
or media commission, Mel Ciociola, the agency's chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Flexibility is the watchword,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While labor-based compensation agreements now outpace
billings-based payments, according to the trade group study, more
than 30 percent of advertisers now also include some type of
incentive compensation agreement that ties bonus money to the
agency's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam said the performance might be based on increased
sales, or on other qualitative research measures such as brand
preference or consumer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incentive compensation says that we'll take less up front and
if we're successful, we have an opportunity to make a lot more
money,'' Vick said. ``We're saying we're willing to put a large
part of our profit at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, linking advertising to sales revenue can be
risky because often problems beyond the scope of advertising cause
a brand to fail, such as the wrong price point or poor
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Lundin, whose company conducted the trade group study, said that
this problem may soon be solved because a more exact formula to
measure the success of advertising has been defined in the academic
world, and he expects it will be adopted by business in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until then, incentives tied to sales remain a risk _
though some agencies consider it worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients take those risks every day,'' Reinhardt said, ``so
why shouldn't we?''

TURKEY WITH JIMMY, THREE MNF DATES ON TAP FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Guess who's coming to dinner on Thanksgiving
Day.
</P>
<P>
   How about former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson, who will bring his
up-and-coming Miami Dolphins to Texas Stadium for the annual
holiday game.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Johnson's first visit as a coach since his bitter
breakup with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after the 1993 Super Bowl
season. Johnson visited Texas Stadium in 1995 as part of the Fox
studio team.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's much-anticipated visit will be the highlight of the
Cowboys' 1999 schedule, which was released yesterday by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game will be exciting for me personally,'' said Jones,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Jones already has the satisfaction of the Cowboys' 29-10 victory
in Miami during Johnson's first season as coach in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was hired by Jones in 1989, helped orchestrate the
franchise's return to prominence with Super Bowl titles in 1992 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I anticipate there will be ``some'' interest in our
Thanksgiving Day game,'' Johnson said yesterday. ``And for me
personally, I am looking forward to going back to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys open the season at Washington on Sept. 12. The
schedule also includes a franchise-record six nationally televised
games, which tops the previous high of five. The Cowboys will make
three appearances on ``Monday Night Football,'' including the home
opener against the Atlanta Falcons (Sept. 20) and road trips
against the New York Giants (Oct. 18) and Minnesota Vikings (Nov.
8).
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule speaks to the interest in our team and the
excitement we have for the upcoming season,'' Jones said of the
Cowboys' TV schedule, which also includes three nationally
television preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The home schedule includes games against the Dolphins, Jets,
Packers and Falcons. In addition to playing on Sunday, Monday night
and Thursday, the Cowboys have a Friday, Christmas Eve matchup
against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first six weeks of the season, the Cowboys will have
faced each of their NFC East opponents. The Cowboys swept the
division last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to go through training camp and be ready to compete
at a high level because the challenge is to get ahead of it in the
division,'' Jones said. ``We know from last year that can make a
lot of things positive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the schedule, which ranks 12th-toughest in the league
based on opponents' 1998 records, is one of the most challenging
the Cowboys have had in years. In addition to playing the AFC East,
Jones cited a stretch in October and early November when they
sandwich a home game against the Redskins (Oct. 24) between road
games against the Eagles (Oct. 10) and Giants (Oct. 18) and the
Colts (Oct. 31) and the Vikings (Nov. 8).
</P>
<P>
   The positives, Jones said, are that the Cowboys end the season
with three of their final five games at home and that they play one
potential cold-weather game, at New England on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The bye week comes early for the Cowboys, Sept. 26, after two
games. Cowboys' pursuit Jones had no update on the Cowboys' pursuit
of receiver Raghib Ismail, center Mark Stepnoski and linebacker
Quentin Coryatt. Jones said he remains confident the team will sign
all three players, but reiterated the deals are not yet finalized.
Visiting prospects Although the Cowboys have been visiting with a
number of draft prospects _ they brought in Louisiana Tech tight
end Marlon Chambers a few days ago _ they won't begin serious
business until next week. Jones said the team has scheduled visits
for some of the draft's top prospects at several positions.
Southern California inside linebacker Chris Claiborne is one of the
players scheduled to visit Valley Ranch next week.
Schedule breakdown With a first-place schedule in the NFC East, the
Cowboys might have a difficult time repeating as division
champions. Staff writer Clarence E. Hill Jr., takes a look at the
schedule: Date Opponent Comment Sept. 12 at Washington The Cowboys
are 29-9-1 on opening day Sept. 20 vs. Atlanta Chan Gailey's first
matchup against boyhood idol Dan Reeves Sept. 26 Bye Oct. 3 vs.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Three American soldiers captured along
the border with Macedonia will appear before a Yugoslav military
court that could charge and try them, the state news agency,
Tanjug, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a judicial officer in the Kosovo
capital, Pristina, said that the court investigation of the three
could begin as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government said a Yugoslav court-martial of the
Americans would violate international law.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, _ were
paraded on Serbian state television Thursday, but the main evening
broadcast led with another news event, an unexpected meeting
between the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and a prominent
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   On the broadcast, the two men, looking relaxed, signed a
document calling for a peaceful end to the Kosovo crisis through
``political means.'' Rugova was a part of the ethnic Albanian
delegation that signed a Western-drafted peace treaty rejected by
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbian forces now driving to destroy the armed Kosovo
Liberation Army and forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the
province, Rugova's seemingly uncoerced meeting led a spokesman for
the ethnic Albanian rebels, Jakub Krasniqi, to call Rugova's action
high treason. But other than the television images, which carried
Thursday's date, there was no confirmation that the men had
actually met on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, who has long advocated a nonviolent political solution
to the problem of Kosovo, appeared relaxed, chatting with an
evidently cheerful Milosevic. But it was only on Wednesday that
Serbian television announced that Rugova had sought the protection
of the Serbian police and showed a nervous Rugova asking NATO to
stop its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three captured soldiers, grim-faced and nervous,
were shown on television here throughout the day, the Serbian
evening news did not even mention them until deep in the broadcast,
and then in the context of a commentary. First, it showed Milosevic
meeting representatives of the Greek Orthodox Church. Then it
showed the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic and the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle all
meeting separately with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, sent here by
Pope John Paul II to call on all sides to observe a week-long
Easter truce that would extend from the Western observance of
Easter, April 4, through the Orthodox observance on April 11, a
suggestion the allies have already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a delegation of Russian parliamentarians was shown meeting
various officials.
</P>
<P>
   Only after all this footage did the announcer mention the
capture of the American soldiers ``on Yugoslav territory,'' as
another event ``casting doubt on the Western interpretation of
events.'' At first NATO said the soldiers were captured about three
miles inside Macedonia, though later top officers said it was
unclear exactly where they were caught.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one gloating touch when the announcer read: ``The
Western aggressors have over night forgotten the humanitarian
crisis'' that is their ostensible reason for intervention and
``have now directed all their attention to three of their soldiers
who were captured,'' the announcer said. ``This puts the American
Fuehrer in the most uncomfortable position because he is the one
who launched the theory that America would win without a single
casualty.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials were debating Thursday why Rugova might have
met with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said in Brussels
Thursday that Rugova might have been under duress. ``I don't see
that Rugova is freely doing what he is doing,'' Solana said, adding
that he would feel ``much more relaxed'' if he had been able to
speak to Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans originally backed Rugova, who was re-elected
as the leader of the ethnic Albanians last April, his credibility
was sharply diminished by the rise in support for the insurgents of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Unity among the ethnic Albanians has been fragile, and with the
Serbian military trying to destroy the KLA in the current fighting,
some Western diplomats suggested by telephone that Rugova may be
trying both to restore his position and to save what is left of
Kosovo from catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may think that half a state is better than a killing ground
and a wasteland,'' said one Western diplomat who left Belgrade
before the bombings began. He drew a possible comparison with the
Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who has sacrificed Palestinian
claims to parts of the West Bank for a Palestinian Authority likely
to become a state.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whom Rugova now represents. As thousands of
ethnic Albanians are driven out of Kosovo, some will regard him as
a traitor, quisling or worse, while others will regard him as
trying to save something from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said they were concerned that Milosevic might
conduct his own negotiations with Rugova and come up with a plan
for Kosovo's partition or political autonomy along the lines the
West has drawn _ but without the presence of NATO peacekeeping
troops that the West is insisting upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic and Rugova announce a deal that gives political
autonomy, a sharp reduction in Serb forces in Kosovo and protection
for refugees to return, it will be awkward,'' another Western
official said by telephone. ``It will look even more like NATO is
on the side of the KLA.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in another move to shore up his support in the
Yugoslav Army, fired an army commander and seven other generals
based in Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro. He replaced the
Second Army Corps commander, Gen. Radosav Martinovic, with a closer
ally, Gen. Milorad Obradovic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has a more pro-Western government and has tried to
distance itself from Serbia's conflict with NATO. Yugoslav analysts
wondered whether Martinovic might have resisted orders to crack
down on Montenegro's separatist-minded government, or if Milosevic
feared an army coup starting from Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. support for Montenegro, NATO warplanes have bombed
Yugoslav military facilities there, including the airport. The
strikes have undermined President Milo Djukanovic's opposition to
Belgrade's policies and raised concerns that Milosevic may move
against Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   In the air war early on Thursday, NATO struck targets in Kosovo
and destroyed a major bridge over the Danube River in Novi Sad,
Serbia's second city. NATO officials said that military warehouses
line one end of the bridge. Serbian officials said the city's water
supply was badly damaged. The wreckage blocked the Danube waterway,
one of the main passages for trade between Western and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Belgrade's 2 million people, it was a frazzled day, with
rumors flying at warp speed about NATO's plans for bombing
government buildings, for the first time, in the city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   As people lined up to buy an informal ration of two packs of
cigarettes _ one kiosk owner said he'd sold 1,000 packs by noon and
had none left on Thursday _ they exchanged worried talk about where
they lived in town and how close it might be to the defense
ministry or the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A man who would only identify himself as Sasha, who owns a
basement cafe downtown, said his parents were sleeping in the cafe,
and he was considering going out to the suburbs for the night. A
man named Ilija said he would go to his sister's house; others
talked of heading down to the crowded bomb shelters for the first
time in several days.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, Belgrade's deputy mayor, said in an interview
Thursday that there was little more the city could do to prepare
for new bombings. ``We just want to insure there are enough
supplies on both sides of the river in case they destroy the
bridges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 100 yards from the federal and Serbian ministries
for internal affairs is Belgrade's largest hospital complex, the
Clinical Center of Serbia, attached to the university. It contains
4,000 of Belgrade's 5,000 hospital beds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bozic said, there had been ``10 or 11'' civilian deaths
from the bombing in and around Belgrade and 47 people kept at least
one night in the hospital for their wounds. Military casualties are
classified information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Serb said Thursday that he had read on the Internet a New
York Times report that NATO would spare the Presidential Palace
because it had a Rembrandt on the first floor. ``It's good news and
bad news,'' the Serb said he told a friend. ``The good news is
Milosevic's palace will be spared because it has a Rembrandt. The
bad news is that you, unfortunately, do not have a Rembrandt.''

WETTELAND, PALMEIRO PASS FINAL SPRING TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Two performances yesterday eased the
Rangers' greatest fears this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland appeared dominant during a 1-2-3 first
inning, and first baseman Rafael Palmeiro delivered a game-winning
home run in the bottom of the eighth inning in the Rangers' 6-4
victory against Cincinnati at Charlotte County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent positive vibes throughout the clubhouse,'' manager
Johnny Oates said after the Rangers' final Florida exhibition game.
``It was a nice way to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, whose progress this spring was slowed by a
soft-tissue injury to his right ankle, required only nine pitches
to complete his appearance and never allowed the ball to leave the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't expect this,'' said Wetteland, who threw
seven pitches for strikes. ``I really didn't. My warmup was so bad
that I wondered if I should even leave with the team, but there was
a lot of adrenaline. I'm sure that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland displayed ``a good fastball,'' catcher Ivan Rodriguez
said, and none appeared better than the one Cincinnati shortstop
Barry Larkin saw on a 2-1 count. Larkin's swing could not catch up
to Wetteland's fastball, and the All-Star reliever recorded the
strikeout on the next pitch with a slider on the outside corner
that the shortstop only could watch.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland also retired outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds on a foul
ball that Lee Stevens caught between the plate and first base and
induced an inning-ending come-backer to the mound from Hal Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as excited as I've seen him this spring, and there's no
doubt in my mind that he's ready physically and mentally,'' Oates
said. ``I told John in the dugout before the game that I wasn't
looking for results, but I saw in his eyes, `I am.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who underwent arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 and March 7
to remove torn cartilage from his right knee, hit his game-winning
home run on a 1-0 pitch from right-hander Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro also drew a fifth-inning walk in addition to his
opposite-field home run in four plate appearances, but the
left-handed power hitter never received an opportunity to test the
knee as a base runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about my hitting,'' Palmeiro said. ``I just
want to put my leg through a test. I want to see if I can score
from second on a single or from first on a double, and I've got two
more days to figure that out. I feel like I can, but it's one thing
to think you can and another to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers returned to Texas, though, having witnessed enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the biggest question marks we had,'' Oates said, ``were
able to perform well for us.''

MATEO TO OPEN AT TRIPLE-A OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Outfielder Ruben Mateo, listed by
oddsmaker Danny Sheridan as the favorite to win 1999 American
League rookie-of-the-year award, was told yesterday that he will
start the season at Triple-A Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan, whose line is published in ``USA Today'', installed
Mateo as a 5-to-1 favorite to win the rookie award.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is he going to get playing time?'' general manager Doug
Melvin asked.
</P>
<P>
   With Mateo ticketed for Triple A, five players are left to fill
two remaining Opening Day roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not intend to announce their roster until after
tomorrow's game against the New York Mets at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Today's and tomorrow's games at The Ballpark, though, will not
influence the decisions, manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made them in my mind before \Ryesterday's\S game,'' Oates
said. ``I know the roster right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Bournigal, Jon Shave and Scott Sheldon are the candidates
to become the utility infielder, and the fifth outfielder will be
either Scarborough Green or Milt Cuyler.
</P>
<P>
   NO INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who could use a right-handed hitter with Mike Simms
(torn left Achilles' tendon) on the 15-day disabled list for an
undetermined length of time, have no interest in free agent Cecil
Fielder or Baltimore's Chris Hoiles, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gilhooley, who represents Fielder, placed a call to Melvin
after the Toronto Blue Jays released his client this week.
Baltimore wants to trade Hoiles and his $3.5 million salary, but
Melvin informed Orioles general manager Frank Wren that the Rangers
are not interested.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers officially informed right-hander Mike Morgan that he
has made the ballclub. Morgan signed his contract Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Tim Welke ejected Reds designated hitter Greg
Vaughn in the second inning for questioning balls and strikes.

   Howe opens the door and finds Grieve, in pre-adolescent glee,
jumping up and down on his bed with the A's elephant mascot.
</P>
<P>
   No, Grieve isn't reverting to his childhood. He's acting.
</P>
<P>
   This scene comes from one of a series of commercials designed to
promote the team. The theme: ``Generation A's. They're young, but
they can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Other spots have former California governor Jerry Brown running
Eric Chavez' rookie-of-the-year candidacy, and Howe and pitching
coach Rick Peterson scouting videotape of a Little Leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever campaign, and unlike other clever ad campaigns _
talking amphibians come to mind _ this one is based on truth. These
A's indeed are young, but they really can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are the real deal,'' pitcher Gil Heredia said.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have as much young talent as any team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, the Martin High School graduate, was the American League
rookie of the year last season. The right fielder is 22.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who hit a combined .327 with 126 runs batted in and 33
homers in 135 games from Double A to the majors in '98, is a
prohibitive favorite to be the league's top rookie this year. The
third baseman is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada, a talented shortstop with a potent bat, is 22.
Catcher A.J. Hinch, in his second season, is 24. Second baseman
Scott Spezio is 26. Center fielder Ryan Christenson is 25. Jimmy
Haynes, the No. 2 starter in the rotation, is 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are young,'' pitcher Kenny Rogers said. ``We'll make some
mistakes. But these guys have talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, not all the A's are young. The team is an intriguing
mix of peach fuzz and graybeards. The roster includes two
41-year-olds in pitchers Tom Candiotti and Doug Jones, and a couple
of 39-year-olds in outfielders Tony Phillips and Tim Raines. Closer
Billy Taylor is 37.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but I act young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On this team, that's a compliment. Young is good.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, the centerpiece of the ad campaign and the youth
movement, seems to have a one-way ticket to stardom. Concerns are
cropping up about his defense, but no one doubts his ability to
hit. He batted .288 with 18 homers and 89 RBI last year, and
expects to improve this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with it,'' he said. ``I know my potential is to
be better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is replete with players who fall victim to the dreaded
``sophomore slump,'' but those who know him would be surprised if
the son of former big-league player and executive Tom Grieve is one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good enough player, and he was around baseball at an
early age,'' Rogers said. ``Those experiences help him get through
rough times. He's level-headed enough. And he's got a great swing.
That swing will get you out of a lot of slumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Grieve, Chavez has a smooth, powerful left-handed swing.
Like Grieve, he has been anointed rookie of the year on the
strength of an outstanding minor-league season and solid
performance in the majors after a September call-up (.311 in 45
at-bats).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Grieve, he has got a little swagger in his stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got confidence,'' Rogers said. ``Maybe a little too much,
but that's the way to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Grieve, Chavez knows not to believe all his press
clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting to do anything wonderful this year,'' he
said. ``I'm just concentrating on how I handle myself when I fail.
I know there's going to be lots of ups and downs, and I've got to
be prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire team would be wise to adopt that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The official party line is the A's can contend in the West this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're better than we were last year, and I think we should
be, we'll surprise some people this year,'' Grieve said. ``Our goal
isn't to do anything less than win the division. You don't want to
go into the season saying we want to finish in third place instead
of last place. Every team's goal is to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's more likely that this will be a season of growing
pains.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia has seen it happen before. He was in Montreal in '92
with young, talented players such as Moises Alou, Marquis Grissom,
John Wetteland, Delino DeShields, Cliff Floyd, Darrin Fletcher and
Wil Cordero. Within two years, the Expos had the best record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have consistency, and that's the bottom line,''
Heredia said. ``They have the talent, but not the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If the youngsters all mature at the same time, they could team
with Matt Stairs (26 homers, 106 RBI) and Jason Giambi (27 homers,
110 RBI) to give the A's a powerful offense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the A's do hit, the pitching staff looms as a weakness.
Especially if Rogers is traded sometime between now and the end of
July, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   They're young. They can play. It should be fun to watch them
grow up. But for now, it'll be tough for the A's to avoid finishing
last for the fifth time in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge,'' Heredia said.
