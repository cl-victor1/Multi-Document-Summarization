Japan's leaders intensify efforts to save troubled bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials are stepping up efforts to save
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, readying emergency loans and urging
another leading bank to speed up a planned merger with the ailing
lender.
	   The government is considering using part of a 13 trillion yen
(dlrs 91 billion) fund to help LTCB clean up its bad loans, Japan's
leading financial daily, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported
Friday. Japan established the fund earlier this year to stabilize
its debt-ridden financial system.
	   To head off any potential opposition to using a big share of the
public money for LTCB, the bank will announce a stringent
restructuring plan and top executives will resign as early as
September to take responsibility for the bank's troubles, the paper
reported, citing LTCB sources.
	   The bank would also likely close all its overseas operations,
the report said.
	   LTCB declined to comment but media reports said the bank would
unveil its plan as early as Friday evening.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took the unusual step of calling the
president of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. to his residence late
Thursday to ask him to move quickly on a planned merger with LTCB.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, among Japan's to 19 lenders, has
repeatedly denied it has serious financial problems. But rumors
that bad loans threaten to sink the bank had driven its shares down
to below their 50 yen par-value.
	   Analysts have said that whether the rumors were true or not, the
bank would have difficulty remaining afloat with investor
confidence so low.
	   How Japan deals with the LTCB problem is seen as a crucial test
of its ability to stabilize its shaky banking system and keep
troubles there from dragging down the whole economy.
	   In what has been widely seen as a government-orchestrated
rescue, Sumitomo announced in June that it was negotiating to
absorb LTCB, but said it was not willing to take over LTCB's bad
debt.
	   Several Japanese newspapers have reported this week that the
government has decided to inject 500 billion yen (dlrs 3.5 billion)
to 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7 billon) of public money into LTCB to
dispose of its bad loans and make it a more attractive merger
partner for Sumitomo.
	   Government regulators have determined that despite the bank's
troubles, its condition has not deteriorated to the point where its
liabilities exceed its assets, a key requirement under Japanese law
to qualify for a public bailout.
	   The Bank of Japan was also preparing to extend special loans to
Long-Term Credit Bank as early as next week to help it through any
short-term funding problems, a bank of Japan official told Dow
Jones newswire Thursday on condition of anonymity.
	   Unlike conventional banks, LTCB raises money by issuing bonds
and has been forced to pay more as investors inceasingly view the
bonds as a risky investment.
	   The government's financial system stabilization fund was
established to buy shares in a number of leading banks as a way of
strengthening their capital bases.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ It wasn't unusual to find wealthy
Saudis on the periphery of the Afghan struggle against the Soviet
Union. They'd arrive in Afghan refugee camps, open briefcases full
of cash, and distribute dollars to war widows and wounded veterans.
	   But Osama bin Laden was unusual. The son of a Saudi construction
magnate went into the rugged Afghan mountains to fight, gaining a
reputation for bravery and determination. He used his millions to
buy bulldozers to gouge guerrilla trails in the heart of
Afghanistan and to bring in, by his count, thousands of Egyptians,
Lebanese, Turks and others to join their Afghan Muslim brothers in
the struggle against an ideology that spurned religion.
	   U.S. forces attacked alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and
a chemical plant in Sudan on Thursday, and U.S. President Bill
Clinton said the targets were linked to bin Laden.
	   Clinton said he ordered military strikes after linking bin
Laden's facilities to the bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 257 people.
	   Bin Laden survived the attacks, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers
said.
	   Osama bin Laden ``is safe and no damage has been done to any of
his companions,'' said Mullah Abdullah, a spokesman reached at
Taliban headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar.
	   The spokesman did not say where bin Laden was, or whether he had
been at the targeted sites at the time of the attacks.
	   Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan with the permission of
the Taliban, who control most of the country.
	   The U.S. State Department calls bin Laden ``one of the most
significant sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world
today.''

Harbin defends its dikes against the Songhua River floods
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Soldiers piled sandbags and directed the
work of 400,000 people on Friday to guard Harbin, capital of
China's northeastern province bordering Siberia, from the flooding
Songhua River.
	   In Stalin Park on the river bank, martial music blared from
loudspeakers to pep up weary soldiers lugging sandbags to the
dikes. The city of 9 million people was calm after the embankment
held back another record crest early Friday.
	   On the north bank, opposite the city, the river covered all but
village roofs. Families camped and took shelter in trains parked on
sidings atop raised rail beds.
	   Surging rivers in the northeast have added to China's battles
against the worst flood season in at least 40 years.
	   Farther south in the center of the country, much of the Yangtze
River has stood above the emergency stage for more than a month.
Experts predicted waters would not recede until mid-September, the
People's Daily reported Friday.
	   In Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province,
the city dike was about one meter (three feet) above the water
level. The city was calm, but soldiers and civilians were watching
trouble spots for leaks as the river poured past at its highest
level on record.
	   ``We don't sleep much,'' said Nie Yuping, a soldier from Anhui
province, where his family's fields were under water. Nie said he
caught about three or four hours a night in the back of a People's
Liberation Army truck.
	   ``Everybody's out working,'' he said. ``We'll leave when the
water goes.''
	   Officers said their soldiers suffered colds and blistered hands
because they had been soaked for so long.
	   Jiang Bailu, an army field officer who had been on the dike for
four days, said not much more could have been done to prepare.
	   ``The flood came so suddenly. We never thought it would rain so
hard for so long,'' he said.
	   Along the Yangtze, at Wuhan, one of the biggest industrial bases
of central China, people guarding the dikes were ordered to stay at
their posts, the People's Daily reported.
	   Dangerous river levels would continue because more rain was
forecast, reservoirs were full and the ground could not absorb more
rain, the State Flood Relief Headquarters told state media.
	   In central China's Hunan province, Dongting Lake, fed by the
Yangtze, remained dangerously high, the government-controlled
reports said. China's news media have focused on the fight against
the floods, but offer little information about deaths and damage.
	   The latest available casualty toll, more than two weeks old, is
more than 2,000 deaths nationwide. Millions have been left
homeless, and the government expects damage of about 200 billion
yuan (dlrs 24 billion).
	   In the northeast, around the Daqing oil field, the Nen River
overwhelmed dikes this week, forcing more than 100,000 people
living up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Xingzhan town to
flee, the official China Daily said. A railway line needed to bring
in relief supplies was destroyed Wednesday.
	   Part of the oil field was under water, but oil production was
largely stable, the China Daily quoted Daqing spokesman Liu
Zhengyin as saying.

Hopes rise for settlement of Hyundai Motor's labor dispute
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co.'s labor union
accepted ``a minimum level of layoffs'' Friday, raising hopes for a
negotiated settlement of a month-long strike at the nation's
largest automaker, government mediators said.
	   ``Considering the difficulty being faced by Hyundai and the car
industry as a whole, the union has accepted layoffs as a realistic
solution,'' Cho Sung-jun, a government mediator, told reporters.
	   The move was a major concession by the militant, 26,000-member
union, which has long insisted it would never accept a ``single
worker laid off.''
	   After shedding 6,100 workers earlier this year through early
retirements, Hyundai laid off 1,538 workers on July 31. The union
first fought to forestall the layoffs, then demanded that Hyundai
take back the fired employees.
	   Some 5,000 workers and their families have been picketing
Hyundai's plant at Ulsan since July 20, shortly after the company
first announced its layoff plans.
	   In talks that continued off and on through the night, the union
agreed to a government proposal calling for between 250 and 300
workers to be dismissed. Mediators said management and the union
were still far apart on what to do with the remaining workers the
company originally wanted to fire.
	   The company has suggested putting them on unpaid leave for a
year and a half, then bringing them back for six months of paid
retraining. The union wants them put on two years of paid leave.
	   Company and union negotiators were to meet with mediators later
Friday to try to resolve that issue.
	   The company maintains it needs to reduce its work force because
of sharply falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been
operating at 40 percent of its annual capacity of 1.25 million
units.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, is
the first major business to shed redundant workers. The outcome
will set an example for other businesses and affect South Korea's
overall efforts to woo back foreign investors.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Soldiers will patrol the streets of
Honduras' main cities reinforcing police in an attempt to fight
rising crime, President Carlos Flores Facusse said.
	   He also called on the legislature to provide funding to increase
the number of police to 8,000 from 6,000 and to give them
helicopters and advanced weapons needed to protect the country.
	   Flores Facusse's announcement, in a speech broadcast nationwide
Thursday, follows the kidnapping Tuesday of Tania Facusse, daughter
of Mario Facusse, a businessman and opposition politician who is
the president's cousin. The kidnappers are demanding dlrs 425,000
ransom.
	   The armed forces controlled the police from 1963 until last
year, when power was transferred to a civil police department.

Hong Kong police seize thousands of pirated compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a growing crackdown, officials said Friday
that they had seized more than 45,000 pirated compact discs valued
at U.S. dlrs 142,000.
	   Ten people were arrested when customs officers raided shops in a
busy mall on Thursday, seizing more than 20,000 video discs, 24,000
video-game CD-ROMs, 1,200 compact discs, and 192 video game
cartridges, a government statement said.
	   Those arrested, who are between 17 and 37 years old, were
released on bail pending further inquiries.
	   ``We have been stepping up enforcement action to protect
intellectual property rights in Hong Kong,'' the statement said.
	   Hong Kong officials are under pressure, particularly from the
United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. U.S. officials say Hong Kong has become a production and
distribution center for pirated discs since officials in mainland
China began cracking down.
	   Early this year, U.S. officials decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watch list for copyright violation.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth U.S.
dlrs 83 million, the biggest such seizure in Hong Kong's history.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels may be looking to talk peace, but
war remains the reality in Congo's troubled capital.
	   With an army of rebels on the march toward Kinshasa, fear and
uncertainty now fill a city that 15 months ago rejoiced when former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was ousted from power.
	   Residents struggled through much of the week without
electricity, which also caused shortages of water and fuel. Where
dwindling food stocks were still available, prices have spiraled.
	   Dilapidated hospitals have filled with the wounded and dead from
battles 100 miles (160 kilometers) from here.
	   ``How much, just how much do we have to take?'' says Ngengele
Sukusuku, a shop owner who closed his store earlier in the week for
fear of looting. ``We can't run like the Americans can. We're stuck
here, and this is our lives.''
	   Fearing the worst, many countries including the United States
have closed their embassies and evacuated many of their nationals.
	   Rebel leaders said Wednesday they were willing to negotiate a
political solution and even a cease-fire with President Laurent
Kabila, who took power after ousting Mobutu in May 1997.

 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Mariners 0 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Seattle, Roger Clemens won his 10th straight decision and
pitched his first shutout of the season, leading the Toronto Blue
Jays over the Seattle Mariners.
	   Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., falling out of the home run race,
failed to homer in his fifth straight game, going 0-for-4. The AL
home run leader with 42 has one homer in his last 18 games and 77
at bats.
	   He trails Mark McGwire of St. Louis, who homered twice Thursday
to increase his total to 51, by nine. Last season, McGwire
outhomered Griffey 58-56.
	   Clemens (15-6) pitched a three-hitter, walked two and struck out
six in recording his 42nd career shutout to lower his ERA to 2.90.
In going 10-0 since his last loss to Cleveland 7-3 May 29, he also
has five no decisions.
	   Seattle lost for the seventh time in nine games.
	   Jose Cruz Jr., traded by the Mariners to the Blue Jays last
year, hit his second homer in two nights against his former team to
lead a 14-hit attack. The Blue Jays took a 4-0 lead in the first
off Bill Swift (10-7).
 &UR; Athletics 3, White Sox 1
	   In Oakland, California, Kenny Rogers pitched seven strong
innings for his 100th career victory and Miguel Tejada backed him
with a two-run homer as the Oakland Athletics beat the Chicago
White Sox for their third straight win.
	   Rogers (12-5) allowed one run on five hits while striking out
four and walking two in helping the A's finish a two-game series
sweep.
	   Obtained in an offseason trade with New York, Rogers improved to
9-0 with a 2.11 ERA in 15 starts at the Oakland Coliseum, the best
home ERA in the AL. He is 100-71 overall, registering his first 70
wins while with Texas.
	   Bill Taylor pitched the ninth for his 25th save.
	   Tom Fordham (1-2), recalled from Triple-A Calgary on Wednesday,
allowed three runs on seven hits in 6 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Angels 13, Tigers 2
	   In Anaheim, California, Gary DiSarcina drove in three runs and
rookie Troy Glaus broke out of a slump with a career-high three
hits to lead the Anaheim Angels past the Detroit Tigers.
	   Anaheim won for the ninth time in its last 12 games and
maintained its 1{-game lead over Texas in AL West. Detroit lost for
the 13th time in its last 16 games.
	   DiSarcina capped a six-run third inning off Brian Powell (2-4)
with an RBI single.
	   Omar Olivares (7-8) won for only the second time since June 17.
He had gone 1-6 in his previous 12 starts, giving up 42 earned runs
in 64 innings pitched.

Japanese trading company files for bankruptcy

bankruptcy, reasons for failure; changes overline; Okura and Co.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese trading company Okura and Co. filed for
bankruptcy Friday after bad real estate investments and sluggish
earnings left it with an insurmountable level of debt.
	   The failure of businesses entered during the 1980s ``bubble''
era of asset inflation, including real estate investment, left the
87-year-old company with debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.8
billion), Okura said in a statement.
	   Weak earnings were also a factor in the bankruptcy, the company
said.
	   Okura, which specialized in trading steel and machinery, said it
had failed to find a merger partner or to convince shareholders to
inject more capital into the business.
	   The latest failure comes as Japanese corporate bankruptcies are
rising at their fastest pace since the end of World War II, fueled
by recession and shrinking access to credit.
	   In terms of liabilities, Okura's bankruptcy is the third largest
in Japan this year, according to financial information provider
Teikoku Data Bank.
	   Fuji Bank Ltd., one of Okura's main lenders, said Friday that it
expected to be unable to collect about half of its 38 billion yen
(dlrs 266 million) in loans to Okura.

Commentary calls for Suu Kyi to be deported as deadline passes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A state-run newspaper said opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi should be expelled from Myanmar and her
National League for Democracy banned, as the military refused to
meet the party's demand to convene parliament.
	   ``The NLD led by (Suu Kyi) has broken many existing laws,
therefore the NLD should be declared illegal and she should be
deported,'' the Friday commentary in the state-run Mirror Daily
said.
	   ``Only after she is deported can the government continue with
its nation-building task, the people can go about their business
peacefully and the price of consumer goods can come down,'' it
said.
	   The NLD, of which Suu Kyi is general secretary, had set Aug. 21
as the deadline for the military government to allow a parliament
elected in 1990 to meet. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the
assembly. The military did not honor the result.
	   Various Myanmar ethnic groups, pro-democracy activists in exile
and Western governments have called on the military to heed the
NLD's demand.
	   As the deadline passed, the streets of Yangon were quiet and Suu
Kyi spent a 10th day in her van parked on a bridge outside Yangon,
continuing her protest over her right to travel freely outside the
capital.
	   The authorities stopped her last Wednesday 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of Yangon for the fourth time in two months as she
tried to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.
	   Her food was running low and she was becoming ill, NLD leaders
said. She has offered to end the impasse and return to Yangon if
the government releases members of her party imprisoned since May
27.
	   Tin Oo, vice chairman of the NLD, said there were about 97 party
members who had been jailed since that time. May 27 was the
anniversary of the 1990 election and a spate of arrests took place
after the NLD set a deadline for the government to honor the
result.
	   Forty two NLD members elected to parliament are in prison along
with hundreds more party members arrested over the years.
	   Tin Oo said releasing the prisoners in exchange for ending Suu
Kyi's protest was raised by NLD Chairman Aung Shwe during a rare
meeting Wednesday with Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the four most
powerful generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   ``That would be a positive step. If they are sincere, then they
could release them,'' Tin Oo said, while not commenting on Khin
Nyunt's response.
	   Meanwhile, more than a hundred Myanmar students protested
outside the country's embassy in Bangkok, and said 30 of them would
begin a hunger strike on Saturday until the military convened
parliament.
	   ``The military government yesterday issued a statement saying
the country lacks a constitution to allow the parliament to
convene. But Burma has the 1947 Constitution, which is the only
democratic constitution,'' said Zaw Wint, a student spokesman.
	   The military abrogated the 1947 charter when Gen. Ne Win seized
control of the country from the democratically-elected government
in 1962. The military has ruled Myanmar ever since.

Cuba and its Caribbean neighbors join forces on trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SDO104 &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ For nearly four
decades, Fidel Castro kept to one side of a sometimes-bitter
ideological divide between his communist Cuba and the Dominican
Republic's dabbling in democracy.
	   But now that divide seem to be crumbling. On Thursday, Castro
said he felt right at home when he finally set foot on Dominican
soil for the first time since becoming Cuba's leader in 1959.
	   ``To be here in the Dominican Republic, I hardly believe it,''
he exclaimed to Dominican President Leonel Fernandez. ``It's been
my lifelong dream.''
	   Attending a 16-nation Caribbean summit starting Friday, Castro
prepared to join another struggle _ of small island states fighting
for economic survival in an era of increasingly global free trade.
	   Castro alluded to that struggle as he recalled the strong
cultural ties that historically wed Cuba and the Dominican
Republic. ``We have done a lot together, but we must do a lot more
together in the future,'' he declared.
	   Cuba's economy has struggled since the collapse of its biggest
trading partner, the Soviet-era Eastern bloc. The continuing U.S.
trade embargo has also taken its toll.
	   Other Caribbean states, meanwhile, have seen U.S. aid dwindle
since the end of the Cold War _ from dlrs 200 million a year to
dlrs 25 million last year _ and are fighting to maintain access to
foreign markets for such exports as bananas, sugar and textiles.
	   No longer fearing reprisals from Washington, Caribbean
democracies are reaching out to Castro, hoping for some extra
muscle in upcoming talks with European trading partners and on a
proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.
	   At the summit, Castro will observe the signing of a trade
agreement between the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean
Community economic bloc, a combined economy of dlrs 30 billion that
could rise to dlrs 40 billion if Cuba were included. Cuba asked for
a similar pact this year.
	   Community officials said they hoped to nudge Castro toward
democratic reforms as a step to closer relations.
	   Castro, 72, planned to stay in the Dominican Republic for at
least two days after the summit to get acquainted with a nation
that restored full diplomatic ties with Havana in April after a
34-year hiatus.
	   Many Dominicans recall Castro's opposition to the despised
Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled this country with an
iron fist from 1930 until his assassination in 1961.
	   A series of U.S.-backed Dominican governments, however, shunned
Castro, especially those of six-term conservative President Joaquin
Balaguer. The centrist Fernandez, who succeeded Balaguer in 1996,
enjoys strong U.S. ties but also moved quickly to restore relations
with Havana.
	   Castro and Fernandez were expected to discuss expanding trade
ties between Cuba and the Dominican Republic, both increasingly
dependent on tourism.
	   Security was tight for the visit following several reported
plots against the Cuban leader. Rifle-toting troops stood guard in
many parts of Santo Domingo, and two navy patrol boats trolled off
the seaside hotel hosting the summit.

Fires rage in Far Eastern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Large fires raged Friday in the forests of the
Russian Far East, and cash-strapped regional authorities fretted
about the cost of fighting them, a Russian news agency said.
	   The fires in the Khabarovsk region covered 243,000 hectares
(600,000 acres), and were costing up to 900,000 rubles (dlrs
130,000) in firefighting expenses each day, the regional office of
the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Another 35,000 hectares (86,000 acres) were burning in
surrounding regions of the Far East, ITAR-Tass said.

Myanmar embassy in Thailand tightening rules on tourist visas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok has
increased the waiting period for tourists to receive visas from
about one hour to at least a week, applicants said Friday.
	   Tourists applying for visas were told that since Aug. 13 the
process will take at least a week, and that on the seventh day
applicants must return for an interview.
	   The moves are believed to be a reaction to 18 foreign activists
who entered Myanmar on tourist visas earlier this month and were
arrested for handing out democracy leaflets.
	   They were sentenced to five years in prison, but deported the
next day.
	   The government also deported two journalists this week who
entered Myanmar on tourist visas. Myanmar is also known as Burma.
Journalists are required to apply for special visas to work in the
country, but the government has approved almost none in recent
months.
	   Myanmar launched an ambitious tourism campaign spanning 1997-98
called ``Visit Myanmar Year.''
	   Although the government recently said tourist arrivals were up
and the industry booming, travelers returning from Myanmar have
reported there are almost no foreign tourists in the country.

Peru's ``untouchable'' women clean up traffic chaos, corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LIM103 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Calm amid dizzying traffic chaos, Lima
policewoman Miriam Diaz waves over an aging taxi that had sputtered
through a stop signal.
	   With a no-nonsense expression, she ignores a bribe offer and
hands the driver a ticket _ part of a women-driven revolution of
honesty taking place on Lima's streets.
	   The government hopes to use Peruvians' perception that women are
more honest than men to clean up the image of a police force so
corrupt that many officers will overlook traffic infractions for
bribes as small as a dollar,about the cost of a candy bar.
	   President Alberto Fujimori has announced that all of Lima's
2,500 traffic officers will be women by July 1999.
	   Some 25 percent of Lima's traffic police are already women, and
these first recruits have earned a reputation among drivers as
unbribable.
	   ``The women are more honest and morally firm than the men. It's
undeniable,'' said Cmdr. Pedro Montoya, who is training an
all-woman motorcycle brigade.
	   Lima is a sprawling city of 7 million on Peru's coastal desert.
An explosion in the number of cars in recent years has swamped its
traffic and police services, creating some of the world's most
chaotic traffic.
	   Public reaction to the women officers has been largely positive.
	   Traffic police earn about dlrs 200 a month, a pauper's wage in
Lima, where the minimal survival income for a family of five is
dlrs 300. This has led police to view bribes a part of their
income.
	   Male officers are known to pull cars over en masse before
holidays to extort gift-buying money and sell tickets to
non-existent barbecues. Drivers refuse to buy the tickets at their
own risk.
	   ``The old police were only interested in collecting money to buy
lunch. The women seem more concerned with doing the job,'' said
veteran taxi driver Juan Ignacio. ``But let's wait to see if they
stay that way.''
	   A recent study showed that two of three Peruvians view women as
both more honest and less authoritarian than men. The study by the
private company Imasen polled 1,150 people in Peru's three largest
cities in March with a margin of error of 5 percent.
	   Diaz, her jet-black hair cut short, is proud of her job. She
wears a dark green skirt, coat, cap and black boots. A bright
orange reflector vest saying ``Policia'' identifies her as a
policewoman.
	   ``Most of the women become police officers to wear the uniform
and get respect,'' said Diaz, 26.
	   Officers assigned to the street usually come from Peru's largely
poor majority.
	   Montoya says he thinks the women are more honest because of
their role as heads of the family in deeply Catholic Peru and their
aversion to taking money from male drivers, which they see as
resembling prostitution.
	   ``Women police officers take the job more seriously. Perhaps
because they are breaking ground in a male bastion,'' said
sociologist Cecilia Blondet.
	   A police school on the outskirts of Lima will graduate 300
female cadets in October and 1,500 more in 1990, school director
Col. Javier Caballero said. Male officers will be transferred to
different departments.
	   The women will face a tough task improving the corrupt force's
image.
	   More than 1,000 cops were kicked off the police force as a whole
for corruption in 1995 alone. Dozens more were arrested for
kidnapping, armed robbery and other crimes.
	   Another daunting task will be bringing order to Lima's
law-of-the-jungle traffic.
	   Drivers accustomed to avoiding tickets with a small bribe
routinely ignore the few posted rules on Lima's roads.
	   Motorists roar through stop signs and red lights, and make left
turns from three lanes over, cutting off two lanes of traffic.
Motorcyclists drive down sidewalks, scattering pedestrians. Lane
markings serve no apparent purpose.
	   ``The women officers have a lot to teach us men about respecting
the law,'' said Montoya.

Chinese community in Thailand criticizes Indonesia over rapes

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About 500 ethnic Chinese protested
Friday at the Indonesian Embassy over the mass rapes and violent
attacks against Indonesia's ethnic Chinese during the country's
recent upheaval.
	   The protesters, many of them well-dressed businessmen who
arrived in chauffeur-driven cars, called on Indonesia's new leader,
President B.J. Habibie, to take legal action against the wrongdoers
and to prevent such outbursts of ethnic hatred from recurring.
	   ``I can't believe the Indonesians would do something as
backwards as what the Japanese did 50 years ago to the Chinese
during World War II,'' said one protester, Dilok Pannaprapaporn, a
member of the Overseas Chinese Association.
	   In Thailand as in Indonesia, the Chinese minority is the driving
force of the economy.
	   But Thailand's ethnic Chinese are better accepted than
Indonesia's, who were made a scapegoat for the country's economic
meltdown during the May unrest that brought down President Suharto.
	   Chinese-owned shops and homes were burned and rampaging mobs
killed, beat and raped ethnic Chinese.
	   Thailand's Friends of Women Foundation issued a statement
demanding that the government pay for damages to the rape victims.
	   ``Such injustices have unfortunately culminated in rampant
sexual assaults on innocent women and girls of Chinese origin, a
sad manifestation of misperceived power over and hatred of
compatriots of different race,'' the statement said.
	   About 1,200 people are estimated to have been killed in the
rioting. Women's rights groups estimate that at least 160 women and
girls were raped.
	   Outrage over the May attacks has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices abroad.

Japan to drastically cut satellite prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will slash prices on its expensive commercial
satellites to remain competitive in the aerospace industry during
the 21st century, government officials said Friday.
	   Like the United States, Europe and Russia, Japan's
rocket-launching technology now makes it possible to carry two-ton
payloads into the geostationary orbits needed by communication
satellites.
	   But the cost of making a commercial satellite in Japan is more
than twice that of its competitors, despite the global
competitiveness of electronics parts used in its consumer products.
	   To help close the price gap, the government plans to spend about
25 billion yen (dlrs 174.8 million) under a seven-year plan from
fiscal 1999, said Ryo Imoto, who oversees space industry matters at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   In Japan, the cost of making a computer central processing unit
for use in a space satellite is currently about 20 million yen
(dlrs 139,000). That compares with about 8,000 yen (dlrs 56) for
those used in consumer products, ministry officials said.
	   ``We will compile a data base on the durability of a variety of
parts by conducting practical tests involving heat, radiation and
vibration in space,'' Imoto said.
	   Imoto said global demand for launching commercial satellites
into space is expected to grow annually to about 100 satellites to
150 satellites around 2010 and after, compared with annual
launchings of 25 to 30 satellites now.
	   Two government-run agencies handle rocket-launching in Japan,
with commercial satellites built by private electronics and other
manufacturers.
	   Despite being a latecomer to the aerospace industry, Japan is
gradually moving toward independence in its space program. In 1990,
it sent a satellite to the moon, a feat that had previously been
accomplished only by the United States and the former Soviet Union.
	   Last year, Japan launched a foreign satellite fore the first
time.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ U.S. missiles targeting terrorists
killed at least eight people in Afghanistan, including five
Pakistanis training to fight in India, sources said Friday.
	   The Pakistani news agency NNI, quoting the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen
group, said the five Pakistanis were killed in a strike on a
training camp near Khost, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of
the Afghan capital Kabul. Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, formally known as
Harkat-ul-Ansar, was included last year on the U.S. State
Department's list of terrorist groups for its support of an
insurrection by militant Muslims in Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Maulvi Sadre Azam, the Taliban deputy governor of Nangarhar
province, said three other people were killed in strikes near
Jalalabad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul.

Philippine shares lower, peso keeps gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended lower Friday,
spooked by Wall Street's overnight loss and fears of a fresh round
of regional currency declines on rumors that Venezuela's currency
may be devalued, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed down 18.33 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1372.60, after
gaining 1.9 percent, or 26.34 points, Thursday.
	   The decline in Manila shares was in step with losses on other
Asian stock markets Friday, which followed an 81.87 point drop in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Thursday.
	   Market rumors of a plan to devalue Venezuela's bolivar was
denied by Venezuelan authorities Thursday, but traders said the
idea was enough to raise fears of a new round of Asian currency
turmoil.
	   ``What could hurt us most at this point is what will happen to
Latin American economies and their currencies,'' said Edwin Siao,
trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Total volume of shares traded Friday thinned to 229 million
shares from 936.4 million shares Thursday.
	   Gainers lagged behind decliners 27 to 54, while 42 issues were
unchanged.
	   The Philippine peso, meanwhile, sustained its advances in recent
days against the U.S. dollar on gains by the Japanese yen and the
central bank's siphoning off of excess domestic liquidity that
could have been used by banks to speculate against the dollar.
	   The peso has gained five percent since hitting a seven-month low
of 44.790 pesos to the dollar on Aug. 10 because of fears of a
possible devaluation in the Chinese yuan.
	   In early afternoon trading, the dollar averaged 42.638 on the
Philippine Dealing System, down from 42.691 at Thursday's reference
rate.

	   There was no immediate confirmation of the reports. NNI and
Sadre Azam had few details.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the attacks on sites in
Sudan as well as Afghanistan Thursday night, saying he had
established links between the targets and those responsible for the
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed a total
of 257 Aug. 7.
	   Clinton said the facilities attacked were linked to Osama bin
Laden, a Saudi millionaire he called the ``pre-eminent organizer
and financier of international terrorism in the world today.''
	   Sadre Azam said the camp struck near Jalalabad had been a major
training camp during the Afghan war against Soviet invaders in the
1980s, and later was used as a training camp for the Taliban
religious militia that has fought its way to control most of the
country.
	   Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen told NNI its fighters were
in Afghanistan training to fight in India. Indian-held Kashmir is
the only predominately Muslim state in majority-Hindu India, and
Indian officials have accused the government in neighboring,
Islamic Pakistan of supporting groups like Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen.
Pakistan denies the charges, saying it provides only moral and
political support to what it calls the legitimate aspirations of
Kashmiris.

Jalalabad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the reports. NNI and
Sadre Azam had few details.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the attacks on sites in
Sudan as well as Afghanistan Thursday night, saying he had
established links between the targets and those responsible for the
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed a total
of 257 Aug. 7.
	   Clinton said the facilities attacked were linked to Osama bin
Laden, a Saudi millionaire he called the ``preeminent organizer and
financier of international terrorism in the world today.''
	   Sadre Azam said the camp struck near Jalalabad had been a major
training camp during the Afghan war against Soviet invaders in the
1980s, and later was used as a training camp for the Taliban
religious militia that has fought its way to control of most of the
country.
	   Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen told NNI its fighters were in Afghanistan
training to fight in India. Indian-held Kashmir is the only
predominately Muslim state in majority-Hindu India, and Indian
officials have accused the government in neighboring, Islamic
Pakistan of supporting groups like Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Pakistan
denies the charges, saying it provides only moral and political
support to what it calls the legitimate aspirations of Kashmiris.

Israel army seals Hebron after settler stabbed to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops sealed off this divided
town Friday after a 63-year-old rabbi was stabbed to death by a
Palestinian in his home in a Jewish settler enclave, the army said.
	   The victim, Shlomo Raanan, belonged to a dynasty of spiritual
leaders of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and
there was tension in Hebron as settlers prepared for his funeral.
	   Shortly after Thursday evening's killing, a group of settlers
beat two Palestinian passers-by outside a settler enclave. The two
suffered bruises and were treated at a Hebron hospital.
	   Hebron is a town of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers
who live in several enclaves. In 1997, Israeli troops withdrew from
the bulk of the town, remaining only in the downtown area.
	   On Friday morning, the army imposed a curfew on 30,000
Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled area and brought more
troops into the city.
	   The army also sealed off Hebron and asked the Palestinian
Authority to help search for the assailant who is believed to have
fled into the Palestinian-controlled sector.
	   Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, Israel's army commander in the West
Bank, said ``nobody will leave or enter the city for the next few
days until we complete the investigation.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his vacation in
northern Israel and returned to Jerusalem in the wake of the
stabbing, his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said.
	   The attack occurred Thursday evening in the settler compound of
Tel Romeida, a heavily guarded cluster of several mobile homes on a
hill overlooking downtown Hebron.
	   The assailant climbed through a window into the rabbi's trailer,
stabbed him several times, threw a firebomb into the living room
where the rabbi's wife was sitting and escaped through the window
and over a nearby fence, the army said.
	   The rabbi's wife was rescued suffering from smoke inhalation.
	   After news of the killing spread, a few dozen settlers marched
towards the Palestinian sector but were stopped at an Israeli
roadblock. They shouted slogans accusing the Israeli army and
police of doing nothing to protect them.
	   Settlers leaders called on the government to approve
construction of permanent housing for the settlers in Tel Romeida,
as a response to the killing and to end the process of handing over
territory to the Palestinians.
	   ``The government must stop the process of withdrawal which
threatens to bring a tragedy upon the Jewish people,'' said Noam
Arnon, a spokesman for the settlers in Hebron.
	   Raanan was a grandson of the late Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen
Kook whose teachings inspired the Jewish settlement movement. Kook
said establishing settlements throughout the biblical Land of
Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was a religious
value and would bring the Jewish people closer to redemption.
	   Raanan was also a nephew of Israel's former Chief Rabbi Avraham
Shapira.

Rescuers hope to intensify efforts in buried Himalayan villages

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A break in the rain Friday raised hopes
for a helicopter airlift of the injured and dead from India's
northern Himalayas, where 239 people were feared killed in more
than six landslides in three days.
	   The break in the monsoon storms allowed nearly 200 rescue
workers to intensify their search for victims in the sludge of
landslides and along the banks of a river that swept away an entire
pilgrim campsite.
	   Authorities evacuated more than 30,000 people to higher ground
from 30 towns and villages who were threatened by floods following
a blockage in the Mandakini river about 300 kilometers (185 miles)
east of New Delhi.
	   Army and civil engineers were still undecided whether to
dynamite the dam created by falling boulders and mudslides. Rising
water could drown five towns and 25 villages, said B.M. Vohra, an
administrative officer of the Garhwal district.
	   On Thursday, five helicopters landed eight kilometers from
Malpa, the village where Hindu pilgrims were camped by the Kali
river on their way to a sacred shrine in Tibet. Officials said 202
people were feared killed in Malpa, although only 24 bodies have
been recovered.
	   Other landslides Wednesday and Thursday killed another 27
people.
	   Rescuers found 18 survivors, who were being treated by two
doctors attached to a local unit of paramilitary forces in Malpa,
said Ashok Kumar, the relief commissioner for the state of Uttar
Pradesh.
	   Authorities plan to airlift the injured to Bareilly, the nearest
town, once the weather clears.
	   India's foreign ministry, which organizes the pilgrimage across
the Chinese border, said Malpa had been turned into a debris of
stones. ``There is no trace of any survivors from the 60 pilgrims
as yet,'' said K.C. Singh, the ministry spokesman.

High court rules Quebec has no right to secede
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos QBC102 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ It was a judgment worthy of Solomon. Canada's
Supreme Court managed to rule on the question of Quebec secession
without infuriating leaders on either side of a bitter ideological
divide.
	   In its unanimous opinion Thursday, the court stated clearly _ as
the federal government had hoped _ that Quebec had no right to
secede from Canada unilaterally. The ruling was widely considered
the most important ever by Canada's high court.
	   But instead of the expected anger from separatists, there was
satisfaction over another part of the court's declaration: that
federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear
majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum.
	   ``We've always said that negotiations would follow a vote for
secession,'' said Jacques Brassard, a Cabinet minister in Quebec's
pro-independence government. ``Now what the court has said is that
these negotiations will be obligatory.''
	   Hard-line anti-separatists also were pleased, because for the
first time, the high court said the separatists' longstanding claim
that Quebec could decide for itself whether to secede has no legal
basis.
	   ``If I were a dancing man, I'd be dancing in the street,'' said
William Johnson, president of a Montreal-based group called
Alliance Quebec that promotes the rights of the province's
English-speaking minority.
	   ``Secessionists have always said that they alone could impose
the question (in a referendum), interpret the results as they like
and then impose all the conditions of the secession,'' Johnson
said. ``It has always been false.''
	   Secession by Quebec _ where more than 80 percent of the 7
million residents are French-speaking _ would deprive Canada of a
quarter of its population and split the four Atlantic provinces
from the rest of the country.
	   The ruling is likely to play a pivotal role in Quebec's upcoming
provincial election. Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatists'
charismatic leader, is expected to hold the vote either late this
year or next spring, and he plans to call another referendum on
secession if he wins re-election.
	   The latest polls show Bouchard's Parti Quebecois running
neck-and-neck with the anti-separatist Liberal Party.
	   The leader of the Quebec Liberals, Jean Charest, said the
election would offer a clear choice to voters in the mostly
French-speaking province.
	   ``Do we want a government that's going to hold another
referendum ... or do we want to get down to the business of
building Quebec?'' he asked.
	   Montrealers espoused virtually every possible viewpoint after
the ruling. Some were pleased by the balanced nature of the
decision; others complained that the court was intruding on a
matter that concerned only Quebeckers.
	   ``It isn't up to the courts,'' said Martin Pare, 26. ``When
people want to be free, they make that choice themselves.''
	   Clyde Jennings, a 29-year-old graphic artist, said the ruling
sends a message to the Quebec government that secession would
involve bargaining and possible compromise.
	   ``It takes the pressure off the separation issue and puts the
emphasis on people's rights,'' he said. ``It sends a strong signal
that Canada is one country.''
	   The high court decided to leave some of the thorniest issues to
the politicians. It did not specify what victory margin would
constitute a ``clear majority'' in a secession referendum, and it
did not grapple with the possibility that negotiations over
secession might reach an impasse.

Government launches investigation into deaths of kidney patients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Health Department on Friday began
investigating Hong Kong's latest medical scandal in which
contaminated water was pumped into dialysis machines, killing three
kidney patients.
	   The probe led by the territory's assistant director of health,
Mak Yinping, will be conducted concurrently with a separate inquiry
commissioned by the private Hong Kong Sanitorium and Hospital,
where the three patients died on Thursday.
	   Three other patients who were contaminated survived, and were in
stable condition on Friday.
	   Both investigations are expected to take about two weeks.
	   Legislator Dr. Edward Leong Che-hung will join the hospital's
investigation team, which will be led by Lai Kar-neng, head of Hong
Kong University's nephrology division and a kidney specialist at
its teaching hospital, Queen Mary Hospital.
	   Leong works in the Hong Kong Sanatorium, which is considered one
of Hong Kong's best hospitals, but is not employed by it. He told
government radio on Friday that he does not think there will be any
conflict of interest.
	   The hospital's water system, which was under repair, was
inadvertently switched on before antiseptics could be flushed out,
Walton Li, deputy medical superintendent of the hospital, said
Thursday.
	   ``It's clear there was human error,'' said Anita Ng, a relative
of one of the recovering patients.
	   The kidney patients were the latest victims in a chain of
hospital mistakes in one of Asia's best health care systems, some
of which have proved fatal. The blunders have shaken confidence in
both private and public hospitals.
	   In April, a painkiller that could harm both mother and fetus was
injected into 526 pregnant women after a hospital pharmacist failed
to verify the drug's contents.
	   A year ago, an 84-year-old woman died after staff mixed up tubes
and pumped oxygen into her blood instead of into the air cushion
under her neck. Shortly after, a student nurse in an intensive care
unit mistakenly connected a nutrition pack to an intravenous line,
sending milk into a patient's bloodstream.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said in a statement that
he was ``shocked and distressed'' by the deaths, and said Hong Kong
needed to restore confidence in its health services.
	   Michael Ho, chairman of the legislature's health services panel,
called for sweeping changes in the public health system.
	   A patients' advocacy group called for a review of government
monitoring of private hospitals.
	   ``There are no channels of complaint or a monitoring system for
private hospitals,'' Yung Qai-mui of the Patients' Rights
Association was quoted as saying in the South China Morning Post.

Hezbollah ambush kills two in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas have ambushed an
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, killing a soldier and a
civilian, officials said Friday.
	   Guerrillas set off a remote-controlled roadside bomb Thursday
night as an Israeli army patrol was heading to the Crusader-built
Beaufort castle in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   In Israel, the military said Friday that one soldier and a
civilian employed by a contractor working for the army were killed
in the blast.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   Three hours before Thursday night's bombing, Israeli warplanes
blasted suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon for the
second day.
	   No casualties were reported in the air raid, which targeted the
hills of Mazraat Iqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to oust some
1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern
towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

from late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York rate
of 143.19 yen overnight.
	   Traders also attributed the dollar's strength to a belief among
investors that Japan's efforts to reorganize the nation's ailing
financial system may take more time than expected.
	   But lingering speculation that Japan would intervene in currency
markets to support the yen if it falls further weighed on the
dollar, traders said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he ordered cruise
missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major
sponsor of terrorism.
	   The attacks were in response to the August 7 bombings at the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500 people.
	   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 93.21 points, or 0.61 points, to close at
15,298.20 points. On Thursday, the average fell 14.93 points, or
0.10 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange slipped 5.16 points, or 0.44 percent,
to 1,176.51. The TOPIX closed down 2.04 points, or 0.17 percent,
the day before.
	   Stocks started lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street
and news that medium-sized Japanese trading firm Okura and Co. was
to file for bankruptcy.
	   Okura filed for bankruptcy later Friday with debts totaling
257.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion).
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,611.41 on Thursday,
down 81.87 from Wednesday's finish.
	   The decline in Tokyo was mitigated in part by a rise in bank
shares following reports that drastic restructuring measures for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan were being mapped out.
	   LTCB shares jumped 18 yen, or 32.14 percent, to 74 yen.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.180 percent from
1.190 percent Thursday, driving its price up to 111.87 yen from
111.80 yen.

North Korea rejects Seoul's offer for dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea has effectively rejected a
South Korean proposal for dialogue for rapprochement by repeating
demands Seoul has already called unacceptable, government officials
said Friday.
	   In his Aug. 15 Independence Day address, President Kim Dae-jung
proposed to rival North Korea that special envoys discuss opening a
regular government channel of dialogue.
	   The two governments have had little contact since the 1950-53
Korean War, and never signed a peace treaty. Kim, a former
dissident, has made improvement of relations with the North a top
priority.
	   North Korea has shunned South Korea as a dialogue partner,
denouncing the Seoul government as a U.S. puppet. Instead of
directly rejecting Kim's proposal, the North renewed long-running
demands Seoul already has ruled unacceptable.
	   ``How can the South gibber about reunification while keeping
imperialist U.S. troops on its soil?'' the North's Committee for
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland asked in a statement.
	   In the statement, the committee, which handles relations with
the South, also demanded that the Seoul government:
	   _Abolish its anti-espionage national security laws.
	   _Disband its main intelligence Agency for National Security
Planning.
	   _Stop joint military exercises with the United States.
	   _Stop repression of pro-North Korean student activists in the
South.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war, having
signed no peace treaty after the Korean War ended in 1953.

Grenade attack leaves Cambodian opposition shaken, but defiant

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hours after escaping a lethal
grenade blast, opposition leader Sam Rainsy vowed Friday to go
ahead with a major weekend demonstration that he said the attack
was aimed at stopping.
	   A government official suggested the attack was a convenient
coincidence benefiting the opposition, which he accused of trying
to create a ``social explosion.''
	   Sam Rainsy, a loser in parliamentary elections held July 26, was
leading a sleep-in protest by his supporters at the National
Election Committee headquarters Thursday when several shots were
fired and a grenade was tossed from a passing car.
	   The grenade did not clear the wall of the compound and exploded
outside it, killing Sieng Sean, 45, a driver for Kyodo News agency
of Japan. Sam Rainsy was unharmed. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   ``I think the attackers may want to scare people from
participating in Sunday's demonstration,'' a shaken Sam Rainsy told
reporters. ``But we will go ahead as planned.''
	   ``I hope people will be determined not to continue being
slaves,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``You should not be afraid, you should
not give in.''
	   Sam Rainsy, one of the most vocal critics of strongman Hun Sen,
the election winner, was detained by Interior Ministry guards for
several hours after the attack.
	   Sam Rainsy said he was held at gunpoint and threatened with
death. Guns were also trained on journalists who had been with him
in the Interior Ministry compound, where the election committee's
headquarters are.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak suggested Friday that
Sam Rainsy was responsible for the attack by calling the sleep-in
to guard ballot boxes from being tampered with.
	   Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the other main
opposition leader, have demanded that ballots be recounted from the
elections. They refuse to recognize the election result or permit a
new government to be formed until their complaints are addressed.
	   Khieu Sopheak said that a rally planned for Sunday to press
their demands _ which organizers hope will bring 10,000 people to
the streets _ will be ``illegal.''
	   Khieu Sopheak said that the ministry, which controls the police,
will do everything possible to arrest those responsible, but it was
too early to tell if the attack was politically motivated.
	   Asked if the perpetrators could be linked to Sam Rainsy, he
said: ``There is no suspicion yet because there is no evidence. But
I would like to tell you that this was too coincidental.''
	   Khieu Sopheak accused the opposition organizing Sunday's
demonstration of taking ``a step leading up to social explosion and
turmoil, political crisis and alteration of the results of the
elections.''
	   Khieu Sopheak said a lawsuit will be filed against Sam Rainsy
for entering the ministry compound without authorization Thursday.
He did not know what steps might be taken if Sam Rainsy decides to
go ahead with the protest.
	   Sam Rainsy said he believed the attack was an attempt to
intimidate people from questioning last month's election results or
from joining Sunday's rally.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack March 30,
1997, during a demonstration outside parliament. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 wounded. No one was ever arrested.
	   Sam Rainsy said at the time that he suspected Hun Sen was behind
the attack. Hun Sen briefly accused Sam Rainsy of carrying it out
himself.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority
of the 122 National Assembly seats in the election, short of the
two-thirds necessary to form a new government.

France is urging negotiations to begin as fighting continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ France is warning that military
intervention may the only alternative to halt the fighting in
Kosovo province if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire and
peace talks soon.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fresh fighting
Thursday in the Serb province between government forces and the
Kosovo Liberation Army, despite Serb success in driving the
secessionist rebels from most of their strongholds this month.
	   Eight days ago, the leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova,
announced a five-member team to negotiate the future of the
province with the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Face-to-face talks have not taken place, despite Serb offers to
start them immediately. The Albanians have demanded an end to the
government offensive against the KLA and measures to guarantee the
safe return of the estimated 230,000 who fled their homes since the
crackdown began Feb. 28.
	   In a telephone call Thursday to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
French President Jacques Chirac said that unless fighting stops and
peace talks begin soon, military action ``will become difficult to
avoid.''
	   Aides said Chirac was especially concerned about the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Kosovo. U.N. and European
officials have warned that unless the refugees can return in time
to harvest crops in the next few weeks, the province could face
severe food shortages this winter.
	   In Belgrade, a spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist party, Ivica
Dacic, said the government was ready for serious negotiations on
autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo.
	   ``We expect the international community to persuade the
delegation of Kosovo Albanians to continue talks,'' Dacic said.
``It is obvious that talks are not in the interest of all those who
think that Kosovo problem can be solved by arms, threats or further
pressure.
	   He said that warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo
were ``sensationalistic lies'' aimed at obscuring the real problem,
which he said were ``separatism and terrorism - the evil which
hurts both Albanians and Serbs and all others in Kosovo.''
	   On Thursday, the Serb Media Center said ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste, near
the town of Orahovac, with automatic weapons and mortars, wounding
one policemen.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes that began
Wednesday night near the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Thursday with
Nikola Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, to
discuss the need to create better conditions for the return of
displaced people.
	   ``We talked about the need to improve access for humanitarian
shipments and the fact that we need conditions to be created so
these people can come home,'' Hill said at a news conference. ``We
are committed to improve those conditions as soon as possible.''
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which
the Europeans and Americans support.

ASDA welcomes IOC move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Sports Drug Agency
described the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) proposal for
a worldwide drug testing agency as a practical and logical step.
	   Olympic leaders announced the plans in Lausanne Thursday. The
IOC will set up a special agency to coordinate random drug-testing
around the world.
	   ``A drug testing agency established by the IOC will ensure top
ranked athletes in Olympic sports are subjected to random
out-of-competition testing year round,'' ASDA chief executive
Natalie Howson said Friday.
	   ``A program of testing coordinated by one international body
will increase athletes' confidence in the commitment of sports
administrators to deterring athletes from using banned drugs.''
	   Howson said Australian athletes had consistently supported
ASDA's program but wanted to see more action taken overseas.
	   ``This is a very practical and logical step for the IOC to take
to increase the effectiveness of the international fight against
doping,'' Howson said.
	   Faced with an array of doping scandals in the last few months,
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the idea for the agency
would be put to international sports federations and Olympic chiefs
at a key doping conference next February.
	   The IOC presently carries out drug tests during the Olympic
Games but the responsibility for the more efficient
out-of-competition tests is in the hands of international
federations and national bodies.
	   Australia's IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said he
hoped the proposed worldwide drug testing agency would be in
operation before the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   ``It will give an extra bite against doping,'' said Gosper.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty
U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum Friday and pulled down the
American flag to protest a U.S. missile attack on a factory in the
Sudanese capital.
	   Sudanese government officials termed the attack ``a criminal
act'' and charged that President Clinton had ordered it to distract
attention from his troubles in the Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir warned that Sudan ``reserves the right
to respond to the American attack using all necessary measures,''
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
	   In New York, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, Elfatih
Erwa, said his country would act ``within the civilized
international law.''
	   Sudanese officials said at least seven workers at the factory
were injured in the Thursday night attack and that some workers
still were unaccounted for and could be beneath the rubble.

Viagra manufacturer opens health center for advice on impotence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pfizer, the manufacturer of the drug
Viagra, has opened a health center in Bangkok to educate men on the
causes and cures of impotence and other health problems, the
company said Friday.
	   Thailand became the first Asian country to approve the sale of
Viagra earlier this week, although it can only be obtained through
a hospital after consultations with specialists.
	   Pfizer representatives said that the company conducted a study
in Thailand that showed most men don't understand the causes of
impotence.
	   They said the study showed most Thais believe psychological
problems or stress was the leading cause when in fact it is most
often a physical problem, the company said.
	   A team of Thai doctors is overseeing the center, the company
said.

Government paper calls for Suu Kyi deportation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS government comments in grafs 13-15 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A state-run newspaper said opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi should be expelled from Myanmar and her
National League for Democracy banned, as the military refused to
meet the party's demand to convene parliament.
	   ``The NLD led by (Suu Kyi) has broken many existing laws,
therefore the NLD should be declared illegal and she should be
deported,'' the Friday commentary in the state-run Mirror Daily
said.
	   ``Only after she is deported can the government continue with
its nation-building task, the people can go about their business
peacefully and the price of consumer goods can come down,'' it
said.
	   The NLD, of which Suu Kyi is general secretary, had set Aug. 21
as the deadline for the military government to allow a parliament
elected in 1990 to meet. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the
assembly. The military did not honor the result.
	   Various Myanmar ethnic groups, pro-democracy activists in exile
and Western governments have called on the military to heed the
NLD's demand.
	   As the deadline passed, Suu Kyi spent the day in her van parked
on a bridge outside Yangon, the tenth day of her protest over her
right to travel freely outside the capital.
	   The authorities stopped her last Wednesday 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of Yangon for the fourth time in two months as she
tried to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.
	   Her food was running low and she was becoming ill, NLD leaders
said. She has offered to end the impasse and return to Yangon if
the government releases members of her party imprisoned since May
27.
	   Tin Oo, vice chairman of the NLD, said there were about 97 party
members who had been jailed since that time. May 27 was the
anniversary of the 1990 election and a spate of arrests took place
after the NLD set a deadline for the government to honor the
result.
	   Forty two NLD members elected to parliament are in prison along
with hundreds more party members arrested over the years.
	   Tin Oo said releasing the prisoners in exchange for ending Suu
Kyi's protest was raised by NLD Chairman Aung Shwe during a rare
meeting Wednesday with Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the four most
powerful generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   ``That would be a positive step. If they are sincere, then they
could release them,'' Tin Oo said, while not commenting on Khin
Nyunt's response.
	   The streets of Yangon were quiet as the deadline for convening
parliament passed.
	   ``It's business as usual. There's no extra security
precautions,'' said a government spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said ``Myanmar and her citizens at this stage of development
cannot afford to have the basic universal human rights overshadowed
and sidetracked by other excessive individual rights.''
	   Meanwhile, more than a hundred Myanmar students protested
outside the country's embassy in Bangkok, and said 30 of them would
begin a hunger strike on Saturday until the military convened
parliament.
	   ``The military government yesterday issued a statement saying
the country lacks a constitution to allow the parliament to
convene. But Burma has the 1947 Constitution, which is the only
democratic constitution,'' said Zaw Wint, a student spokesman.
	   The military abrogated the 1947 charter when Gen. Ne Win seized
control of the country from the democratically-elected government
in 1962. The military has ruled Myanmar ever since.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers will launch
ticket sales for the 2000 Olympics on Wednesday, SOCOG president
Michael Knight said Friday.
	   SOCOG received the all clear to announce its ticket pricing
following an International Olympic Committee meeting in Lausanne on
Thursday.
	   ``SOCOG is anxious to proceed with its launch and it will,''
said IOC marketing director Michael Payne.
	   IOC officials had recently balked at high ticket prices proposed
by SOCOG, but Knight expected a good public response when the
prices were announced Wednesday.
	   ``I think when you see all of the things that will be released
next week people will be pretty happy,'' Knight said. ``I'm
certainly very pleased.''
	   The most expensive tickets, the best seats at the Sept. 15
opening ceremony, are expected to cost more than U.S. dlrs 1,000.
SOCOG sources say 10,000 seats to the opening ceremony will be
available for about U.S. dlrs 60. Tickets to the less-popular
sports will be sold for as little as U.S. dlrs 6.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty
U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum Friday and pulled down the
American flag to protest a U.S. missile attack on a factory in the
Sudanese capital.
	   Sudanese government officials termed the attack ``a criminal
act'' and charged that President Clinton had ordered it to distract
attention from his troubles in the Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir warned that Sudan ``reserves the right
to respond to the American attack using all necessary measures,''
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
	   In New York, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, Elfatih
Erwa, said his country would act ``within the civilized
international law.''
	   Sudanese officials said at least seven workers at the factory
were injured in the Thursday night attack and that some workers
still were unaccounted for and could be beneath the rubble.

France urging negotiations to begin as fighting continues

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ France has warned that military
intervention may be the only way to stop the fighting in Kosovo
province if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire and peace
talks soon.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fresh fighting
Thursday in the Serb province between government forces and the
Kosovo Liberation Army, despite Serb success in driving the
secessionist rebels from most of their strongholds.
	   Eight days ago, the leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova,
announced a five-member team to negotiate the future of the
province with the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Face-to-face talks have not taken place, despite Serb offers to
start them immediately. The Albanians have demanded an end to the
government offensive against the KLA and measures to guarantee the
safe return of the estimated 230,000 people who have fled their
homes since the crackdown began Feb. 28.
	   In a telephone call Thursday to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
French President Jacques Chirac said that unless fighting stops and
peace talks begin soon, military action ``will become difficult to
avoid.''
	   Aides said Chirac was especially concerned about the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Kosovo. U.N. and European
officials have warned that unless the refugees can return in time
to harvest crops in the next few weeks, the province could face
severe food shortages this winter.
	   In Belgrade, a spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist party, Ivica
Dacic, said the government was ready for serious negotiations on
autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo.
	   ``We expect the international community to persuade the
delegation of Kosovo Albanians to continue talks,'' Dacic said.
``It is obvious that talks are not in the interest of all those who
think that the Kosovo problem can be solved by arms, threats or
further pressure.
	   He said that warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo
were ``sensationalistic lies'' aimed at obscuring the real problem,
which he said were ``separatism and terrorism - the evil which
hurts both Albanians and Serbs and all others in Kosovo.''
	   On Thursday, the Serb Media Center said ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste, near
the town of Orahovac, wounding one policemen.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes that began
Wednesday night near Orahovac and Suva Reka.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Thursday with
Nikola Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, to
discuss the need to create better conditions for the return of
displaced people.
	   ``We talked about the need to improve access for humanitarian
shipments and the fact that we need conditions to be created so
these people can come home,'' Hill said at a news conference. ``We
are committed to improve those conditions as soon as possible.''
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which
the Europeans and Americans support.

Kiriyenko faces hostile Duma, Communists call for government's
</HEADLINE>
ouster &QL;

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Friday defended
devaluation of the ruble before a hostile parliament, dominated by
Communists and other hardliners who reiterated their call for the
government's ouster.
	   ``We can't afford the luxury of being a popular government,''
Kiriyenko said in a 10-minute speech before the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, which convened an emergency session to
discuss the crisis.
	   Kiriyenko accused the Duma of dragging its feet on approving a
series of government-proposed steps to boost revenues and said the
lawmakers' indecision precipitated the latest financial crisis.
	   ``Let's honestly recognize that there is no political force in
the country that is ready to undertake political responsibility for
the economy in crisis,'' he said, drawing angry shouts from the
Communists and their allies.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who took the floor shortly
afterward, assailed the government, saying it had ``put the country
on the verge of a precipice.''
	   ``Russia has devalued itself to the point where a single
multibillionaire can buy it,'' he said. ``This is the full collapse
of the course carried out in the past seven years.''
	   Zyuganov repeated his long-time call for Yeltsin to step down
and proposed a vote of no-confidence in Kiriyenko's cabinet.
	   Even the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction joined
attacks against the government. Its leader, Alexander Shokhin, said
the government's latest moves proved its course was wrong and also
called on Kiriyenko to step down. The premier greeted the call with
a dismissive smile.
	   The government has long asked the Duma to meet and consider a
package of austerity measures aimed at boosting revenues, but
lawmakers have resisted. They convened Friday's emergency session
in response to the government's announcement Monday of a
devaluation of the ruble of up to 34 percent against the U.S.
dollar, along with other emergency moves.
	   Kiriyenko described the devaluation and suspension of the debt
owed on treasury bills as the only way to pay months-long wage and
pension debts to millions of Russians nationwide.
	   ``We had the choice whom to pay _ banks, investors or state
workers, and the decision was obvious: we should pay wages and
pensions first,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   He dismissed accusations that the government had failed to warn
the nation about the devaluation.
	   ``Only a fool or provocateur can shout `fire' when he sees a
smoke on a ship filled with people,'' Kiriyenko said. ``Fire must
be extinguished in silence, otherwise there will be panic that
would make things worse for everyone.''
	   He reiterated the call for parliament to approve the
government's austerity steps, saying they are needed to stabilize
the economy. ``Investments won't come to a country where branches
of government are constantly in discord,'' he said.
	   Lawmakers weren't expected to tackle any of the government bills
on Friday. Instead, hardliners suggested the Duma vote for a
non-binding resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign.

Thai central bank governor won't name politicians in scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor has
refused to divulge the names of politicians involved in a bad loan
scandal at a commercial bank, local papers reported Friday.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul has come under increasing pressure in
recent days to disclose the names of politicians who borrowed huge
sums of money from the Bangkok Bank of Commerce and failed to
repay, leaving it bad debts of approaching dlrs 3 billion.
	   The government was forced to take over the bank in 1996. Under
the financial reform package unveiled last week by Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, BBC will be merged with another bank,
causing hundreds of employees to lose their jobs.
	   About 500 employees have been staging a protest in front of
parliament.
	   ``It's a curse that I have to be in this job,'' The Nation
newspaper quoted Chatu Mongkol as saying during an angry exchange
with reporters over whether he would reveal the names.
	   He insisted it was not the central bank's job or responsibility
to disclose the names, while saying the bank would pursue legal
action against those involved in the scandal.
	   ``Let publicizing the list be a political decision,'' he said.
	   Most politicians believed to be involved in the scandal are not
from the current government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but
were in the two previous coalition governments.

China, South Korea agree to more military exchanges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A top Chinese army leader met with
South Korean officials Friday and agreed to unspecified military
exchanges between the two former adversaries, the Defense Ministry
said.
	   The agreement came in a meeting between Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai,
deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and
Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and his deputy, Ahn Byung-kil, it
said.
	   Ministry officials refused to elaborate on details of the
exchanges.
	   Xiong was the highest Chinese military office to visit South
Korea since Seoul established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1992.
	   Despite its growing economic relations with Seoul, China has
been cautious about expanding military exchanges with South Korea,
against which it fought in the 1950-53 Korean War. China is North
Korea's only major remaining ally.
	   Xiong led a Chinese military delegation on a goodwill visit to
North Korea early this month.
	   Xiong arrived here Thursday on a two-day visit. He visited a
South Korean special forces unit and a Samsung Electronics Co.
factory outside Seoul.

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas have ambushed an
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, killing two, officials said
Friday.
	   Guerrillas set off a remote-controlled roadside bomb Thursday
night as an Israeli army patrol was heading to the Crusader-built
Beaufort castle in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   They said the blast killed two Israeli soldiers.
	   In Israel, however, the military said that one soldier and a
civilian employed by a contractor working for the army were killed
in the blast.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Security was tightened Friday on the
final day of a NATO military exercise following U.S. missile
attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials canceled a media visit to the USS La Salle, one
of the ships taking part in the five-day ``Cooperative Assembly
1998'' exercise, which began Monday.
	   Albanian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited
security and said the warship was still in Albanian waters but had
sailed from the port of Durres, 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of
here.
	   The exercise, involving 1,700 troops from the United States,
Russia and 12 other countries, was aimed at sending a signal to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that the Alliance was capable
of moving to halt the fighting in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Ethnic Albanians there are fighting for independence from
Serbia, the largest of the two republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   But the exercise has been dogged by the threat of terrorism
which heightened following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 257 people were killed
and 5,000 injured.
	   The day before the explosions, an Arabic-language newspaper
published a letter purportedly from Islamic Jihad threatening
reprisals against the United States for its role in the arrest of
some of the organization's members in Albania.
	   Albanian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Albanian secret police and the CIA have launched a nationwide
manhunt here for others suspected of involvement in terror attacks
in Egypt, including the November massacre of 63 people, mostly
tourists, in Luxor.
	   On Sunday, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines secured the American
diplomatic compound here after U.S. officials said they received
credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S. Embassy here.
	   Albania, a former hardline Communist state, has been in turmoil
since riots erupted across the country last year following the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes which bankrupted thousands
of people.
	   The government claims the former administration of Sali Berisha
had allowed thousands of foreigners, some of them Islamic
extremists and criminals, to enter the country in a bid for support
from Muslims worldwide.
	   About 60 percent of Albania's 3 million people are nominally
Muslim.

Exotic beetle trade in Japan bugs quarantine authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese quarantine authorities say the country
faces a growing threat from abroad: bootlegged beetles.
	   Capitalizing on Japan's traditional fascination with the bugs,
exotic _ and pricy _ foreign beetles are being marketed over the
Internet in a trade which flouts the country's strict quarantine
laws.
	   Authorities worry an influx of banned bugs from Southeast Asia
and other tropical climes could wreak havoc on domestic crops if
they escape captivity and breed.
	   Only three beetle species can be imported under current law.
	   ``We've seen an increase in the number of people trying to bring
them in,'' Tero Sato, a quarantine department official at Tokyo's
main international airport, said Friday.
	   Keeping beetles as pets has long been a popular summer pastime
for Japanese children. But bug-keeping has also become popular
among adult collectors, many of whom appear to prize types of
beetles not native to Japan.
	   The many-legged visitors from overseas don't come cheap,
however.
	   One beetle dealer which operates an Internet web page site
entitled ``Beetle-Maniac World'' offers 64-millimeter long (3-inch)
beetles from Laos for 11,000 yen (dlrs 77). The site also
advertises 75-millimeter (2.56-inch) Taiwanese beetles for up to
80,000 yen (dlrs 560).
	   Earlier this decade, Japan increased penalties for illegal
importation of banned beetles to a fine of up to one million yen
(dlrs 7,000) and a three-year jail term.

Yeltsin condemns U.S. attacks; says failure to inform was
</HEADLINE>
`indecent' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin expressed
indignation Friday over American attacks on alleged terrorist sites
in Sudan and Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am outraged and condemn'' the U.S. action, Yeltsin said upon
arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to attend
naval exercises in the Barents Sea, Interfax reported.
	   ``They should have conducted negotiations through to the end,
involving all nations, every one who can take part. They haven't
done that. I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and
that means the whole world was unaware of that. This is even more
indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United
States are in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he added. ``We have coordinated
and, without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on
the issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   However, he added that Yeltsin was outraged about not being
informed. Russian news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from
Clinton after the attack containing a detailed explanation of the
U.S. motivation.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the attacks.

Palestinians: U.S. air strikes undermine Mideast stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority on Friday condemned
the U.S. air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan, saying the
attacks would bring more turmoil to the Middle East.
	   ``I believe that this act will bring the world back to the rule
of the jungle,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Cabinet. ``As Palestinians we know what it means to
have solutions imposed by the use of force.''
	   The U.S. air strikes, which were aimed at Islamic militants
linked to the U.S. embassy bombings in eastern Africa earlier this
month, placed the Palestinian leadership in a difficult position.
	   The Palestinian Authority itself is being challenged by the
powerful Islamic militant group Hamas, and Yasser Arafat does not
want to be overly critical of Washington at a time when he needs
the Clinton administration's help in negotiating an Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   On the other hand, the bombings have triggered angry reactions
throughout the Arab and Muslim world and the Palestinians do not
want to be seen as stepping out of the consensus.
	   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said he was
concerned the U.S. air strike would lead to more violence, such as
retaliatory attacks by Islamic militants. ``We believe that such
actions would open the door to reactions,'' Asfour said.
	   In Israel, the U.S. strikes were welcomed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Mordechai congratulated Clinton on his ``courageous activity
against terrorist targets, wherever they may be'' and that the war
against terrorism was vital.

Japan's leaders intensify efforts to save troubled bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with LTCB's closing stock price, details throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials are stepping up efforts to save
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, readying an infusion of public
funds and urging another leading bank to speed up a planned merger
with the ailing lender.
	   The government will use public money to help LTCB clean up its
bad loans, Japan's leading financial daily, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported Friday.
	   To head off any opposition to a public bailout, the bank will
undertake a stringent restructuring plan and its top executives
will step down, the paper reported, citing LTCB sources.
	   The bank will close all its overseas operations, accelerate a
planned reduction in its workforce and sell its glitzy headquarters
building in central Tokyo to raise cash, the report said.
	   The company declined to comment on the report.
	   LTCB is one of Japan's biggest lenders and larger than all but a
handful of U.S. banks.
	   How Japan deals with the bank's problems is seen as a crucial
test of its ability to revive its debt-ridden banking system and
stop problems there from dragging down the whole economy.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took the unusual step of calling the
president of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Atsushi Takahashi, to
his residence late Thursday to ask him to move quickly on a
proposed merger between his bank and LTCB.
	   Sumitomo was reportedly reluctant to go ahead with the tie-up,
announced in June, because of concerns about the level of bad loans
at LTCB.
	   Obuchi and Takahashi discussed ways the government might support
the merger, Obuchi told an upper house budget committee Friday
morning.
	   Japanese newspapers said the government has decided to inject
500 billion yen (dlrs 3.5 billion) to 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7
billion) of public money into LTCB to help it dispose of bad loans
and make it more attractive to Sumitomo.
	   The Bank of Japan was also preparing special loans to the bank
to help it through any funding problems, a bank official told Dow
Jones newswire Thursday on condition of anonymity.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank has denied it faces failure. But
rumors the bank might collapse under the weight of its bad loans
had driven its share price to a historic low. Analysts said it
would be difficul for the bank to remain afloat on its own with
investor confidence so weak.
	   Unlike conventional banks, LTCB raises money by issuing bonds.
Analysts worry that could become difficult as investors
increasingly view the bonds as a risky investment.
	   News of the restructuring efforts boosted LTCB shares 18 yen, or
32.14 percent, to 74 yen in Friday's trading.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas have ambushed an
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon killing two, officials said
Friday.
	   Guerrillas set off a remote-controlled roadside bomb Thursday
night as an Israeli army patrol was heading to the Crusader-built
Beaufort castle in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   They said the blast killed two Israeli soldiers.
	   In Israel, however, the military said that one soldier and a
civilian employed by a contractor working for the army were killed
in the blast.

Slums, street children increase in Indonesia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deepening poverty brought on by
Indonesia's economic collapse has forced thousands of children to
work on the streets and hastened the growth of slums.
	   ``All of us know the expansion (of slums) is caused by the
economic crisis,'' said Jakarta Gov. Sutiyoso, as quoted by the
Jakarta Post newspaper.
	   Indonesia's current recession, the worst in 32 years, is
expected to shrink the national economy by 15 percent and dump at
least 50 million people into the ranks of the poor by the end of
1998, government statistic show.
	   Visible signs of the collapse can now be seen on the streets of
Jakarta _ both in the rising number of street children and growth
of overcrowded and dirty housing, the Post reported.
	   The total number of slum districts, marked by makeshift houses,
squatters and lack of clean water or sewage has risen by five times
since 1993, said a government demographer, Rusmandesiar.
	   Slums will only spread as poverty increases, he said.
	   Ami Poerwanto, head of the city office of social services, said
thousands of children had turned to polishing shoes, selling
newspapers, begging and busking to earn a living.
	   ``Some do so for financial reasons, and some have no major
reason at all,'' she said.
	   Government data collected from 25 shelters around Jakarta showed
a 15 percent rise in the number of street children.
	   Sutiyoso said he still had no clear plan on how to cope with the
problem, the Jakarta Post reported.

Tokyo stock prices slip, dollar edges higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and dollar rates;
Okura and Co. in 4th graf and Sumitmomo Trust and Banking in 7th
graf take ampersands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell moderately on Friday as Japan's
third-largest corporate failure this year raised fears about the
health of the economy. The dollar was slightly higher against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 93.21 points,
or 0.61 percent, to close at 15,298.20 points. On Thursday, the
average fell 14.93 points, or 0.10 percent.
	   Stocks started lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street
and news that medium-sized Japanese trading firm Okura and Co.
would file for bankruptcy.
	   Okura said failed investments in real estate during the 1980s
speculative ``bubble'' era and sagging earnings had left it with
debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion).
	   The dollar bought 142.94 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.39
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York
rate of 143.19 yen overnight.
	   The stock market's slide was partly stemmed by reports the
government is preparing to support a merger between Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Trust and Banking with an
infusion of public money.
	   LTCB shares soared 18 yen, or 32 percent, to 74 yen and were the
most actively traded on the exchange Friday. Last week the price
sank to a record low of 37 yen.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange slipped 5.16 points, or 0.44 percent,
to 1,176.51. The TOPIX closed down 2.04 points, or 0.17 percent,
the day before.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 358
million shares, little changed from 360 million shares Thursday.
Declines outnumbered advances 672 to 396, while 187 issues were
unchanged.
	   The U.S. dollar rose as high as 143.50 yen in early Tokyo
trading Friday on news of U.S. air strikes against suspected
terrorist targets.
	   But lingering speculation that Japan would intervene in currency
markets to support the yen, weighed on the dollar, traders said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he ordered
missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major
sponsor of terrorism.
	   The attacks were in response to the August 7 bombings at the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500.
	   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.180 percent from
1.190 percent Thursday, driving its price up to 111.87 yen from
111.80 yen.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum Friday and pulled down the American
flag to protest the attack.

Prime minister orders action to solve `millennium bug'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing criticism Japan has moved too slowly in
dealing with the ``millennium bug'' computer problem, Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said Friday he has ordered government
agencies to submit solutions by the middle of next month.
	   Critics say Japan has fallen behind other industrialized
countries in addressing the problem, which may cause computers to
malfunction if they are not reprogrammed to recognize dates after
2000.
	   Obuchi said the government will ask experts to advise on how to
reprogram computers in time for the end of 1999, especially those
with critical social functions, such as controlling financial
markets or nuclear power plants.
	   ``With less than 500 days to the year 2000, both government and
the private sector need to take all possible measures to deal with
the problem,'' Obuchi said.
	   A Japanese government report released in April found that of 395
essential computer systems used by public agencies, 141 _ or 36
percent _ won't complete the modification and test runs until
sometime in 1999, perilously close to the deadline.

<TEXT>
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada, reached by telephone at
the Taliban's headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said
21 people were killed and another 30 were injured when cruise
missiles exploded on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base near Khost, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
	   U.S. officials said the attack was meant to disrupt the
infrastructure of a guerilla organization run by Osama bin Laden,
an anti-American Islamic militant who has been blamed for bombing
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   ``It is such a callous act,'' Akhumzada said. ``They have no
proof of terrorism committed by bin Laden or the Taliban. If they
were going to take such action, they should have contacted us
first.''
	   Akhumzada also said missiles hit targets near Jalalabad, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul. The deputy governor of the
region had said three people were killed in the Jalalabad attack.
U.S. defense officials had said only the Al-Badr base was targeted,
and six sites were hit on the sprawling complex.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the sketchy reports.
	   The Pakistani news agency NNI, quoting the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen
group, said five of its Pakistani members were killed at the camp
near Khost. They appeared to be among Akhumzada's total.
Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, formally known as
Harkat-ul-Ansar, was included last year on the U.S. State
Department's list of terrorist groups for its support of an
insurrection by militant Muslims in Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Indian-held Kashmir is the only predominately Muslim state in
majority-Hindu India, and Indian officials have accused the
government in neighboring, Islamic Pakistan of supporting groups
like Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Pakistan denies the charges, saying it
provides only moral and political support to what it calls the
legitimate aspirations of Kashmiris.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the attacks on sites in
Sudan as well as Afghanistan Thursday night, saying he had
established links between the targets and those responsible for the
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed a total
of 257 Aug. 7.
	   Clinton said the facilities attacked were linked to bin Laden, a
Saudi millionaire he called the ``preeminent organizer and
financier of international terrorism in the world today.''
	   Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had said Thursday that bin Laden
``was safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions.''
Mullah Abdullah, a spokesman reached at Taliban headquarters in the
southern city of Kandahar, did not say where bin Laden was, or
whether he had been at the targeted sites at the time of the
attacks. The government also had no reaction to the U.S. ofF on his bases, the United States had
warned non-Muslim foreign aid workers to leave Afghanistan, saying
they had learned of ``credible threats'' against them. The U.S.
Embassy spokesman in neighboring Pakistan had refused to elaborate
on the threats.
	   Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
evacuation a day earlier of all but essential embassy staff in
neighboring Pakistan. The attacks could spark angry, potentially
violent reactions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   About 100 protesters shouting ``long live Osama! Americans _
dogs!'' paraded peacefully before an embassy-run American cultural
center in downtown Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. They dispersed
after about an hour.
	   Although the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal
minority in the officially Islamic country paints the United States
as an enemy of Islam. The Pakistani government is likely to face
domestic political pressure if it is learned that it facilitated an
attack on bin Laden.

Indonesia to close three insolvent banks: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government will close
three banks Friday in a bid to reassure international investors
that it's serious about cleaning up its beleaguered banking system
and stamping out corruption, a news report said.
	   The government will close PT Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia, PT
Modern Bank and PT Bank Umum Nasional, Dow Jones Newswires quoted
government sources as saying.
	   The government will also take over control of PT Bank Danamon,
the sources, who asked not to be named, said.
	   The fate of PT Bank PDFCI and PT Bank Tiara Asia _ two other
banks now under the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency _ was
unclear, although the sources said they won't be closed.
	   PT Bank Central Asia, Indonesia's largest private bank, will, as
expected, survive the sweep, the sources said.
	   The bank is controlled by the family of billionaire Liem Sioe
Liong, with two of former president Suharto's children holding
minority stakes.
	   It remained unclear how the bank would be recapitalized.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in
decades as Asia's financial meltdown continues.
	   The government is under international pressure to show it's
serious about cleaning up corruption in the banking system and
restoring consumer confidence in banks.
	   Many banks have been wound up or placed under state supervision
over the past year.
	   Indonesian police this week said they have arrested five
executives of nine liquidated banks and identified 24 others as
suspects in a corruption and embezzlement investigation.
	   Reform of the ailing banking sector is a major part of a
multi-billion dollar economic bailout for Indonesia put together by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   President B.J. Habibie has also promised to stamp down on
corruption as part of a drive to restore economic confidence.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum Friday and pulled down the American
flag to protest the attack.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen seriously injured
two U.N. workers in the Afghan capital of Kabul Friday, a day after
a U.S. missile attack on a suspected Islamic militant base that the
country's Taliban rulers said killed 21 people.
	   The United Nations confirmed the two men, one French and one
Italian, were shot as they drove in Kabul. No other details were
available, and it was not immediately clear if the attack was
related to the U.S. missile strikes on eastern Afghanistan
Thursday.
	   Foreigners had been advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan.
Kabul was reported calm and tense Friday. Its residents will gather
later in the day for prayers on the Muslim holy day, and protests
could be sparked by fiery sermons.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada, reached by telephone at
the Taliban's headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said
21 people were killed and another 30 were injured when cruise
missiles exploded on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base near Khost, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
	   U.S. officials said the attack was meant to disrupt the
infrastructure of a guerrilla organization run by Osama bin Laden,
an anti-American Islamic militant who has been blamed for bombing
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, killing a total of
257 people.
	   The U.S. retaliation ``is such a callous act,'' Akhumzada said.
``They have no proof of terrorism committed by bin Laden or the
Taliban. If they were going to take such action, they should have
contacted us first.''
	   Akhumzada also said missiles hit targets near Jalalabad, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul. The deputy governor of the
region had said three people were killed in the Jalalabad attack.
But U.S. defense officials had said only the Al-Badr base was
targeted, and six sites were hit on the sprawling complex.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the sketchy reports.
	   The Pakistani news agency NNI, quoting the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen
group, said five of its Pakistani members were killed at the camp
near Khost. They appeared to be among Akhumzada's total.
Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, formally known as
Harkat-ul-Ansar, was included last year on the U.S. State
Department's list of terrorist groups for its support of an
insurrection by militant Muslims in Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Indian-held Kashmir is the only predominately Muslim state in
majority-Hindu India, and Indian officials have accused the
government in neighboring, Islamic Pakistan of supporting groups
like Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Pakistan denies the charges, saying it
provides only moral and political support to what it calls the
legitimate aspirations of Kashmiris.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the attacks on sites in
Sudan as well as Afghanistan Thursday night, saying he had
established links between the bin Laden targets and embassy
bombings.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had said Thursday that bin Laden
``was safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions.''
Mullah Abdullah, a spokesman reached at Taliban headquarters in the
southern city of Kandahar, did not say where bin Laden was, or
whether he had been at the sites at the time of the attacks.
	   Bin Laden, son of a wealthy Saudi construction magnate, is
believed to have used his fortune to run the camps. He has been
living in Afghanistan with the permission of the Taliban, a
hard-line Islamic group that controls most of the country.
	   A day before the attacks on his bases, the United States had
warned non-Muslim foreign aid workers to leave Afghanistan, saying
they had learned of ``credible threats'' against them. The U.S.
Embassy spokesman in neighboring Pakistan had refused to elaborate
on the threats.
	   Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
evacuation a day earlier of all but essential embassy staff in
neighboring Pakistan. The attacks could spark angry, potentially
violent reactions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   About 100 protesters shouting ``long live Osama! Americans _
dogs!'' paraded peacefully before an embassy-run American cultural
center in downtown Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. They dispersed
after about an hour.
	   Although the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal
minority in the officially Islamic country paints the United States
as an enemy of Islam. The Pakistani government is likely to face
domestic political pressure if it is learned that it facilitated an
attack on bin Laden.

African anger over meddling in Congo raises specter of larger war
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Last time around, most African
leaders simply winked and called the fight against Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko an internal rebellion _ despite widespread
knowledge that Rwanda and Uganda were supporting the Congolese
rebels.
	   Mobutu, after all, was an embarrassing Cold War anachronism, a
man whose corrupt rule had turned Africa's third-largest country
into an economic and political wasteland. If the rebels needed help
to get rid of him _ including soldiers, armament, air support and
strategic guidance _ accepting such outside meddling was the price
that had to be paid.
	   But now, former rebel leader Laurent Kabila is the president of
the country he renamed Congo, and he faces a rebellion by soldiers
apparently supported by his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda.
	   This time around there is no winking. And the rebellion against
Kabila, which he paints as an invasion by his former allies, is
threatening to flare into something bigger.
	   Shifting alliances, security problems along volatile borders,
greed for mineral resources and a complex web of rebel movements
are fueling fears of a wider war across central Africa.
	   The two former Congolese allies deny involvement, but diplomats
and witnesses say there is little doubt they have provided military
guidance, men and supplies to the rebels, a coalition of ethnic
Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of
Kabila's military.
	   In response, Kabila _ a clumsy diplomat who has made few close
allies during his 15 months in power _ has been offered support
from a number of African countries.
	   Angola has thrown its support behind Kabila, as have some
southern African nations who say Rwanda and Uganda's meddling must
be stopped.
	   Non-interference has traditionally been a major precept of
African diplomacy. In addition, Kabila has been quick to play on
long-held fears that the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government may be
trying to create a sort of trans-African Tutsi state, even though
Tutsis make up a small percentage of the few countries where they
live.
	   The Organization of African Unity has said it backs Kabila, and
``condemned all external intervention in the internal affairs'' of
Congo. The group urged the rebels to lay down their weapons.
	   The rebels' surprise announcement Wednesday that they were ready
to negotiate with Kabila has done little to calm the situation as
the rebels reportedly continued their advance on Kinshasa, the
Congolese capital.
	   But despite the widespread anger at Rwanda and Uganda, the
outside involvement in the Congolese rebellion has as much to do
with other African rebellions and regional power politics as it
does with issues inside Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda, for instance, helped install Kabila in part
to bring stability to eastern Congo, where rebels opposed to the
Rwandan and Ugandan governments are based. Kabila, however, proved
unable to stem the cross-border attacks from his country and
eventually lost the support of his former allies.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in Rwanda in attacks by
Hutu rebels since former Hutu soldiers and militiamen, responsible
for the 1994 genocide of at least 500,000 people in Rwanda, fled
the country ahead of Tutsi-led forces who stopped the killing.
	   Angola, for its part, is currently facing a resurgence of its
own rebellion, and reportedly backs Kabila because it fears a
possible marriage of Congolese rebels to its UNITA rebel movement.
	   As for Zimbabwe, which has promised to send soldiers to support
Kabila, many political analysts speculate that the basis for
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's support may be personal _ and
directed at South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Mugabe has long seen himself as Africa's elder statesman and is
believed to be furiously jealous of Mandela's fame. With his
political future in doubt at home, and with South Africa pushing
for a diplomatic solution in Congo, Mugabe could simply be using
the crisis to raise his own profile.
	   The question is, however, whether that involvement will stem the
tide of war _ or spur it to greater bloodshed.

Israel army seals Hebron after settler stabbed to death

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Jewish settlers, some
weeping and others shouting ``revenge,'' marched Friday in the
funeral procession of a 63-year-old rabbi who was stabbed to death
in his home by a Palestinian intruder.
	   The body of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, draped in a white cloth and
placed on a stretcher, was carried through the deserted streets of
downtown Hebron. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers enforced a curfew on
30,000 Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled sector of the city.
	   Raanan belonged to a dynasty of spiritual leaders of the Jewish
settlement movement, and there was concern that his brutal killing
could trigger revenge attacks.
	   Raanan was stabbed to death Thursday night in his bedroom in a
trailer in the heavily fortified Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, one
of several in the center of Hebron. After killing Raanan, the
assailant torched the mobile home on fire with a firebomb before
fleeing. The rabbi's wife suffered smoke inhalation.
	   During a mourning ceremony Friday morning, the rabbi's draped
body, lying on a stretcher, was placed under an oak tree in the
tiny playground of Tel Romeida. Hundreds of mourners squeezed into
the yard to listen to eulogies and say prayers.
	   Immigrant Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, who represented
the government, was repeatedly heckled and booed by settlers who
charged the government was not doing enough to protect them.
	   ``Liar, liar,'' some shouted as Edelstein promised the security
forces would do everything in their power to track down the
assailant who is believed to have fled into the Palestinian sector
of the city that is off-limits to Israeli soldiers.
	   After the ceremony, mourners walked through the downtown area to
the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine holy to both Muslims and Jews.
From their, they boarded buses for Raanan's burial in Jerusalem.
	   In an effort to find the assailant, the armed sealed off Hebron,
a town of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, Israel's army commander in the West
Bank, said ``nobody will leave or enter the city for the next few
days until we complete the investigation.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his vacation in
northern Israel and returned to Jerusalem in the wake of the
stabbing, his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said.
	   Settlers leaders called on the government to approve
construction of permanent housing for the settlers in Tel Romeida,
as a response to the killing and to end the process of handing over
territory to the Palestinians.
	   ``The government must stop the process of withdrawal which
threatens to bring a tragedy upon the Jewish people,'' said Noam
Arnon, a spokesman for the settlers in Hebron.
	   After the news of Raanan's killing spread Thursday night, two
Palestinians were beaten by a group of settlers and were treated
for bruises at a Hebron hospital.
	   Raanan was a grandson of the late Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen
Kook whose teachings inspired the Jewish settlement movement. Kook
said establishing settlements throughout the biblical Land of
Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was a religious
value and would bring the Jewish people closer to redemption.
	   Raanan was also a nephew of Israel's former Chief Rabbi Avraham
Shapira.

<TEXT>
	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin expressed
outrage Friday over American attacks on alleged terrorist sites in
Sudan and Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am indignant and I condemn these bombings,'' Yeltsin said
upon arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to
attend naval exercises in the Barents Sea, Interfax reported.
	   ``They should have conducted negotiations through to the end,
involving all nations, every one who can take part. They haven't
done that. I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and
that means the whole world was unaware of that. This is even more
indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying his reaction
was the same ``as to any act of terrorism.''
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United
States are in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he added. ``We have coordinated
and, without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on
the issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   He said Yeltsin's outrage was over not being informed. Russian
news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from Clinton after the
attack containing a detailed explanation of the U.S. motivation.
	   Yeltsin and Clinton are scheduled to hold a summit meeting in
Moscow on Sept. 1-3.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the attacks.
	   From Murmansk, Yeltsin went to the nearby port of Severomorsk,
where he boarded the newly built, nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great, the pride of the Northern Fleet. He was to spend
the day observing exercises involving approximately 50 surface
warships and other air and sea forces.

northern Israel and returned to Jerusalem in the wake of the
stabbing, his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said.
	   Settlers leaders called on the government to approve
construction of permanent housing for the settlers in Tel Romeida,
as a response to the killing and to end the process of handing over
territory to the Palestinians.
	   ``The government must stop the process of withdrawal which
threatens to bring a tragedy upon the Jewish people,'' said Noam
Arnon, a spokesman for the settlers in Hebron.
	   After the news of Raanan's killing spread Thursday night, two
Palestinians were beaten by a group of settlers and were treated
for bruises at a Hebron hospital.
	   Raanan was a grandson of the late Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen
Kook whose teachings inspired the Jewish settlement movement. Kook
said establishing settlements throughout the biblical Land of
Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was a religious
value and would bring the Jewish people closer to redemption.
	   Raanan was also a nephew of Israel's former Chief Rabbi Avraham
Shapira.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese trading company Okura and Co. filed for
bankruptcy Friday after bad real estate investments and sluggish
earnings left it with an insurmountable level of debt.
	   The failure of businesses entered during the 1980s ``bubble''
era of asset inflation, including real estate investment, left the
87-year-old company with debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.8
billion), Okura said in a statement.
	   Weak earnings were also a factor in the bankruptcy, the company
said.
	   Okura, which specialized in trading steel and machinery, said it
had failed to find a merger partner or to convince shareholders to
inject more capital into the business.
	   The latest failure comes as Japanese corporate bankruptcies are
rising at their fastest pace since the end of World War II, fueled
by recession and shrinking access to credit.
	   In terms of liabilities, Okura's bankruptcy is the third largest
in Japan this year, according to financial information provider
Teikoku Data Bank.
	   Fuji Bank Ltd., one of Okura's main lenders, said Friday that it
expected to be unable to collect about half of its 38 billion yen
(dlrs 266 million) in loans to Okura.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ To reduce cash-draining imports,
Malaysia will monitor major construction projects to make sure they
use as many local products as possible, a news report said.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will oversee
the monitoring plan, said the ministry's chief, Rafidah Aziz,
adding that the government had already agreed to the move.
	   Rafidah said the Housing and Local Government Ministry had made
it compulsory for the construction sector to use 60 percent local
products.
	   The plan reflects Malaysia's efforts to cut imports, the cost of
which have soared with the nearly 40 percent depreciation of the
country's currency, the ringgit, since last July.
	   Rafidah added that the ministry was willing to act as a
go-between for construction companies looking for local materials.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government will close
three banks Friday in a bid to reassure international investors
that it's serious about cleaning up its beleaguered banking system
and stamping out corruption, a news report said.
	   The government will close PT Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia, PT
Modern Bank and PT Bank Umum Nasional, Dow Jones Newswires quoted
government sources as saying.
	   The government will also take over control of PT Bank Danamon,
the sources, who asked not to be named, said.
	   The fate of PT Bank PDFCI and PT Bank Tiara Asia _ two other
banks now under the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency _ was
unclear, although the sources said they won't be closed.
	   PT Bank Central Asia, Indonesia's largest private bank, will, as
expected, survive the sweep, the sources said.
	   The bank is controlled by the family of billionaire Liem Sioe
Liong, with two of former president Suharto's children holding
minority stakes.
	   It remained unclear how the bank would be recapitalized.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in
decades as Asia's financial meltdown continues.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor has
refused to divulge the names of politicians involved in a bad loan
scandal at a commercial bank, local papers reported Friday.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul has come under increasing pressure in
recent days to disclose the names of politicians who borrowed huge
sums of money from the Bangkok Bank of Commerce and failed to
repay, leaving it bad debts of approaching dlrs 3 billion.
	   The government was forced to take over the bank in 1996. Under
the financial reform package unveiled last week by Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, BBC will be merged with another bank,
causing hundreds of employees to lose their jobs.
	   About 500 employees have been staging a protest in front of
parliament.
	   Chatu Mongkol said it was not the central bank's job or
responsibility to disclose the names, while saying the bank would
pursue legal action against those involved in the scandal.

Diana fund sends warning letters to 50 souvenir companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's memorial fund has threatened
legal action against companies worldwide producing unauthorized
souvenirs, the fund said Friday.
	   Lawyers for the fund, which is trying to control the trade in
Diana souvenirs and stop tacky products, have sent ``cease and
desist'' warning letters to more than 50 companies. Demand for
souvenirs is likely to grow around the first anniversary of her
death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash.
	   ``It is illegal to use the princess's name and image without
permission,'' said Jo Greensted, a fund spokeswoman. ``The warning
is to please cease and stop now. The next action is up to our
lawyers.''
	   The fund, set up days after Diana's death to accept donations
and channel the money into charities, is currently engaged in a
lawsuit in the United States with The Franklin Mint for producing a
Diana doll and other items which have not been approved by the
princess's estate.
	   The fund says it is also fighting for a British trademark of
Diana's image to prevent commercial exploitation. Approved products
bear the fund's trademark, Diana's signature.
	   Among the hundreds of ideas the fund has rejected on the grounds
of taste are: a toilet seat cover, a toilet brush, air freshener, a
bumper sticker reading ``Bye-bye Di,'' a car breakdown kit,
seatbelts and a colonic irrigation kit.
	   The only products approved by the fund so far are a
candleholder, stamps, a candle, the tribute compact disc, two
enamel boxes and a Beanie Bear toy called Princess.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday strongly
backed the U.S. attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan, saying that
terrorism requires ``resolute action by all countries.''
	   ``The German government therefore supports all measures that
help combat this scourge of the international community,'' Kohl
said in a statement.
	   ``This applies particularly to the attacks marshaled by the
United States against installations in Afghanistan and Sudan that
are being linked with the recent terrorist attacks against the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,'' he said.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also expressed unconditional
support for the U.S. attacks, and said he shared U.S. President
Clinton's view that this is ``not a conflict with Islam or
Afghanistan or Sudan, but with international terrorism alone.''
	   Kinkel said terrorism has been declared a threat to
international peace and security that should be denied any refuge
in at least 11 international conventions.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange slumped
Friday after two straight sessions of sharp gains.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 214.92 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at 7,527.61. On
Thursday, the index had gained 1.6 percent.
	   Turnover fell to 4.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 637
million), down from Thursday's 7.03 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 901 million).
	   Brokers atrributed the slump to profit-taking following recent
sharp gains in shares following government intervention to prop up
the market.
	   There were also rumors that the government had sold some stocks,
pocketing some profits in preparation for another battle with
speculators next week when the August index futures contract
expires.
	   Brokers said market sentiment was also damped by an overnight
decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell
81 points to 8,611.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 6 Hong Kong dollars to 165.00,
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.45 dollars to 22.35, Hutchison Whampoa
fell 90 cents to 38.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 30 cents to 40.40.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities.
	   The judgement was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who
is black, bringing and end to a trial that has highlighted South
Africa's still simmering racial divisions.
	   Botha, 82, could get up to two years in jail or an unspecified
fine on the conviction of ignoring the subpoena from South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Due to his age and frail
health, a fine is considered more likely.

	   Botha ignored a summons to appear before the commission which
wanted to quiz him on his role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet
that launched a violent crackdown on black liberation fighters in
the 1980s.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   About 30 supporters of the governing African National Congress
party demonstrated outside the courthouse Friday chanting, ``Send
him to jail, send him to jail.''
	   The demonstrators, standing beyond the razor wire surrounding
the courthouse, carried placards and a banner. ``We can forgive him
for the past. Send him to jail for his arrogance,'' read one.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989 when he
was ousted in internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   De Klerk later released President Nelson Mandela from jail and
began a process of reform that culminated in the all-race elections
of 1994 that ended white rule.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a small
coastal town located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness and
240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

France on U.S. strikes: terrorist bombings ``could not remain
</HEADLINE>
unanswered''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Friday said the United States was
justified in bombing sites linked to terrorists who allegedly
bombed two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
	   ``France expressed its indignation after the attacks carried out
in Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salam,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.
``Such acts must not remain unanswered and their plotters must be
taken out of commission.
	   ``In that regard, France takes note of the decision by American
authorities who proceeded with bombardments yesterday by invoking
the right to legitimate defense recognized by international law,''
the ministry said.
	   The U.S. air strikes on Thursday evening hit a suspected Islamic
militant base in Afghanistan and a factory in Khartoum, Sudan that
Washington said manufactured ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   ``France strongly condemns terrorism wherever it happens and in
whatever form,'' the statement said. ``The struggle against
terrorism, the support it benefits from, must mobilize the entire
international community. It is up to each country to mobilize the
means necessary in that struggle.''

U.S. Marine Hornet jet crashes, pilot killed

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A U.S. Marine died when his F/A-18
Hornet jet fighter crashed during a military exercise in the
Northern Territory, officials said Friday.
	   The Hornet crashed while taking part in Exercise Southern
Frontier, referred to by the U.S. military as ``spring training,''
involving about 60 U.S. Marines based in Japan.
	   An aerial and land response team located the wreckage near the
Delamere bombing range control facility southwest of Katherine on
Thursday night.
	   Maj. Tim Keefe of U.S. Marine Corps public affairs in Iwakuni,
Japan, named the pilot as Maj. Michel W. Kudsin, 32, of Roseville,
Michigan, a member of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 212.
	   Keefe said an investigation team from the Marine Corps had left
Japan morning and was expected to arrive in Australia later Friday.
	   Kudsin's body will be flown back to the United States in the
next few days. Keefe said he understood Kudsin was living at the
Iwakuni base in single men's quarters.
	   The response team was still at the crash site but there would be
no further reports until Saturday, U.S. Information Service
spokesman Don Washington said.
	   The McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18s have been in service since 1980
and the aircraft comes in four versions, used by the U.S. Marine
Corps and U.S. Navy.

Posh Spice is pregnant: tabloid report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Posh Spice Victoria Adams is three months
pregnant, the tabloid The Sun reported Friday.
	   Ms. Adams and her fiance, Manchester United soccer star David
Beckham, had not planned a baby so soon but are thrilled and will
get married after the birth, according to The Sun.
	   No one answered calls at the office of The Spice Girls'
spokesman, Alan Edwards.
	   Ms. Adams, 24, broke the news to the other three Spice Girls on
their current tour of America. The Sun said she had to tell them
because she kept getting morning sickness.
	   The other Spice Girls were stunned, but will carry on as a
group, The Sun said. Although Ms. Adams plans to take time off from
the Spice Girls' hectic schedule, she will not be leaving the band,
the paper said.
	   The fifth Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell, also known as Ginger
Spice, quit the band in June.

U.S. Embassy in Malaysia heightens security after missile strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With concrete ramparts fortifying
its compound, the U.S. Embassy remained on full alert Friday
against possible terrorist attacks after U.S. missile strikes in
Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``Our security posture remains heightened,'' said U.S. embassy
spokesman Chip Barclay from within the embassy compound, as several
officers from an elite Malaysian combat unit stood guard outside
the heavy iron gates.
	   ``Security here is an ongoing process and many measures are in
place,'' Barclay said, adding public access to the embassy compound
was ``limited.''
	   Embassies worldwide have taken safety precautions after U.S.
ships late Thursday fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at a suspected
chemical weapons plant in Sudan and a terrorist training complex in
eastern Afghanistan.
	   Some U.S. airports tightened security immediately, and senior
U.S. intelligence officials have warned the prospect of retaliation
against Americans overseas was ``very, very high.''
	   The State Department urged U.S. citizens traveling or residing
abroad to remain alert and exercise greater caution.
	   On Friday, the embassy here issued a State Department bulletin
cautioning U.S. citizens living in Malaysia to watch out for
suspicious vehicles, parcel bombs and to drive with their windows
up and doors locked.
	   Heightened precautions had already been taken at the U.S.
Embassy here following the car-bomb explosions at missions in Kenya
and Tanzania, which killed at least 250 people and injured more
than 5,000.
	   Nine days ago, the embassy hastily paid off and shut down a gas
station next to the compound to prevent any attempts by terrorists
to use it as a bombing base.
	   ``I think they have to be cautious,'' said Rustam Sani, a
widely-read newspaper columnist and social critic. ``Muslims from
all parts of the world have traditionally moved in and out of this
country without causing too much attention.''
	   He warned that such people could use the Southeast Asian nation,
where about 60 percent of the population is Muslim, as ``an ideal
launching pad'' for terrorist acts.
	   ``African Muslims wearing turbans, caps or gowns moving around
this country would hardly be noticed. I'm not saying such violence
will happen,'' he added. ``But given the religious make-up of the
country, it's possible.''

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities.
	   The judgment was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is
black, bringing and end to a trial that has highlighted South
Africa's still simmering racial divisions.
	   Botha, 82, could get up to two years in jail or an unspecified
fine on the conviction of ignoring the subpoena from South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Due to his age and frail
health, a fine is considered more likely.
	   After a brief recess, the trial resumed to allow the defense to
present any mitigating circumstances before the magistrate passes
sentence.
	   Botha ignored a summons to appear before the commission which
wanted to quiz him on his role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet
that launched a violent crackdown on black liberation fighters in
the 1980s.
	   ``The failure of the accused to appear ... was unlawful,
intentional and without sufficient cause,'' the magistrate said in
his ruling, which took 50 minutes to read.
	   Lugaju also dismissed the argument from defense attorneys that
the subpoena was technically flawed. The magistrate said Botha, if
he felt the summons was flawed, had a duty to appeal against the
subpoena or to take the matter up with the commission. He could
not, the magistrate said, simply ignore the summons.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   However, the magistrate dismissed claims the commission was
prejudiced against Botha and noted that every political party at
one time or another had attacked the commission. Lugaju said the
panel had treated Botha with great respect.
	   ``On the evidence the accused was treated with the utmost
courtesy by the commission, said the magistrate. ``The commission
went to great lengths to assist the accused and meet his
requirements.''
	   Lugaju also ruled that no agreement existed that allowed Botha
to submit written answers instead of appearing before the
commission.
	   Botha had claimed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairman of the
commission, had agreed that if Botha submitted written answers he
would not have to appear.
	   Tutu, in his testimony, denied such an agreement existed and the
judge ruled the defense had not presented any evidence to
contradict Tutu's testimony.
	   ``The evidence introduced by the state remains uncontested,''
the magistrate said.
	   About 30 supporters of the governing African National Congress
party demonstrated outside the courthouse Friday chanting, ``Send
him to jail, send him to jail.''
	   The demonstrators, standing beyond the razor wire surrounding
the courthouse, carried placards and a banner. ``We can forgive him
for the past. Send him to jail for his arrogance,'' read one.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989 when he
was ousted in internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   De Klerk later released Nelson Mandela from jail and began a
process of reform that culminated in the all-race elections of 1994
that ended white rule and made Mandela president.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a small
coastal town located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness and
240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Nigeria's military leader appoints 31-member cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian military leader Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has announced a new 31-member cabinet to replace the one
he dissolved last month.
	   A statement issued Thursday in the Nigerian capital Abuja by
Abubakar's press secretary said the appointees would be formally
sworn in and given portfolios in a ceremony on Saturday.
	   Noticeably absent from the list were three influential ministers
from the cabinet of his predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha _ Foreign
Affairs Minister Chief Tom Ikimi, Finance minister Anthony Ani, and
Petroleum Resources minister Dan Etete.
	   The new cabinet includes nine ministers who served in the
previous cabinet. Six of the new appointees are military officers.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June after the sudden death of
Abacha, whose five-year dictatorship left Nigeria economically
crippled and diplomatically isolated.
	   He dissolved the cabinet in early July, one day after the
surprise death of imprisoned opposition leader Moshood Abiola.

Ford, three South Korean conglomerates bid for Kia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
auto firms tendered their bids Friday for Kia Motors Co., the
country's No. 2 carmaker before it collapsed last year fueling its
financial crisis.
	   A 15-member panel will meet in a secluded place to study the
bidding details before it announces the successful bidder on Sept.
1, Kia's creditor banks said.
	   The banks promised to write off nearly half Kia's dlrs 6.7
billion debt to make the failed company more attractive. Kia has
dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   In July, five companies, including General Motor Co., said they
will bid for Kia and its commercial vehicle arm Asia Motors Corp.
	   But GM pulled out in the last minute, Kia officials said. Friday
was the deadline for submitting tenders.
	   The three South Korean bidders were Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo
Motor Co, and Samsung Motors Inc. Ford already owns 16.9 percent of
Kia.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of the equity
of Kia and Asia through the auction.
	   Kia remains under court receivership after going bankrupt in
July last year. Its collapse helped erode investors' confidence in
the bloated, inefficient Korean industries.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to organize a record dlrs 58 billion bailout for its
economy. The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure the economy under the IMF bailout terms.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

China says diplomatic channels preferred for anti-terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Friday indirectly criticized the U.S.
missile strikes against sites in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The strikes Thursday on a suspected chemical weapons plant and
alleged terrorist training complex were linked to the Aug. 7
bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   China believed the attacks on the embassies should have been
dealt with according to the U.N. charter and international law,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a response to the
U.S. strikes.
	   ``China's position of condemning all forms of terrorist
activities is clear,'' Zhu said in a statement carried by the
state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   Zhu did not directly condemn Washington for acting alone.
Instead he said the world's countries should strengthen cooperation
to eliminate the sources of international terrorism and protect
world peace and stability.

France is urging negotiations to begin as fighting continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Rugova calling for ``no fly zone'' over
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading Kosovo Albanian
politician called on foreign powers Friday to declare a ``no-fly
zone'' over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war
machine'' in its crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   The call by Ibrahim Rugova was issued after France warned that
military intervention may the only alternative to halt the fighting
in Kosovo if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire and peace
talks soon.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fresh fighting
Thursday in the Serb province between government forces and the
Kosovo Liberation Army, despite Serb success in driving the
secessionist rebels from most of their strongholds this month.
	   In a press conference, Rugova repeated demands that civilians
driven from their homes by the fighting be allowed to return ``with
international supervision,'' claiming Serb police were preventing
them from going home.
	   ``It is necessary to establish ban on military flights over
Kosovo,'' Rugova said. ``That is one of the ways to stop Serbian
war machinery in Kosovo.''
	   NATO imposed a similar ``no-fly zone'' over Bosnia during the 3
1/2-year ethnic conflict and flew combat missions over the former
Yugoslav republic to prevent Bosnian Serb aircraft from moving
troops or attacking Bosnian Muslims and Croats.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is very difficult and dangerous,''
Rugova added. ``The offensive by Serbian police and military forces
continues, as well as the shelling of Albanian villages ... In
other parts of Kosovo, repression continues.''
	   Such confrontational rhetoric continued despite American efforts
to pave the way for a cease-fire and peace talks on the future of
the Serb province, whose population is 90 percent Albanian.
	   Eight days ago, Rugova announced a five-member team to negotiate
the future of the province with the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which
the Europeans and Americans support.
	   Face-to-face talks have not taken place, despite Serb offers to
start them immediately. The Albanians have demanded an end to the
government offensive against the KLA and measures to guarantee the
safe return of the estimated 230,000 who fled their homes since the
crackdown began Feb. 28.
	   In a telephone call Thursday to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
French President Jacques Chirac said that unless fighting stops and
peace talks begin soon, military action ``will become difficult to
avoid.''
	   Aides said Chirac was especially concerned about the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Kosovo. U.N. and European
officials have warned that unless the refugees can return in time
to harvest crops in the next few weeks, the province could face
severe food shortages this winter.
	   In Belgrade, a spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist party, Ivica
Dacic, said the government was ready for serious negotiations on
autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo.
	   ``We expect the international community to persuade the
delegation of Kosovo Albanians to continue talks,'' Dacic said.
``It is obvious that talks are not in the interest of all those who
think that Kosovo problem can be solved by arms, threats or further
pressure.
	   He said that warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo
were ``sensationalistic lies'' aimed at obscuring the real problem,
which he said were ``separatism and terrorism - the evil which
hurts both Albanians and Serbs and all others in Kosovo.''
	   On Thursday, the Serb Media Center said ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste, near
the town of Orahovac, with automatic weapons and mortars, wounding
one policemen.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes that began
Wednesday night near the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.

Suu Kyi's party says it will call parliament to session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with NLD calling parliament to convene; RECASTS
throughout to conform; TRIMS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi's political party said
Friday it will call parliament to convene, the most direct
challenge to the authority of the military government it has ever
attempted.
	   Friday was the deadline the party had set for the military
government to convene the parliament elected in 1990. The National
League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, won 82 percent of the vote.
	   Although the military promised before the election to hand over
power to the winners, it ignored the result. The military has ruled
Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   ``The NLD will call parliament in the near future,'' a statement
from the party's executive committee said.
	   Yangon-based analysts expected the statement would spark a major
confrontation with the government resulting in arrests of NLD
members, perhaps even its leadership.
	   The military government has in the past launched massive arrests
against NLD members elected in the 1990 poll as a means of
preventing them from gathering at Suu Kyi's Yangon home for party
meetings.
	   Yangon-based analysts expected a similar response from the
government to Friday's NLD statement.
	   Justifying past arrests, the military accused the NLD of
attempting to set up a parallel government, and said the action was
unlawful.
	   Suu Kyi countered that since the NLD was elected to power in a
free and fair vote, it was the military who had set up a parallel
government.
	   As NLD leaders issued the statement, Suu Kyi was spending her
tenth day in her car 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon in a
protest over the military's restrictions on her right to travel
freely outside the capital.
	   The authorities stopped her last Wednesday 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of Yangon for the fourth time in two months as she
tried to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.
	   Her food was running low and she was becoming ill, NLD leaders
said. She has offered to end the impasse and return to Yangon if
the government releases members of her party imprisoned since May
27.
	   Tin Oo, vice chairman of the NLD, said there were about 97 party
members who had been jailed since that time. May 27 was the
anniversary of the 1990 election and a spate of arrests took place
after the NLD set a deadline for the government to honor the
result.
	   Forty two NLD members elected to parliament are in prison along
with hundreds more party members arrested over the years.
	   Tin Oo said releasing the prisoners in exchange for ending Suu
Kyi's protest was raised by NLD Chairman Aung Shwe during a rare
meeting Wednesday with Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the four most
powerful generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   ``That would be a positive step. If they are sincere, then they
could release them,'' Tin Oo said, while not commenting on Khin
Nyunt's response.
	   The streets of Yangon were quiet as the deadline for convening
parliament passed.
	   ``It's business as usual. There's no extra security
precautions,'' said a government spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said ``Myanmar and her citizens at this stage of development
cannot afford to have the basic universal human rights overshadowed
and sidetracked by other excessive individual rights.''
	   Meanwhile, more than a hundred Myanmar students protested
outside the country's embassy in Bangkok, and said 30 of them would
begin a hunger strike on Saturday until the military convened
parliament.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sudanese hospital saying 10 injured in attack,
 &UR; AP Photos LON147-149
 &UR; By MOHAMMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were
injured in the raid, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be
trapped under the debris.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum Friday and pulled down the American
flag to protest the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum
in 1996.
	   Sudanese officials charged that President Clinton ordered the
missile attack to distract attention from his troubles in the
Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said on state-run Sudan Television that
Clinton was a ``liar and morally decrepit.''
	   He warned that Sudan ``reserves the right to respond to the
American attack using all necessary measures,'' Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Friday.
	   ``We will retain the right to protest, and will ask the Security
Council to investigate the truth ... about this factory,''
el-Bashir said on Sudanese television.
	   The television said the factory produced about 50 percent of the
country's pharmaceuticals.
	   El-Bashir also accused Sudanese opposition groups of
misinforming the United States that Sudanese factories were being
used to produce chemical weapons.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the bombings of the American embassies in East
Africa. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim
militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in Khartoum had been targeted as a suspected chemical
weapons site.
	   Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, denied the
weapons allegation, saying the factory produced ``cheap medicines
... for the diseases found in Sudan.''
	   He said the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. was hit by
five missiles at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt) Thursday and that ``the
destruction is total.''
	   Mohammed al-Amin, head of the political committee of the
National Congress, a grass-roots citizens' advisory body organized
by the government, called on the United Nations to send a team to
investigate the incident.
	   A number of Sudan's allies spoke out in its defense.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi telephoned el-Bashir and
``condemned the unjust aggression,'' the television said. State-run
Iraq television accused the United States of using ``systematic
international terrorism.''
	   Earlier this year, the American magazine U.S. News and World
Report quoted a secret congressional report as saying Iraq had
built chemical weapons plants in Sudan. This was never publicly
confirmed by U.S. officials.
	   Last December, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons in Khartoum and two other
cities and using them in its war against southern rebels.

Taiwan calls for vigilance against China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's defense minister called for
vigilance against China on Friday, saying its willingness to attack
Taiwan has not diminished despite growing ties between the sides.
	   China's missile tests just outside Taiwan's two main ports in
1996 demonstrated that its ``enmity has not subsided in the
least,'' Chiang Chung-ling told participants in a ceremony on
Kinmen island marking the 40th anniversary of a bloody Chinese
artillery attack.
	   ``Due to the fact that China has not relinquished the use of
military force against Taiwan, our people must build up their
knowledge of the enemy and willingness to endure suffering,''
Chiang told an audience that included veterans of the battle.
	   Taiwan's leaders regularly appeal for vigilance and unity among
Taiwanese more likely to see China as a source of investment
opportunity than communist aggression.
	   Formerly unquestioned, the military has been forced to make
extra efforts to maintain support for large military budgets and
compulsory military service since the end of martial law in 1987.
	   Beijing still claims Taiwan as a breakaway province, and
threatens to invade to reunify it with the mainland. The two sides
last split in 1949 when the Nationalists were swept out of mainland
China by Mao Tse-tung's communists.
	   In the years following, Kinmen, also known as Quemoy, was the
scene of frequent artillery attacks by Chinese gunners located on
the China coast less than 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) away. An intense
bombardment beginning August 23, 1958, lasted for 44 days and
every-other-day shelling between the sides continued for another
two decades.
	   Tensions rose to the highest level since that time in March
1996, when China fired missiles and staged military exercises aimed
at intimidating supporters of Taiwan's independence during the
island's first ever direct presidential elections.
	   Kinmen residents have made a thriving cottage industry out of
forging bomb casings into kitchen knives, but the sides are now
more likely to exchange smuggled cigarettes and illicit travelers.
	   A thriving illicit trade has sprouted since military
administration ended in the early 1990s, in defiance of Taiwan's
ban on direct navigation between the sides.
	   Also Friday, a paper reported that Taiwan's military is shifting
its focus from buying new arms to obtaining intelligence and better
utilizing its recently acquired weapons systems.
	   Warming relations between Washington and Beijing make new arms
sales unlikely, and Taiwan needs time to ``absorb,'' newly
purchased F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighters, frigates, helicopters and
missile systems, the China Times reported.
	   That means it will focus more on upgrading technology on
existing systems, intelligence gathering, electronic warfare, and
setting up training systems, said the newspaper.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Rugova calling for ``no fly zone'' over
Kosovo. TRIMS outdated material, no pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading Kosovo Albanian
politician called on foreign powers Friday to declare a ``no-fly
zone'' over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war
machine'' in its crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   The call by Ibrahim Rugova was issued after France warned that
military intervention may be the only alternative to halt the
fighting in Kosovo if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire
and peace talks soon.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fresh fighting
Thursday in the Serb province between government forces and the
Kosovo Liberation Army, despite Serb success in driving the
secessionist rebels from most of their strongholds this month.
	   In a press conference, Rugova repeated demands that civilians
driven from their homes by the fighting be allowed to return ``with
international supervision,'' claiming Serb police were preventing
them from going home.
	   ``It is necessary to establish ban on military flights over
Kosovo,'' Rugova said. ``That is one of the ways to stop Serbian
war machinery in Kosovo.''
	   NATO imposed a similar ``no-fly zone'' over Bosnia during the 3
1/2-year ethnic conflict and flew combat missions over the former
Yugoslav republic to prevent Bosnian Serb aircraft from moving
troops or attacking Bosnian Muslims and Croats.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is very difficult and dangerous,''
Rugova added. ``The offensive by Serbian police and military forces
continues, as well as the shelling of Albanian villages ... In
other parts of Kosovo, repression continues.''
	   Such confrontational rhetoric continued despite American efforts
to pave the way for a cease-fire and peace talks on the future of
the Serb province, whose population is 90 percent Albanian.
	   Eight days ago, Rugova announced a five-member team to negotiate
the future of the province with the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which
the Europeans and Americans support.
	   Face-to-face talks have not taken place, despite Serb offers to
start them immediately. The Albanians have demanded an end to the
government offensive against the KLA and measures to guarantee the
safe return of the estimated 230,000 who fled their homes since the
crackdown began Feb. 28.
	   In a telephone call Thursday to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
French President Jacques Chirac said that unless fighting stops and
peace talks begin soon, military action ``will become difficult to
avoid.''
	   Aides said Chirac was especially concerned about the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Kosovo. U.N. and European
officials have warned that unless the refugees can return in time
to harvest crops in the next few weeks, the province could face
severe food shortages this winter.
	   In Belgrade, a spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist party, Ivica
Dacic, said the government was ready for serious negotiations on
autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo.
	   ``We expect the international community to persuade the
delegation of Kosovo Albanians to continue talks,'' Dacic said.
``It is obvious that talks are not in the interest of all those who
think that Kosovo problem can be solved by arms, threats or further
pressure.
	   He said that warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo
were ``sensationalistic lies'' aimed at obscuring the real problem,
which he said were ``separatism and terrorism - the evil which
hurts both Albanians and Serbs and all others in Kosovo.''
	   On Thursday, the Serb Media Center said ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste, near
the town of Orahovac, with automatic weapons and mortars, wounding
one policemen.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes that began
Wednesday night near the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.

Report: Unpaid Ukrainian miners turn to stealing explosives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Unpaid miners in eastern Ukraine are
increasingly stealing mine explosives to make a living, police
said, according to a newspaper report Friday.
	   The miners, many of whom have not been paid for months, are
selling the explosives on the black market, Viktor Lobach, a senior
police official in the coal-producing Luhansk region, told the
daily Fakty.
	   A recent case involved a mine worker who was offering to sell 18
kilograms (40 pounds) of explosives. Police learned of the offer
and detained the miner, who said he was given the explosives by a
manager, Fakty said.
	   Police then searched the manager's office and found nearly 117
kilograms (257 pounds) of explosives and detonators, enough to
destroy a large house, it said.
	   Fakty said the explosives, produced by two former defense
factories in the Luhansk region, sell well in Russia and also are
in demand by criminals in the ex-Soviet Baltic nations. The thieves
face three to 10 years in jail if caught and convicted, it added.

Looking toward the end of Lewinsky investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with more details. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETE YOST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the testimony of President Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky in hand, prosecutors have Clinton admitting
sexual improprieties and conflicting accounts about why the former
White House intern returned gifts from the president.
	   Democrats on Capitol Hill feel that if any report to Congress by
prosecutor Kenneth Starr focuses on sex there will be no chance for
impeachment proceedings against the president.
	   But if the independent counsel sends a strong obstruction case
to Congress, Clinton will have much more difficult problems, many
of the Democrats say.
	   Alleged gifts are an important element in Starr's probe of
possible obstruction in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against the president. Starr has been trying to determine if
Clinton suggested that Ms. Lewinsky get rid of items she received
from him so that she wouldn't have to turn them over to lawyers in
the Jones case, where the gifts would raise questions about their
relationship.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified she and Clinton agreed she should hand
over the gifts to his secretary, Betty Currie, sources familiar
with her account have said.
	   Clinton told the grand jury he never instructed Mrs. Currie to
retrieve them, didn't know she had them and ``didn't consider them
a big deal,'' said a Clinton adviser, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Ms. Lewinsky also had testified that she performed oral sex on
Clinton in the White House. Clinton generally acknowledged sexual
improprieties but would not answer specific questions about his
physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, the adviser said.
	   Clinton has maintained that his testimony in the Jones
deposition, in which he denied sexual relations with her, was
``legally accurate.''
	   Stymied by his refusal to answer sexual questions, prosecutors
asked Clinton a series of questions about his understanding of the
definition of ``sexual relations'' used in the Jones case, the
adviser said. Clinton said oral sex was one of the acts not covered
in that definition.
	   Prosecutors, meanwhile, awaited results run on DNA material
submitted by Clinton. They want to link the president to a stain on
a dress Ms. Lewinsky turned over to them.
	   Ms. Lewinsky also told grand jurors that Clinton fondled her
breasts and other parts of her body, according to several friends
of the former White House intern.
	   When asked about this, Clinton gave a vague answer, neither
confirming nor denying her allegation, his adviser said.
	   Clinton's advisers have said since Tuesday that he will not
answer any more questions for Starr. If the prosecutor issues
another subpoena, Clinton would almost certainly fight it, they
say.
	   Ms. Lewinsky wants to go about ``rebuilding her life,'' Lewinsky
family spokeswoman Judy Smith said after Ms. Lewinsky left the
courthouse Thursday after her second and probably last appearance.
The grand jury is apparently not finished with its work and more
witnesses may be called next week.
	   As Ms. Lewinsky finished her testimony, the president was
announcing a military strike against what he called terrorist sites
in Afghanistan and Sudan, and live television coverage switched to
the attack rather than the now-familiar footage of the federal
courthouse where the grand jury is meeting.
	   ``I don't think that the president or the White House has been
particularly following her business today,'' presidential spokesman
Mike McCurry told reporters covering the president in Martha's
Vineyard, Massachusetts.

Chinese president cancels Russia, Japan trips over flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin canceled planned
trips next month to Japan and Russia due to the raging floods in
central and northeast China, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Planning for both visits had been in the works for months.
Jiang's trip to Japan, scheduled for Sept. 6-11, would have been
the first by a Chinese president and was aimed at smoothing often
testy relations between the East Asian powers.
	   Annual summits between Jiang and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
have helped build cooperative, steady relations between Beijing and
Moscow, Cold War rivals for the allegiances of the socialist world.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Jiang postponed the visits ``due to
the immensity of flood control and disaster relief efforts,'' the
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Both visits will be rescheduled, Xinhua quoted the Foreign
Ministry as saying.
	   Floods along the Yangtze and northeastern rivers are the worst
in at least 44 years. Flood control experts have predicted that
flood waters along the Yangtze, China's longest river, would not
recede until mid-September.

Philippine shares lower, peso keeps gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing peso rate

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended lower Friday,
spooked by Wall Street's overnight loss and fears of a fresh round
of regional currency declines on rumors that Venezuela's currency
may be devalued, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed down 18.33 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1372.60, after
gaining 1.9 percent, or 26.34 points, Thursday.
	   The decline in Manila shares was in step with losses on other
Asian stock markets Friday, which followed an 81.87 point drop in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Thursday.
	   Market rumors of a plan to devalue Venezuela's bolivar was
denied by Venezuelan authorities Thursday, but traders said the
talk was enough to raise fears of a new round of Asian currency
turmoil.
	   ``What could hurt us most at this point is what will happen to
Latin American economies and their currencies,'' said Edwin Siao,
trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Total volume of shares traded Friday thinned to 229 million
shares from 936.4 million shares Thursday.
	   Gainers lagged behind decliners 27 to 54, while 42 issues were
unchanged.
	   The Philippine peso sustained its advances in recent days
against the U.S. dollar on gains by the Japanese yen and the
central bank's siphoning off of excess domestic liquidity that
could have been used by banks to speculate against the dollar.
	   The peso has gained five percent since hitting a seven-month low
of 44.790 pesos to the dollar on Aug. 10 because of fears of a
possible devaluation in the Chinese yuan.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 42.654 on the Philippine
Dealing System, down from P42.691 at Thursday's reference rate.
	   The dollar reached a session-low of 42.500 and was last traded
at 42.680.
	   Volume was dlrs 140.1 million after 101.5 million Thursday.
	   Dealers said the central bank's decision to maintain its
overnight borrowing rate at its present high level and expanding a
currency risk-protection scheme for unhedged dollar borrowers also
helped underpin the peso.

 &UR; Judge finds Botha guilty of ignoring subpoena &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arguments on sentencing &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities.
	   The judgment was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is
black, bringing and end to a trial that has highlighted South
Africa's still simmering racial divisions.
	   Botha, 82, could get up to two years in jail or an unspecified
fine on the conviction of ignoring the subpoena from South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Due to his age and frail
health, a fine is considered more likely. Sentencing could come
later Friday.
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison asked the magistrate to fine
Botha 60,000 rands (dlrs 9,463) and to give him a suspended prison
sentence on condition Botha comply with any future subpoenas.
	   The Human Rights Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which summoned Botha, has finished its hearings.
However, the commission's amnesty committee is still conducting
hearings and could summon Botha.
	   ``Had the accused been 30 or 40 years younger, the state would
have asked for imprisonment to be imposed,'' said Morrison. ``All
the fingers pointed in his direction at having been the person in
charge at a time when acts of torture were perpetrated.''
	   Morrison argued that the Truth Commission was trying to bring
about a racial healing in the country and that Botha was disrupting
its work.
	   ``The accused has chosen not to participate in this process. He
has chosen to remain silent,'' said Morrison.
	   Defense attorney Lappe Laubscher called the state's
recommendation ``simply ludicrous.''
	   ``It would be entirely inappropriate,'' said Laubscher, who
cited Botha's age, ill health and status as a former president as
mitigating factors.
	   Botha ignored a summons to appear before the commission which
wanted to quiz him on his role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet
that launched a violent crackdown on black liberation fighters in
the 1980s.
	   ``The failure of the accused to appear ... was unlawful,
intentional and without sufficient cause,'' the magistrate said in
his ruling, which took 50 minutes to read.
	   Lugaju also dismissed the argument from defense attorneys that
the subpoena was technically flawed. The magistrate said Botha, if
he felt the summons was flawed, had a duty to appeal against the
subpoena or to take the matter up with the commission. He could
not, the magistrate said, simply ignore the summons.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   However, the magistrate dismissed claims the commission was
prejudiced against Botha and noted that every political party at
one time or another had attacked the commission. Lugaju said the
panel had treated Botha with great respect.
	   ``On the evidence the accused was treated with the utmost
courtesy by the commission, said the magistrate. ``The commission
went to great lengths to assist the accused and meet his
requirements.''
	   Lugaju also ruled that no agreement existed that allowed Botha
to submit written answers instead of appearing before the
commission.
	   Botha had claimed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairman of the
commission, had agreed that if Botha submitted written answers he
would not have to appear.
	   Tutu, in his testimony, denied such an agreement existed and the
judge ruled the defense had not presented any evidence to
contradict Tutu's testimony.
	   ``The evidence introduced by the state remains uncontested,''
the magistrate said.
	   About 30 supporters of the governing African National Congress
party demonstrated outside the courthouse Friday chanting, ``Send
him to jail, send him to jail.''
	   The demonstrators, standing beyond the razor wire surrounding
the courthouse, carried placards and a banner. ``We can forgive him
for the past. Send him to jail for his arrogance,'' read one.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989 when he
was ousted in internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   De Klerk later released Nelson Mandela from jail and began a
process of reform that culminated in the all-race elections of 1994
that ended white rule and made Mandela president.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a small
coastal town located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness and
240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Airport official denies political reasons for airport opening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An official on Friday rejected charges that the
opening date for Hong Kong's new dlrs 20-billion airport was set
for political reasons, saying the decision was purely a commercial
one.
	   Clinton Leeks, the airport's corporate development director,
said it was ``an absolute myth'' that the opening of Chek Lap Kok
airport on July 6 was set to coincide with the first anniversary of
Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, and the visits of U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   ``This airport was not opened to create a feel-good feeling for
a particular president,'' Leeks told a Foreign Correspondents' Club
luncheon. ``We did not have to invent any diplomatic
skullduggery.''
	   Critics have charged that both the government and airport
authorities were ill-prepared for the airport opening, and that
problems that lingered for weeks afterwards compromised Hong Kong's
reputation as a leading international shipping center.
	   The Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy said
on Wednesday that the airport was opened too soon ``mainly for
political reasons.''
	   ``What was intended to be a symbol of Hong Kong's bright new
future under China has become an example of poor planning, worse
implementation, and finger-pointing in which no one is willing to
step forward and take the blame,'' it said.
	   Leeks acknowledged that airport officials ``should have done
more to prepare,'' but said the opening date was set by financial
decisions made as far back as 1995. The terms and conditions on
loans and equity provided by the Hong Kong government could not
have been changed, Leeks said.
	   ``We had a finite amount of money and a very clear obligation to
open on time,'' Leeks said. ``To have awaited perfection would not
have been a good commercial strategy.''
	   Shortly after the airport opened, complaints of lost luggage,
malfunctioning toilets, and rotting cargo shipments prompted
speculation that both government and airport officials were under
political pressure to open.
	   After imposing an embargo on all incoming nonperishable cargo,
the airport's main cargo handler Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd.
said it was under extreme time pressure to open even before it was
ready.
	   The cargo company said Wednesday that its efforts to resume
normal service were progressing well, enabling it to lift all
limits on imports brought in by passenger flights.

Rabbi buried among calls for revenge

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu and minister's quotes. Picks up 8th

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Jewish settlers, some
weeping and others shouting ``revenge,'' marched Friday in the
funeral procession of a 63-year-old rabbi who was stabbed to death
in his home by a Palestinian intruder.
	   The body of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, draped in a white cloth and
placed on a stretcher, was carried through the deserted streets of
downtown Hebron. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers enforced a curfew on
30,000 Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled sector of the city.
	   Raanan belonged to a dynasty of spiritual leaders of the Jewish
settlement movement, and there was concern that his brutal killing
could trigger revenge attacks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he contacted Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat with the demand that Palestinian security
forces arrest the assailant who is believed to have fled to the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron.
	   Netanyahu said the killing strengthened his resolve not to sign
a deal on a West Bank troop pullback unless he won guarantees that
the Palestinians will keep their security obligations.
	   ``If somebody had forgotten what we are fighting for, what we
are insisting on, perhaps he understands it better today,''
Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Raanan was stabbed to death Thursday night in his bedroom in a
trailer in the heavily fortified Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, one
of several in the center of Hebron. After killing Raanan, the
assailant torched the mobile home on fire with a firebomb before
fleeing. The rabbi's wife suffered smoke inhalation.
	   During a mourning ceremony Friday, the rabbi's draped body,
lying on a stretcher, was placed under an oak tree in the tiny
playground of Tel Romeida. Hundreds of mourners squeezed into the
yard to listen to eulogies and say prayers.
	   Immigrant Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, who represented
the government, was repeatedly heckled and booed by settlers who
charged the government was not doing enough to protect them.
	   ``Liar, liar,'' some shouted as Edelstein promised the security
forces would do everything in their power to track down the
assailant.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan which U.S.
President Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East
Africa.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him ``minutes
before'' the raids to inform him of U.S. actions.
	   The statement said Museveni expressed strong support for the
action and added that Uganda has also been a target for terrorist
actions orchestrated by agents from Sudan.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether Albright also
telephoned Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi or Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa about the U.S. actions.
	   U.S. embassies in the capitals of both countries were the
targets two weeks ago of car-bombings in which 257 people died, all
but 10 of them in Kenya.
	   Clinton said the U.S. raids were linked to the Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam embassy bombings.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices of the
Saudi Arabian charity, Mercy International Relief Agency, in
connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers and
cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment.

Pole wins gold medal in the 50K walk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pole winning gold in 50K, Kipketer, Drechsler,
Jackson advance in their events &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Robert Korzeniowski of Poland added the
European Championship gold medal to his Olympic and world titles
when he won the men's 50-kilometer walk Friday.
	   The 30-year-old Pole was in the front group from the start and
began pulling away at 40K.
	   He finished the grueling course on a muggy morning in three
hours, 43.51 minutes to beat Valentin Kononen of Finland by a
comfortable margin of 38 seconds.
	   Kononen, the world 1995 champion, clinched the silver at
3:44.29, while Andrey Plotnikov of Russia was more than a minute
behind at 3:45.53 for the bronze.
	   The walk was the first of the nine finals to be decided Friday
with Russia leading with eight medals overall through the first
three days.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and world record-holder, easily
passed the first round of the men's 800-meter qualifying, although
he was only second in his heat after not pushing hard. He is
recovering from a bout of malaria in February, which set his
training back by three months.
	   Kipketer, who was born in Kenya but now holds Danish
citizenship, clocked 1:46.19, more than five seconds outside his
world record of 1:41.11.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, world record-holder Colin
Jackson of Britain, who is seeking his third consecutive title, had
the fastest time in the first qualifying round of 13.47 seconds.
Two other British runners also advanced, Tony Jarrett and Andrew
Tulloch.
	   Heike Drechsler of Germany, seeking to become only the third
athlete to win four straight titles in the same event, cleared 6.79
meters to make the final in the women's long jump.
	   Drechsler had the second longest jump after Russian Lyudmila
Galkina's 6.83.
	   Already Estonia's most popular athlete, Erki Nool became a hero
in his tiny Baltic homeland when he captured the decathlon
Thursday.
	   With an astonishing heave of the javelin, Nool gave Estonia its
first European gold medal since 1938.
	   ``I cannot tell you how happy I am,'' said the 28-year-old
athlete.
	   ``In the beginning I felt strong and hoped for a medal. After
the pole vault I was sure of at least the silver, and after the
javelin I knew I had won,'' Nool said.
	   Nool was lagging sixth after six events. But then he cleared
5.40 meters in the pole vault and then stunned the field with a
throw of 70.65 meters in the ninth event of the decathlon.
	   He collected a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   One page of the official championship statistics gives the date
of Estonia's last gold medal as 1934, the inaugural championship.
	   But Nool knew his history and quickly set the record straight.
He was Estonia's first gold medalist since 1938, when Aleksander
Kreek won the shot put.
	   Soon after that, Estonia was swallowed up by the neighboring
Soviet Union, before regaining independence in the collapse of
communism.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, coming off left-knee and right
Achilles tendon surgeries, had to settle for silver after holding
the lead in the middle stages. He was more than 15 meters behind
Nool in the javelin.
	   Eduard Hamalainen, who was born in the Soviet Union after his
grandfather had been deported from Finland, now competes for the
country of his roots. Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze.
	   While Estonia got a rare gold, Spain got a gold it expected in
the men's 1,500.
	   It didn't come from Fermin Cacho, but from Reyes Estevez. Cacho
started the strong Spanish showing in the distance by winning the
Olympic gold in Barcelona in 1992. He also had the silver in
Atlanta four years later and another silver at last year's worlds.
	   Cacho was the defending champion here, but he had no chance
against Estevez, the fastest in Europe this year at the distance.
	   A strong finisher, Estevez pulled away with 200 meters left in a
slow race to cruise home in 3:41.31.
	   Rui Silva of Portugal, who was slightly ahead entering the last
lap, held off Cacho to win the silver in 3:41.84. Cacho finished in
3:42.13 for the bronze.
	   Other champions Thursday: Pavel Januszewski of Poland in the
men's 400 hurdles; Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia in the women's 800;
Annarita Sidoti of Italy in the women's 20K; Vita Pavlish of
Ukraine in the women's shot put, with a heave of 21.69 meters, a
championship record and the best in the world this year; and Olga
Vasdeki of Greece in the women's triple jump.

Soldiers battle Chinese flooding as victims go hungry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with flooding near Harbin,
warnings by government officials, new flood crest on Yangtze &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Urged on by warnings of danger, weary
soldiers on Friday plugged slow leaks in a waterlogged levee barely
holding back a rain-swollen river from a northeast China industrial
hub.
	   Continuing its days-long march to ever higher record levels, the
Songhua River seeped through the sandbag-covered dike, spilling
onto riverside streets and Stalin Park.
	   On the opposite shore, soldiers struggled to keep open a road
housing makeshift encampments of about 10 farm families. Their
nearby villages and fields were roof-high in water.
	   ``We've got enough food for the next couple of days, but then it
will get dangerous if this goes on,'' said Shi Baohuai.
	   Shi, his wife and two children have been living off 10 kilograms
(22 pounds) of rice _ all they could manage to carry when the
Songhua overwhelmed dikes protecting Qianjijia village on Sunday.
His wife gutted a bowl of fish _ their meal for the day.
	   Surging rivers in the northeast have added to China's battles
against the worst flood season in at least 40 years. More than
2,000 people have died and millions have been left homeless, but
those official tallies are two weeks old and expected to rise.
	   President Jiang Zemin postponed trips to Japan and Russia
because of the severity of the floods, the Foreign Ministry
announced Friday.
	   In central China, much of the Yangtze River has stood above the
emergency stage for more than a month. Experts predicted that flood
waters would cover surrounding rich farmland until mid-September,
the People's Daily reported.
	   The Yangtze lapped near the top of dikes in Wuhan as the sixth
flood crest since early July passed through the industrial center
overnight, state television said.
	   Heavy rains upstream on Yangtze tributaries in Sichuan and Hubei
provinces have created a seventh flood crest. The State Flood
Relief Headquarters predicted danger because reservoirs were full
and the ground saturated.
	   In Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province,
the Songhua surged one meter (three feet) below an embankment piled
high with sandbags. Some 400,000 soldiers and civilians watched for
trouble spots.
	   Although the city seemed calm, Governor Tian Fengshan warned
against complacency.
	   ``Rigid thinking and relaxing vigilance is the No. 1 enemy when
it comes to fighting floods. There must be absolutely no
wavering,'' the Harbin Daily quoted Tian as saying.
	   ``People, people, don't worry. Wherever there's danger there's
the People's Liberation Army,'' soldiers sang to keep spirits high.
``We'll defend Harbin to the death.''
	   ``We don't sleep much,'' said Nie Yuping, a soldier from Anhui
province, where his family's fields were under water. Nie said he
caught about three or four hours a night in the back of an army
truck.
	   ``Everybody's out working,'' he said. ``We'll leave when the
water goes.''
	   Officers said their soldiers suffered colds and blistered hands
because they had been soaked for so long.
	   School children cheered and sang for the soldiers, and city
residents brought food.
	   The outpouring of gratitude contrasted with the squalid
conditions of flood victims on the river's north shore.
	   ``Food is difficult to get and drinking water is a problem. The
water is unhygienic,'' said a woman living on the raised roadbed
above flooded-out Qianjijia village.
	   A kilometer (half mile) away soldiers worked to build a dike
protecting the roadbed. Nearby were piles of melons donated to the
soldiers.
	   The road connects Harbin with Daqing, China's largest oil field,
150 kilometers (100 miles) to the northwest. The Nen River burst
dikes in the past 10 days, forcing more than 100,000 people to flee
and smothering part of the oil field.
	   The Heilongjiang Daily reported Friday that only 297 of the
2,500 submerged wells were not pumping. Oil production was largely
stable, the China Daily quoted Daqing spokesman Liu Zhengyin as
saying.

	   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) _ Human rights investigators
recovered three sets of bones Friday when they began to dig up
suspected mass graves thought to contain remains of those killed in
a military crackdown against Islamic separatists.
	   Indonesian troops are accused of committing atrocities,
including killings and torture, during the late 1980s and 1990s in
the northernmost province of Aceh, on Sumatra island about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The separatists, whose numbers have now dwindled, had wanted to
set up their own independent Muslim state.
	   A four-man team from Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission and a group of volunteers with shovels were led to
several alleged grave sites by grieving villagers.
	   They took samples of human remains from the sites, which local
people allege contain dozens of skeletons.
	   The bones will be subjected to forensic tests to determine
whether they were victims of executions, officials said.
	   The Indonesian media have widely reported allegations of mass
graves by villagers. Some have said they were forced at gunpoint to
bury the bodies of people executed by troops.
	   Earlier, the secretary general of the National Human Rights
Commission, Baharuddin Lopa, who is heading the investigative team
in Aceh, said his group wanted to confirm whether mass graves
existed.
	   ``We will collect information about human rights abuses in this
province by digging these areas and by talking with the victims'
families, eyewitnesses and non-governmental organizations,'' he
told the official Antara news agency.
	   He said his team would then submit its findings to the
government of President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``You must be sure they will find mass graves,'' said Muhamad
Harun, a human rights activist based in Sigli, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) east of the provincial capital, Banda Aceh.
	   ``Local villagers saw trucks full of bodies go to the grave
sites and then come back empty,'' he said of events a decade ago.
	   Habibie, who replaced former autocratic President Suharto after
nationwide riots in May, has promised greater human rights for
Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   In a state-of-the-nation address to Parliament last Saturday he
made an unprecedented apology for abuses committed during his
predecessor's 32-year reign.
	   Indonesia's military commander Gen. Wiranto has also publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh.
	   Since Suharto's resignation the powerful military has faced a
barrage of allegations of past wrongdoing and is currently the
subject of two major inquires over the shooting and abduction of
anti-Suharto activists.
	   In a gesture of conciliation, the military began withdrawing
troops from Aceh on Thursday when about 250 soldiers left. Another
800 are slated to go on Aug. 31.
	   A pro-government newspaper, Suara Karya, reported Thursday that
12,000 soldiers were stationed in Aceh before the withdrawal.
	   Hundreds of troops have also been pulled out the disputed
territory of East Timor, which has also endured years of human
rights abuses and guerrilla warfare.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany canceled aid flights to Sudan
Friday until the German and Sudanese governments can assess the
risks following the U.S. attack on a suspected terrorist target in
the Sudanese capital Khartoum.
	   Four transport planes were to depart for Sudan on Friday and
Saturday to begin an eight-week mission delivering aid to southern
Sudan, where international aid agencies estimate 1.5 million people
face starvation.

Man recovering after stuck in elevator in Italy for 10 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ An Italian man who spent 10 days trapped
in an elevator was recovering Friday in a hospital here.
	   RAI state radio said Armando Piazza, 63, claimed he ate or drank
nothing while stuck in the elevator in an unoccupied hotel in this
winter ski resort.
	   After friends told police Piazza hadn't been seen for several
days, officers found Piazza on Thursday in the lift trapped between
the first and second floor of the hotel where he works as a
caretaker. The hotel is closed for the summer.
	   ``He is having all sort of medical exams now, but he's in
excellent shape'' said a nurse at Pinerolo Hospital who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The nurse indicated medical staff were baffled over how the man
survived. ``It's a very unusual situation,'' she said.
	   Italian newspapers said he slept, prayed and did some exercises
while trapped. Piazza was quoted as saying he never drank his own
urine to survive.
	   Doctors said the 120-kilo (264-pound) man lost 10 kilos (22
pounds).

Most Asian markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended the week sharply lower
Friday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur tumbling nearly 8
percent as investors took profits following sharp gains in the past
two days.
	   The Malaysian market's key Composite Index plummeted 26.98
points, or 7.7 percent, to close at 324.06. The index had surged 11
percent in the past two days.
	   Dealers said the surge was largely speculative, with short-term
investors jumping into the market following the Malaysian
government announcement that it was considering intervening in the
market to prop up share prices.
	   On Thursday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged
Malaysians to be prepared when the government introduces the new
measures, which he didn't elaborate.
	   Share prices also tumbled in Hong Kong on profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's main indicator of
blue chips, fell 214.92 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at
7,527.61. On Thursday, the index had gained 1.6 percent.
	   Brokers attributed the slump to profit-taking following recent
sharp gains in shares after the government intervened to prop up
the market.
	   Brokers said market sentiment was also damped by an overnight
decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell
81 points to 8,611.
	   In Tokyo, share prices fell as Japan's third-largest corporate
failure _ trading firm Okura and Co. _ this year raised fears about
the health of the economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 93.21 points,
or 0.61 percent, to close at 15,298.20 points. On Thursday, the
average fell 14.93 points, or 0.10 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was trading at 142.94 yen in
late-afternoon trading, up 0.39 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
lower than its late New York rate of 143.19 yen overnight.
	   The dollar rose as high as 143.50 yen in early Tokyo trading on
news of U.S. air strikes against suspected terrorist targets. But
lingering speculation that Japan would intervene in currency
markets to support the yen, weighed on the dollar.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply lower on skepticism over
the privatization plan of the government. The Composite Index fell
10.985 points, or 2.8 percent, to 388.345, its lowest point since
mid-January.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended lower as local players sold
banking shares ahead of the weekend, dealers said. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index was down 4.08 points, or 1.7 percent, to
238.92.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed as late buying propped up select
stocks on rumors that Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. would
lower its prime lending rate, The Straits Times Industrial Index
rose 10.30 points, or 1.1 percent, to 933.16.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on the back of declines in
Asian stock markets and amid concerns the regional crisis is
spreading globally, dealers said. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index fell 57.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,213.37.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower on
profit-taking. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 30.14 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,001.50.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, spooked by Wall Street's
overnight loss. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell
18.33 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,372.60.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 23.5 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,635.0.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed in active trading. The Korea
Composite Index edged up 0.03 point to 316.62.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan which U.S.
President Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East
Africa.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him ``minutes
before'' the raids to inform him of U.S. actions.
	   The statement said Museveni expressed strong support for the
action and added that Uganda has also been a target for terrorist
actions orchestrated by agents from Sudan.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether Albright also
telephoned Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi or Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa about the U.S. actions.
	   U.S. embassies in the capitals of both countries were the
targets two weeks ago of car-bombings in which 257 people died, all
but 10 of them in Kenya.
	   Clinton said the U.S. raids were linked to the Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam embassy bombings.
	   Nairobi residents were divided about the U.S. strikes.
	   ``I was delighted. I stayed up all last night watching TV. We
were waiting for this for a long time,'' said drama student George
Orido, 25.
	   ``We were waiting for this for a long time. I thought what they
did was actually insufficient. Let them do more.''
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude towards his religion and condemned raids for
continuing the indiscriminate killing.
	   ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I
want to tell the Americans that they should just leave us Muslims
alone. If they would just leave us, there would be no fighting, no
killing,'' he said.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices of the
Saudi Arabian charity, Mercy International Relief Agency, in
connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers and
cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment.

Suu Kyi's party says it will call parliament to session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background, further developments

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi's political party said
Friday it will call parliament to convene, the most direct
challenge to the authority of the military government it has ever
attempted.
	   Friday was the deadline the party had set for the military
government to convene the parliament elected in 1990. The military
said Thursday it would do no such thing.
	   The National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, won 82
percent of the seats in parliament in the 1990 vote.
	   Although the military promised before the election to hand over
power to the winners, it ignored the result. The United Nations has
issued several resolutions calling on the military to honor the
vote.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   ``Failure to hold a parliament session by the authorities
amounts to ignoring the wishes of the people,'' the party statement
said, adding it was now the duty of the NLD and elected candidates
from other parties to convene.
	   ``Hence, the NLD has announced it will call a parliament
consisting of ethnic and elected representatives in the near
future,'' the statement said.
	   Many ethnic groups, in rebellion against the military government
at the time, had no chance to participate in the 1990 vote.
	   Yangon-based analysts expected the statement would spark a major
confrontation with the government resulting in arrests of NLD
members, perhaps even its leadership.
	   The military government has in the past launched massive arrests
against NLD members elected in the 1990 poll as a means of
preventing them from gathering at Suu Kyi's Yangon home for party
meetings.
	   Justifying the arrests, the military accused the NLD of
attempting to set up a parallel government, an action it called
unlawful.
	   Suu Kyi countered that since the NLD was elected to power, it
was the military who had set up a parallel government.
	   As NLD leaders issued the statement, Suu Kyi was spending her
10th day in her car 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon in a
protest over the military's restrictions on her right to travel
freely outside the capital.
	   The NLD has said that Suu Kyi's health is failing after 10 days
of living in her van. She was stopped at a police checkpoint for
the fourth time in two months last Wednesday as she and colleagues
attempted to travel to the city of Bassein to meet parliamentarians
from her party.
	   Suu Kyi has offered to end the protest and return to Yangon if
the military releases party members imprisoned since May and jailed
parliamentarians.
	   Of the 385 NLD members elected in 1990, 181 are either in jail,
have died, been forced into exile, been stripped of their lawmakers
status by the military-controlled election commission or been
forced to resign from the party.
	   The rest are living under intense harassment from the
government, the party said.
	   The government has insisted that the 1990 vote was for delegates
to a constitutional convention and has said no parliament can be
called until a new charter is written.
	   The NLD said Friday that there was no provision in the
military-promulgated election laws that a constitution had to be in
place before the parliament could meet and added it was the job of
the elected lawmakers to write the constitution.
	   The military convened a constitutional convention in 1992 in
which Suu Kyi's party had only 15 percent of the seats. The rest
were given to people appointed by the military. The constitution
they have been drafting, but have yet to finish, gives the military
the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi from public office.
	   The NLD pulled out of the convention in 1995.
	   Protests against the military's failure to convene parliament
took place in several cities around the world including Bangkok,
Tokyo and were expected in Washington D.C. later on Friday.
	   In Bangkok, about 30 of the 100 student protesters outside the
Myanmar embassy said they would start a hunger strike Saturday
until the military convened the assembly.

Dinner guests mistook cruise missiles for thunder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dinner guests at a British diplomat's house three
miles (5 kms) from a chemical plant in the Sudanese capital,
Khartoum, mistook the crash of U.S. cruise missiles for thunder, a
British businessman said Friday.
	   Alan White, 29, head of the Sudan branch of international air
courier giant DHL, was also quoted as saying in a telephone
interview with the British news agency Press Association that he
had visited the plant and doubted that it was a chemical weapons
factory.
	   ``There is definitely skepticism that this was a cover for such
a factory,'' said White. ``I have been there. It is a very modern,
up-to-date facility and well reputed factory for pharmaceuticals.''
	   The United States attacked the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant, saying it produced nerve gas, and also hit
alleged Islamic terrorist camps in Afghanistan on Thursday in
retaliation for deadly bombings at U.S. embassies in east Africa.
	   White said he sensed no general antagonism toward foreigners in
Khartoum, quiet because Friday is the weekly religious day, but had
closed his company's office as a precaution.
	   Britain and other leading West European powers have strongly
supported the U.S. attack.
	   ``We heard bangs but there were thunder storms last night and
everyone assumed that was what it was,'' White said. ``We were
having a meal, about 10 of us, and just before 8 p.m. a friend who
was traveling to the dinner rang and told us of the attacks ... he
heard about it on the BBC World Service.''
	   White said the dinner guests stayed over at the diplomats house
and returned home Friday.
	   He added that an Irish friend, Damien Traynor, who runs a
meat-processing plant and lives 1/2 a mile (less than 1 km) from
the factory was coming to stay temporarily.
	   ``You can walk to the factory in 10 minutes from his house, so
obviously the shudder was quite severe,'' said White.
	   There are about 200 Britons in Khartoum.

This time, no need to pull punches on terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Seventeen years ago, Ronald Reagan assumed the
U.S. presidency just as the 444-day Iran hostage crisis was ending.
In his inaugural address, he vowed ``swift and effective''
retaliation against terrorists.
	   It was a promise on which he was able to deliver very little.
Reagan, along with his successors, discovered there always seemed
to be reasons to refrain from retaliation: the intelligence was too
inconclusive or the prospective loss of civilian life too great.
	   In the aftermath of the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa two
weeks ago, things have been different. To hear President Bill
Clinton and his top advisers tell it, intelligence windfalls not
only pinpointed the perpetrators, they also exposed plans for new
terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.
	   Finally, a president has been able to feel reasonably
comfortable about launching punishing military strikes against
terrorists. And despite suspicions raised at home and abroad about
the timing on the heels of his confessing to inappropriate sexual
conduct with a White House intern, the attacks are being applauded
by political foes and allies.
	   In refraining from the use of force, especially in Lebanon,
Reagan disappointed some close advisers. On several occasions, he
was tempted to retaliate but felt too many innocent lives would
have been lost.
	   One exception occurred in April 1986 when Reagan ordered the
bombing of Tripoli and Banghazi after he concluded that Libyans
were responsible for the murder of two U.S. soldiers at a Berlin
disco.
	   In general, however, Reagan and his successors found talk about
a ``swift and effective'' response was easier than actually
carrying it out.
	   The perpetrators of the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103,
which claimed 270 lives, remain at large. Those responsible for the
June 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which left 19
American servicemen dead, also have escaped justice.
	   National Security adviser Sandy Berger expressed frustration
over the dead ends in the Khobar Towers investigation. ``We have a
number of different theories...information that leads in a number
of different directions,'' he said.
	   But Berger and other officials described no similar frustration
following the East Africa bombings Aug. 7. Early on, investigators
conclude that Saudi-born millionaire Osama bin Laden and his allies
were responsible. They also concluded that plans for additional
attacks on Americans were afoot.
	   Clinton responded Thursday by ordering bombing raids on a
factory in Sudan supposedly capable of producing chemical weapons
ingredients. Another Clinton target was a suspected Islamic
militant base in Afghanistan. One of the reasons Thursday was
chosen for the attack was that a meeting of Islamic militant
chieftains was planned for that day at the site. The idea was to
take them out as well, although Afghan officials announced that bin
Laden himself was not harmed.
	   Berger said information gathered from various sources all
pointed to bin Laden.
	   To some career diplomats, however, it is too early for a victory
lap. Riley Sever, a vice president of the American Foreign Service
Association, the union of U.S. diplomats, says retaliation is not
enough.
	   His concern is the dozens of embassies around the world that are
officially acknowledged to be below minimum security standards set
in 1986. He worries that Thursday's bombings will encourage
counter-retaliation by terrorists.
	   ``If anything, this is going to make our embassies more
dangerous,'' he said.

 &UR; Judge finds Botha guilty of ignoring subpoena &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities and was given a suspended
prison sentence and ordered to pay a fine.
	   The judgment was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is
black, bringing and end to a trial that has highlighted South
Africa's still simmering racial divisions.
	   Botha, 82, could have received up to two years in jail or an
unspecified fine on the conviction of ignoring the subpoena from
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
	   The magistrate ordered Botha to pay a fine of 10,000 rands (dlrs
1,577) or spend 12 months in prison. He also gave Botha a 12-month
prison term suspended for five years on condition Botha comply with
any future summons.
	   ``Right through the proceedings, the accused has shown no
remorse,'' said the magistrate.
	   Botha, smiling and joking with friends after the sentencing,
left the courtroom without comment to reporters. He was jeered by
demonstrators outside as he left.
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison asked for a fine of 60,000 rands
(dlrs 9,463) and a prison sentence suspended on condition Both
comply with future summons.
	   The Human Rights Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which summoned Botha, has finished its hearings.
However, the commission's amnesty committee is still conducting
hearings and could summon Botha.
	   ``Had the accused been 30 or 40 years younger, the state would
have asked for imprisonment to be imposed,'' said Morrison. ``All
the fingers pointed in his direction at having been the person in
charge at a time when acts of torture were perpetrated.''
	   Morrison argued the Truth Commission was trying to bring about a
racial healing in the country and that Botha was disrupting its
work.
	   ``The accused has chosen not to participate in this process. He
has chosen to remain silent,'' said Morrison.
	   Defense attorney Lappe Laubscher called the state's
recommendation ``simply ludicrous.''
	   ``It would be entirely inappropriate,'' said Laubscher, who
cited Botha's age, ill health and status as a former president as
mitigating factors.
	   Botha ignored a summons to appear before the commission which
wanted to quiz him on his role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet
that launched a violent crackdown on black liberation fighters in
the 1980s.
	   ``The failure of the accused to appear ... was unlawful,
intentional and without sufficient cause,'' the magistrate said in
his ruling, which took 50 minutes to read.
	   Lugaju also dismissed the argument from defense attorneys that
the subpoena was technically flawed. Even if it had been flawed,
Botha could not simply ignore the summons,'' the magistrate said.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   However, the magistrate dismissed claims the commission was
prejudiced against Botha and said the panel had treated him with
great respect.
	   ``On the evidence the accused was treated with the utmost
courtesy by the commission, said the magistrate. ``The commission
went to great lengths to assist the accused and meet his
requirements.''
	   Lugaju also ruled that no agreement existed that allowed Botha
to submit written answers instead of appearing.
	   Botha had claimed Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairman of the
commission, had agreed that if Botha submitted written answers he
would not have to appear.
	   Tutu denied such an agreement existed and the judge ruled the
defense had not presented any evidence to contradict Tutu's
testimony.
	   About 30 supporters of the governing African National Congress
party demonstrated outside the courthouse Friday chanting, ``Send
him to jail, send him to jail.''
	   The demonstrators, standing beyond the razor wire surrounding
the courthouse, carried placards and a banner. ``We can forgive him
for the past. Send him to jail for his arrogance,'' read one.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   Alex Boraine, the acting commission chairman, told reporters in
Cape Town the judgment demonstrates ``in a concrete way that we now
have a society in which no one is above the law.''
	   ``Mr. Botha has been publicly held accountable for his actions
in a court of law, and he has been afforded every opportunity to
defend himself -- something which was often denied to his political
opponents during the years of his rule,'' Boraine said.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989 when he
was ousted in internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   De Klerk later released Nelson Mandela from jail and began a
process of reform that culminated in the all-race elections of 1994
that ended white rule and made Mandela president.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a small
coastal town located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness and
240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Former Polish ambassador to U.S. dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Kazimierz Dziewanowski, a journalist and
Solidarity activist who became Poland's first ambassador to the
United States after communism, has died, according to media reports
Friday. He was 68.
	   No exact cause of death was given, but reports in newspapers and
the PAP state news agency said Dziewanowski died Wednesday in a
hospital from sudden illness. No further information was
immediately available.
	   A journalist with a law degree from Warsaw University,
Dziewanowski joined other intellectuals in supporting the Gdansk
shipyard strike of 1980 that gave birth to Solidarity, the first
free trade union in the former Soviet bloc.
	   Dziewanowski created the ``Solidarity Weekly'' newspaper with
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who later became Poland's first prime minister
after the fall of communism.
	   During martial law imposed by communist rulers in 1980-81,
Dziewanowski was fired and state publishing houses canceled
contracts for his books.
	   In 1990-93, Dziewanowski became Poland's ambassador to
Washington and lobbied for his country's membership in NATO. He
also wrote about international affairs for the Polish daily
newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
	   ``He opened the doors to NATO for us. It is a pity he did not
live to the moment they are wide open,'' former President Lech
Walesa said in Friday's issue of Rzeczpospolita.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is scheduled
to join NATO in April.

Cabinet commemorates victims of the Soviet-led invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Premier Milos Zeman commemorated
Friday victims of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the
Prague Spring reforms.
	   Speaking in front of the Czech public radio station, which was
attacked by Soviet troops on the first day of the occupation, Zeman
commended the public protests against the invasion as ``heroic.''
	   Thirty years ago on this date, five Warsaw Pact allies led by
the Soviet Union stormed the streets of downtown Prague to quash a
democratic movement known as the Prague Spring. About 100 people
were killed and the Czech Communist leader Dubcek was deposed.
	   Zeman also remembered the clashes between Czech police and the
Soviet Army one year later, when several more people died.
	   President Vaclav Havel's wife Dagmar Havlova, Chancellor Ivan
Medek, and several legislators were also present at the ceremony,
broadcast live by the Czech Radio.
	   A Russian delegation, led by Vladimir Lukin, the Russian Duma's
foreign committee chairman, laid wreaths in downtown Prague's
Wenceslas Square, where the Soviet tanks were met by thousands of
angry Czechs.
	   Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia in late 1989 and in Jan.
1993, the country peacefully split into the independent countries
of Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Villa boss: I would have shot Yorke if I had a gun
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Aston Villa manager John Gregory is
furious that Dwight Yorke turned his back on the club after nine
years to move to Manchester United in a 12.6 million-pound (dlrs
20.5 million) transfer deal.
	   ``If I'd had a gun I would have shot him,'' an angry Gregory
said after the deal was completed Thursday.
	   Gregory's reaction was splashed across the headlines Friday.
	   ``Dwight Yorke came to see me two weeks ago to tell me he wanted
to play for Manchester United and not Aston Villa,'' he said.
	   ``If I'd had a gun at the time I would have shot him. What he
said really hurt. It really got me.
	   ``I had hoped he would change his mind. Yet in the last few days
he made it very clear he wanted to go.''
	   The 26-year-old Tobagan striker had been consisently linked with
a transfer to Manchester United in the off-season as the Red
Devil's boss Alex Ferguson combed the competition in search of a
striker.
	   Ferguson's original 10 million pound (dlrs 16.25 million) offer
was rejected by Gregory, who said he wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs
26.4 million) for Yorke.
	   After stating Tuesday he planned to see out his contract at
Villa despite being disappointed about a failed move to the Red
Devils, he suddenly confirmed Wednesday that transfer negotiations
were back on.
	   He eventually signed with Manchester United Thursday, just in
time to meet the deadline to play in the European Champions' Cup.
	   Yorke's arrival at Old Trafford prompted speculation that
Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be leaving and one
report said United had agreed a 5 million pound (dlrs 8.25 million)
deal with Tottenham.
	   Spurs chairman Alan Sugar admitted negotiations were taking
place but Ferguson said he wasn't planning to sell anyone.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended the week sharply lower
Friday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur tumbling nearly 8
percent as investors took profits following sharp gains in the past
two days. The Malaysian market's key Composite Index plummeted
26.98 points to close at 324.06. Hong Kong market's main indicator
of blue chips, fell 214.92 points, or 2.8 percent on profit taking,
closing at 7,527.61. In Tokyo, share prices fell as Japan's
third-largest corporate failure this year raised fears about the
health of the economy. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 93.21 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 15,298.20 points.
Stocks started lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street and
news that medium-sized Japanese trading firm Okura and Co. would
file for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was trading at
142.94 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.39 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York rate of 143.19
yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Friday defended
devaluation of the ruble before a hostile parliament, dominated by
Communists and other hard-liners who reiterated their call for the
government's ouster. ``We can't afford the luxury of being a
popular government,'' Kiriyenko said in a 10-minute speech before
the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, which convened an
emergency session to discuss the crisis. Kiriyenko accused the Duma
of dragging its feet on approving a series of government-proposed
steps to boost revenues and said the lawmakers' indecision
precipitated the latest financial crisis. Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, who took the floor shortly afterward, assailed the
government, saying ``Russia has devalued itself to the point where
a single multibillionaire can buy it,'' he said. Zyuganov repeated
his longtime call for Yeltsin to step down and proposed a vote of
no-confidence in Kiriyenko's cabinet. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Trying to take advantage of Iran's nascent openings
to the West, France's foreign minister heads Friday to Tehran for a
visit to boost economic and political ties. The two-day trip by
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine is the highest-level French visit
in seven years. Coming only weeks after the visit of Italy's prime
minister, it is a clear sign that Europe, eager to increase trade
with Iran, is moving to capitalize quickly on the moderate signs
coming out of Tehran since the election of President Mohammad
Khatami a year ago. It also comes amid a tentative but obvious
softening of the relationship between Iran and the United States _
or ``The Great Satan,'' as it's been known in Iran since the 1979
Islamic Revolution. Vedrine says he plans to broach all subjects,
including the thorniest issue affecting Iran's ties to the West:
terrorism. (FRANCE-IRAN)
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Attending a 16-nation
Caribbean summit starting Friday, Cuban President Fidel Castro
prepares to join the struggle of small island states fighting for
economic survival in an era of increasingly global free trade.
Castro alluded to that struggle as he recalled the strong cultural
ties that historically wed Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Cuba's
economy has struggled since the collapse of its biggest trading
partner, the Soviet-era Eastern bloc, and under strain of a
continuing U.S. trade embargo. Other Caribbean states, meanwhile,
have seen U.S. aid dwindle since the end of the Cold War _ from
dlrs 200 million a year to dlrs 25 million last year _ and are
fighting to maintain access to foreign markets for such exports as
bananas, sugar and textiles. No longer fearing reprisals from
Washington, Caribbean democracies are reaching out to Castro,
hoping for some extra muscle in upcoming talks with European
trading partners and on a proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.
(DOMINICAN-CASTRO)
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co.'s labor union
accepted ``a minimum level of layoffs'' Friday, raising hopes for a
negotiated settlement of a monthlong strike at the nation's largest
automaker, government mediators said. ``Considering the difficulty
being faced by Hyundai and the car industry as a whole, the union
has accepted layoffs as a realistic solution,'' Cho Sung-jun, a
government mediator, told reporters. The move was a major
concession by the militant, 26,000-member union, which has long
insisted it would never accept a ``single worker laid off.'' After
shedding 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements,
Hyundai laid off 1,538 workers on July 31. The union first fought
to forestall the layoffs, then demanded that Hyundai take back the
fired employees. Some 5,000 workers and their families have been
picketing Hyundai's plant at Ulsan since July 20, shortly after the
company first announced its layoff plans. (SKOREA-HYUNDAI)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The thunderclap of cruise missiles against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan signaled what President Bill
Clinton said would be a lengthy war on terrorists who bombed two
U.S. embassies in Africa and were planning still more attacks.
Jolting the United States from the scandal over his relationship
with a former White House intern, Clinton called Thursday's strikes
pre-emptive measures. U.S. officials nevertheless warned that the
military action almost certainly would provoke a terrorist response
and the State Department urged U.S. citizens traveling or residing
abroad to remain alert and to exercise extra caution. At least 10
people were injured during the bombing of the suspected chemical
weapons plant in Khartoum, Sudan, and 21 people are believed dead
after the strikes against a terrorist training complex in eastern
Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen seriously injured
two U.N. workers Friday in the Afghan capital of Kabul, a day after
a U.S. missile attack on a suspected Islamic militant base that the
country's Taliban rulers said killed 21 people. The United Nations
confirmed the two men, one French and one Italian, were shot as
they drove in Kabul. No other details were available, and it was
not immediately clear if the attack was related to the U.S. missile
strikes on eastern Afghanistan Thursday. Foreigners had been
advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan. Kabul was reported calm and
tense Friday. Its residents will gather later in the day for
prayers on the Muslim holy day, and protests could be sparked by
fiery sermons. Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada said 21
people were killed and another 30 were injured when cruise missiles
exploded on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base near Khost, about 150
kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul. (AFGHANISTAN-US BOMBINGS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the testimony of President Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky in hand, prosecutors have Clinton admitting
sexual improprieties and conflicting accounts about why the former
White House intern returned gifts from the president. The
independent prosecutor has been trying to determine if Clinton
obstructed justice by suggesting that Ms. Lewinsky get rid of items
she received from him so that she wouldn't have to turn them over
to lawyers in the Paul Jones sexual harassment case, where the
gifts would raise questions about their relationship. Democrats on
Capitol Hill feel that if any report to Congress by prosecutor
Kenneth Starr focuses on sex there will be no chance for
impeachment proceedings against the president. But if the

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities. The judgment was handed
down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is black, bringing an end to
a trial that has highlighted South Africa's racial divisions.
Botha, 82, could get up to two years in jail or an unspecified fine
on the conviction of ignoring the subpoena from South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Due to his age and frail
health, a fine is considered more likely. Botha ignored a summons
to appear before the commission which wanted to quiz him on his
role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet that launched a violent
crackdown on black liberation fighters in the 1980s. (SOUTH

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi's political party said
Friday it will call parliament to convene, the most direct
challenge to the authority of the military government it has ever
attempted. Friday was the deadline the party had set for the
military government to convene the parliament elected in 1990. The
National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, won 82 percent of
the vote. Although the military promised before the election to
hand over power to the winners, it ignored the result. The military
has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962. Yangon-based
analysts expected the statement would spark a major confrontation
with the government resulting in arrests of NLD members, perhaps
even its leadership. Justifying past arrests, the military accused
the NLD of attempting to set up a parallel government, and said the
action was unlawful. Suu Kyi countered that since the NLD was
elected to power in a free and fair vote, it was the military who
had set up a parallel government. (MYANMAR)

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition Friday
accused the country's leaders of trying to kill prominent dissident
Sam Rainsy in a grenade attack and vowed to take their challenge
against alleged election fraud to the streets.
	   Sam Rainsy and three other leading opposition figures, appearing
at a news conference, urged the international community to withdraw
the endorsement it has bestowed on parliamentary elections last
month won by strongman Hun Sen.
	   The leaders said they would go ahead with a massive planned
protest Sunday against alleged election-stealing by Hun Sen and
announced they would hold daily demonstrations afterward.
	   ``Our only channel to express our discontent is in the street,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``On Sunday, on Monday, maybe one on Tuesday .. it
will be continuous until the protests are investigated.''
	   The grenade attack, which killed one person, and protests show
Cambodia is no closer to a peaceful resolution of its post-election
instability and that things may be getting worse.
	   Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the main opposition
leaders, have refused to recognize Hun Sen's slight majority
victory in the 122-seat National Assembly, short of the two-thirds
needed to form a government.
	   They threaten to withhold their support until the alleged
election irregularities are probed. The Hun Sen-controlled National
Election Committee has refuse to look into their complaints.
	   Ahmad Yahya, a member of Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party,
told the news conference that government leaders were behind the
grenade attack. His suspicions are widely shared, though he
presented no proof.
	   ``Last night shows they want to kill Mr. Sam Rainsy,'' Ahmad
Yahya said. ``The leaders of our country look at him as the enemy,
so therefore, according to information from different sources, they
want to kill him.''
	   Sam Rainsy was leading a sleep-in protest Thursday at the
election committee's headquarters, inside the Interior Ministry
compound, when several shots were fired and a grenade was tossed
from a passing car.
	   The grenade did not clear the wall and exploded outside it,
killing Sieng Sean, 45, a driver for Kyodo News Service of Japan.
Sam Rainsy was unharmed. There were no reports of injuries.
	   ``I think the attackers may want to scare people from
participating in Sunday's demonstration,'' a shaken Sam Rainsy told
reporters after he was released Friday morning by Interior Ministry
guards.
	   He had been interrogated for several hours and held at gunpoint.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak suggested that Sam
Rainsy was responsible, calling the attack ``too coincidental.''
	   Sunday's protest would be ``illegal,'' Khieu Sopheak said,
calling it ``a step leading up to social explosion and turmoil,
political crisis and alteration of the results of the elections.''
	   Khieu Sopheak said a lawsuit will be filed against Sam Rainsy
for entering the ministry compound without authorization.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack March 30,
1997, during a demonstration outside parliament. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy
himself. A bodyguard died shielding him from the blast.
	   No one was ever arrested. Sam Rainsy said at the time that he
suspected Hun Sen was behind the attack. Hun Sen briefly accused
Sam Rainsy of carrying it out himself.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday strongly
backed the U.S. attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan, calling them a
justified response to terrorism.
	   ``I believe that a country has the right to defend itself
against this scourge,'' Kohl told reporters.
	   In a statement earlier, Kohl called for ``resolute action by all
countries'' against terrorism and said Germany ``supports all
measures'' to combat it, including the U.S. raids in retaliation
for bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Kohl dismissed the notion that President Bill Clinton was trying
to divert attention from the scandal over his relationship with a
former White House intern.
	   ``The American president has a global responsibility like no one
else and he has to assume it, regardless of the domestic political
situation,'' he said.
	   The Clinton administration informed Germany about the attacks as
they began, he said.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also expressed unconditional
support for the U.S. attacks, and said he shared U.S. President
Clinton's view that this is ``not a conflict with Islam or
Afghanistan or Sudan, but with international terrorism alone.''
	   Kinkel said terrorism has been declared a threat to
international peace and security that should be denied any refuge
in at least 11 international conventions.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan which U.S.
President Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East
Africa.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him
``minutes before'' the raids to inform him of U.S. actions.
	   The statement said Museveni expressed strong support for the
action and added that Uganda has also been a target for terrorist
actions orchestrated by agents from Sudan.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether Albright also
telephoned Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi or Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa about the U.S. actions.
	   U.S. embassies in the capitals of both countries were the
targets two weeks ago of car-bombings in which 257 people died, all
but 10 of them in Kenya.
	   The White House said the U.S. raids were linked to the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam embassy bombings. Freeh, speaking to reporters at
the Nairobi airport before flying back to Washington, declined to
say whether evidence developed during U.S. investigations at the
bomb scenes led to the missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether the investigations had yielded
any specific proof linking renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden to the embassy attacks. He said ``many, many people in a
number of places'' could have been involved in planning the twin
bombings.
	   Nairobi residents were divided about the U.S. strikes on targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``I was delighted. I stayed up all last night watching TV. We
were waiting for this for a long time,'' said drama student George
Orido, 25.
	   ``We were waiting for this for a long time. I thought what they
did was actually insufficient. Let them do more.''
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude towards his religion and condemned the raids as
continuing the indiscriminate killing.
	   ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I
want to tell the Americans that they should just leave us Muslims
alone. If they would just leave us, there would be no fighting, no
killing,'' he said.
	   Meanwhle, the FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices
of the Saudi Arabian charity, Mercy International Relief Agency, in
connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers and
cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment.

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin strongly
denounced American attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan, telling reporters Friday that the U.S. action was
``indecent.''
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am indignant and I condemn (the bombings),'' Yeltsin said
upon arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to
attend naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
	   ``I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and that
means the whole world was unaware of that. And this makes the
strike even more indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United
States are in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he added. ``We have coordinated
and, without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on
the issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   He said Yeltsin's outrage was over not being informed. Russian
news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from U.S. President
Bill Clinton after the attack containing a detailed explanation of
the U.S. motivation.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
concern over the unilateral use of force. In the State Duma, the
lower house of Russian parliament, the criticism was sharper, with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov saying the United States
was ``moving toward a policy of state terrorism.''
	   The Duma also passed a resolution urging the government to
consider canceling a summit meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton
that is scheduled to be held in Moscow on Sept. 1-3.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the attacks.
	   From Murmansk, Yeltsin went to the nearby port of Severomorsk,
where he boarded the newly built, nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great, the pride of the Northern Fleet. He was to spend
the day observing exercises involving approximately 50 surface
warships and other air and sea forces.
	   He announced that he would take full, personal control soon over
military policy and over Russian arms exports, and promised to
ensure that members of the armed services are paid all back
salaries.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid president P. W.
Botha was found guilty Friday of ignoring a summons from a panel
investigating apartheid-era atrocities and was given a suspended
prison sentence and ordered to pay a fine.
	   The judgment was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is
black, bringing and end to a trial that has highlighted South
Africa's still simmering racial divisions.
	   Botha, 82, could have received up to two years in jail or an
unspecified fine for ignoring the subpoena from South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
	   The magistrate ordered Botha to pay a fine of 10,000 rands (dlrs
1,577) or spend 12 months in prison. He also gave Botha a 12-month
prison term suspended for five years on condition Botha comply with
any future summons.
	   ``Right through the proceedings, the accused has shown no
remorse,'' said the magistrate.
	   Botha, smiling and joking with friends after the sentencing,
left the courtroom without comment to reporters. He was jeered by
demonstrators outside as he left.
	   His lawyers filed a notice of appeal and Botha was released on a
bail of 50 rands (dlrs 8).
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison asked for a fine of 60,000 rands
(dlrs 9,463) and a prison sentence suspended on condition Both
comply with future summons.
	   The Human Rights Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which summoned Botha, has finished its hearings.
However, the commission's amnesty committee is still conducting
hearings and could summon Botha.
	   ``Had the accused been 30 or 40 years younger, the state would
have asked for imprisonment to be imposed,'' said Morrison. ``All
the fingers pointed in his direction at having been the person in
charge at a time when acts of torture were perpetrated.''
	   Defense attorney Lappe Laubscher called the state's
recommendation ``simply ludicrous.''
	   ``It would be entirely inappropriate,'' said Laubscher, who
cited Botha's age, ill health and status as a former president as
mitigating factors.
	   Botha ignored a summons to appear before the commission which
wanted to quiz him on his role as head of a shadowy inner Cabinet
that launched a violent crackdown on black liberation fighters in
the 1980s.
	   ``The failure of the accused to appear ... was unlawful,
intentional and without sufficient cause,'' the magistrate said in
his ruling, which took 50 minutes to read.
	   Lugaju also dismissed defense arguments that the summons was
technically flawed.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   However, the magistrate dismissed claims the commission was
prejudiced against Botha and said the panel had treated him with
great respect.
	   ``The commission went to great lengths to assist the accused and
meet his requirements,'' the magistrate said.
	   Lugaju also ruled that no agreement existed that allowed Botha
to submit written answers instead of appearing.
	   About 30 supporters of the governing African National Congress
party demonstrated outside the courthouse Friday chanting, ``Send
him to jail, send him to jail.''
	   The demonstrators, standing beyond the razor wire surrounding
the courthouse, carried placards and a banner. ``We can forgive him
for the past. Send him to jail for his arrogance,'' read one.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   Alex Boraine, the acting commission chairman, told reporters in
Cape Town the judgment demonstrates ``in a concrete way that we now
have a society in which no one is above the law.''
	   ``Mr. Botha has been publicly held accountable for his actions
in a court of law, and he has been afforded every opportunity to
defend himself -- something which was often denied to his political
opponents during the years of his rule,'' Boraine said.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989 when he
was ousted in internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   De Klerk later released Nelson Mandela from jail and began a
process of reform that culminated in the all-race elections of 1994
that ended white rule and made Mandela president.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a small
coastal town located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness and
240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Muslim leader killed in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A local Muslim leader was killed in a
car bombing on Friday in Russia's southern region of Dagestan
bordering the breakaway republic of Chechnya, officials said.
	   Mufti Said-Mohammad Abubakarov, Dagestan's Muslim leader, died
along with his brother when their car was blown up by a
radio-controlled bomb after a service at the main mosque in
Makhachkala, the regional capital.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and police
have refused to comment on who could be the perpetrators The
Interfax news agency said authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect, could be involved in the attack.
	   Abubakarov has been a long-time enemy of the Wahhabis. He once
said in an interview that every Muslim who killed a Wahhabi would
go to heaven.
	   There are 20,000 Wahhabis in Dagestan and they have already
seized full control over several villages in the central and
southern parts of the mountainous province on the Caspian Sea.
	   The Wahhabis said this week they would disobey the government,
and local officials responded by saying that they would use force
if the Wahhabis don't end their resistance.
	   Dagestan has been restive, plagued by frequent bombings,
kidnappings and other violence as numerous ethnic and religious
groups have fought for power.
	   There was no evidence that the Wahhabis have taken part in any
of the violent actions.
	   Dagestan's Wahhabis also have close ties with Chechnya. Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov recently launched a crackdown on the
Wahhabis, accusing them of trying to destabilize his government.

Yamazaki leads in New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAKONE, Japan (AP) _ Chikayo Yamazaki shot a 4-under-par 69
Friday to take a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the 60
million yen (dlrs 420,000) New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies.
	   Yamazaki, seeking her first victory of the season and eighth
overall, scored five birdies against a bogey over the hilly
6,662-yard (6,062-meter), par-73 Shizuoka Country Hamaoka Course.
	   ``I'm playing a better golf than I did earlier this season,''
said the 34-year-old Yamazaki. ``But I feel that I'm not even
halfway through my program to reform my game.''
	   Yamazaki has been in a slump since winning the Saishunkan Ladies
in March last year. She has tried to compensate by readjusting her
swing and game. Her best finish this season has been a tie for 14th
in the NEC Karuizawa last week.
	   Yamazaki said she started the program last year. ``So, I'm not
quite ready yet to compete with Pak Se-ri,'' she said, referring to
her decade-old plan to join the U.S. LPGA Tour.
	   Pak is a South Korean rookie on the U.S. tour who has won the
LPGA championship, the U.S. Women's Open and so far two more titles
this summer.
	   Yamazaki started the round with consecutive birdies on Nos. 10
and 11 but bogeyed the par-4 14th. She then sank three more
birdies, on the 18th, 4th and 5th holes.
	   Hiromi Takamura, Yoko Inoue and Aki Takamura shot 3-under 70s.
	   Fuki Kido, winner of the Mizuno ladies two weeks ago, fired a 71
and shared fifth with Chihiro Furukawa and Mayumi Inoue.
	   Defending champion Takayo Bando shot a level-par 73 and was in a
group of 14 sharing 13th.

Mandela to host Congo peace summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ As a war in Congo threatens to
engulf other countries, President Nelson Mandela is set to host
peace talks between the presidents of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda, his
spokesman said Friday.
	   The meeting involving Mandela, Congo President Laurent Kabila,
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu was planned for Saturday in Pretoria, the capital,
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana told the South African Press
Association.
	   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has also been invited to
Saturday's meeting.
	   It was to be followed Sunday by a full meeting of Southern
African Development Community on the crisis in Central Africa,
Mankahlana said.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels, while
Zimbabwe has already reportedly sent military advisers and
technicians to support Kabila.
	   South Africa has ruled out military intervention in Congo. Top
South African officials have spent the past week trying to work out
a negotiated solution.

Russian priest held on suspicion of killing two parishioners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian Orthodox priest has been jailed on
suspicion of killing two of his elderly parishioners near the altar
of his church, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The bodies of the two parishioners _ Vera Saprunova, 79, and
Raisa Cherednichenko, 63 _ were found in front of a large crucifix
near the altar of the Church of the Transfiguration in the western
Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, the daily Moscow Times reported.
	   The women had been guarding the church on the night of the July
25 when they were killed, it said.
	   Police arrested the parish priest, Father Yevgeny Saprunov, last
Friday, Novokuznetsk deputy prosecutor Anatoly Polozov was quoted
as saying. Saprunov is not believed to be related to Saprunova, the
victim.
	   Saprunov has denied involvement, and said that at the time of
the killing he was asleep in a small house near the church. Two
parishioners verified this, the Moscow Times said.
	   The two women appeared to have been stabbed with a ceremonial
spear that is kept near the altar, investigators said. Police
believe the killing may have been a ritual murder, but more likely
was committed for some other, unspecified reason, Polozov said.
	   A commission of Russian Orthodox Church officials, led by the
Bishop Sofrony of Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk, was in the city to
look into the matter, the report said.

U.S. criticized for attacks on Sudan, Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Bombings, Sudan-US
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on
crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting
Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``Down, Down USA!'' and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!'' the crowd
chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square
in the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders
and many citizens roundly criticized Thursday's American attacks on
a factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama
bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to
the United States, but even in perceived U.S. allies like Saudi
Arabia, some people said the attack would add to and not lessen the
threat against Americans.
	   U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of
reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned. U.S.
officials said the factory in Sudan made chemical weapons agents;
Sudan maintains it's a pharmaceutical plant.
	   Clinton's actions were widely seen by Arabs as an effort to
distract public opinion in the United States from his travails over
a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against
Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir
daily in Lebanon said.
	   A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said
that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world
after Clinton has discovered Osama bin laden's dishdasha (Arab
robe).''
	   In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the
American campaign ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless
action.''
	   She added: ``This violence will only beget more violence.''
	   In the Palestinian territories, Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian
negotiator with Israel, also said he feared the U.S. strikes would
provoke more fury against the United States.
	   Kuwaiti Najeeb al-Othman, a 38-year-old civil engineer, termed
the American strikes ``useless cowboy-like retaliation.''
	   ``These people (extremists) are like ghosts,'' he added. ``How
can you fight ghosts?''
	   An official of the Arab League, which is usually measured in its
comments on the United States, also called the attack rash.
	   ``The American action was carried out in a Rambo style and will
not resolve the problem of international terrorism,'' said league
Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed Zakariya Ismail.
	   Several countries _ notably Persian Iran _ warned, too, that the
U.S. attacks could backfire by raising Muslim ire and drawing
retaliation.
	   ``We condemned the killing of innocent people in the embassy
bombings in Africa,'' Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said
in a sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran. ``But those bombings do
not justify that innocent Muslims should die in Afghanistan.''
	   He added that the results of the American strikes ``will be to
increase hatred toward the United States.''
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told
state-run radio that the Americans had a ``double standard'' on
terrorism.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Mohammadi said.
	   Both Libya and Iran are accused by the United States of being
terrorist-sponsoring states, an allegation they've repeatedly
denied.
	   As Gadhafi was leading the rally _ dressed in a khaki camouflage
uniform _ a statement from the Libyan People's Unity Committee, a
government-organized body, accused the United States of
``state-sponsored terrorism.''
	   In Iraq, which charges the United States is working to prolong
U.N. trade sanctions on the country, Sheik Abdel-Latif Hmayem used
his nationally televised Friday sermon to characterize Clinton as
``a clown'' and an enemy of Islam.
	   ``He is a professional criminal who, whenever a star rises in
the skies of Arabism and Islam, tries to pull it down,'' he said.
``The target is our Islam, our Arab identity.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A woman discovered living at a drug
rehabilitation center in central Thailand is apparently a German
national who was reported missing about four years ago, Thai police
said Friday.
	   Maj. Gen. Chainarong Watcharanand, Saraburi province police
commander, told The Associated Press Friday the woman carried a
German passport identifying her as Yvonne Rickert, 36, and showing
she had entered Thailand in 1993. He said her visa to stay in the
country had long since expired.
	   Thai newspapers on Friday morning had published photos of a
blond woman they said had been staying for several years at Tham
Krabok Buddhist temple in Saraburi province, 90 kilometers (56
miles) north of Bangkok.
	   The reports said she appeared to be mentally unstable and had
been the victim of repeated sexual assaults.
	   The temple hosts a well-known center for curing drug addicts
through withdrawal and the administration of herbal and emetic
medicines.
	   A preliminary investigation led police to believe she had been
brought to the monastery by her brother, and had been suffering
from mental illness before she had arrived, said Chainarong.
	   An aide to Chainarong said the embassy of the Netherlands had
sent a letter to the temple as long ago as 1994 seeking to learn if
Rickert was there.
	   He said temple authorities claimed they did not give a positive
response because they knew the woman only by the name Eva. It was
not clear why the Dutch Embassy would be interested in her
whereabouts.
	   Chainarong said a task force has been set up to look into the
woman's background and investigate the alleged attacks on her. She
told them of such attacks but did not provide details.
	   He described the woman as ``mentally disturbed'' and said she
couldn't respond to questions very well.
	   He said that while the woman carries a German passport, it was
possible she was a Dutch citizen as well, so both the German and
the Dutch embassies had been contacted. Officials at the two
embassies could not be reached for comment
	   The task force would consider what to do with the woman, he
said. When interviewed by police, she appeared to be fearful of
leaving and refused to go to a hospital, he said.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The largest country in Africa, Sudan has
had a long-simmering conflict with the United States over its
Islamic government.
	   Sudan, one of the continent's poorest countries, has been bogged
down in a 15-year civil war in the south that has left 1.5 million
people dead from the fighting and ensuing famines.
	   Ever since the country's independence in 1956, the country
repeatedly has been torn by dissension between the south _ largely
African, Christian and animist _ and the Arab and Muslim north.
	   The current Islamic government, which took power in a 1989 coup,
has been clear in its hostility toward Washington.
	   ``America incarnates the devil for Muslims,'' Hassan Turabi,
Sudan's Islamic leader, told The Associated Press in an interview
last year. ``When I say Muslims, I mean all the Muslims in the
world.''
	   Turabi is believed to be the power behind the government of
President Omar Hassan el-Bashir.
	   Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a
major sponsor of international terrorism, spent about four years in
Sudan. He left in 1995 after Western countries pressured the
government to force him out. Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan,
where he was a leader in the Muslim fight against Soviet domination
of the country.
	   There are reports Sudan also has sheltered pro-Iranian groups
and Islamic militants fighting the secular regime of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Sudan has been on Washington's list of states sponsoring
terrorism since 1993. Washington has frozen Sudanese assets in the
United States, blocked trade with Sudan and banned U.S. investments
in the country in an effort to limit the government's power.
	   The United States cut all but humanitarian aid to Sudan in 1989.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sudan recalling diplomats from Washington,
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By MOHAMMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were
injured in the raid, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be
trapped under the debris.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to
protest the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum
in 1996.
	   Sudanese officials charged that President Clinton ordered the
missile attack to distract attention from his troubles in the
Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said on state-run Sudan Television that
Clinton was a ``liar and morally decrepit.'' He said Sudan was
recalling its diplomats from Washington.
	   He also warned that Sudan ``reserves the right to respond to the
American attack using all necessary measures,'' Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Friday.
	   ``We will retain the right to protest, and will ask the Security
Council to investigate the truth ... about this factory,''
el-Bashir said on Sudanese television.
	   He said he would call for an emergency meeting of the council to
discuss the U.S. attack and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to send a delegation to Sudan to investigate whether the plant was
used to produce chemical weapons.
	   The television said the factory produced about 50 percent of the
country's pharmaceuticals.

New souring of China-Taiwan relations casts pall over meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan urged China to ``face the fact'' of
their political division Friday, amid a new souring of relations
that has cast a shadow over an upcoming meeting between their top
negotiators.
	   Responding to new demands from China that Taipei accept
Beijing's sovereignty over it, official Sheu Ke-sheng said
separation between the sides was a ``political reality and
historical fact.''
	   ``Since 1949, the territory of China has been divided between
two equal political entities,'' said Sheu, secretary general of the
Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   In another sign of added stress in their already strained
relationship, Taiwanese immigration officials rejected applications
from 13 Chinese scholars to attend a conference on Taiwan-China
relations in Taipei, saying ``scholarship on the cross-straits
issue at this stage attracts much political controversy,'' the
United Evening News reported.
	   In a letter Friday, China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait expressed its strong opposition to the concepts of
``separate governments on the two sides of the straits,'' and
``temporary two Chinas.''
	   The association again demanded Taiwan agree to negotiations on
an agenda for discussing political topics related to reunification,
an idea Taiwan rejects in favor of first crafting agreements on
practical issues.
	   Taiwan and China separated politically in 1949 when the
Nationalists fled the communist takeover of the mainland, and
Beijing continues to claim Taiwan as a breakaway province to be
reunified with eventually.
	   While rejecting the letter's content, Sheu said the dispute
should not affect plans for a casual meeting in September or
October in Beijing between the sides' top negotiators.
	   Expectations for the long awaited meeting between Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation and his
ARATS counterpart Wang Daohan have come under a cloud in recent
weeks following the murder of a Taiwanese politician in China.
	   Beijing's refusal to allow foundation officials to accompany the
victim's relatives to help with arrangements reawakened anger here
over Beijing's perceived callous treatment of Taiwanese in China.

Afghanistan: impoverished, remote, but long a favorite of warriors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Bombings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan was a natural choice as a
target of U.S. air strikes against suspected Islamic militants
believed linked to bombings at U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   A remote mountainous nation in the embrace of fundamentalist
Islam, Afghanistan has long been a second home to Osama bin Laden,
the Islamic militant whose followers were the focus of the attacks.
	   It's also a place where the Saudi-born bin Laden, armed with a
hefty checkbook and an AK-47, made his name as a protector of the
faith.
	   War has torn the central Asian nation since 1979, when Soviet
troops invaded to oust one leftist leader, replace him with another
and touch off popular resistance among traditionalist,
anti-communist Afghans, whose forces were aided by thousands of
like-minded Arabs, including bin Laden, who flocked to the
battlefront.
	   In 1989, a beleaguered Soviet Union finally withdrew its troops
from Afghanistan, and three years later the Moscow-allied
government collapsed under pressure from Islamic rebel forces.
	   Because of ethnic and other quarrels, the victorious rebels soon
fell to fighting among themselves, in a sporadic war that now
appears near its end with a final triumph for the extreme
fundamentalists of the Taliban movement.
	   Wedged between the Indian subcontinent, the Russian realm, China
and Iran, the Afghan valleys have for centuries been an Asian
crossroads of trade and conquest.
	   Afghanistan's 24 million people are among the world's poorest,
millions eking out a living _ when cease-fires allow _ by farming
and raising sheep and goats. Its paltry exports include handwoven
carpets, some gems, fruits and nuts.
	   At the height of the war, one-third of the population had fled
the country.
	   Afghanistan, in size slightly smaller than France, is believed
to be the world's second-largest producer of illicit opium and is a
major source of hashish.

Chinese president cancels Russia, Japan trips over flooding

presidents, foreign minister explaining postponement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Friday postponed
trips next month to Japan and Russia to deal with calamitous floods
in central and northeast China.
	   Both visits had been in the works for months. Jiang's trip to
Japan, scheduled for Sept. 6-11, would have been the first by a
Chinese president and was aimed at smoothing often testy relations
between the East Asian powers.
	   Annual meetings between Jiang and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin since 1994 have helped build cooperative, steady relations
between Beijing and Moscow, rivals for the allegiances of the
socialist world throughout much of the Cold War.
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met separately with the Russian
and Japanese ambassadors to explain the postponement and gave them
letters Jiang wrote to Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Tang described the flooding along the Yangtze and northeastern
rivers as the worst since the Communist Party came to power 49
years ago, and he added there is no end in sight, Xinhua said.
	   ``Under these conditions, President Jiang must remain at home to
handle urgent problems of flood control and emergency relief,''
Xinhua quoted Tang as saying.
	   Both visits will be rescheduled, Tang said.

Philippines criticizes IMF official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank on Friday
criticized the International Monetary Fund's representative in
Manila, Henri Lorie, for expressing pessimism on the country's
economy.
	   Lorie said Wednesday the Philippines would be ``lucky'' if it
achieved growth of 1 percent this year because of poor agricultural
production, which fell 7.2 percent during the first half of 1998,
the worst record in 20 years.
	   His forecast is shared by many private sector economists.
	   The Philippine government, however, sees the country's gross
national product as growing 2 percent to 3 percent in 1998. The
central bank has said it believes this target is attainable.
	   The bank's policy-making board passed a resolution Friday
expressing ``great disappointment'' over Lorie's ``speculative
remarks.''
	   Lorie's remarks were ``clearly premature and baseless at this
point,'' the central bank added.
	   The government and an IMF monitoring team are scheduled to
review on Aug. 26 recent economic developments.
	   Numerous economic and fiscal targets were set for the
Philippines to tap a dlrs 1.4 billion IMF precautionary loan
facility to be used to help defend the peso in the event of a heavy
speculative attack.
	   The central bank said this was the first time it had formally
expressed ``strong displeasure'' over the actions of an IMF
representative. But, it added, Lorie had in the past been
``privately cautioned on the possible misinterpretation of his
public statements.''
	   The Philippines was the IMF's first patient in Asia over three
decades ago. Earlier this year, the country finally graduated from
a succession of borrowing programs with the IMF.
	   The precautionary arrangement, which is a standby loan facility,
has somewhat laxer conditions attached to it than fully-fledged
borrowing programs.
	   ``By and large, the IMF has played a constructive role in the
Philippines,'' the central bank said.
	   ``However, the recent statements attributed to Mr Lorie, which
unnecessarily undermine confidence at a sensitive period, are
distinctly unhelpful and counter-productive to the country's and
even the IMF's interests,'' it said.
	   Earlier, Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said Lorie's
``irresponsible forecast'' could affect the market.
	   ``We are a very well-behaved economy,'' Medalla said. ``They can
suggest changes but they cannot force them on us.''

Government to return confiscated Jewish properties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government ordered that four
buildings, part of the property confiscated from Jews during and
after World War II, be turned over to the Jewish community, an
official said Friday.
	   The order issued by the government Thursday will come into force
next week, said cabinet spokesman Gabriel Piscociu.
	   ``This is a positive decision,'' said Iulian Sorin, a leader of
the Romanian Federation of Jewish Communities, which represents the
interests of the country's 12,000 Jews.
	   The buildings, located in the cities of Bacau, Brasov and
Cluj-Napoca, had housed schools and a Jewish ritual bath.
	   The first buildings were returned in April 1997, when six
structures were handed over to the Jewish community. No others have
been returned since that time.
	   The community claims that more than 5,000 buildings were
confiscated. They estimate both individual and communal property
was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   No one is sure how many of those buildings are still standing
today.
	   About half of the 850,000 Jews living in Romania before World
War II were killed by the Nazis. Romania was allied with Nazi
Germany during the war.
	   Most of the Jews who survived left after the communists came to
power in 1945. Their assets were confiscated by the pro-Nazi and
communist governments.
	   After the December 1989 overthrow of communism, the new
government agreed to return some of the confiscated property.
	   The government also decided Thursday to return a building to the
Hungarian community, which belonged to the Reformat Church in the
city of Cluj-Napoca during World War II.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition Friday
accused the country's leaders of trying to kill prominent dissident
Sam Rainsy in a grenade attack and vowed to take their challenge
against alleged election fraud to the streets.
	   Sam Rainsy and three other leading opposition figures, appearing
at a news conference, urged the international community to withdraw
the endorsement it has bestowed on parliamentary elections last
month won by strongman Hun Sen.
	   The leaders said they would go ahead with a massive planned
protest Sunday against alleged election-stealing by Hun Sen and
announced they would hold daily demonstrations afterward.
	   ``Our only channel to express our discontent is in the street,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``On Sunday, on Monday, maybe one on Tuesday ...
it will be continuous until the protests are investigated.''
	   The grenade attack, which killed one person, and protests show
Cambodia is no closer to a peaceful resolution of its post-election
instability and that things may be getting worse.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon urged
calm on both sides: ``Heightened political tension in the country
would only contribute to the perception of instability.''
	   Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the main opposition
leaders, have refused to recognize Hun Sen's slight majority
victory in the 122-seat National Assembly, short of the two-thirds
needed to form a government.
	   They threaten to withhold their support until the alleged
election irregularities are probed. The Hun Sen-controlled National
Election Committee has refuse to look into their complaints.
	   Ahmad Yahya, a member of Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party,
told the news conference that government leaders were behind the
grenade attack. His suspicions are widely shared, though he
presented no proof.
	   ``Last night shows they want to kill Mr. Sam Rainsy,'' Ahmad
Yahya said. ``The leaders of our country look at him as the enemy,
so therefore, according to information from different sources, they
want to kill him.''
	   Sam Rainsy was leading a sleep-in protest Thursday at the
election committee's headquarters, inside the Interior Ministry
compound, when several shots were fired and a grenade was tossed
from a passing car.
	   The grenade did not clear the wall and exploded outside it,
killing Sieng Sean, 45, a driver for Kyodo News agency of Japan.
Sam Rainsy was unharmed. There were no reports of injuries.
	   ``I think the attackers may want to scare people from
participating in Sunday's demonstration,'' a shaken Sam Rainsy told
reporters after he was released Friday morning by Interior Ministry
guards.
	   He had been interrogated for several hours and held at gunpoint.
At one point, a warning shot was fired between his legs.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak suggested that Sam
Rainsy was responsible, calling the attack ``too coincidental.''
	   Sunday's protest would be ``illegal,'' Khieu Sopheak said,
calling it ``a step leading up to social explosion and turmoil,
political crisis and alteration of the results of the elections.''
	   Khieu Sopheak said a lawsuit will be filed against Sam Rainsy
for entering the ministry compound without authorization.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack March 30,
1997, during a demonstration outside parliament. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy
himself. A bodyguard died shielding him from the blast.
	   No one was ever arrested. Sam Rainsy said at the time that he
suspected Hun Sen was behind the attack. Hun Sen briefly accused
Sam Rainsy of carrying it out himself.

Taiwanese businesses report millions in damage from China floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese businesses in southeastern China
have sustained over U.S. dlrs 24 million in damage from the worst
flooding on the Yangtze River in 44 years, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Businesses located in industrial parks in badly flooded Jiangxi
province downstream on the river suffered the worst losses, while a
food processing plant belonging to Taiwan's Weichuan Food Corp. in
the industrial center of Wuhan suffered over U.S. dlrs 200,000 in
damage, the China Times Express reported.
	   Taiwanese have invested an estimated U.S. dlrs 30 billion in
China, sinking much of it in densely populated areas along the
Yangtze. Reports of damage were to Taiwanese businesses are still
being received, the paper said.
	   Heavier than usual rains have caused successive waves of
flooding in China this summer that have killed over 2,000 people
and left millions homeless. China's state media has said damage
from the floods will surpass U.S. dlrs 24 billion.
	   The floods, which have affected 240 million Chinese, nearly a
fifth of the population, could shave half a percentage point off
the economic growth this year, Beijing's official Xinhua News
Agency reported earlier this month.

France on U.S. strikes: terrorist bombings ``could not remain
</HEADLINE>
unanswered''
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from French prime minister,

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Friday said the United States was
justified in bombing sites linked to terrorists who allegedly
bombed two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
	   ``We must give determined and firm responses against terrorists
there where they strike. Taking it from there, one can
understand,'' the American raids, said Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
	   The French prime minister also stressed that France wanted to
make sure that any strikes against terrorists were carried out in
accordance with international law.
	   For its part, the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement
expressing France's ``indignation after the attacks carried out in
Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salam. Such acts must not remain unanswered and
their plotters must be taken out of commission.
	   ``In that regard, France takes note of the decision by American
authorities who proceeded with bombardments yesterday by invoking
the right to legitimate defense recognized by international law,''
the ministry said.
	   The U.S. air strikes on Thursday evening hit a suspected Islamic
militant base in Afghanistan and a factory in Khartoum, Sudan that
Washington said manufactured ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   ``France strongly condemns terrorism wherever it happens and in
whatever form,'' the Foreign Ministry statement said. ``The
struggle against terrorism, the support it benefits from, must
mobilize the entire international community. It is up to each
country to mobilize the means necessary in that struggle.''
	   The leftist daily Liberation was less charitable toward
Clinton's decision to authorize the strikes, which the newspaper
said were timed to deflect attention from the president's troubles
with Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``How many (people) will be persuaded that under the cover of
defending the Star Spangled Banner, the American president wasn't
just looking to bury once and for all the Monica Lewinsky affair
and to shut up the unbearable Prosecutor Kenneth Starr.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Friday defended
the devaluation of the ruble before a hostile parliament, dominated
by Communists and other hardliners who reiterated their call for
the government's ouster.
	   ``We can't afford the luxury of being a popular government,''
Kiriyenko said in a 10-minute speech before the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, which convened an emergency session to
discuss the crisis.
	   Kiriyenko accused the Duma of dragging its feet on approving a
series of government-proposed steps to boost revenues and said the
lawmakers' indecision precipitated the latest financial crisis.
	   ``Let's honestly recognize that there is no political force in
the country that is ready to undertake political responsibility for
the economy in crisis,'' he said, drawing angry shouts from the
Communists and their allies.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who took the floor shortly
afterward, assailed the government, saying it had ``put the country
on the verge of a precipice.''
	   ``Russia has devalued itself to the point where a single
multibillionaire can buy it,'' he said. ``This is the full collapse
of the course carried out in the past seven years.''
	   Zyuganov repeated his long-time call for Yeltsin to step down
and proposed a vote of no-confidence in Kiriyenko's cabinet. The
Duma later voted 248-32 to approve a non-binding resolution calling
on the president to step down.
	   ``The president has failed to take steps ... to take the country
out of financial and economic crisis that now threatens Russia's
national security, territorial integrity and independence,'' it
read.
	   Yeltsin, who went to watch maneuvers of Russia's Northern Fleet
on Friday, reacted calmly to the Duma's action, dismissing it as a
``routine'' procedure.
	   The Duma has set a panel to prepare legal grounds for Yeltsin's
impeachment earlier this summer. Once the panel finishes its work,
two thirds of the Duma's 450 members must vote to formally launch
the motion, which would then go to Russia's high courts and the
upper chamber.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament and the motion is expected to
fizzle, as have previous attempts.
	   During the parliament debates, all Duma factions, including the
pro-government Our Home Is Russia group, called for Kiriyenko's
resignation. The premier greeted the call with a dismissive smile
and urged lawmakers to approve government-proposed fiscal steps in
his final remarks.
	   ``It's very unpleasant to take responsibility for the unpopular
actions, but there is no pleasant and popular way out of the
crisis,'' he said.
	   The government has long asked the Duma to meet and consider a
package of austerity measures aimed at boosting revenues, but
lawmakers have resisted. They convened Friday's emergency session
in response to the government's announcement Monday of a
devaluation of the ruble of up to 34 percent against the U.S.
dollar, along with other emergency moves.
	   He dismissed accusations that the government had failed to warn
the nation about the devaluation and said that along the suspension
of dent owed on treasuries it was the only way to pay long-time
wage debts to millions of Russians.
	   The ruble fell slightly on Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange to 7.005 to the dollar on Friday against 6.995
the previous day. The government has allowed the ruble to plunge as
low as 9.5 rubles a dollar before the end of the year, but promised
that it would stabilize at around 7 for the time being.
	   Street exchange rates plummeted to 9.5 rubles a dollar earlier
this week, but rose to 7.5-8 in recent days as the Central Bank
tightened control over banks.
	   Lawmakers weren't expected to tackle any of the government bills
on Friday. Instead, Zyuganov said the Duma is likely to consider a
no-confidence motion in Kiriyenko's cabinet as early as next week.
	   The Duma needs a simple majority to approve the motion, but it
wouldn't oblige Yeltsin to act. If the Duma passes a second
no-confidence motion within three months, the president would have
the choice of dismissing the cabinet or disbanding the parliament.

	   JEUMERANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Grieving widows and torture victims
looked on as investigators Friday dug up three sets of bones from
remote grave sites thought to contain the remains dozens of Islamic
separatists and others killed by Indonesian troops.
	   Two skeletons had holes in their skulls, probably from bullets,
forensic doctors said.
	   One, a male, was dressed only in his underwear. He had been
blindfolded, his arms bound behind his back by an army belt.
	   Indonesian troops are accused of committing atrocities,
including arbitrary killings and torture, during the late 1980s and
1990s in the northernmost province of Aceh, on Sumatra island about
1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The separatists, whose numbers have now dwindled, were crushed
when they fought to set up their own independent Muslim state.
	   A four-man team from Indonesia's National Human Rights
commission and a group of volunteers with shovels were led to
several alleged mass graves by villagers. All remains were buried
less than 60 centimeters (two feet) below the surface.
	   Hundreds watched the grisly investigation. Among the crowd were
dozens of sobbing widows, many wearing Islamic headscarves.
	   The team said it would only take samples of human remains from
several grave sites, which locals allege contain dozens of
skeletons.
	   The bones will be subjected to forensic tests to determine
whether they were of execution victims, officials said. Mass
exhumations would be made later.
	   The team declined to comment to repeated claims by villagers
that the Indonesian army was responsible.
	   ``We are still investigating. It is too early to say who did
this,'' said Koesparmono Irsan, a member of the team.
	   A third set of human remains, thought to be of a human hand,
were found buried behind a remote traditional house that villagers
said had been a base for special forces troops, known as Kopassus.
	   Witnesses told the investigators the house had been used as a
torture center.
	   One woman, Halima Mardia, 22, sobbed as she recounted how troops
sexually assaulted her and beat her husband there four years ago
when they were arrested as suspected separatists.
	   ``I never saw my husband again,'' she said, adding that she was
pregnant at the time.
	   The Indonesian media have widely reported allegations of mass
graves by villagers. Some have said they were forced at gunpoint to
bury the bodies of people executed by troops.
	   Earlier, the secretary general of the National Human Rights
Commission, Baharuddin Lopa, who is heading the investigative team
in Aceh, said his group wanted to confirm whether mass graves
existed.
	   ``We will collect information about human rights abuses in this
province by digging these areas and by talking with the victims'
families, eyewitnesses and non-governmental organizations,'' he
told the official Antara news agency.
	   Lopa said more grave sites would be examined during the next few
days, including one site nicknamed ``Skull Hill.''
	   He said his team would then submit its findings to the
government of President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``Local villagers saw trucks full of bodies go to the grave
sites and then come back empty,'' said Muhamad Harun, a human
rights activist, of events a decade ago.
	   The investigation into the Aceh graves is the latest sign of a
new openness in Indonesia following the resignation of former
autocratic President Suharto after nationwide riots in May.
	   His successor, Habibie has promised greater human rights for
Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   In a state-of-the-nation address to Parliament last Saturday he
made an unprecedented apology for abuses committed during his
predecessor's 32-year reign.
	   Indonesia's military commander Gen. Wiranto has also publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh.
	   Since Suharto's resignation the powerful military has faced a
barrage of allegations of past wrongdoing and is currently the
subject of two major inquires over the shooting and abduction of
anti-Suharto activists.
	   In a gesture of conciliation, the military began withdrawing
troops from Aceh on Thursday when about 250 soldiers left. Another
800 are slated to go on Aug. 31.

Ex-gov't officials appeal ``dirty war'' conviction before Spanish
</HEADLINE>
Court &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two former Spanish government officials
convicted of ``dirty war'' activities against Basque separatists
lodged appeals before the Constitutional Court on Friday.
	   National radio said the appeals were signed by former Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a qualified lawyer, indicating he
intended forming part of the two ex-officials' defense.
	   The Supreme Court handed down 10-year jail terms against Jose
Luis Barrionuevo, an Interior Minister under Gonzalez, and his
former aide Rafael Vera for the 1983 kidnapping of a businessman
who was mistaken for a Basque separatist hitman and held for 10
days.
	   Ten other former officials who had pleaded guilty got lesser
sentences.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to the so-called
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, of GAL, death squads that killed
27 people between 1983 and 1987 in a drive against members and
sympathizers of the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   Many of the victims turned out to be mistaken targets.
	   Gonzalez, a Socialist who was premier from 1982 to 1996, has
long denied allegations that his government ran the death squads.
An investigating magistrate for the Supreme Court concluded in 1996
that there was insufficient evidence to try Gonzalez himself in the
kidnapping case.
	   One of Spain's most popular and astute politicians, Gonzalez
surprised many last month when he re-enrolled as a lawyer so he
could take part in the defense of his former subordinates.
	   Political parties accuse him of trying to put pressure on the
Constitutional Court, many of whose judges were appointed while
Gonzalez was in office.
	   News reports said Barrionuveo and Vera's defense will argue that
the Supreme Court had insufficient proof to reach a guilty verdict.
Four of the 11 Supreme court judges who deliberated the case
declared both Barrionuevo and Vera innocent.
	   Gonzalez alleged that the court had come under political
pressure from the current conservative government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and that the convictions were ``radically
unjust.''

Yeltsin condemns U.S. attacks; says failure to inform was

<TEXT>
	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin strongly
denounced American attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan, telling reporters Friday that the U.S. action was
``indecent.''
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am indignant and I condemn (the bombings),'' Yeltsin said
upon arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to
attend naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
	   ``I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and that
means the whole world was unaware of that. And this makes the
strike even more indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United
States are in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he added. ``We have coordinated
and, without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on
the issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   He said Yeltsin's outrage was over not being informed. Russian
news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from U.S. President
Bill Clinton after the attack containing a detailed explanation of
the U.S. motivation.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
concern over the unilateral use of force.
	   ``Only concerted actions by the entire international community
may effectively counteract terrorism,'' the ministry was quoted as
saying by Interfax news agency.
	   In the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, the
criticism was sharper, with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
saying the United States was ``moving toward a policy of state
terrorism.''
	   The Duma also passed a resolution urging the government to
consider canceling a summit meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton
that is scheduled to be held in Moscow on Sept. 1-3. The Duma also
hinted that it may again postpone ratification of the START-II arms
reduction treaty.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the attacks.
	   From Murmansk, Yeltsin went to the nearby port of Severomorsk,
where he boarded the newly built, nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great, the pride of the Northern Fleet. He was to spend
the day observing exercises involving approximately 50 surface
warships and other air and sea forces.
	   He announced that he would take full, personal control soon over
military policy and over Russian arms exports, and promised to
ensure that members of the armed services are paid all back
salaries.

Muslim leader killed in southern Russia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Muslim leader in new grafs 5-6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A local Muslim leader was killed in a
car bombing on Friday in Russia's southern region of Dagestan
bordering the breakaway republic of Chechnya, officials said.
	   Mufti Said-Mohammad Abubakarov, Dagestan's Muslim leader, died
along with his brother when their car was blown up by a
radio-controlled bomb after a service at the main mosque in
Makhachkala, the regional capital.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and police
have refused to comment on who could be the perpetrators. The
Interfax news agency said authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect, could be involved in the attack.
	   Abubakarov has been a long-time enemy of the Wahhabis. He once
said in an interview that every Muslim who killed a Wahhabi would
go to heaven.
	   Ravil Gainutdin, the Mufti of Moscow and western Russia, called
Abubakarov's killing a ``tragedy for all Russia'' and described him
as a ``peaceful and reasonable man,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Gainutdin added that Abubakarov had told him recently that he
had to constantly change cars. ``That means he felt the danger,''
Gainutdin said.
	   There are 20,000 Wahhabis in Dagestan and they have already
seized full control over several villages in the central and
southern parts of the mountainous province on the Caspian Sea.
	   The Wahhabis said this week they would disobey the government,
and local officials responded by saying that they would use force
if the Wahhabis don't end their resistance.
	   Dagestan has been restive, plagued by frequent bombings,
kidnappings and other violence as numerous ethnic and religious
groups have fought for power.
	   There was no evidence that the Wahhabis have taken part in any
of the violent actions.
	   Dagestan's Wahhabis also have close ties with Chechnya. Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov recently launched a crackdown on the
Wahhabis, accusing them of trying to destabilize his government.

Mandela to host Congo peace summit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Namibian defense minister, Rwandan
ambassador; ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ As a war in Congo threatens to
engulf other countries, President Nelson Mandela is set to host
peace talks between the presidents of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda, his
spokesman said Friday.
	   The meeting involving Mandela, Congo President Laurent Kabila,
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu was planned for Saturday in Pretoria, the capital, said
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahla.
	   Mankahlana said there was an agreement in principle from all the
parties to attend.
	   Rwandan Ambassador Ben Karenzi, meanwhile, told journalists in
Johannesburg that Rwandan government troops were ready to go into
Congo to protect ``Rwanda's vital interest in eastern Congo.''
	   Karenzi called on Mandela to convince Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam Nujoma to withdraw their
military support for Kabila.
	   ``The alternative is a bloodbath,'' Karenzi said.
	   The rebellion in Congo has already caused aftershocks beyond the
borders of the central African country.
	   _Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels.
	   _Zimbabwe has reportedly already sent military advisers and
technicians to support Kabila.
	   _Namibia has pledged logistical support like food and medicine
to Kabila. Namibian Defense Minister Erriki Nghitima refused to
comment Friday on a newspaper report that two Boeings had landed in
Namibia last weekend to pick up arms and ammunition for Kabila's
forces.
	   The meeting was to be followed Sunday by a full meeting of
Southern African Development Community on the crisis in Central
Africa, Mankahlana said.
	   The 14-member SADC summit is aimed at resolving the split on how
best to deal with the crisis. Its members include Namibia, Zimbabwe
and South Africa.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were
injured in the raid, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be
trapped under the debris.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to
protest the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum
in 1996.
	   Sudanese officials charged that President Clinton ordered the
missile attack to distract attention from his troubles in the
Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said on state-run Sudan Television that
Clinton was a ``liar and morally decrepit.'' He said Sudan was
recalling its diplomats from Washington.
	   He also warned that Sudan ``reserves the right to respond to the
American attack using all necessary measures,'' Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Friday.
	   ``We will retain the right to protest, and will ask the Security
Council to investigate the truth ... about this factory,''
el-Bashir said on Sudanese television.
	   He said he would call for an emergency meeting of the council to
discuss the U.S. attack and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to send a delegation to Sudan to investigate whether the plant was
used to produce chemical weapons.
	   The television said the factory produced about 50 percent of the
country's pharmaceuticals.

	   Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and
chanted angry slogans Friday across Pakistan. Many of the protests
were called by conservative Islamic parties who have condemned the
U.S. military attacks on bases linked to Osama Bin Laden. U.S.
President Bill Clinton said investigators had determined bin Laden
was behind the Aug. 7 bombings on two U.S. embassies in East Africa
that killed 257 people.
	   The United Nations closed its offices and directed its American
and other foreign staff to stay home for their own safety.
	   The U.S. State Department had recalled all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families Monday and warned other
Americans to leave the country. Many Americans who had stayed when
their government first advised them to depart are now flying out,
some catching flights early Friday morning.
	   But Dale Sinkler, president of an American-owned power company
operating in Pakistan, said he was inclined to stay. He said 13
foreign staff left after Monday's warning, but he and a British
colleague stayed.
	   ``We came over here to Pakistan knowing the risks, and we want
to be in Pakistan. I don't think it sends the right message to pull
out,'' he said.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said Americans had been
issued no additional warnings since the strikes on Afghanistan,
adding ``we're still operating under the previous advisory that
Americans should consider leaving.''
	   Hoagland said he had no numbers on how many of the estimated
6,700 Americans living in Pakistan have left.
	   Police rolled out barbed wire outside the American cultural
center, where Hoagland has his office, during Friday's
demonstration. Dozens of Pakistani police and a few paramilitary
troops stood guard, some on the roof of the center. Across town,
more police officers stood guard at the U.S. Embassy.

Chechyna says it's establishing relations with Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of Chechnya, whose independence is
not officially recognized by any country, says it is establishing
diplomatic relations with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   The Taliban have been recognized by only a few countries as the
legitimate rulers of Afghanistan.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, Chechen Foreign Minister
Movladi Udugov said his ministry recently sent proposals for
establishing diplomatic relations to 20 countries as well as the
United Nations. He said the Taliban were the first to respond.
	   Udogov called on Russia to follow Chechnya's lead and recognize
the Taliban. Russia still considers Chechnya to be a Russian
republic.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan said Friday that one of the
missiles America aimed at neighboring Afghanistan landed on its
soil, killing at least five people.
	   The missile was part of the barrage fired Thursday at
Afghanistan, where U.S. officials said they were targeting alleged
militant training camps.
	   ``It seems there has been some technical error,'' said Pakistani
foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf. He said five or six people
were killed, but did not say where the missile struck.
	   Pakistan condemned the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan.
Altaf said a U.S. envoy was called to hear Pakistan's ``protest and
outrage'' over those strikes, as well as over the mistaken missile
strike on its own soil.
	   ``Irrespective of the motives of these strikes, the act of
violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these
Islamic countries cannot but be a matter of grave concern to the
people of Pakistan who justifiably feel outraged,'' Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Pakistani senate earlier.
	   Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and
chanted angry slogans across Pakistan Friday.
	   Many of the protests were called by conservative Islamic parties
who have condemned the U.S. military attacks on bases linked to
Osama Bin Laden. President Bill Clinton said investigators had
determined bin Laden was behind the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed 257 people.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya on Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan that President
Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East Africa.
	   FBI agents and Kenyan police, meanwhile, raided the Nairobi
offices of a Saudi Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief
Agency, in connection with the bombing, hauling away documents,
computers and cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a secretary for
the charity. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment on the raid.
	   Freeh canceled plans to lay a wreath amid the rubble of the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, and instead returned to
Washington, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said.
	   The U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania were
the targets a twin car bombs Aug. 7 that killed 257 people and
wounded 5,500 others, mostly Kenyans.
	   Freeh did not comment on Thursday's air strikes in Afghanistan
and Sudan. He toured the wreckage of the embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, with FBI agents and local officials Thursday before
traveling to Nairobi.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport before leaving,
Freeh declined to say whether evidence developed during U.S.
investigations at the bomb scenes led to the missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether the investigations had yielded
any specific proof linking renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden to the embassy attacks. He said ``many, many people in a
number of places'' could have been involved in planning the twin
bombings.
	   Nairobi residents were divided about the U.S. strikes in Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``I was delighted. I stayed up all last night watching TV. We
were waiting for this for a long time,'' said drama student George
Orido, 25. ``We were waiting for this for a long time. I thought
what they did was actually insufficient. Let them do more.''
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude towards his religion and condemned the raids as
indiscriminate killing.
	   ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I
want to tell the Americans that they should just leave us Muslims
alone. If they would just leave us, there would be no fighting, no
killing,'' he said.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him
``minutes before'' the raids to inform him of U.S. actions.
	   Museveni expressed strong support for the action, noting that
Uganda has also been a target for terrorist actions orchestrated by
agents from Sudan.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether Albright also
telephoned the presidents of Kenya and Tanzania about the U.S.
strikes.
	   Clinton and defense officials said the facilities attacked
Thursday by the United States had ties to bin Laden.
	   An Egyptian Islamic militant linked to bin Laden has been
identified by one suspect as having planned the embassy bombings, a
senior Pakistani official said Thursday on condition of anonymity.
	   Bin Laden, however, has denied involvement in the bombings.
	   The suspect, named by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, said the bombing operation began in July under the
direction of a man he called Ali Saleh, a member of the Egyptian
Islamic Jihad group.
	   Saleh led bin Laden's terrorist group in Africa, the Pakistani
source said. The Saudi millionaire has called on Muslims to attack
American installations.
	   Odeh also said the main conspirators left before the explosions,
leaving behind hired Kenyans and Tanzanians to carry out the car
bombings, the source said.
	   The Daily Nation reported Friday that the man who hurled a
grenade at security guards outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
immediately before the bomb blast has been identified in a police
lineup.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation. Tanzania is holding at least two
people.

Report: Israel formally submitted 13 percent offer to Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Inching toward compromise, Israel for the first
time confirmed to the Palestinians in writing that it would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, albeit with some
conditions, an Israeli newspaper said Friday.
	   However, a Palestinian negotiator denied any progress has been
made and said there have been no negotiations since Aug. 4.
	   The United States has tried since January to win acceptance for
a proposal that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
The Palestinians reluctantly accepted the plan, while Israel has
said a pullback on this scale would endanger its security.
	   In recent weeks, Israel floated a compromise under which it
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, but 3 percent of
that area would be declared a nature reserve and the Palestinians
would have virtually no say over land use, including construction.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Friday that Israel has now
submitted the plan to the Palestinians in writing, and that for the
first time, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has become intensively
involved in the negotiations.
	   The daily said the compromise was accepted by the Palestinians,
a claim staunchly denied by Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   ``The redeployments must be in accordance with the agreements
and not creating new categories of land,'' Asfour said Friday.
	   The Palestinians have accused the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of leaking reports that agreement with the
Palestinians was near in hopes of deflecting U.S. pressure.
	   Netanyahu aides had no comment on the Yediot report.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu summoned a key Cabinet hawk, Ariel
Sharon, to a resort in northern Israel where he is vacationing to
brief him on developments in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, could not confirm that the
Israeli offer has been put in writing. However, Sharon told
reporters earlier this week that the Palestinians already know that
Israel is prepared to hand over 13 percent of the territory.

Bookmakers set odds on Beckham offspring being sent off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Posh Space Victoria Adams, fiance of Manchester
United and England soccer star David Beckham, reportedly is three
months pregnant and the news already has bookmakers taking odds on
the future exploits of their offspring.
	   Bookmakers Williams Hill is offering odds of 1,000-1 that the
child, assuming it is a boy, will play soccer for England and
10,000-1 that he will emulate his father and be sent off playing
against Argentina.
	   Beckham was shown the red card during the World Cup and was
blamed for England's elimination. The team was forced to play a man
short for 70 minutes against Argentina before losing on penalties
after a 2-2 tie.

Yeltsin takes part in military exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE PETER THE GREAT (AP) _ Russian President Boris
Yeltsin personally took part in major naval exercises Friday,
launching a missile from a nuclear submarine in a northern sea.
	   Yeltsin, who also serves as commander-in-chief of the Russian
army, was aboard the Peter the Great cruiser in the Barents Sea
when he ordered a Kalmar-class submarine to launch the missile.
	   Earlier, he announced that he would take full, personal control
soon over military policy and over Russian arms exports, and
promised to ensure that members of the armed services are paid all
back salaries.
	   Yeltsin later said he was happy to have participated in the
exercise, and praised the crew of the Kalmar submarine, which NATO
calls the Delta-3.
	   The RSM-50 missile, launched from the Barents Sea, hit three
``simulated targets'' on Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka peninsula
26 minutes later, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
military command.

Government fears encouraging Aboriginal state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A U.N. declaration of
self-determination for indigenous people could encourage Aborigines
to secede, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Friday.
	   The non-binding declaration took 12 years to draft and is to be
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2004.
	   Federal Cabinet opposes part of a draft U.N. declaration that
supports self-determination for indigenous people, arguing that
``self-management'' or ``self-empowerment'' would be more
appropriate terms.
	   Downer angrily denied the government was reacting to right-wing
populist One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's attack on the U.N.
treaty as a precursor to a taxpayer-funded Aboriginal state.
	   ``Obviously in the case of Australia, we don't want to see a
separate country created within Australia for indigenous
Australians and I don't think there are many indigenous Australians
who would hold that view either,'' Downer told reporters.
	   The Labor party opposition and Aborigines accused the government
of using a ridiculous excuse to water down the U.N. declaration.
	   National Indigenous Working Group coordinator Olga Havnen said
the government's attitude on self-determination would be entirely
out of step with nations such as Canada and New Zealand which will
be represented at a working group meeting on the declaration in
October and November.
	   ``It's an international embarrassment; it's back to the 1950s
where the ultimate goal is assimilation,'' Havnen said.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police have appealed for public
help in identifying two men spotted parking an explosives-packed
car that killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 last weekend.
	   But police freed three of the five men who had been arrested
Monday as part of the effort to track down the Irish Republican
Army dissidents responsible for Saturday's blast, the deadliest
terrorist attack since the Northern Ireland conflict began in 1969.
	   Under British anti-terrorist law, the two remaining suspects can
be held for up to a week without being charged.
	   The police moves came after three days of funerals for all the
civilians _ two infant girls, nine teen-agers, 12 women and five
men, Protestant and Catholic alike _ slain Saturday.
	   The dissidents, called the Real IRA because of their refusal to
adhere to the parent organization's July 1997 truce, have insisted
they didn't mean to cause a massacre, despite giving misleading
phoned warnings. On Wednesday a spokesman, using a recognized
codeword, announced that the group would ``suspend'' its car-bomb
attacks on Northern Ireland towns in response to the public outcry.
	   But public anger against those associated with the dissidents
continued Thursday.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, leader of an anti-British pressure
group opposed to April's multi-party agreement on how Protestants
and Catholics should govern Northern Ireland, was prevented from
entering her business in the Irish Republic border town of Dundalk.
	   Shopping mall managers changed the locks on her T-shirt shop and
had her escorted out by security guards.
	   Irish police have identified her common-law husband, Michael
McKevitt, as the alleged commander of the Real IRA. Earlier this
week, through a local priest, McKevitt denied having anything to do
with the Omagh explosion and he has not been arrested.
	   Peace activists in Dundalk, 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of
Belfast, planned to march Friday night from a cathedral to the
central square to protest against Real IRA members and supporters
of the group who are believed to live in the town.
	   Sands-McKevitt, sister of the late IRA prison hunger-strike
leader Bobby Sands, is part of a legal pressure group called the 32
County Sovereignty Movement that opposes the participation of the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in April's agreement.
	   In response to Omagh, the Irish government has announced plans
to strengthen its anti-terrorist legislation to restrict the right
to bail, to detain suspects for up to 96 hours' questioning, and to
convict people of belonging to paramilitary groups based on the
testimony of a senior detective.
	   Many similar powers are already included in British
anti-terrorist legislation. But David Trimble, Protestant leader of
the new cross-community government, appealed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair to strengthen British laws to match Irish proposals.
	   Besides allowing the opinions of senior detectives to be
admitted as evidence, the proposed Irish laws would empower
authorities to confiscate property used to hide weaponry.
	   Sinn Fein criticized the proposals as likely to erode civil
rights. But Seamus Mallon, Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy, said
he would ``fully support'' toughening police and judicial powers in
both countries. ``The entire community in the island of Ireland
must have the maximum protection,'' he said.

	   JEUMERANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Grieving widows and torture victims
looked on as investigators Friday dug up three sets of bones from
remote grave sites thought to contain the remains dozens of Islamic
separatists and others killed by Indonesian troops.
	   Two skeletons found at one spot had holes in their skulls,
probably bullet wounds, forensic doctors said.
	   One, a male, was dressed only in his underwear. He had been
blindfolded, his arms bound behind his back by an army belt.
	   Indonesian troops are accused of committing atrocities,
including killings and torture, during the late 1980s and 1990s in
the northernmost province of Aceh, on Sumatra island about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The separatists, whose numbers have now dwindled, were crushed
when they fought to set up their own independent Muslim state.
	   A four-man team from Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission and a group of volunteers with shovels were led to
several alleged mass graves by villagers. All the recovered remains
had been buried less than 60 centimeters (two feet) below the
surface.
	   Hundreds watched the grisly investigation. Among the crowd were
dozens of sobbing widows, many wearing Islamic headscarves, who
stood waiting in case any signs of their missing husbands were
found.
	   The team said it would only take samples of human remains from
several grave sites, which locals allege contain dozens of
skeletons.
	   The bones will be subjected to forensic tests to determine
whether they were of execution victims, officials said. Mass
exhumations would be made later.
	   ``These findings show that there was very serious violations of
human rights in Aceh when the province was declared as a military
operation region'' in the late 1980s, said Baharuddin Lopa,
secretary general of the commission who heads the team.
	   Koesparmono Irsan, another team member, said a forensic team
acompanying them ``have found bullet holes in the bones of the
victims.''
	   However, the team declined to comment specifically on repeated
claims by villagers that the Indonesian army was responsible for
executions.
	   ``We are still investigating. It is too early to say who did
this,'' said Koesparmono.
	   A third set of human remains, thought to be of a human hand,
were found buried behind a remote traditional house that villagers
said had been a base for special forces troops, known as Kopassus.
	   Witnesses told the investigators the house had been used as a
torture center.
	   One woman, Halima Mardia, 22, sobbed as she recounted how troops
sexually assaulted her and beat her husband there four years ago
when they were arrested as suspected separatists.
	   ``I never saw my husband again,'' she said, adding that she was
pregnant at the time.
	   The Indonesian media have widely reported allegations of mass
graves by villagers. Some have said they were forced at gunpoint to
bury the bodies of people executed by troops.
	   Lopa said more grave sites would be examined during the next few
days, including one site nicknamed ``Skull Hill.''
	   He said his team would then submit its findings to the
government of President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``Local villagers saw trucks full of bodies go to the grave
sites and then come back empty,'' said Muhamad Harun, a human
rights activist, of events a decade ago.
	   The investigation into the Aceh graves is the latest sign of a
new openness in Indonesia following the resignation of former
autocratic President Suharto after nationwide riots in May.
	   His successor, Habibie has promised greater human rights for
Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   In a state-of-the-nation address to Parliament last Saturday he
made an unprecedented apology for abuses committed during his
predecessor's 32-year reign.
	   Indonesia's military commander Gen. Wiranto has also publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh.
	   Since Suharto's resignation the powerful military has faced a
barrage of allegations of past wrongdoing and is currently the
subject of two major inquires over the shooting and abduction of
anti-Suharto activists.
	   In a gesture of conciliation, the military began withdrawing
troops from Aceh on Thursday when about 250 soldiers left. Another
800 are slated to go on Aug. 31.

Report: Israel provided intelligence to U.S. on terror groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Palestinian-US Strikes; UPDATES with quotes
from Netanyahu, reports that U.S. and Israel exchanged intelligence
on Islamic militant groups ahead of strike &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the two weeks ahead of the U.S. air strikes
in Sudan and Afghanistan, Israeli intelligence agents provided
their U.S. counterparts with considerable information on Islamic
militant groups, an Israeli newspaper said Friday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether
Israel helped the United States select the targets in Thursday's
air raids, which came in retaliation for the U.S. embassy bombings
in East Africa earlier this month.
	   ``The Americans do not need our operational help,'' Netanyahu
said. ``As for coordination, we are partners in the struggle ...
against those who blow up embassies, children, women, old people,
innocent civilians.''
	   Netanyahu said senior U.S. officials tried to contact him just
before the air strikes were launched, presumably to inform him of
the operation ahead of time.
	   Netanyahu, who was vacationing in northern Israel on Thursday,
said he was only available on a cellular phone at the time and that
it was decided to hold off on the conversation until he could reach
a more secure phone line.
	   ``Later, I was briefed by the secretary of state (Madeleine
Albright) on the details, or to be more exact on the principles
which guided the Americans in their action,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``Of course, these are principles known to Israel. It was Israel
that generally charted the course in the struggle against
terrorism,'' he said.
	   The Haaretz daily said that in the past two weeks, Israel gave
the United States considerable information about the connections
between Islamic militant groups and Saudi millionaire Osama Bin
Laden, the alleged mastermind of the embassy bombings.
	   The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, condemned the U.S.
operation, saying it would only bring more turmoil to the Middle
East.
	   ``I believe that this act will bring the world back to the rule
of the jungle,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Cabinet. ``As Palestinians we know what it means to
have solutions imposed by the use of force.''
	   The U.S. air strikes placed the Palestinian leadership in a
difficult position.
	   The Palestinian Authority itself is being challenged by the
powerful Islamic militant group Hamas, and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat does not want to be overly critical of Washington at
a time when he needs the United States' help in negotiating an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   On the other hand, the bombings have triggered angry reactions
throughout the Arab and Muslim world and the Palestinians do not
want to be seen as stepping out of the consensus.
	   In Friday noon services at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's
third holiest shrine, prayer leader Yousef Abu Sneineh told
thousands of faithful that U.S. President Bill Clinton only ordered
the attacks to deflect attention from his domestic woes.
	   ``This is an act of terrorism committed by a state,'' Abu
Sneineh said.

Police confiscate marijuana on holiday island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORFU, Greece (AP) _ Police on Friday arrested two Albanians
with more than 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of marijuana, authorities
said.
	   Stavri Baku, 29, and Thanassi Nasso, 31, were allegedly in
possession of 153 kilograms (336 pounds) of marijuana which had
been unloaded from a speedboat in the Vaton area of Corfu, local
authorities said.
	   According to police, the speedboat was delivering the drugs from
the port of Sarande in Albania.
	   Albania is a large producer of marijuana and a transit point for
drugs, including heroin. Narcotics are usually smuggled across the
narrow straits separating Albania from Corfu or across the Adriatic
Sea to Italy.
	   In a separate incident, Athens police announced Friday the
arrest of three Greeks, including a police officer, on drug
trafficking charges after confiscating 40 kilograms of marijuana.
	   Following a tip-off, authorities on Thursday arrested police
officer Nikolaos Lefkaditis, 43, and Angelos Floratos, 42, while
they were allegedly attempting to sell 40.6 kilograms (89 pounds)
of marijuana to 32-year-old Ilia Pomonis.
	   Pomonis was also arrested, and all three are scheduled to appear
before a prosecutor.

Hopes rise for settlement of Hyundai Motor's labor dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with the government urging Hyundai to concede in grafs
8-11 &QL;

 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co.'s labor union
accepted ``a minimum level of layoffs'' Friday, raising hopes for a
negotiated settlement of a month-long strike at the nation's
largest automaker, government mediators said.
	   ``Considering the difficulty being faced by Hyundai and the car
industry as a whole, the union has accepted layoffs as a realistic
solution,'' Cho Sung-jun, a government mediator, told reporters.
	   The move was a major concession by the militant, 26,000-member
union, which has long insisted it would never accept a ``single
worker laid off.''
	   After shedding 6,100 workers earlier this year through early
retirements, Hyundai laid off 1,538 workers on July 31. The union
first fought to forestall the layoffs, then demanded that Hyundai
take back the fired employees.
	   Some 5,000 workers and their families have been picketing
Hyundai's plant at Ulsan since July 20, shortly after the company
first announced its layoff plans.
	   In talks that continued off and on through the night, the union
agreed to a government proposal calling for between 250 and 300
workers to be dismissed. Mediators said management and the union
were still far apart on what to do with the remaining workers the
company originally wanted to fire.
	   The company has suggested putting them on unpaid leave for a
year and a half, then bringing them back for six months of paid
retraining. Abandoning its earlier demand of paid leave, the union
said it can settle for a one-year unpaid leave for the workers.
	   ``Since the union made significant concessions, it's time for
the company to respond,'' said Rep. Noh Mu-hyun, another government
mediator.
	   Major employers' organizations, including the Korea Employers'
Federation, urged Hyundai not to give in to outside pressure.
	   In a joint statement, they accused the government of siding with
Hyundai union leaders, who were being sought by police on charges
of organizing illegal strikes.
	   The government ``abandoned principles in its hurry to forge a
deal. It will set a bad precedent,'' the statement said.
	   The company maintains it needs to reduce its workforce because
of sharply falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been
operating at 40 percent of its annual capacity of 1.25 million
units.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, is
the first major business to shed redundant workers. The outcome
will set an example for other businesses and affect South Korea's
overall efforts to woo back foreign investors.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin strongly
denounced American attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan, telling reporters Friday that the U.S. action was
``indecent.''
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am indignant and I condemn (the bombings),'' Yeltsin said
upon arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to
attend naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
	   ``I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and that
means the whole world was unaware of that. And this makes the
strike even more indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United
States are in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he added. ``We have coordinated
and, without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on
the issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   He said Yeltsin's outrage was over not being informed. Russian
news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from U.S. President
Bill Clinton after the attack containing a detailed explanation of
the U.S. motivation.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
concern over the unilateral use of force.
	   ``Only concerted actions by the entire international community
may effectively counteract terrorism,'' the ministry was quoted as
saying by Interfax news agency.
	   In the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, the
criticism was sharper, with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
saying the United States was ``moving toward a policy of state
terrorism.''
	   The Duma also passed a resolution urging the government to
consider canceling a summit meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton
that is scheduled to be held in Moscow on Sept. 1-3. The Duma also
hinted that it may again postpone ratification of the START-II arms
reduction treaty.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the attacks.
	   From Murmansk, Yeltsin went to the nearby port of Severomorsk,
where he boarded the newly built, nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great, the pride of the Northern Fleet. He was to spend
the day observing exercises involving approximately 50 surface
warships and other air and sea forces.
	   He announced that he would take full, personal control soon over
military policy and over Russian arms exports, and promised to
ensure that members of the armed services are paid all back
salaries.

Mandela to host Congo peace summit amid risk of wider war

 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ As the Congo war threatens to
spread, President Nelson Mandela plans to host weekend peace talks
between the presidents of Congo, Uganda Rwanda and Zimbabwe, his
spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``It's in that context
that we view the weekend discussions in a very, very serious
light.''
	   The war in the central African country has sent shock waves far
beyond its borders.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
supporting the rebels with troops and weapons. Military technicians
and advisers from Zimbabwe have reportedly already started arriving
in Congo to support Kabila, and Namibia has pledged logistical help
for Kabila.
	   Rwandan Ambassador Ben Karenzi called on Mandela to convince
Zimbabwe and Namibia to withdraw their military support, saying:
``The alternative is a bloodbath.''
	   Karenzi told journalists that Rwandan government troops were
ready to go into Congo to protect ``Rwanda's vital interest in
eastern Congo'' near the Rwandan border. Kabila says Rwandan troops
are already in Congo.
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principal to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to comment on whether the rebels themselves were
invited. Kabila's government has rejected any talks with the
rebels, saying it will only negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The meeting was to be followed Sunday by a full meeting of
Southern African Development Community on the crisis in Central
Africa, Mankahlana said.
	   The 14-member SADC summit is aimed at resolving a split within
the group on how best to deal with the crisis. SADC members South
Africa and Zimbabwe have been at loggerheads over Congo, with
Mugabe sending troops and Mandela ruling out military intervention.
	   Namibian Defense Minister Erriki Nghitima, while saying his
country has pledged logistical support like food and medicine to
Kabila, refused to comment Friday on a newspaper report that two
Boeings had landed in Namibia to pick up up arms and ammunition for
Kabila's forces.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan which U.S.
President Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East
Africa.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him
``minutes before'' the raids to inform him of U.S. plans.
	   The statement said Museveni expressed strong support for the
action and added that Uganda also has been a target for terrorist
actions orchestrated by agents from Sudan.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm whether Albright also
telephoned Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi or Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa.
	   U.S. embassies in the capitals of both countries were the
targets two weeks ago of car-bombings in which 257 people died, all
but 10 of them in Kenya.
	   The White House said the U.S. raids were linked to the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam embassy bombings.
	   Freeh, speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport before
flying back to Washington, declined to say whether evidence
developed during U.S. investigations at the bomb scenes led to the
missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether the investigations had yielded
proof linking renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden to the
embassy attacks. Washington says the Afghan base targeted by U.S.
missiles was run by bin Laden.
	   The twin bombings could have involved ``many, many people in
different places at different times,'' Freeh said.
	   The director said, however, that the two bombings were probably
linked. ``We're beginning on a preliminary basis to see forensic
similarities at the crime scene both here and in Dar es Salaam,''
he said, refusing to elaborate.
	   Nairobi residents, meanwhile, were divided about the U.S.
strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``I was delighted. I stayed up all last night watching TV. We
were waiting for this for a long time,'' said drama student George
Orido, 25. ``Let them do more.''
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, condemned the raids as
indiscriminate killing.
	   ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I
want to tell the Americans that they should just leave us Muslims
alone,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices
of a Saudi Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief Agency,
in connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers
and cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment.
	   Freeh canceled plans to lay a wreath amid the rubble of the
bombed-out U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, but walked though the wreckage
with investigators. The attack killed 247 people.
	   Freeh toured the destroyed embassy in Tanzania, where 10 died in
a nearly simultaneous bombing, with FBI agents and local officials
on Thursday before traveling to Nairobi.
	   The Tanzanian and Kenyan governments were weighing their
responses to the U.S. missile strikes, and had no immediate
comment.
	   The Daily Nation reported Friday that the man who hurled a
grenade at security guards outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
immediately before the bomb blast was identified as Khalid
Mohammed.
	   Mohammed was picked out by three of eight witnesses at a police
lineup and was in the custody of the FBI and Kenyan Criminal
Investigation Department, the newspaper said. Both agencies
declined comment.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen seriously injured
two U.N. workers in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday, a day
after a U.S. missile attack on a suspected Islamic militant base
that the country's Taliban rulers said killed 21 people.
	   Prayer leaders at mosques in Kabul and the southern city of
Kandahar, the Taliban's stronghold, exhorted the faithful to
protest the missile strikes on eastern Afghanistan. Hundreds heeded
the call in both cities, taking to the streets to shout ``God is
great! Down with U.S.!'' and to decry the attack on Afghanistan as
an attack on the entire Islamic world.
	   The United Nations confirmed that two men, an Italian and a
French man, were shot as they drove in Kabul. No other details were
available, and it was not immediately clear if the attack was
related to the U.S. missile strikes on Thursday.
	   The Italian Defense Ministry said an Italian soldier working as
a U.N. observer, Lt. Col. Carmine Calo, was shot by a ricocheting
bullet.
	   The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Eric
Lavertu, a civilian U.N. worker, was wounded in the hand. Both
Lavertu and Calo are now at the Red Cross hospital in Kabul and the
United Nations is arranging their evacuation, it said.
	   Foreigners had been advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan.
Those still in Kabul stayed out of sight Friday, while the United
Nations and other agencies arranged evacuations.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada, reached by telephone at
the Taliban's headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said
21 people were killed and another 30 were injured when U.S. cruise
missiles exploded on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base near Khost, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul.
	   A Pakistani official said Friday that one of the missiles aimed
at Afghanistan landed in Pakistan, killing at least five people.
	   U.S. officials said the attack was meant to disrupt the
infrastructure of a guerrilla organization run by Osama bin Laden,
an anti-American Islamic militant who has been blamed for bombing
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, killing a total of
257 people.
	   Akhumzada called the missile attack ``a callous act,'' saying
the United States had no proof against bin Laden.
	   Akhumzada also said missiles hit targets near Jalalabad, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul. The deputy governor of the
region had said three people were killed in the Jalalabad attack.
But U.S. defense officials said only the Al-Badr base was targeted,
and six sites were hit on the sprawling complex.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the sketchy reports.
	   The Pakistani news agency NNI, quoting the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen
group, said five of its Pakistani members were killed at the camp
near Khost. They appeared to be among Akhumzada's total.
Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, formally known as
Harkat-ul-Ansar, was included last year on the U.S. State
Department's list of terrorist groups for its support of an
insurrection by militant Muslims in Indian-held Kashmir.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the attacks on sites in
Sudan as well as Afghanistan Thursday night, saying he had
established links between the bin Laden targets and bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had said after the attacks Thursday
that bin Laden ``was safe and no damage has been done to any of his
companions.''
	   Bin Laden, son of a wealthy Saudi construction magnate, is
believed to have used his fortune to run the camps. He has been
living in Afghanistan with the permission of the Taliban, a
hard-line Islamic group that controls most of the country.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with amplified reaction from French prime minister,
British prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Friday said the United States was
justified in bombing sites linked to terrorists who allegedly
bombed two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
	   ``We must give determined and firm responses against terrorists
there where they strike. Taking it from there, one can understand
that great nations hit in the flesh cannot remain impervious,''
Jospin said.
	   The French prime minister also stressed that France wanted to
make sure that any strikes against terrorists were carried out in
accordance with international law.
	   Jospin made his remarks after a meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who offered unequivocal support for the U.S.
action.

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE PETER THE GREAT (AP) _ Russian President Boris
Yeltsin personally took part in major naval exercises Friday,
launching a missile from a nuclear submarine in a northern sea.
	   Yeltsin, who also serves as commander-in-chief of the Russian
army, was aboard the Peter the Great cruiser in the Barents Sea
when he ordered a Kalmar-class submarine to launch the missile.
	   Earlier, he announced that he would take full, personal control
soon over military policy and over Russian arms exports, and
promised to ensure that members of the armed services are paid all
back salaries.
	   Yeltsin has made repeated such pledges in the past, but the
cash-strapped government has been unable to pay months-long wage
debts to the military and other state employees.
	   Yeltsin later said he was happy to have participated in the
exercise, and praised the crew of the Kalmar submarine, which NATO
calls the Delta-3.
	   The RSM-50 missile, launched from the Barents Sea, hit three
``simulated targets'' on Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka peninsula
26 minutes later, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
military command.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin,
who has been on vacation since July 18, officially returned to work
on Thursday.

Bomb-hit Nairobi divided on U.S. raids

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Still mourning more than 230 compatriots
slain in the bombing of the American Embassy, Kenyans on Friday
expressed mixed feelings about U.S. missile raids on Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``As a Kenyan, I think what the Americans did was a good
thing,'' said Ernest Kariuki, a 26-year-old insurance salesman. But
he said he worried about the loss of innocent lives in Thursday's
raids, which the Clinton administration said targeted sites
believed to be linked to terrorist activity.
	   Kariuki, perusing newspaper headlines about the raids at a
sidewalk newsstand only a few blocks from the bomb-shattered
embassy, said Americans and Arabs should ``come to a dialogue''
about their differences.
	   Officially, Kenya was silent on the strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan. President Daniel arap Moi was out of the capital when
the American raids occurred and issued no statement on them.
	   The Sudanese Embassy in Nairobi said in a statement that Kenyan
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana had once toured the El Shifa
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, which was hit in the U.S. air
strike.
	   The United States described the facility was a suspected
chemical weapons factory.
	   American officials in Kenya said they hadn't been given advance
word on the raids.
	   ``We learned of it the way everyone else did, with the
president's announcement,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris
Scharf. FBI director Louis Freeh, in East Africa to oversee the
investigations into the bombings, abruptly cut short his visit
Thursday to return to Washington for consultations.
	   On Friday, two weeks after almost simultaneous bomb blasts at
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Kenya, Kenyans were still
grappling with the violence that shook their capital.
	   Near the site of the embassy blast, ordinary Kenyans were being
urged to leave handwritten notes describing their feelings about
the attack.
	   Some were bitter about the fact that the overwhelming majority
of victims were Kenyans, even though the bomb was aimed at
Americans.
	   ``If enemies will be fighting on their friends' ground, I would
rather stay alone without any of the two enemies instead of these
effects on the innocent,'' wrote one Kenyan, O.K. Chege.
	   But others said Americans were also innocent victims, and
cheered the U.S. missile strikes.
	   ``We needed a response from the U.S.,'' said Moses Mungai, 22.
``There was no way we should be attacked and do nothing. So it's a
good move. This is a way of stopping them (the bombers).''
	   George Orido, 25, said he was ``delighted'' when he heard about
the strikes. ``Let them do more,'' he urged.
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude toward Islam and condemned the air strikes
Thursday as indiscriminate killings.
	   ``I feel bad about it, because so many innocent people died,''
Yarrow said. ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are
terrorists ... If they would just leave us alone, there would be no
fighting and no killing.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen seriously injured
two U.N. workers in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday, a day
after a U.S. missile attack on a suspected Islamic militant base
that the country's Taliban rulers said killed 21 people.
	   Prayer leaders at mosques in Kabul and the southern city of
Kandahar, the Taliban's stronghold, exhorted the faithful to
protest the missile strikes on eastern Afghanistan. Hundreds heeded
the call in both cities, taking to the streets to shout ``God is
great! Down with U.S.!'' and to decry the attack on Afghanistan as
an attack on the entire Islamic world.
	   The United Nations confirmed that two men, an Italian and a
French man, were shot as they drove in Kabul. No other details were
available, and it was not immediately clear if the attack was
related to the U.S. missile strikes on Thursday.
	   The Italian Defense Ministry said an Italian soldier working as
a U.N. observer, Lt. Col. Carmine Calo, was shot by a ricocheting
bullet.
	   The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Eric
Lavertu, a civilian U.N. worker, was wounded in the hand. Both
Lavertu and Calo are now at the Red Cross hospital in Kabul and the
United Nations is arranging their evacuation, it said.
	   Foreigners had been advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan.
Those still in Kabul stayed out of sight Friday, while the United
Nations and other agencies arranged evacuations.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada, reached by telephone at
the Taliban's headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said
21 people were killed and another 30 were injured when U.S. cruise

	   Akhumzada also said missiles hit targets near Jalalabad, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kabul. The deputy governor of the
region had said three people were killed in the Jalalabad attack.
	   A Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
U.S. missiles did not strike anywhere near Jalalabad.
	   U.S. defense officials had earlier said that only the Al-Badr
base was targeted, and six sites were hit on the sprawling complex.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   The number of casualties from the raid was not immediately
clear.
	   The governor of Khartoum, Majthob al-Khalifa, was quoted Friday
in the Sudanese daily Alwan as saying there were ``several dead and
wounded among the workers'' of the plant.
	   He gave no details.
	   Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were
injured in the raid, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be
trapped under the debris.
	   Al-Khalifa, who apparently spoke to Alwan on Thursday night,
said there was ``confusion ... surrounding the fate of another 300
... workers.'' It was unclear how many of those may have been
located during the night and morning.

 &UR; Ugandan leader says Albright told him about strikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni received a
telephone call from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to inform
him about U.S. missile strikes launched against targets in Sudan
and Afghanistanan, and he supported the action, a statement from
his office said Friday.
	   The statement said Albright told Museveni the actions were
carried out ``because those sites accomodated factories that make
explosives with which the terrorists make bombs.''
	   The statement said Museveni expressed ``strong support'' for the
American action and reminded Albright ``that one reason why Uganda
does not have diplomatic relations with Sudan is because of its
terrorist behavior.''
	   Albright met with Museveni in Uganda last December and announced
a dlrs 2 million increase in non-lethal military funding to Uganda
for its fight to contain terrorism in Sudan.
	   Uganda broke off ties with its northern neighbor in 1994 after
both traded accusations that each was harboring and bankrolling
rebel movements fighting their respective governments.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan of backing at least three rebel groups in
the country, the most important of which is the Lord's Resistance
Army which raids nortern Uganda from its bases in southern Sudan.
	   Since the beginning of the year, unidentified attackers have
tossed grenades into several bars and restaurants in Kampala,
killing 10 people and injuring at least a dozen.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
	   ``As everybodu knows, Uganda has been a regular victim of
terrorist attacks,'' the statement said. ``With all this negative
background, President Museveni expressed gratification at the
American attacks.''

Yeltsin condemns U.S. attacks; says failure to inform was

<TEXT>
	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin strongly
denounced American attacks on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan, telling reporters Friday that the U.S. action was
``indecent.''
	   However, his spokesman was more conciliatory, saying Yeltsin was
mainly upset about not being informed in advance of the bombings.
	   ``I am indignant and I condemn (the bombings),'' Yeltsin said
upon arrival in Murmansk, a northern port city where he came to
attend naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
	   ``I didn't know that this strike would be carried out, and that
means the whole world was unaware of that. And this makes the
strike even more indecent,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Apparently seeking to soften Yeltsin's words, spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky quickly said that ``Russia and the United States are
in the same boat in the fight against world terrorism.''
	   ``We very well understand the bitterness of losses suffered by
Americans, foremost in Kenya,'' he said. ``We have coordinated and,
without doubt, will continue to coordinate with each other on the
issues concerning the fight against world terrorism.''
	   He said Yeltsin's anger was over not being informed. Russian
news agencies said Yeltsin received a letter from U.S. President
Bill Clinton after the attack containing a detailed explanation of
the American motivation.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko also condemned the U.S. action
as interference in the affairs of other countries and ``something
unacceptable,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``However, acts of international terrorism clearly cannot go
unpunished,'' he added.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
concern over the unilateral use of force.
	   ``Only concerted actions by the entire international community
may effectively counteract terrorism,'' the ministry was quoted as
saying by Interfax news agency.
	   In the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, the
criticism was sharper, with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
saying the United States was ``moving toward a policy of state
terrorism.''
	   The Duma also passed a resolution urging the government to
consider canceling a summit between Yeltsin and Clinton that is
scheduled to be held in Moscow on Sept. 1-3. The Duma also hinted
that it may again postpone ratification of the START-II arms
reduction treaty.
	   In Moscow, American Ambassador James Collins met Friday morning
with Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the attacks.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Military technicians and advisers from
Zimbabwe have started to arrive in Congo's capital to lend support
for President Laurent Kabila's embattled army, a government
official said Friday.
	   Zimbabwe is reportedly the first country to offer troop support
for Congo, although Zambia, Namibia and Angola also say they back
Kabila.
	   Neighboring Rwanda quickly responded to the troop deployment,
warning it was ready for full-out war with Congo if the Zimbabwean
troops don't withdraw.
	   ``The alternative is a bloodbath,'' Rwandan Ambassador to South
Africa Ben Karenzi told reporters in Johannesburg.
	   Karenzi also accused Namibia of sending troops to Congo in
support of Kabila.
	   Rwandan troops are ready to go into Congo to protect ``Rwanda's
vital interest in eastern Congo,'' Karenzi said.
	   Kabila, however, says Rwandan troops are already fighting in
Congo in support of rebel fighters trying to topple the government
in Kinshasa.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, warning Zimbabwe against
intervention in Congo, is trying to broker peace talks to fend off
an escalation in the Congolese conflict that could draw in member
states of the South African Development Community.
	   State-television in Kinshasa on Thursday night broadcast
pictures of troops arriving at an airport, but did not specify
where the troops were from or what role they would play in Kabila's
war against the rebel fighters.
	   The rebels, just 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Kinshasa,
have sent mixed signals to Kabila in recent days. While they
continue to push for the president's ouster, the group's political
wing earlier in the week offered to discuss cease-fire terms with
Kabila.

Russia, Vietnam to sign deals on banking, law during summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Vietnam are expected to sign agreements
on legal assistance, bank settlements and other issues during the
visit of Vietnam's President Tran Duc Luong to Moscow.
	   Luong and Russian President Boris Yeltsin plan to discuss
bilateral relations and international problems during Luong's visit
that is scheduled to begin Monday and run through the following
Saturday, the Interfax news agency said, citing Vietnamese
Ambassador Ngo Tat To.
	   Russia and Vietnam will also sign an agreement to form a joint
oil-refining venture, and a deal on legal cooperation, To said.
	   This will be the first visit by a Vietnamese president to Moscow
since the 1991 Soviet collapse, the ambassador said.
	   Luong is also scheduled to lay a wreath at a monument to Ho Chi
Minh and visit the Russian Academy of Sciences, where he will be
made an honorary professor.

U.S. criticized for attacks on Sudan, Afghanistan

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on
crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting
Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``Down, Down USA!'' and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!'' the crowd
chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square
in the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders
and many citizens criticized Thursday's American attacks on a
factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama bin
Laden in Afghanistan.
	   Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to
the United States, but even in U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, some
people said the attack would add to and not lessen the threat
against Americans.
	   ``This violence will only beget more violence,'' said Abeer
Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker.
	   An official of the Arab League, which is usually measured in its
comments on the United States, also called the attack rash.
	   ``The American action was carried out in a Rambo style and will
not resolve the problem of international terrorism,'' said league
Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed Zakariya Ismail.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the strikes were ordered to
avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and
because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being
planned.
	   Clinton's actions were widely seen in the Middle East as an
effort to distract public opinion in the United States from his
problems over a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against
Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir
daily in Lebanon said.
	   Several countries _ notably Iran _ warned, too, that the U.S.
attacks could backfire by raising Muslim ire and drawing
retaliation.
	   ``We condemned the killing of innocent people in the embassy
bombings in Africa,'' Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said
in a sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran. ``But those bombings do
not justify that innocent Muslims should die in Afghanistan.''
	   He added that the results of the American strikes ``will be to
increase hatred toward the United States.''
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told
state-run radio that the Americans had a ``double standard'' on
terrorism.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Mohammadi said.
	   Both Libya and Iran are accused by the United States of being
terrorist-sponsoring states, an allegation they've repeatedly
denied.
	   In Iraq, which charges the United States is working to prolong
U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Sheik
Abdel-Latif Hmayem used his nationally televised Friday sermon to
characterize Clinton as ``a clown'' and an enemy of Islam.
	   ``He is a professional criminal who, whenever a star rises in
the skies of Arabism and Islam, tries to pull it down,'' he said.
``The target is our Islam, our Arab identity.''

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni received a
telephone call from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to inform
him about U.S. missile strikes launched against targets in Sudan
and Afghanistanan, and he supported the action, a statement from
his office said Friday.
	   The statement said Albright told Museveni the actions were
carried out ``because those sites accomodated factories that make
explosives with which the terrorists make bombs.''
	   The statement said Museveni expressed ``strong support'' for the
American action and reminded Albright ``that one reason why Uganda
does not have diplomatic relations with Sudan is because of its
terrorist behavior.''
	   Immediately after the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, the U.S. diplomatic mission in
Kampala was closed for unspecified security reasons.
	   When he announced the strikes Thursday, President Bill Clinton
said they were linked to the embassy bombings.
	   Albright met with Museveni in Uganda last December and announced
a dlrs 2 million increase in non-lethal military funding to Uganda
for its fight to contain terrorism in Sudan.
	   Uganda broke off ties with its northern neighbor in 1994 after
both traded accusations that each was harboring and bankrolling
rebel movements fighting their respective governments.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan of backing at least three rebel groups in
the country, the most important of which is the Lord's Resistance
Army which raids nortern Uganda from its bases in southern Sudan.
	   Since the beginning of the year, unidentified attackers have
tossed grenades into several bars and restaurants in Kampala,
killing 10 people and injuring at least a dozen.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
	   ``As everybodu knows, Uganda has been a regular victim of
terrorist attacks,'' the statement said. ``With all this negative
background, President Museveni expressed gratification at the
American attacks.''

Mandela to host Congo peace summit amid risk of wider war

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ As the Congo war threatens to
spread, President Nelson Mandela plans to host weekend peace talks
between the presidents of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, his
spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``It's in that context
that we view the weekend discussions in a very, very serious
light.''
	   The war in the central African country has sent shock waves far
beyond its borders.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
supporting Congo rebels with troops and weapons. Military
technicians and advisers from Zimbabwe have reportedly already
started arriving in Congo to support Kabila, and Namibia has
pledged logistical help for the Congolese president.
	   Rwandan Ambassador Ben Karenzi called on Mandela to persuade
Zimbabwe and Namibia to withdraw their military support, saying:
``The alternative is a bloodbath.''
	   Karenzi told journalists that Rwandan government troops were
ready to go into Congo to protect ``Rwanda's vital interest in
eastern Congo'' near the Rwandan border. Kabila says Rwandan troops
are already in Congo.
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principle to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to comment on whether the rebels themselves were
invited. Kabila's government has rejected any talks with the
rebels, saying it will only negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The meeting was to be followed Sunday by a full meeting of
Southern African Development Community on the crisis in Central
Africa, Mankahlana said.
	   The 14-member SADC summit is aimed at resolving a split within
the group on how best to deal with the crisis. SADC members South
Africa and Zimbabwe have been at loggerheads over Congo, with
Mugabe sending troops and Mandela ruling out military intervention.
	   Namibian Defense Minister Erriki Nghitima, while saying his
country has pledged logistical support like food and medicine to
Kabila, refused to comment Friday on a newspaper report that two
Boeings had landed in Namibia to pick up up arms and ammunition for
Kabila's forces.

himself a Saudi was ``no better.''
	   In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper

attacks were justified.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania) it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh abruptly cut
short his visit to Kenya on Friday, hours after U.S. missiles hit
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan that President
Bill Clinton linked to the embassy bombings in East Africa.
	   FBI agents and Kenyan police, meanwhile, raided the Nairobi
offices of a Saudi Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief
Agency, in connection with the bombing, hauling away documents,
computers and cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a secretary for
the charity. Police were questioning six more employees, he said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment on the raid.
	   Freeh canceled plans to lay a wreath amid the rubble of the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, and instead returned to
Washington, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said.
	   The U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania were
the targets a twin car bombs Aug. 7 that killed 257 people and
wounded 5,500 others, mostly Kenyans.
	   Freeh did not comment on Thursday's air strikes in Afghanistan
and Sudan. He toured the wreckage of the embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, with FBI agents and local officials Thursday before
traveling to Nairobi.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport before leaving,
Freeh declined to say whether evidence developed during U.S.
investigations at the bomb scenes led to the missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether the investigations had yielded
any specific proof linking renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden to the embassy attacks. He said ``many, many people in a
number of places'' could have been involved in planning the twin
bombings, which were probably linked.
	   Nairobi residents were divided about the U.S. strikes in Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``I was delighted. I stayed up all last night watching TV. We
were waiting for this for a long time,'' said drama student George
Orido, 25. ``We were waiting for this for a long time. I thought
what they did was actually insufficient. Let them do more.''
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude towards his religion and condemned the raids as
indiscriminate killing.
	   ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I
want to tell the Americans that they should just leave us Muslims
alone. If they would just leave us, there would be no fighting, no
killing,'' he said.
	   In neighboring Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's office said
Friday that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him
minutes after the raids to inform him of U.S. actions.

Cabinet commemorates victims of the Soviet-led invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Thirty years after a Soviet-led
invasion crushed reforms aimed at humanizing communism in
Czechoslovakia, Premier Milos Zeman commemorated victims of the
attack.
	   Speaking Friday in front of the Czech public radio station which
was attacked by Soviet troops on the first day of the occupation,
Zeman commended the public protests against the invasion as heroic.
	   On this date in 1968, five Warsaw Pact allies led by the Soviet
Union stormed the streets of downtown Prague to quash a democratic
movement known as the Prague Spring.
	   The Soviets brought an end to nine months of free speech and
assembly unprecedented in the Soviet bloc. About 100 people were
killed in the invasion, Czechoslovak Communist leader Dubcek was
deposed and thousands fled in fear of political revenge.
	   Zeman also remembered clashes between Czechoslovak police and
the Soviet Army one year later, when several more people died.
	   President Vaclav Havel's wife Dagmar Havlova, Chancellor Ivan
Medek, and several legislators were also present at the ceremony,
broadcast live by Czech Radio.
	   A Russian delegation, led by Vladimir Lukin, the Russian Duma's
foreign committee chairman, laid wreaths in downtown Prague's
Wenceslas Square, where the Soviet tanks were met by thousands of
angry Czechs.
	   Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia in late 1989 and in
January 1993, the country peacefully split into the Czech Republic
and Slovakia.

Looking toward the end of Lewinsky investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Inserts new grafs 10-11 to UPDATE with Clinton testimony on
affair &QL; 
 &UR; By PETE YOST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the testimony of President Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky in hand, prosecutors have Clinton admitting
sexual improprieties and conflicting accounts about why the former
White House intern returned gifts from the president.
	   Democrats on Capitol Hill feel that if any report to Congress by
prosecutor Kenneth Starr focuses on sex there will be no chance for
impeachment proceedings against the president.
	   But if the independent counsel sends a strong obstruction case
to Congress, Clinton will have much more difficult problems, many
of the Democrats say.
	   Alleged gifts are an important element in Starr's probe of
possible obstruction in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against the president. Starr has been trying to determine if
Clinton suggested that Ms. Lewinsky get rid of items she received
from him so that she wouldn't have to turn them over to lawyers in
the Jones case, where the gifts would raise questions about their
relationship.
	   Ms. Lewinsky testified she and Clinton agreed she should hand
over the gifts to his secretary, Betty Currie, sources familiar
with her account have said.
	   Clinton told the grand jury he never instructed Mrs. Currie to
retrieve them, didn't know she had them and ``didn't consider them
a big deal,'' said a Clinton adviser, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Ms. Lewinsky also had testified that she performed oral sex on
Clinton in the White House. Clinton generally acknowledged sexual
improprieties but would not answer specific questions about his
physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, the adviser said.
	   Clinton has maintained that his testimony in the Jones
deposition, in which he denied sexual relations with her, was
``legally accurate.''
	   Stymied by his refusal to answer sexual questions, prosecutors
asked Clinton a series of questions about his understanding of the
definition of ``sexual relations'' used in the Jones case, the
adviser said. Clinton said oral sex was one of the acts not covered
in that definition.
	   Clinton did tell grand jurors that he recalled about a half
dozen sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, beginning in late 1995
or early 1996, according to a legal source familiar with his
testimony. Most of their activities occurred in 1996, with Clinton
recalling one in 1997, the source said.
	   The president suggested that he and Ms. Lewinsky agreed to keep
the affair secret from the beginning. ``It was a normal
let's-not-shout-this-from-the-rooftops type of thing,'' said the
source. Clinton misled friend Vernon Jordan about the nature of the
relationship, the source said; prosecutors now want to know if
Jordan's efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job were part of an attempt
to get her to deny the affair under oath.

Sudanese foreign minister arrives in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail arrived in Iraq Friday on a previously arranged three-day
visit to meet with President Saddam Hussein, officials said.
	   Ismail crossed into Iraq from Jordanian, officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said earlier Friday that Ismail would
deliver a message from Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir to Saddam.
It did not elaborate.
	   Iraq has expressed its support for Sudan following the United
States' Thursday bombing of a factory in Khartoum, the Sudanese
capital. The statement by Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council
criticized the bombing as a result of America's ``rash, aggressive
and dangerous policy.'' The council is Iraq's most powerful
decision-making body.
	   The United States says the plant was making chemical weapons
agents. Sudan says it made medicine.
	   Sudan was one of the few Arab countries to support Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Sudan and Iraq still enjoy strong
relations and there are thousands of Sudanese working in Iraq.

Reinforcements arrive in Congo to aid Kabila

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Military technicians and advisers from
Zimbabwe have started to arrive in Congo's capital to lend support
for President Laurent Kabila's embattled army, a government
official said Friday.
	   Zimbabwe is reportedly the first country to offer troop support
for Congo, although Zambia, Namibia and Angola also say they back
Kabila.
	   Neighboring Rwanda quickly responded to the troop deployment,
warning it was ready for full-out war with Congo if the Zimbabwean
troops don't withdraw.
	   ``The alternative is a bloodbath,'' Rwandan Ambassador to South
Africa Ben Karenzi told reporters in Johannesburg. Rwandan troops
are ready to go into Congo, he said, to protect ``Rwanda's vital
interest in eastern Congo.''
	   Karenzi also accused Namibia of sending troops to Congo in
support of Kabila.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, warning Zimbabwe against
intervention, is trying to broker peace talks to stop any
escalation in the Congolese conflict.
	   He plans to hold weekend peace talks between the presidents of
Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, his spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' Parks
Mankahlana said.
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principle to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the South African capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to say whether the rebels were invited. Kabila's
government has rejected the idea of talks with the rebels, instead
saying it will only negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda _ both of
which, Kabila says, are arming and fighting alongside the rebels.
	   Kabila has also heaped blame on the West, which he says supports
Rwanda.
	   About 600 people, many waving banners, blowing whistles and
carrying sticks, protested Friday in front of the French Embassy in
Kinshasa, accusing France and the United States of trying to
destabilize Congo and of supporting Rwanda.
	   State-television in Kinshasa on Thursday night broadcast
pictures of troops arriving at an airport, but did not specify
where the troops were from or what role they would play in Kabila's
war against the rebel fighters.
	   The rebels, just 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Kinshasa,
have sent mixed signals to Kabila in recent days. While they
continue to push for the president's ouster, the group's political
wing earlier in the week offered to discuss cease-fire terms with
Kabila.
	   Accusing Kabila of corruption and nepotism, a coalition of
ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of
the Congolese army revolted earlier this month and swiftly captured
key towns in the east and west.
	   Those same forces last year helped Kabila oust longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but have since grown disenchanted with
the new government.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi on Friday confirmed that the
troops reinforcements had started to arrive and more were expected
in the coming days.
	   Congolese military commanders were meeting with the
reinforcements Friday at Camp Kokolo, Kinshasa's main military
base.
	   At a rally in the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma on Thursday,
a key political figure in the rebel movement backed away from
earlier tough talk and said he hoped to find a political resolution
to the country's latest conflict.
	   ``Our problem is political, and the solution must be
political,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, an exiled professor and leader
of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition told several thousand
people at the rally.
	   Rebel chief commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane and his lieutenants,
who had vowed to crush Kabila, were not at the rally.
	   Ondekane, in Goma, said he was taking care of the military
situation and that politicians should speak about political
affairs.
	   In Kinshasa, the impact of the war continues to take a toll on
civilians. Since the conflict began at the start of the month, food
prices have soared.
	   Power was briefly restored to Kinshasa on Thursday, but by
nightfall the electricity was again cut off.
	   Rebels control the town of Inga, the site of a key power dam
that supplies Kinshasa with its electricity.

	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Friday said the United States was
justified in bombing sites linked to terrorists who allegedly
bombed two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last week.
	   ``We must give determined and firm responses against terrorists
there where they strike. Taking it from there, one can understand
that great nations hit in the flesh cannot remain impervious,''
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said.
	   Jospin also stressed that France wanted to make sure that any
strikes against terrorists were carried out in accordance with
international law.
	   The French prime minister made his remarks after a meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who speaking in French offered
unequivocal support for the U.S. action.

Indonesia's military commander promises to maintain reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hit by a barrage of allegations of
past human abuses, Indonesia's powerful military promised Friday to
press on with internal reform.
	   Armed Forces commander Gen. Wiranto said the military, known as
ABRI, would also redefine its role in Indonesian politics.
	   Under Indonesia's constitution, the military has the dual
function of maintaining security and being involved in politics,
including being represented in the Parliament.
	   He said the changes would help ``cultivate democracy in a more
empowered civil society.'' He did not elaborate.
	   The push for reform follows the resignation in May of former
President Suharto.
	   Suharto quit after a wave of protests and riots swept the
Southeast Asian island nation.
	   New President B.J. habibie has promised wideranging political
and economic reforms, including a new respect for human rights. He
has also called for reform within the military.
	   In recent weeks the military has been the target of many
allegations of human rights violations.
	   A major inquiry has recommended that several senior officers,
including a son-in-law of Suharto, face court-martials over the
abduction of anti-Suharto activists.
	   Dozens were abducted and tortured. Fourteen are still missing,
feared dead. Ten soldiers have been charged with kidnappings.
	   Top military officials are also to be questioned about the
military's role in May's violence, in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   Eighteen soldiers have been charged over the shootings of four
university student protesters. The slayings triggered the riots,
which led to Suharto's departure after 32 years in office. Wiranto
said the military ``is resolving'' these cases and would review a
code ethics for troops and officers ``to prevent reoccurrences of
deviations from procedure.''
	   Wiranto also said the military is clarifying its activities in
outlying provinces such as in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh where
some small bands of rebels still operate.
	   Indonesia is currently trying to negotiate a U.N.-sponsored
peace settlement on East Timor. It has recently reduced the number
combat troops in the former Portuguese colony, which it invaded in
1975.
	   It has also cut back troop numbers in Aceh, on the island of
Sumatra, where human rights investigators are currently probing
claims that the military tortured and executed Muslim separatists.
	   A small number of bones were recovered from several suspected
mass grave sites in Aceh on Friday.

Muslim leader killed in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with driver also killed, graf 2. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A local Muslim leader was killed in a
car bombing on Friday in Russia's southern region of Dagestan
bordering the breakaway republic of Chechnya, officials said.
	   Mufti Said-Mohammad Abubakarov, Dagestan's Muslim leader, died
along with his brother when their car was blown up by a
radio-controlled bomb after a service at the main mosque in
Makhachkala, the regional capital. Their driver was also killed,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and police
have refused to comment on who could be responsible. The Interfax
news agency said authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect, could be involved in the attack.
	   Abubakarov has been a long-time enemy of the Wahhabis. He once
said in an interview that every Muslim who killed a Wahhabi would
go to heaven.
	   Ravil Gainutdin, the Mufti of Moscow and western Russia, called
Abubakarov's killing a ``tragedy for all Russia'' and described him
as a ``peaceful and reasonable man,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Gainutdin added that Abubakarov had told him recently that he
had to constantly change cars. ``That means he felt the danger,''
Gainutdin said.
	   There are 20,000 Wahhabis in Dagestan and they have already
seized full control over several villages in the central and
southern parts of the mountainous province on the Caspian Sea.
	   The Wahhabis said this week they would disobey the government,
and local officials responded by saying that they would use force
if the Wahhabis don't end their resistance.
	   Dagestan has been restive, plagued by frequent bombings,
kidnappings and other violence as numerous ethnic and religious
groups have fought for power.
	   There was no evidence that the Wahhabis have taken part in any
of the violent actions.
	   Dagestan's Wahhabis also have close ties with Chechnya. Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov recently launched a crackdown on the
Wahhabis, accusing them of trying to destabilize his government.

France catching up in computer, Internet use: study
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After years of delay, French companies have
suddenly rushed into the Information Age. A majority are now hooked
up on computers and a growing number are on the Internet, a new
government study says.
	   In a country where the president set up his website only last
year, 63 percent of French companies are now equipped with
micro-computers, up from 32 percent since the last survey four
years earlier, according to the study released Thursday by the
Industry Ministry.
	   The number of companies that invested in mainframe computers has
only gradually increased, to 39 percent from 36 percent in 1994,
said the study by the ministry's statistics agency Sessi.
	   Internet use has risen to 60 percent among businesses with more
than 2,000 employees, but the figure drops to 30 percent overall
and only 15 percent among small and medium-size businesses.
	   Only 13 percent of French companies use the Web to publicize
their operations, said the study, which was posted on the
ministry's website.
	   To boost Internet use, France's vice-minister for industry,
Christian Pierret, noted the government was spending 50 million
francs (dlrs 8.3 million) this year to train managers on the Web.
	   Internet use varies widely among sectors of the French economy.
It ranges from 61 percent in the electronics industries and 53
percent in pharmaceutical and perfume industries to only 14 percent
in clothing and 18 percent in metallurgy, the study said.
	   Most government ministries have established Web sites in recent
years, also after years of delay.
	   Even French media chided President Jacques Chirac for being
unfamiliar with a computer mouse as late as last year. With great
fanfare, the presidential palace inaugurated its Website on
Bastille Day, July 14, 1997.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading Kosovo Albanian
politician called on foreign powers Friday to declare a ``no-fly
zone'' over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war
machine'' in its crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   The call by Ibrahim Rugova was issued after France warned that
military intervention may be the only alternative to halt the
fighting in Kosovo if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire
and peace talks soon.
	   In Kosovo Friday, state-run Tanjug news agency reported
secessionist Albanians opened fire on a Serb police patrol some 30
kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina, in the town of
Vucitrn. The report said an unspecified number of Albanians were
injured in the shootout.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Albanians, and the
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fighting between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army Thursday, despite
Serb success in driving the secessionist rebels from most of their
strongholds this month.

Big European markets hit by Russia, Asia woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets
Friday afternoon, with Frankfurt blue chips taking the worst hits
on concerns that Russia's economic troubles could prove painful to
German banks.
	   Traders were also discouraged by Thursday's drop on Wall Street,
followed by lower prices Friday on the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets
and persistent concerns about the fallout from the Asian crisis.
	   Investors were moving money out of stocks and into the safer
haven of bonds amid all the gloom _ including fears that some
Russian banks might fail.
	   ``People are really flying into quality,'' said Bart Peters, a
bond trader at Cera Investment Bank in Brussels.
	   In late afternoon electronic dealings, Frankfurt's Dax index was
down by 3.9 percent at 5,274.83 points.
	   German banks are big lenders to Russia, which this week devalued
its ruble and suspended debt payments. The crisis has fueled
considerable negative sentiment in German markets.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by 2.3 percent at
5,536.10. In Paris, the CAC 40 index was off by 2 percent at
4,007.16.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on
crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting
Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``Down, Down USA!'' and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!'' the crowd
chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square
in the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The sentiment was echoed a round the Middle East, where leaders
and many citizens criticized Thursday's American attacks on a
factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama bin
Laden in Afghanistan.
	   Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to
the United States, but even in U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, some
people said the attack would add to and not lessen the threat
against Americans.
	   ``This violence will only beget more violence,'' said Abeer
Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker.
	   Mohammed al-Turki, a Saudi visiting the neighboring island of
Bahrain, criticized Clinton but added that bin Laden _ who is
himself a Saudi was ``no better.''
	   An official of the Arab League, which is usually measured in its
comments on the United States, also called the attack rash.
	   ``The American action was carried out in a Rambo style and will
not resolve the problem of international terrorism,'' said league
Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed Zakariya Ismail.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the strikes were ordered to
avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and
because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being
planned.
	   In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper
stand, was among a minority who said he believed the United States
attacks were justified.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania) it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
	   Clinton's actions were widely seen in the Middle East as an
effort to distract public opinion in the United States from his
problems over a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against
Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir
daily in Lebanon said.
	   Several countries _ notably Iran _ warned, too, that the U.S.
attacks could backfire by raising Muslim ire and drawing
retaliation.
	   ``We condemned the killing of innocent people in the embassy
bombings in Africa,'' Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said
in a sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran. ``But those bombings do
not justify that innocent Muslims should die in Afghanistan.''
	   He added that the results of the American strikes ``will be to
increase hatred toward the United States.''
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told
state-run radio that the Americans had a ``double standard'' on
terrorism.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Mohammadi said.
	   Both Libya and Iran are accused by the United States of being
terrorist-sponsoring states, an allegation they've repeatedly
denied.
	   In Iraq, which charges the United States is working to prolong
U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Sheik
Abdel-Latif Hmayem used his nationally televised Friday sermon to
characterize Clinton as ``a clown'' and an enemy of Islam.
	   ``He is a professional criminal who, whenever a star rises in
the skies of Arabism and Islam, tries to pull it down,'' he said.
``The target is our Islam, our Arab identity.''

Indonesia's military commander promises to maintain reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of `Habibie' sted `habibie' and
`wide-ranging' sted `wideranging' in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hit by a barrage of allegations of
past human abuses, Indonesia's powerful military promised Friday to
press on with internal reform.
	   Armed Forces commander Gen. Wiranto said the military, known as
ABRI, would also redefine its role in Indonesian politics.
	   Under Indonesia's constitution, the military has the dual
function of maintaining security and being involved in politics,
including being represented in the Parliament.
	   He said the changes would help ``cultivate democracy in a more
empowered civil society.'' He did not elaborate.
	   The push for reform follows the resignation in May of former
President Suharto.
	   Suharto quit after a wave of protests and riots swept the
Southeast Asian island nation.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has promised wide-ranging political
and economic reforms, including a new respect for human rights. He
has also called for reform within the military.
	   In recent weeks the military has been the target of many
allegations of human rights violations.
	   A major inquiry has recommended that several senior officers,
including a son-in-law of Suharto, face court-martials over the
abduction of anti-Suharto activists.
	   Dozens were abducted and tortured. Fourteen are still missing,
feared dead. Ten soldiers have been charged with kidnappings.
	   Top military officials are also to be questioned about the
military's role in May's violence, in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   Eighteen soldiers have been charged over the shootings of four
university student protesters. The slayings triggered the riots,
which led to Suharto's departure after 32 years in office. Wiranto
said the military ``is resolving'' these cases and would review a
code ethics for troops and officers ``to prevent reoccurrences of
deviations from procedure.''
	   Wiranto also said the military is clarifying its activities in
outlying provinces such as in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh where
some small bands of rebels still operate.
	   Indonesia is currently trying to negotiate a U.N.-sponsored
peace settlement on East Timor. It has recently reduced the number
combat troops in the former Portuguese colony, which it invaded in
1975.
	   It has also cut back troop numbers in Aceh, on the island of
Sumatra, where human rights investigators are currently probing
claims that the military tortured and executed Muslim separatists.
	   A small number of bones were recovered from several suspected
mass grave sites in Aceh on Friday.

Man Utd, Liverpool fans oppose Super League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fans of Manchester United and Liverpool say
they're not supporting the idea of a European Super League.
	   Convinced that the clubs are only interested in forming the
league to gain revenue from TV and sponsors, the fans are annoyed
they're not being consulted and say they don't like the concept
anyway.
	   ``No-one has asked the fans what they think,'' said Andy Walsh,
chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters'
Association
	   ``The match-going fan is the biggest single sponsor of football
and unless our interests are paramount, the game itself will suffer
irreparable damage.''
	   Speculation has abounded in recent weeks that a Super League
could be formed around 2001 with the biggest names in European
soccer, such as Inter and AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and
Barcelona, also involved.
	   Officials of United, Liverpool and Arsenal are due to have
discussions this weekend about the possibility of joining up.
	   ``The proposals for the European Super League as we know them
are driven by the TV companies and the pursuit of cash,'' Walsh
said.
	   Liverpool fanzine editor Steve Kelly said supporters would soon
lose interest in the league if there were to be no promotion and
relegation.
	   ``The current proposals have nothing to do with the needs of
football or its fans, but are all about money and the business
interests of media moguls,'' he said.
	   ``Domestic football and the domestic title are still the most
important thing to fans and anything that devalues the existing
league structure should be opposed.
	   ``Fans must be consulted fully and openly before any club
negotiates its entry into a proposed Super League.''

Security stepped up at major Italian airports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police reinforced security at Italy's two main
international airports Friday as well as at other places considered
possible targets in case of retaliation by terrorists for the U.S.
bombings in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``The measures were taken following ministerial instructions and
from police headquarters in Rome,'' said Francesco Girasoli, head
of police at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport. ``The controls have
been stepped up as in maximum-alert periods.''
	   Girasoli said deployment of police at the airport was stepped
up, and the Italian news agency ANSA reported that private security
companies that assist the U.S. airlines TWA and Delta with security
and check-in had also stepped up staffing.
	   In Milan's Malpensa airport, served by several U.S. airlines,
security was also increased, ANSA said.
	   Guard posts and well as passing police patrols were also
reported reinforced in Milan at the U.S. Consulate, offices of U.S.
airlines and American schools.

Turkish foreign minister to visit Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will
visit Iran next month in the first high-level visit between the two
neighbors since a diplomatic row ended in January, the Anatolia
news agency reported Friday.
	   Relations between the two countries plummeted last year when the
Iranian ambassador in Ankara attended a rally advocating an Islamic
regime in secular Turkey. Both countries withdrew their envoys and
exchanged harsh words.
	   New ambassadors were appointed in January.
	   Anatolia said bilateral relations as well as the situation in
Afghanistan would be discussed during the Sept. 14-15 visit.
	   Iran is expected to ask for Turkish support for the release of
Iranian citizens detained when the Taliban forces captured a
northern Afghan city this month, Anatolia said.
	   Foreign Ministry officials were not available for comment.
	   Turkey accuses Iran of harboring rebellious Kurdish guerrillas
and of trying to fuel radical Islam in Turkey. Iran is uneasy over
Turkey's boosting military ties with Israel.

Doping scandal shocks Central American and Caribbean Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ A doping scandal took center stage
at the Central American and Caribbean Games after two Mexican
athletes were accused of ingesting banned substances.
	   Mexico lost seven medals, two of them gold, Wednesday when
officials announced swimmer Erendira Villegas and cyclist Nancy
Contreras had taken steroids and other substances designed to
improve athletic prowess.
	   ``We are shocked, very sad. The news took us by surprise,''
Felipe Munoz, head of the Mexican delegation, said Thursday.
	   The two women had performed impressively during the games.
Villegas was on the team that earned the gold in the 4 X 200 relay,
and Contreras triumphed in the 500 meters.
	   Both were ejected from the games and now face possible
punishment from the International Swimming Federation and the
International Cycling Union.
	   Even with the loss of seven medals, Mexico remained in second
place in the competition with 191 medals. Cuba has already clinched
the championship with 274 medals. Venezuela is in third place with
151 medals.

Report: Israel formally submitted 13 percent offer to Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Inching toward compromise, Israel for the first
time confirmed to the Palestinians in writing that it would
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, albeit with some
conditions, an Israeli newspaper said Friday.
	   However, a Palestinian negotiator denied any progress has been
made and said there have been no negotiations since Aug. 4.
	   The United States has tried since January to win acceptance for
a proposal that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
The Palestinians reluctantly accepted the plan, while Israel has
said a pullback on this scale would endanger its security.
	   In recent weeks, Israel floated a compromise under which it
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, but 3 percent of
that area would be declared a nature reserve and the Palestinians
would have virtually no say over land use, including construction.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Friday that Israel has now
submitted the plan to the Palestinians in writing, and that for the
first time, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has become intensively
involved in the negotiations.
	   The daily said the compromise was accepted by the Palestinians,
a claim staunchly denied by Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   ``The redeployments must be in accordance with the agreements
and not creating new categories of land,'' Asfour said Friday.
	   The Palestinians have accused the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of leaking reports that agreement with the
Palestinians was near in hopes of deflecting U.S. pressure.
	   Netanyahu aides had no comment on the Yediot report.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu summoned a key Cabinet hawk, Ariel
Sharon, to a resort in northern Israel where he is vacationing to
brief him on developments in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, could not confirm that the
Israeli offer has been put in writing. However, Sharon told
reporters earlier this week that the Palestinians already know that
Israel is prepared to hand over 13 percent of the territory.

Yugoslavs head for Wembley in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England will face Yugoslavia in an exhibition game
at Wembley Nov. 18.
	   Coach Glenn Hoddle has called for the game after his team plays
in three European Championship qualifying games against Sweden,
Sept. 5, Bulgaria, Oct. 10 and Luxembourg, Oct. 14 but then doesn't
have another until 1999.
	   England has played Yugoslavia 14 times, winning five, tying five
and losing four times. The Yugoslavs have never won at Wembley,
losing four times and tying twice.
	   The last time the two teams met was in December 1989 when
England won 2-1 at Wembley, its third victory in a row over
Yugoslavia, who haven't beaten the English for 30 years.
	   Both teams made it to the last 16 of the World Cup finals,
England losing in a penalty shootout to Argentina and Yugoslavia
tumbling 2-1 to the Netherlands.

Kohl claims election-year image as innovator, statesman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought to project a
vigorous image Friday in re-election campaign, joining forces with
a former rival and issuing firm warnings to troubled economic
partners.
	   Kohl sat shoulder to shoulder with Lothar Spaeth, an executive
and one-time political adversary whom he has named to head an
advisory panel on reforming Germany's welfare-state economy.
	   Spaeth's appointment is seen as an attempt by Kohl to emulate
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder, a pro-market Social
Democrat who has tapped a software whiz to be his economics czar if
he wins elections in five weeks' time.
	   Kohl, a conservative in power for 16 years, trails in opinion
polls for the Sept. 27 vote.
	   Launching a panel on the nation's economic future underlined his
will to keep on running Germany, Kohl said.
	   ``Because I want to win this election, I am making decisions
that point beyond the election,'' he told a news conference.
	   Kohl also put another face _ the world leader minding global and
German interests at a time of financial crisis in Russia and Asia.
	   He said he would talk by telephone to President Boris Yeltsin on
Saturday and to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi next week.
	   Kohl's panel of advisers on ``future and innovation'' will take
shape only if he wins the election, Spaeth said. About 15 business
personalities would then be enlisted to make up the group, he said.
	   He said they would advise Kohl on making Germany more
competitive in the global economy, deregulation and tax reform _
issues Schroeder already has made key elements of his campaign.
	   ``The Christian Democrats have not been dynamic enough in this
direction for my taste,'' said Spaeth, who was part of a revolt
that tried to topple Kohl as leader of the party in 1989 but is now
hitting the campaign trail with Kohl.
	   A former governor of the western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg,
Spaeth moved east in 1991 and has transformed the crumbling Carl
Zeiss Jena group into a highly successful high-tech and
telecommunications firm, Jenoptik.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading Kosovo Albanian
politician urged foreign powers Friday to declare a ``no-fly zone''
over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war machine'' in
its crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   The call by Ibrahim Rugova was issued after France warned that
military intervention may be the only alternative to halt the
fighting in Kosovo if U.S. diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire
and peace talks soon.
	   In Kosovo, state-run Tanjug news agency reported Friday that
secessionist Albanians opened fire on a Serb police patrol some 30
kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina, in the town of
Vucitrn. The report said an unspecified number of Albanians were
injured in the shootout.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Albanians, and the
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fighting Thursday
between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, despite
Serb success in driving the secessionist rebels from most of their
strongholds this month.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police have appealed for public
help in identifying two men spotted parking an explosives-packed
car that killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 last weekend.
	   But police freed three of the five men who had been arrested
Monday as part of the effort to track down the Irish Republican
Army dissidents responsible for Saturday's blast, the deadliest
terrorist attack since the Northern Ireland conflict began in 1969.
	   Under British anti-terrorist law, the two remaining suspects can
be held for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   The police moves came after three days of funerals for all the
civilians _ two infant girls, nine teen-agers, 12 women and five
men, Protestant and Catholic alike _ slain Saturday.
	   The dissidents, called the Real IRA because of their refusal to
adhere to the parent organization's July 1997 truce, have insisted
they didn't mean to cause a massacre, despite giving misleading
phoned warnings. On Wednesday a spokesman, using a recognized
codeword, announced that the group would ``suspend'' its car-bomb
attacks on Northern Ireland towns in response to the public outcry.
	   But public anger against those associated with the dissidents
continued to flare Thursday.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, leader of an anti-British pressure
group opposed to April's multi-party agreement on how Protestants
and Catholics should govern Northern Ireland, was prevented from
entering her business in the Irish Republic border town of Dundalk.
	   Managers at the town's Long Walk shopping mall changed the locks
on her T-shirt and picture-framing shop and had her escorted out by
security guards.
	   Irish police have identified her common-law husband, Michael
McKevitt, as the alleged commander of the Real IRA. Earlier this
week, through a local priest, McKevitt denied having anything to do
with the Omagh explosion and he has not been arrested.
	   Peace activists in Dundalk, 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of
Belfast, are planning to march Friday night from a cathedral to the
central square to protest against Real IRA members and supporters
believed to live in the town.
	   Sands-McKevitt, sister of the late IRA prison hunger-strike
leader Bobby Sands, is figurehead of a legal pressure group called
the 32 County Sovereignty Committee that opposes the participation
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in April's agreement.

Kidnappers release second cousin of Honduran president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ After nearly three days in
captivity, a 23-year-old relative of the Honduran president walked
free of her kidnappers early Friday and returned to her family
unharmed.
	   Tania Facusse, whose father, Mario, is a presidential hopeful,
was kidnapped Tuesday when three women and three armed men dragged
her from her car in a Tegucigalpa suburb.
	   Police captured three suspects Friday and were searching for
others. Officers were checking vehicles leaving and entering the
capital.
	   The kidnappers demanded dlrs 425,000 for the freedom of Facusse,
who is the president's second cousin, but no ransom was paid,
family members said.
	   ``It looks like they become nervous because this crime upset the
public,'' said Mario Facusse, a cousin of President Carlos Flores
Facusse and head of the National Party.
	   Tania was released near a private hospital in central
Tegucigalpa. She was treated at the hospital and released to her
family.
	   ``We are happy ... the kidnappers respected the physical and
mental integrity of Tania,'' Facusse said. ``She is nervous, but
safe and sound. ... It is an act of God, to whom I will dedicate
the rest of my life.''
	   Tania, a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, had been blindfolded during her captivity and will not
be able to identify her kidnappers, he said.
	   Facusse, a prominent textile industry businessman, launched his
campaign for his party's nomination for the 2002 presidential
election last weekend.

U.S. Embassy raises alert level for Americans in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy has raised
the alert level for American diplomats, officials and aid workers
across Bosnia following the American bombing of terrorist targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan, sources said Friday.
	   For several reasons, including its porous borders, Bosnia is
considered a high-risk country for Americans, but U.S. personnel in
other area countries, including Croatia, also received instructions
to be especially cautious.
	   Embassy officials refused to confirm or comment on their alert
level, saying security issues are never discussed.
	   Other U.S. citizens in the country, employed by non-governmental
organizations and aid agencies, have received special security
instructions as well.
	   ``In the light of the recent U.S. military strikes against
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, and possible threats to
Americans and American interests overseas'' a Consular advisory,
obtained by The Associated Press, requested Americans to ``exercise
much greater caution than usual.''
	   The instruction obviously didn't affect some 8,500 American
troops serving in the NATO-led peace force in the northern part of
Bosnia.
	   The American peacekeeping contingent remained on their regular
alert, which, because of the military drill and discipline,
stipulates higher security standards than any civilian ones, NATO
officials said.
	   The U.S. contingent ``did not discuss force protection,'' said
Cap. Sherri Handley, an American spokeswoman in the northern town
of Tuzla, which is the main base for the American peacekeepers.
	   ``However, we continuously, as a matter of daily operations,
review all force protection measures,'' Handley said. ``Our first
priority remains the safety and security of all our forces.''
	   People in Bosnia generally see the United States as an ally for
its key role in peace negotiation in 1995, and for leading
international reconstruction efforts here ever since.
	   Some officials fear that a small number of local and foreign
Muslim fundamentalists still remain in the country, although the
government, under the American pressure, has evicted most of them
over the past two years.

Hundreds of Palestinians in anti-US demonstration in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians chanted
threats against U.S. President Bill Clinton and burned U.S. flags
Friday to protest U.S. air strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   One masked demonstrator called on the Islamic militant group
Hamas to carry out a bombing in Israel to avenge the U.S. attacks.
	   The United States attacked targets linked to Islamic militant
leader Osama bin Laden, based in Afghanistan, in retaliation for
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   The air strikes have stirred angry reactions in the Arab world.
	   ``America is the first terrorist state in the world,'' prayer
leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000 people outside a Nablus
mosque after Friday noon prayers. ``America is an enemy of the
Muslims.''
	   Masked Hamas activists burned two U.S. flags and led the crowd
in chanting: ``Clinton, wait, wait, Islam will take you to your
grave.'' Some demonstrators held up newspapers with frontpage
pictures of bin Laden.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 1,000 Hamas supporters attended an
indoor protest rally. The group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, said the group would remain focused on its struggle against
Israel and not go after U.S. targets. ``When we fight Israel, we
fight the Americans,'' Yassin said. ``When we weaken the Israelis,
we affect U.S. interests.''

Ukrainian chief banker sees no grounds for major hryvna
</HEADLINE>
devaluation &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's chief banker said Friday that the
recent drop in the country's currency was a response to Russia's
ruble crisis and other international financial turmoil and he saw
no reason for a major devaluation.
	   ``We have no economic, political and financial conditions that
could cause a deep devaluation of the hryvna,'' said National Bank
chairman Viktor Yushchenko.
	   The hryvna slipped from 2.143 to the U.S. dollar last week to
2.225 on Wednesday after a devaluation of the Russian ruble. There
was no dollar trading on the interbank currency exchange on
Thursday and no rate was available Friday.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main trading partner and Ukrainian officials
fear its economic problems will spill over the border. They also
fear more foreign investors would withdraw from Ukraine's battered
financial market, putting further pressure on the hryvna.
	   Yushchenko also cited the lack of new foreign credits for the
former Soviet republic and some ``purely psychological factors''
for the hryvna's fall, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year, and Yushchenko's
bank has brought its reserves down from dlrs 2.34 billion in early
1998 to dlrs 1.15 billion this month in attempts to support the
hryvna.
	   The government has established a currency fluctuation band of
1.8 to 2.5 to the dollar for 1998.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Friday that the
government's adherence to the hryvna fluctuation band would
``depend on the processes taking place in Russia.''
	   He voiced hope that Ukraine would not face a financial crisis
similar to that in Russia, but noted that the government must
carefully ``follow every step by Russia.''
	   In particular, it must not allow an increase in Russian imports
and at the same time should stimulate Ukrainian exports to Russia,
which would be ``one of the key issues in adhering to the currency
corridor,'' Pustovoitenko said.
	   In 1997, Russia accounted for 32 percent of Ukraine's total
exports, but exports to Russia have been decreasing this year.

 &UR; Rwanda calls for cease-fire in Congo; warns of intervention
 &UR; With BC-Congo, BC-Southern Africa-Congo &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rwanda called for a cease-fire in the Congo
rebellion Friday, but warned it could still intervene to protect
its borders.
	   The government said Zimbabwe's sending troops to prop up
President Laurent Kabila ``will only serve the narrow interests of
leaders spearheading the intervention.''
	   ``Rwanda reserves the right to get involved and to assist the
Congolese people in their search for lasting solution in whatever
manner it deems appropriate,'' said the statement released in the
capital, Kigali, and obtained by The Associated Press.
	   ``The state of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo is
regrettable, and that is why the Rwandan government is urging all
parties to work towards a political solution,'' the statement said.
	   Kabila has accused Rwanda and neighboring Uganda of
masterminding a rebellion by a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and
disenchanted members of Congolese Army who took up arms on Aug. 2,
swept through eastern Congo, flew troops to the west and have come
within 150 kilometers (90 miles) of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Both countries deny the charges.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagment and
corruption.
	   On Wednesday, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola pledged support to
help Kabila ward off rebel advances. Congolese TV in Kinshasa
showed pictures late Thursday of what it said were Zimbabwean
military instructors and troops arriving at Kinshasa's Ndolo
airport.
	   Rwanda said the western side of its long, common border with
Congo continues to serve as a rear base for Hutu rebels launching
attacks on Rwanda. The statement said Rwanda has a specific
interest in the stability of the Congo.
	   President Yoweri Museveni in nrighboring Uganda was expected to
issue a similar call for a cease-fire later Friday.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who crossed over
to the rebels, flew from Goma to Kampala Friday for talks with
Museveni.
	   On Wednesday, Karaha and other civilians in the rebel movement
said they were ready for a cease-fire and political negotiations.
They warned Zimbabwe's military involvement would complicate the
crisis.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda backed an earlier eight-month rebellion
that toppled long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and brought Kabila
to power in May 1997.
	   But relations between Kinshasa and Rwanda and Uganda have
steadily deteriorated over accusations that Kabila was mismanaging
the vast African nation and failed to prevent Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels from using Congolese territory.

Palestinian says he was stoned by settlers in revenge attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli police spokeswoman saying no complaint
was received at Israeli-Palestinian liaison office &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian man told police that
Jewish settlers seized him from his car, dragged him to a cemetery,
forced him to lie face down and pelted him with stones, a
Palestinian security officer said Friday.
	   The victim, Mohammed Abdel Qader, said his assailants told him
they were avenging the slayings of two residents of the Jewish
settlement of Itzhar by Palestinian militants earlier this month.
	   The vigilante attack occurred Wednesday at Itzhar, said Col.
Fahed Diab, a Palestinian security official who serves as a liaison
with Israeli forces in the Nablus area.
	   Abdel Qader, a resident of the village of Burin near Nablus,
said he was driving in his van when he was stoned by settlers who
brought the vehicle to a stop and pulled him out.
	   The settlers took Abdel Qader to the graves of the two recent
shooting victims in Itzhar, forced him to lie face down at the
cemetery and called children from the settlement to the scene who
began pelting him with stones.
	   ``They said I had to die because we were responsible for the
death of the two settlers,'' Abdel Qader said.
	   In the meantime, Abdel Qader's sisters, who had been riding with
him in the van, alerted Palestinian police who in turn notified the
Israeli authorities, Diab said.
	   Israeli police rescued Qader who suffered some bruises. Diab
said no arrests were made in Itzhar.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said no complaint was
received at the Israeli-Palestinian liaison office, and that she
was checking the report.

Gorbachev condemns unilateral U.S. attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday
the United States should have sought approval from the United
Nations before launching missile attacks at suspected terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``I share the anger and indignation of those who believe that
terrorists should not be supported,'' Gorbachev told the Interfax
news agency.
	   But ``I do not see the United States' actions as legitimate or
balanced,'' he said.
	   ``The international community, the U.N. Security Council and the
U.N. secretary-general should have been notified.''

American-French novelist buried in an Austrian church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ American-French novelist Julien
Green, who died last week in Paris, was buried Friday in the chapel
of an Austrian church in this town he described as a ``refuge of
peace.''
	   Green was laid to rest in the Marian Chapel of the Catholic
municipal parish church in this capital city of Austria's
southernmost Carinthia (Kaernten) province.
	   He was first in Klagenfurt in 1990 to attend the staging of one
of his plays at the municipal theater. At that time, the novelist
was deeply moved by an old painting of Virgin Mary and expressed
his wish to be buried in the chapel.
	   In compliance with a wish of the deceased, the burial was
preceded by a low-key church service and normal funeral rites,
conducted by diocesan Bishop Egon Kapellari, the Austria Press
Agency reported.
	   In his sermon in German and French, the bishop said that Green
had personally lived and suffered through the ``struggle between
divine mercy and human sin in his own heart.''
	   He said that Green, the American in France, had known ``what is
(hidden) in man,'' and he knew about the ```conditio humana' (human
experience) with its heights and depths.''
	   As a writer, he belonged to the literary movement ``renouveau
catholique'' and was ``summoned to eternity'' as its last
representative, Monsignor Kapellari said.
	   ``In this precarious and unsafe world, Klagenfurt is for me a
refuge of happiness and peace,'' Green reportedly had said in
explaining his choice for the chapel where he commissioned
construction of a tomb. A bronze sculpture was created by an artist
from astern Tyrol.
	   A marble slab carries the name ``Julian Green,'' the original
American spelling of his name.
	   Those attending the funeral included Jean-Eric Jourdan-Green,
Green's adopted son; the French ambassador to Austria, Jean Cadet;
Klagenfurt Mayor Harald Scheucher, the publisher of the French
newspaper Le Figaro, Olivier Giesbert; and several Austrian friends
and artists.

Botha found guilty of ignoring summons from truth body
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: (AMs) RECASTS; UPDATES with new comment &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former President P.W. Botha, given a
day in court his government denied thousands of opponents, was
convicted Friday of ignoring a subpoena to testify about apartheid
atrocities.
	   A black magistrate gave apartheid's last hardline president a
one-year suspended jail sentence and ordered him to pay a fine of
10,000 rands (dlrs 1,577) for ignoring the summons from South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
	   Magistrate Victor Lugaju could have sentenced the 82-year-old
Botha to two years in prison, but said he took into account Botha's
age and frail health.
	   Lugaju criticized Botha for his refusal to cooperate with the
commission that was investigating abuses, including murder and
torture, carried out under his rule.
	   ``Right through the proceedings, the accused has shown no
remorse,'' Lugaju said in his ruling at the end of a trial that
underscored South Africa's still-simmering racial divisions.
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison had asked for a fine of 60,000
rands (dlrs 9,463), but because of Botha's age, did not seek a
prison term.
	   ``Had the accused been 30 or 40 years younger, the state would
have asked for imprisonment to be imposed,'' he said.
	   Reading out a 50-minute judgment, Lugaju dismissed defense
claims of technical faults with the subpoena and accusations that
the commission was biased against him.
	   ``The commission went to great lengths to assist the accused and
meet his requirements,'' the magistrate said.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks see the panel as being too soft on top ministers in
apartheid governments.
	   As Botha left the court building, about 30 supporters of the
governing African National Congress jeered and waved placards
demanding he be jailed.
	   ``We can forgive him for the past. Send him to jail for his
arrogance,'' read one.
	   ANC leaders welcomed the verdict. In a reference to Nazi war
trials at the end of the Second World War, ANC Southern Cape
secretary Ismail Lavangee said Botha was lucky to remain free.
	   ``For the fact that we are not pushing for Nuremburg-like trials
in this country, Mr. Botha can consider himself fortunate,'' he
said. ``We welcome the decision of the court. This is a vindication
of persons committed to reconciliation.''
	   Botha declined to comment to reporters, but appeared relaxed and
jovial in court as he chatted to friends and relatives. Defense
lawyers said they would appeal. Botha was released on a bail of 50
rands (dlrs 8).
	   Though originally asked to appear at commission hearings which
have now ended, Botha may be served with more subpoenas as the
commission's amnesty work continues. Botha's sentence was suspended
on condition he obey all future summons.
	   Bringing Botha to court was a vital test for the commission's
credibility as it prepares to submit a final report to President
Nelson Mandela in October summing up its often painful expose of
the country's past.
	   Alex Boraine, the acting commission chairman, told reporters in
Cape Town the verdict was a triumph for justice in post-apartheid
South Africa.
	   ``Mr. Botha has been publicly held accountable for his actions
in a court of law, and he has been afforded every opportunity to
defend himself _ something which was often denied to his political
opponents during the years of his rule,'' Boraine said.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for 11 years until 1989, when he
was ousted in an internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke
and was replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk.
	   Daryl Swanepoel, spokesman for the National Party that Botha
headed, criticized the commission for taking Botha to court.
	   ``The action against Mr. Botha is evidence of an uneven-handed
approach by the TRC with regard to dealing with the role players of
the past,'' said Swanepoel in a statement.
	   He complained that while the Truth Commission granted blanket
amnesty to several ANC figures _ the amnesty was subsequently
annulled by the Supreme Court _ ``in the Botha case they rushed
into legal action.''

French cyclist Jalabert pulls out of Burgos tour on final day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURGOS, Spain (AP) _ Sickness forced top French cyclist Laurent
Jalabert to pull out of the five-day Tour of Burgos Friday despite
the fact he was in second place and trailing by just three seconds.
	   Jalabert, who rides for the ONCE team, decided to scratch his
name from the race because of an overnight stomach ailment, the
national news agency Efe said, citing team officials.
	   Jalabert was trailing Spanish cyclist Abraham Olano by three
seconds going into the last stage. The two had held the first and
second places since the start of the race Monday.
	   The final stage stretches 167 kilometers (104 miles) and winds
up in the north central city of Burgos.
	   The race is one of the final warm-ups prior to the Tour of Spain
which begins Sept. 5 and ends Sept 27.

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A small aircraft carrying 15 passengers
and three crew members was missing Friday in a mountainous region
in midwestern Nepal, a minister said.
	   The Lumbini Airlines Twin-Ottor had taken off from Jomsom at
around 11:05 a.m. (0520 GMT) but lost radio contact with the
control tower five minutes after takeoff, said Tourism and Civil
Aviation Minister Ananda Prasad Dhungana.
	   Jomsom is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of
Katmandu, the Nepalese capital.
	   Two rescue helicopters combed the area but found no sight of the
missing DHC-6 plane, manufactured by DeHavilland of Canada,
Dhungana said.
	   The passengers included 12 Nepalese and three Indians. The
airline identified the Indians as D. Banarjee, S. Bhalrao and ABI
Bhalrao. Their residences were not immediately known.
	   The plane was last spotted by another plane around 11:15 hrs.
The crew have been identifed as Capt. Shiv Shrestha, his deputy Ali
Hussain and flight attendant Rajani Gurung.

One dead in boat accident in Venice lagoon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ An Italian man was killed Friday in the
collision of two boats in the Venetian lagoon, the third fatality
from such an accident in the last few days, Italian news reports
said.
	   Tiziano Spinadin, 38, died while taken to the hospital. His
brother, who was aboard the same boat, and a man on the other boat
involved were unhurt.
	   Although cause of the accident was not immediately determined,
officials were quick to denounce the dangers of lagoon traffic.
	   ``Boats and motorboats are an emergency here,'' said Venice
Deputy Mayor Michele Vianello. ``Our residents ... must realize the
lagoon is not a highway.''
	   The AGI news agency reported that two other men died over the
last few days following similar accidents.
	   Heavy traffic and speeding boats in the lagoon in the carless
city are also blamed for the erosion of monuments and buildings
along the city's canals.

Buffaloes beat Fighters 8-3

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Phil Clark drove in three runs with two home runs
and Kazunori Yamamoto hit a grand slam as the Kintetsu Buffaloes
beat the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 8-3 at
Tokyo Dome on Friday.
	   Clark belted a home run in the fourth and a two-run home run in
the sixth. Pinch hitter Yamamoto slugged his first homer of the
season in the ninth. Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has
24 homers.
	   The Fighters, who suffered their seven straight defeat, are
still 2 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Buffaloes, who extended
their winning streak to five.
	   At Chiba, Luis Lopez singled home a run in the nine-run fifth
inning, leading the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks to a 9-2 victory over the
Chiba Lotte Marines. Lopez formerly played with the Cleveland
Indians.
	   At Kobe, the Orix BlueWave capitalized on Seibu's shortstop
Kazuo Matsui's error for the first run in the second inning and
went on to beat the Seibu Lions 4-2.
	   In the Central League, with two outs and bases-loaded, Morihiro
Komada singled home a winning run in the bottom of 11th inning,
giving the front-running Yokohama BayStars a 5-4 victory over the
second-place Chunichi Dragons at Yokohama.
	   The Dragons tied 4-4 in the ninth on a two-run home run by
Takayuki Oonishi against ace reliever kazuhiro Sasaki and went on
to extra innings.
	   The victory widened the BayStars's lead over the second-place
Dragons to four games.
	   At Hiroshima, Dominican Alejandro Quesada singled home a run and
pinch hitter Tomoaki Kanemoto slugged a three-run home run in the
five-run seventh as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp came from behind and
beat the Yomiuri Giants 8-4. Kanemoto has 16 homers.
	   At Osaka Dome, pinch hitter Shinjiro Hiyama singled home two
runs in the three-run seventh as the Hanshin Tigers edged the
Yakult Swallows 5-4 and extended their winning streak to four.

Three copper miners die in rock fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A cave-in more than a kilometer (half
mile) underground killed three copper miners in southwest Poland
before dawn Friday.
	   Magda Slawek of the KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. press office
confirmed the deaths at the company's Rudna mine in Legnica
province, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Warsaw.
	   It was the second accident at the mine in the past month. On
July 25, one miner was killed and another injured in another
underground rock fall.
	   Mining, one of Poland's major industries, is undergoing reforms
as the economy completes the shift from communist-style central
control to free market principles.
	   Improved safety standards and the closure of some mines has
decreased the number of accidents. The government Mining office
reported 8,882 accidents last year, more than 1,000 fewer than the
previous year.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A city in the Swedish Arctic hopes that
tourists itching for a novel attraction will visit the new mosquito
museum.
	   The museum is to open next summer in Gaellivare, where northern
Sweden's formidable mosquitoes are at their worst, breeding in the
region's scenic wetlands.
	   The museum plans to provide a history of the inhabitants'
struggles with the insect, showing all sorts of mosquito oils, nets
and headgear.
	   ``We haven't had any problem collecting items. There is as much
as we want,'' Gaellivare spokesman Lars Israelsson was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT on Friday.

Paraguay in jeopardy of losing 1999 South American championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Staring down a 10-month deadline,
Paraguay is in danger of losing its privilege of hosting one of the
world's oldest soccer tournaments next year: the Copa America.
	   With an underdeveloped infrastructure _ phone lines are
sometimes hard to find _ and decaying stadiums, Paraguay has yet to
begin badly needed stadium improvements and construction to
accommodate the 12-team tournament scheduled to begin July 1.
	   The tournament, South America's biennial nations championship,
pits CONMEBOL's 10 members and two invitees in an even that started
in 1916, pre-dating the World Cup by 14 years.
	   Only one of Paraguay's stadiums, in the capital of Asuncion, is
tournament-ready, and efforts to build two more in the country's
less developed countryside have been stymied by a lack of funds.
	   Paraguayan soccer officials are hoping recently inaugurated
President Raul Cubas can resuscitate the organizing effort and help
avoid losing the prestigious 82-year-old tournament to another
country.
	   ``Cubas has promised to help us,'' said Antonio Colman, an
official with the Paraguayan Football League, the federation which
is responsible for organizing the Copa America.
	   ``We'll know more once he has taken office,'' he said, referring
to Cuba's Aug. 15 inauguration.
	   Every two years, the host country rotates among the 10 CONMEBOL
members from Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Two other teams are invited, usually
Mexico and another CONCACAF team _ a region that includes Canada,
the United States, and the Carribean.
	   For Paraguay, the 2 1-2 week tournament is an opportunity to
showcase a country perhaps known to many for a 34-year military
dictatorship that ended in 1989 _ one of Latin America's longest.
	   Currently grappling with a serious economic crisis, the Copa
America would help attract badly needed tourist dollars.
	   Paraguay's lack of progress has South American football
officials worried, and some on the organizing committee have begun
considering other sites.
	   ``If the next Copa America can't be held in Paraguay, we will do
it in Colombia,'' CONMEBOL secretary general Eduardo Deluca said.
``Colombia has expressed interest and it has the adequate
infrastructure needed to organize the Cup.''
	   Colombia is scheduled to get the tournament in 2001. If its is
moved up, Paraguay will take its place three years from now, Deluca
said.
	   But Paraguayan officials say their facilities will be ready in
time for next year's competition. If not, the Copa America will be
played ``in the stadiums we have,'' insisted Nicolas Leoz, the the
Paraguayan president of CONMEBOL.
	   But Leoz hopes to avoid that.
	   If President Raul Cubas can deliver the financial help as
promised, Paraguay's officials hope to immediately start builing
two new stadiums: one in Hernandarias, 390 kilometers (224 miles)
east of Asuncion, and another in Encarnacion, 380 kilometers (236
miles) south of the capital.
	   The officials say they are encouraged by a recently approved
dlrs 700,000 loan by a Brazilian bank to spruce up another stadium
just outside of Asuncion.
	   Paraguay's first chance to prove they're capable of continuing
as next year's host will come Dec. 15, the date of the tournament's
draw.
	   ``They will have to show the begnnings of some kind of work,''
Deluca said.

Coast guard finds 98 hidden on board freighter from Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese coast guard officials on Friday discovered
98 suspected illegal immigrants hidden in a secret room on board a
freighter that had arrived from Hong Kong, news reports said.
	   The Maritime Safety Agency discovered the 61 men and 37 women,
all believed to be Chinese, hiding in the freighter after it docked
in the port of Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo, the reports said.
	   The agency arrested the 98 for illegally entering the country
and is questioning the captain and crew of the
Panamanian-registered 1,341-ton Intan Samudera, the reports said.
	   One of the women was in poor but not serious condition,
according to a report by Kyodo News agency.
	   The 98 were not carrying travel documents and were hidden inside
a secret compartment near the vessel's engine room, Kyodo said.
	   Before reaching Kawasaki, the ship strayed off course Wednesday
and headed toward the coast of central Japan. Authorities searched
the vessel at that time but failed to find the secret room, Kyodo
said.
	   Crew members said the vessel had engine trouble, according to
Kyodo.

<TEXT>
	   JEUMERANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Grieving widows and torture victims
looked on as investigators Friday dug up three sets of bones from
remote grave sites thought to contain the remains dozens of Islamic
separatists and others killed by Indonesian troops.
	   Two skeletons found at one spot had holes in their skulls,
probably bullet wounds, forensic doctors said.
	   One, a male, was dressed only in his underwear. He had been
blindfolded, his arms bound behind his back by an army belt.
	   Indonesian troops are accused of committing atrocities,
including arbitrary killings and torture, during the late 1980s and
1990s in the northernmost province of Aceh, on Sumatra island about
1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The separatists, whose numbers have now dwindled, were crushed
when they fought to set up their own independent Muslim state.
	   A four-man team from Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission and a group of volunteers with shovels were led to
several alleged mass graves by villagers. All the recovered remains
had been buried less than 60 centimeters (two feet) below the
surface.
	   Hundreds watched the grisly investigation. Among the crowd were
dozens of sobbing widows, many wearing Islamic head scarves, who
stood waiting in case any signs of their missing husbands were
found.
	   The team said it would only take samples of human remains from
several grave sites, which locals allege contain dozens of
skeletons.
	   The bones will be subjected to forensic tests to determine
whether they were of execution victims, officials said. Mass
exhumations would be made later.
	   ``These findings show that there was very serious violations of
human rights in Aceh when the province was declared as a military
operation region'' in the late 1980s, said Baharuddin Lopa,
secretary general of the commission who heads the team.
	   Koesparmono Irsan, another team member, said a forensic team
accompanying them ``have found bullet holes in the bones of the
victims.''
	   However, the team declined to comment specifically on repeated
claims by villagers that the Indonesian army was responsible for
executions.
	   ``We are still investigating. It is too early to say who did
this,'' said Koesparmono.
	   A third set of human remains, thought to be of a human hand,
were found buried behind a remote traditional house that villagers
said had been a base for special forces troops, known as Kopassus.
	   Witnesses told the investigators the house had been used as a
torture center.
	   The house was later set ablaze by hundred of villagers just
hours after the team's visit, the official Antara news agency said.
	   One woman, Halima Mardia, 22, sobbed as she recounted how troops
sexually assaulted her and beat her husband there four years ago
when they were arrested as suspected separatists.
	   ``I never saw my husband again,'' she said, adding that she was
pregnant at the time.
	   The Indonesian media have widely reported allegations of mass
graves by villagers. Some have said they were forced at gunpoint to
bury the bodies of people executed by troops.
	   Lopa said more grave sites would be examined during the next few
days, including one site nicknamed ``Skull Hill.''
	   He said his team would then submit its findings to the
government of President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``Local villagers saw trucks full of bodies go to the grave
sites and then come back empty,'' said Muhamad Harun, a human
rights activist, of events a decade ago.
	   The investigation into the Aceh graves is the latest sign of a
new openness in Indonesia following the resignation of former
autocratic President Suharto after nationwide riots in May.
	   His successor, Habibie has promised greater human rights for
Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   In a state-of-the-nation address to Parliament last Saturday he
made an unprecedented apology for abuses committed during his
predecessor's 32-year reign.
	   Indonesia's military commander Gen. Wiranto has also publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh.
	   Since Suharto's resignation the powerful military has faced a
barrage of allegations of past wrongdoing and is currently the
subject of two major inquires over the shooting and abduction of
anti-Suharto activists.
	   In a gesture of conciliation, the military began withdrawing
troops from Aceh on Thursday when about 250 soldiers left. Another
800 are slated to go on Aug. 31.

Hundreds of Palestinians in anti-US demonstration in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians chanted
threats against U.S. President Bill Clinton and burned U.S. flags
Friday to protest U.S. air strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   One masked demonstrator called on the Islamic militant group
Hamas to carry out a bombing in Israel to avenge the U.S. attacks.
	   The United States attacked targets linked to Islamic militant
leader Osama bin Laden, based in Afghanistan, in retaliation for
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   The air strikes have stirred angry reactions in the Arab world.
	   ``America is the first terrorist state in the world,'' prayer
leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000 people outside a Nablus
mosque after Friday noon prayers. ``America is an enemy of the
Muslims.''
	   Masked Hamas activists burned two U.S. flags and led the crowd
in chanting: ``Clinton, wait, wait, Islam will take you to your
grave.'' Some demonstrators held up newspapers with front page
pictures of bin Laden.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 1,000 Hamas supporters attended an
indoor protest rally. The group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, said the group would remain focused on its struggle against
Israel and not go after U.S. targets. ``When we fight Israel, we
fight the Americans,'' Yassin said. ``When we weaken the Israelis,
we affect U.S. interests.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition Friday
accused the country's leaders of trying to kill prominent dissident
Sam Rainsy in a grenade attack and vowed to take their challenge
against alleged election fraud to the streets.
	   Sam Rainsy and three other leading opposition figures, appearing
at a news conference, urged the international community to withdraw
the endorsement it has bestowed on parliamentary elections last
month won by strongman Hun Sen.
	   The leaders said they would go ahead with a massive planned
protest Sunday against alleged election-stealing by Hun Sen and
announced they would hold daily demonstrations afterward.
	   ``Our only channel to express our discontent is in the street,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``On Sunday, on Monday, maybe one on Tuesday ...
it will be continuous until the protests are investigated.''
	   The grenade attack and the protests show Cambodia is no closer
to a peaceful resolution of its post-election instability and that
things may be getting worse.
	   Sam Rainsy was leading a sleep-in protest Thursday at the
election committee's headquarters, inside the Interior Ministry
compound, when several shots were fired and a grenade was tossed
from a passing car.
	   The grenade did not clear the wall and exploded outside it,
killing Sieng Sean, 45, a driver for Kyodo News agency of Japan.
Sam Rainsy was unharmed. There were no reports of other injuries.
	   On state television Friday night, national police chief Hok
Lundy _ a close ally of Hun Sen _ accused Sam Rainsy of provoking
the attack, and said the opposition politician bears responsibility
for the death.
	   He accused Sam Rainsy of committing a criminal offense, and said
that if he hadn't entered the ministry compound, the attack would
not have occurred.
	   His remarks suggested that the government might try to charge
Sam Rainsy with a more serious offense than trespassing.
	   Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the main opposition
leaders, have refused to recognize Hun Sen's slight majority
victory in the 122-seat National Assembly, short of the two-thirds
needed to form a government.
	   They threaten to withhold their support until the alleged
election irregularities are probed. The Hun Sen-controlled National
Election Committee has refuse to look into their complaints.
	   Ahmad Yahya, a member of Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party,
told the news conference that government leaders were behind the
grenade attack. His suspicions are widely shared, though he
presented no proof.
	   ``Last night shows they want to kill Mr. Sam Rainsy,'' Ahmad
Yahya said. ``The leaders of our country look at him as the enemy,
so therefore, according to information from different sources, they
want to kill him.''
	   ``I think the attackers may want to scare people from
participating in Sunday's demonstration,'' a shaken Sam Rainsy told
reporters after he was released Friday morning by Interior Ministry
guards.
	   He had been interrogated for several hours and held at gunpoint.
At one point, a warning shot was fired at the ground between his
legs.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak suggested that Sam
Rainsy was responsible, calling the attack ``too coincidental.''
	   Sunday's protest would be ``illegal,'' Khieu Sopheak said,
calling it ``a step leading up to social explosion and turmoil,
political crisis and alteration of the results of the elections.''
	   Khieu Sopheak said charges will be filed against Sam Rainsy for
entering the ministry compound without authorization.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack March 30,
1997, during a demonstration outside parliament. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy
himself. A bodyguard died shielding him from the blast.
	   No one was ever arrested. Sam Rainsy said at the time that he
suspected Hun Sen was behind the attack. Hun Sen briefly accused
Sam Rainsy of carrying it out himself.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon urged
calm on both sides: ``Heightened political tension in the country
would only contribute to the perception of instability.'' The
Philippines is one of a group of Southeast Asian nations which have
sought to mediate an end to Cambodia's political troubles.

Big European markets hit by Russia, Asia woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with further falls after Wall Street opens &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets
Friday afternoon, as waves of global turmoil rattled traders. A
sharp early fall on Wall Street made things worse.
	   Frankfurt's blue chips took the biggest hits _ falling 5.7
percent in value _ on concerns that Russia's economic troubles
could prove painful to German banks.
	   The London and Paris markets showed losses of between 3 percent
and 4 percent, with red ink spreading wildly through smaller
bourses on the continent.
	   Sentiment was bearish from the start, following a drop Thursday
in New York, lower prices Friday on the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets
and persistent concerns about the fallout from the Asian crisis.
	   Traders cited more concerns over factors ranging from the U.S.
military strikes on suspected terrorist targest in Afghanistan and
Sudan to the possible devaluation of Venezuela's currency.
	   Investors were moving money out of stocks and into the safer
haven of bonds amid all the gloom _ including fears that some
Russian banks might fail.
	   ``People are really flying into quality,'' said Bart Peters, a
bond trader at Cera Investment Bank in Brussels.
	   In late afternoon electronic dealings, Frankfurt's Dax index was
down by 5.7 percent at 5,175.67 points.
	   German banks are big lenders to Russia, which this week devalued
its ruble and suspended debt payments. The crisis has fueled
considerable negative sentiment in German markets.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by 3.6 percent at
5,460.9. In Paris, the CAC 40 index was off by 3.5 percent at
3,943.75.
	   Prices were lower before a new sell-off on the New York Stock
Exchange aggravated the situation late in the European trading day.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 150 points in its
first hour of trading.

Kiriyenko faces hostile Duma, Communists call for government's

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Friday defended
the devaluation of the ruble before a hostile parliament dominated
by Communists and other hard-liners who reiterated their call for
the government's ouster.
	   However, his finance minister said the government was
considering new restrictions on taking money out of the country, in
an effort to boost the ruble. He gave no details.
	   ``We can't afford the luxury of being a popular government,''
Kiriyenko said in a 10-minute speech before the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma.
	   The Duma was holding an emergency session to discuss Russia's
financial crisis, including the decision earlier this week to
effectively devalue the ruble by one-third and suspend debt
payments.
	   Worries about Russia's problems _ and fears it could hurt German
banks who lent Russia money _ caused prices to plunge on European
markets Friday.
	   Kiriyenko accused the Duma of dragging its feet on approving a
series of government-proposed steps to boost revenues and said the
lawmakers' indecision precipitated the latest financial crisis.
	   ``Let's honestly recognize that there is no political force in
the country that is ready to undertake political responsibility for
the economy in crisis,'' he said, drawing angry shouts from the
Communists and their allies.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov assailed the government,
saying it had ``put the country on the verge of a precipice.''
	   ``Russia has devalued itself to the point where a single
multibillionaire can buy it,'' he said. ``This is the full collapse
of the course carried out in the past seven years.''
	   Zyuganov repeated his call for Yeltsin to step down and proposed
a vote of no-confidence in Kiriyenko's Cabinet. The Duma later
approved a non-binding resolution calling on the president to step
down, saying he had failed to end a financial crisis ``that now
threatens Russia's national security, territorial integrity and
independence.''
	   The Duma has set a panel to prepare legal grounds for Yeltsin's
impeachment earlier this summer. Once the panel finishes its work,
two thirds of the Duma's 450 members must vote to formally launch
the motion, which would then go to Russia's high courts and the
upper chamber.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament and the motion is expected to
fizzle, as have previous attempts.
	   During the parliament debates, all Duma factions, including the
pro-government Our Home Is Russia group, called for Kiriyenko's
resignation. The premier greeted the call with a dismissive smile
and urged lawmakers to approve government-proposed fiscal steps.
	   ``It's very unpleasant to take responsibility for the unpopular
actions, but there is no pleasant and popular way out of the
crisis,'' he said.
	   The government has long asked the Duma to meet and consider a
package of austerity measures aimed at boosting revenues, but
lawmakers have resisted. The government has been forced to
implement some by decree.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the government would soon
be proposing new legislation to control the flow of money out of
Russia. He gave no details, but said they may affect export
revenues and the movement of capital.
	   ``We think it necessary to tighten currency controls in a number
of directions,'' he said.
	   The Interfax news agency said that Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin also favored more currency controls to stop flights of
money from the country.
	   The government said Thursday that between dlrs 3.5 billion and
dlrs 4.5 billion were taken out of the country legally between May
and mid-August.
	   The ruble fell slightly on Central Bank-controlled Moscow
currency exchange to 7.005 to the dollar on Friday from 6.995 the
previous day. The government said it will allow the ruble to plunge
as low as 9.5 rubles a dollar before the end of the year, but
predicted that it would stabilize at around 7 for the time being.
	   Street exchange rates plummeted to 9.5 rubles a dollar earlier
this week, but rose to 7.5-8 in recent days as the Central Bank
tightened control over banks.
	   Prices plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets Friday amid
concerns that some Russian banks may fail and that German banks who
have lent large sums to Russia will be hurt if the country cannot
pay its debts.

Rwanda calls for cease-fire in Congo; warns of intervention

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rwanda called for a cease-fire in the Congo
rebellion Friday, but warned it could still intervene to protect
its borders.
	   The government said Zimbabwe's sending troops to prop up
President Laurent Kabila ``will only serve the narrow interests of
leaders spearheading the intervention.''
	   ``Rwanda reserves the right to get involved and to assist the
Congolese people in their search for lasting solution in whatever
manner it deems appropriate,'' said the statement released in the
capital, Kigali, and obtained by The Associated Press.
	   ``The state of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo is
regrettable, and that is why the Rwandan government is urging all
parties to work towards a political solution,'' the statement said.
	   Kabila has accused Rwanda and neighboring Uganda of
masterminding a rebellion by a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and
disenchanted members of Congolese Army who took up arms on Aug. 2,
swept through eastern Congo, flew troops to the west and have come
within 150 kilometers (90 miles) of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Both countries deny the charges.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagment and
corruption.
	   On Wednesday, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola pledged support to
help Kabila ward off rebel advances. Congolese TV in Kinshasa
showed pictures late Thursday of what it said were Zimbabwean
military instructors and troops arriving at Kinshasa's Ndolo
airport.
	   Rwanda said the western side of its long, common border with
Congo continues to serve as a rear base for Hutu rebels launching
attacks on Rwanda. The statement said Rwanda has a specific
interest in the stability of the Congo.
	   President Yoweri Museveni in neighboring Uganda was expected to
issue a similar call for a cease-fire later Friday.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who crossed over
to the rebels, went from Goma to northern Ugandan town of Gulu
Friday for talks with Museveni.
	   On Wednesday, Karaha and other civilians in the rebel movement
said they were ready for a cease-fire and political negotiations.
They warned Zimbabwe's military involvement would complicate the
crisis.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda backed an earlier eight-month rebellion
that toppled long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and brought Kabila
to power in May 1997.
	   But relations between Kinshasa and Rwanda and Uganda have
steadily deteriorated over accusations that Kabila was mismanaging
the vast African nation and failed to prevent Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels from using Congolese territory.

France catching up in computer, Internet use: study
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, background on other countries
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After years of delay, most French companies are now
hooked up on computers and a rapidly-growing number are on the
Internet, a new government study says.
	   In a country where the president set up his website only last
year, 63 percent of French companies are now equipped with
micro-computers, up from 32 percent since the last survey four
years earlier, according to the study released Thursday by the
Industry Ministry.
	   Officials pointed to a number of explanations, including falling
computer prices, a recovering economy, world competition and the
upcoming euro currency next year that will initially complicate
bookkeeping.
	   ``There's been a lot of consciousness-raising in recent years,''
Jean-Luc Legall, a ministry analyst, said in a telephone interview
Friday.
	   Internet use has risen to 60 percent among businesses with more
than 2,000 employees, but the figure drops to 30 percent overall
and only 15 percent among small and medium-size businesses, said
the study by the ministry's statistics agency Sessi.
	   Only 13 percent of French companies use the Web to publicize
their operations, said the study, which was posted on the
ministry's website.
	   To boost Internet use, France's vice-minister for industry,
Christian Pierret, noted the government was spending 50 million
francs (dlrs 8.3 million) this year to train managers on the Web.
	   France has lagged far behind other industrialized countries in
Internet use, with only 11 Internet-rigged computers per 1,000
inhabitants compared to 28 in Britain and 81 in the United States
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). Japan and Germany also lagged behind with 11
and 18 respectively.
	   Even French media chided President Jacques Chirac for being
unfamiliar with a computer mouse as late as last year. With great
fanfare, the presidential palace inaugurated its Website on
Bastille Day, July 14, 1997.
	   But France is catching up, officials say. Most government
ministries have established Web sites in recent years, also after
years of delay.
	   ``We feel a very strong acceleration in Internet use,'' said
Legall, citing a France Telecom study that Internet traffic in
France is booming by 15 percent a month and about 400 percent a
year.
	   Among factors behind the rush to computers is the need to keep
two sets of books beginning Jan. 1, when the euro currency takes
effect.
	   Companies will be required to calculate in both francs and euros
until national currencies are to be phased out in 2002, when euro
notes and coins are to be issued.

Polish, Czech foreign ministers discuss NATO, EU membership plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Central Europe
neighbors and NATO candidates Poland and the Czech Republic met
Friday for talks on joining the Western military alliance.
	   Both Bronislaw Geremek of Poland and Jan Kavan of the Czech
Republic supported the United States' attacks Thursday on alleged
terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   Geremek said the U.S. missile raids showed ``determination not
to leave terrorism unpunished,'' while Jan Kavan called them an
``understandable reaction'' to last week's terrorist bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Kavan and Geremek described their talks on joining NATO and
seeking EU membership as ``singing in unison.''
	   Polish and Czech foreign and defense minister plan to meet in
early October in Liberec, in the Czech Republic, to discuss
military cooperation and purchasing uniform equipment in
preparation for formally joining NATO in April.

Iran deploys troops on border with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has deployed troops on its border with
Afghanistan to guard against possible attack, Iranian radio
reported Friday.
	   Troops of the elite Revolutionary Guards were sent to the border
to monitor the movement of forces fighting the civil war in
Afghanistan, the radio reported. It did not say how many troops
were deployed.
	   Iran is ``carefully monitoring the military activity on its
eastern border and will not tolerate any aggression,'' a senior
Revolutionary Guards commander told the radio.
	   ``Any aggression against the Islamic homeland will be strongly
confronted,'' said the commander.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan,
of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who now heads a
government advisory council, warned Tuesday that Iran might resort
to force to free the Iranians, who include 11 diplomats, one
journalist and 35 drivers for an international transport company.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban. Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the
northern-based opposition to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.

Kohl rejects new fund for former Nazi slave workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday rejected
proposals by German industry to open a government fund to
compensate people forced to work as slave laborers by Nazi Germany.
	   ``What companies, banks or insurance firms do to compensate Nazi
victims is their business,'' Kohl told a news conference.
	   His reply to ideas for ``opening the restitution coffers one
more time'' is ``a clear no,'' he said.
	   Fearing lawsuits of the kind that dogged Swiss banks, German
firms have suggested they could pay into a government-sponsored
fund that would compensate former slave workers.
	   Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial group, said Thursday it
would be willing to contribute. Automaker BMW and the Hochtief
construction firm have also signaled readiness to take part.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, made a surprise
announcement last month that it would pay its World War II slave
laborers.

U.S. Embassy raises alert level for Americans in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's U.S. Embassy has
raised the alert level for American diplomats, officials and aid
workers following the American bombing of Islamic militant targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan, sources said Friday.
	   For several reasons, including its porous borders, Bosnia is
considered a high-risk country for Americans, but U.S. personnel in
other area countries, including Croatia, also received instructions
to be especially cautious.
	   Embassy officials refused to confirm or comment on their alert
level, saying security issues are never discussed.
	   Other U.S. citizens in the country, employed by non-governmental
organizations and aid agencies, have received special security
instructions as well.
	   ``In the light of the recent U.S. military strikes against
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, and possible threats to
Americans and American interests overseas'' a Consular advisory,
obtained by The Associated Press, requested Americans to ``exercise
much greater caution than usual.''
	   The American peacekeeping contingent of 8,500 troops remained on
their regular alert, which has higher security standards than any
civilian ones, NATO officials said.
	   People in Bosnia generally see the United States as an ally for
its key role in peace negotiation in 1995, and for leading
international reconstruction efforts here ever since.
	   Some officials fear that a small number of local and foreign
Muslim fundamentalists still remain in the country, although the
government, under the American pressure, has evicted most of them
over the past two years.

	   In Mexico City around 9 a.m. (1400 GMT), on 48-hour spot dollar
markets, banking leader Banamex quoted the peso trading at a
mid-rate of 9.565 pesos to dlrs 1, down from 9.345 at Thursday's
close.
	   Banamex quoted the spot peso opening at a mid-rate of 9.55.
	   Traders cited worries of a possible devaluation in Venezuela
spreading through Latin America, and said domestic speculators were
especially active.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday
recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S.
missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
	   After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir also
announced that Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations,
the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity.
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility
described by U.S. officials.
	   El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese
who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques
chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag.
	   The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear.
	   Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated
for injuries, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said there was still concern that some
victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated
Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been
accounted for.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory,
estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of
Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six
Tomahawk missiles.
	   He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate
if it did any damage.
	   State-run Sudan television said that the factory, which opened
in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main
products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
	   Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert
public attention from the grand jury investigation into his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a
sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his
crumbling credibility and reputation.''
	   The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with
pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton:
Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ...
Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.''
	   He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the
missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all
training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia.
	   Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy
compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest
the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of
Khartoum in 1996.
	   Earlier in the day, hundreds of Sudanese trudged through streets
made muddy with rain to view the twisted steel and concrete rubble
of the four-story factory.
	   Police tried to block the civilians, mostly women and children,
from entering the factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.

Iran deploys troops on border with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has deployed troops on its border with
Afghanistan to guard against possible attack, Iranian radio
reported Friday.
	   Troops of the elite Revolutionary Guards were sent to the border
to monitor the movement of forces fighting the civil war in
Afghanistan, the radio reported. It did not say how many troops
were deployed.
	   Iran is ``carefully monitoring the military activity on its
eastern border and will not tolerate any aggression,'' a senior
Revolutionary Guards commander told the radio.
	   ``Any aggression against the Islamic homeland will be strongly
confronted,'' said the commander.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan,
of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who now heads a
government advisory council, warned Tuesday that Iran might resort
to force to free the Iranians, who include 11 diplomats, one
journalist and 35 drivers for an international transport company.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban. Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the
northern-based opposition to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States was briefing the
Security Council on Friday on its decision to bomb suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, which it has defended
according to its right to self-defense under international law.
	   The deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, was to explain
President Bill Clinton's reasoning before the 15-member council,
diplomatic sources said.
	   On Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the
military strikes in a letter to the Security Council president that
said the strikes complied with international law and the rights of
states to self-defense under the U.N. charter.
	   Repeated threats by Osama Bin Laden's terrorist organization
left Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   The article requires member states report any such actions to
the Security Council.
	   Clinton said U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation
for the bombings linked to bin Laden at U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   ``The targets struck, and the timing and method of attack used,
were carefully designed to minimize risks of collateral damage to
civilians and to comply with international law, including the rules
of necessity and proportionality,'' Richardson wrote.
	   In April, Richardson travelled to Afghanistan, where the
Saudi-born Bin Laden lives, and received a promise from Taliban
leaders to keep him ``under wraps'' and prevent him from using
Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activities.
	   ``It is the sincere hope of the United States government that
these limited actions will deter and prevent the repetition of
unlawful terrorist attacks on the United States and other
countries,'' Richardson in the letter to council president Danilo
Turk of Slovenia.
	   ``We call on all nations to take the steps necessary to bring
such indiscriminate terrorism to an end.''

War crimes suspect hands over archive to Hague tribunal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade lawyer has handed over
documents gathered by an indicted war criminal, incriminating some
Serbian officials involved in atrocities in the Bosnian war.
	   ``The documents seriously incriminate Serbia's Interior
Ministry, especially its top,'' Tatomir Lekovic told the Associated
Press Friday. Lekovic was entrusted the files by his late client,
alleged war crimes suspect Slobodan Miljkovic, who was fatally shot
in a bar earlier this month.
	   Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was wanted by the U.N. War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, for atrocities allegedly
committed in Bosnia. After the war, Miljkovic returned to his
hometown in central Serbia, where he was protected by authorities
who refuse to extradite any of several war crimes suspects in their
midst.
	   On Aug. 7 Miljkovic was shot and killed by an off-duty
policeman, following a fight in a late-night bar.
	   According to Lekovic, Miljkovic was constantly followed by
police and lived in fear that someone would try to hush him up,
because he ``knew too much.'' In an interview in March, Miljkovic
said he was innocent and blamed Serb politicians who ``pushed us
into war.''
	   Lekovic declined to elaborate on contents of the documents, for
fear of impeding the work of investigators. He said, however, that
they detail activities of the Serbian leadership beyond atrocities
that took place in northern Bosnia in 1992, for which Miljkovic was
indicted.
	   According to Lekovic, Miljkovic approached him some six weeks
before his death, asking him to safeguard the documents and hand
them over to UN officials, should he die. Last Wednesday, Lekovic
made good on his promise and gave representatives from the U.N.
tribunal the documents.
	   The Belgrade-based Fund for Humanitarian Law, a human rights
group, mediated the hand over.
	   Natasa Kandic, director of the Fund, said the documents were
``very relevant,'' adding that some of them bore the names and
signatures of several top Serbian police officials.
	   ``I haven't had a chance to see anything like that before,'' she
said.
	   Kandic declined, however, to go into the documents' actual
contents, saying only that they shed light on hierarchy and order
of commands in the Serbian establishment at the time.
	   The U.N. tribunal also refused to comment on the files, calling
their acquisition an ``operational matter.''
	   Serbia largely supported the 1992-1995 rebellion by ethnic Serbs
in Bosnia, who took up arms to contest the decision by Bosnia's
Muslims and Croats to secede from the former Yugoslavia.

Ukraine prepares for millennium bug, orders computers checked

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has ordered its nuclear power
plants to thoroughly examine all their computers to avoid the
so-called ``millennium bug'' that threatens to cause widespread
confusion in 2000.
	   The government has asked all ministries, departments and
regional administrations to make similar checks and report their
findings by Sept. 15, the government's press service said Friday.
	   The National Information Agency will then come up with
recommendations, it said.
	   The millennium bug threatens all computer programs that use only
the last two digits to designate a year. When 1999 changes into
2000, many computers might confuse between that year and 1900,
which could cause major faults or shutdowns.
	   Experts fear that developing and economically struggling
countries like Ukraine and other former Soviet republics do not
have enough money to deal with the problem, and that the bug could
affect their financial markets and telecommunications networks.
	   In Ukraine, the problem is aggravated by the presence of nuclear
power plants including Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident in 1986.
	   The state Energoatom company that runs Ukraine's five atomic
plants sent the plants a letter late last month ordering a thorough
examination of all computer systems, according to the Interfax news
agency. The results are to be submitted no later than June 1, 1999.
	   It has also asked the Kiev Nuclear Research Institute and the
Academy of Sciences to participate, the report said.
	   However, experts say the millennium bug does not threaten the
safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants, some of which use
outdated Soviet-designed reactors and other systems and have
experienced a growing number of minor accidents lately.
	   Ludwig Lytvynsky, the director of the State Control Systems and
Accident Regulation Center, said programs securing the plants'
safety ``are not linked in any way'' to the annual calendar and
year designation.
	   ``The processors and computers used at the nuclear power plants
are far from a PC,'' he said.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade lawyer has handed over
documents gathered by an indicted war criminal, incriminating some
Serbian officials involved in atrocities in the Bosnian war.
	   ``The documents seriously incriminate Serbia's Interior
Ministry, especially its top,'' Tatomir Lekovic told the Associated

in a bar earlier this month.
	   Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was wanted by the U.N. War

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity expressed ``deep concern'' Friday
over the U.S. missile attack against Sudan _ one of its 52 member
states _ and over the implications of the attack.

have been injured'' in the attack on a suspected terrorist
installation in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, Salim A. Salim
said.
	   He said Addis-based OAU has consistently condemned terrorism and
favors an international response to it.
	   ``We believe that the struggle against terrorism must be pursued
vigorously and in a coordinated manner; international terrorism
requires an international response,'' Salim said.

	   UBS chief executive officer Marcel Ospel last weekend said he
hoped the SNB would ``show financial solidarity.''
	   One of the suits dropped by the claimants in the settlement was
against the SNB because it accepted Nazi gold stolen from Holocaust
victims.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.

War crimes suspect hands over archive to Hague tribunal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade lawyer has handed over
documents gathered by an indicted war criminal, incriminating some
Serbian officials involved in atrocities in the Bosnian war.
	   Serbia largely supported the 1992-1995 rebellion by ethnic Serbs
in Bosnia, who took up arms to contest the decision of Bosnia's
Muslims and Croats to secede from the former Yugoslavia.
	   ``The documents seriously incriminate Serbia's Interior
Ministry, especially its top,'' Tatomir Lekovic told the Associated
Press Friday. Lekovic was entrusted the files by his late client,
alleged war crimes suspect Slobodan Miljkovic, who was fatally shot
in a bar earlier this month.
	   Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was wanted by the U.N. War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, for atrocities allegedly
committed in Bosnia. After the war, Miljkovic returned to his
hometown in central Serbia, where authorities refused to extradite
any of several war crimes suspects in their midst.
	   Miljkovic was shot and killed Aug. 7 by an off-duty policeman,
following a fight in a late-night bar.
	   According to Lekovic, Miljkovic was constantly followed by
police and lived in fear that someone would try to hush him up,
because he ``knew too much.'' In an interview in March, Miljkovic
said he was innocent and blamed Serb politicians who ``pushed us
into war.''
	   Lekovic declined to elaborate on contents of the documents, for
fear of impeding the work of investigators. He said, however, that
they detail activities of the Serbian leadership beyond atrocities
that took place in northern Bosnia in 1992, for which Miljkovic was
indicted.
	   According to Lekovic, Miljkovic approached him some six weeks
before his death, asking him to safeguard the documents and hand
them over to UN officials in case he died. Last Wednesday, Lekovic
made good on his promise and gave representatives from the U.N.
tribunal the documents.
	   The Belgrade-based Fund for Humanitarian Law, a human rights
group, mediated the transfer.
	   Natasa Kandic, director of the Fund, said some of the documents
bore the names and signatures of several top Serbian police
officials, but declined to describe their contents.
	   ``I haven't had a chance to see anything like that before,'' she
said.
	   The U.N. tribunal also refused to comment on the files, calling
their acquisition an ``operational matter.''

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan recalled its diplomats Friday from
Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the
Sudanese capital a day earlier.
	   After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, President Omar
el-Bashir also announced that Sudan would file complaints with the
United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of African
Unity.
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility
described by U.S. officials.
	   El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese
who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques
chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag.
	   The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear.
	   Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated
for injuries, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said there was still concern that some
victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated
Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been
accounted for.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory,
estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Islamic
militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six
Tomahawk missiles.
	   He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate
if it did any damage.
	   State-run Sudan television said that the factory, which opened
in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main
products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
	   Earlier Friday, hundreds of Sudanese trudged through streets
made muddy with rain to view the twisted steel and concrete rubble
of the four-story factory.
	   Police tried to block the civilians, mostly women and children,
from entering the factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert
public attention from the grand jury investigation into his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a
sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his
crumbling credibility and reputation.''
	   El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ...
Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.''
	   He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the
missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all
training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia.
	   Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy
compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest
the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of
Khartoum in 1996.

BERN: that gold.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Bank directors said their wartime predecessors had to accept
gold from both sides to fulfill their mandate of maintaining the
value of the gold-backed Swiss currency.
	   The small neutral nation surrounced by Germany and Nazi allies
eeded increasing amounts of gold in the face of demand for the
Swiss franc, the only internationally acceptable currency on the
European continent.
	   Earlier this week, SNB board chairman Jakob Schoenenberger said
he and bank president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution to
the settlement.
	   A contribution also is opposed by Switzerland's main political
parties. But the government has declined to make any
recommendation, saying the decision is a matter for the bank
itself.
	   The government says the agreement creates no obligations for it
as it was not involved in the negotiations, and rules out use of
taxpayers' money to help finance the settlement.
	   Central bank officials have noted that the SNB did make a
contribution of 100 million francs (dlrs 69 million) to a Swiss
fund to help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   Swiss banks and industry have given a total of 275 million
francs (dlrs 190 million) to that fund, set up last year by the
commercial banks.

Edwards after first European gold; 4-day weekend in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ World record-holder Jonathan Edwards
has the best triple jump in the world this season, and four of the
top five. Still, winning the European outdoor title Sunday won't be
easy.
	   Edwards, after a strong start this season, picked up a heel
injury earlier this month in a meet in Sheffield, England. Then
came a subsequent ankle injury, which probably caused him to bomb
out of the Golden League meet in Monte Carlo, Monaco, where he
failed to register a fair jump.
	   A few days later in Zurich, he bounced back with a jump of
17.75, just under his season world-leading mark of 18.01.
	   Edwards arrived in the Hungarian capital late Thursday, hoping
to improve on his meager sixth-place finish four years ago in
Helsinki.
	   ``I've been looking forward to getting out here,'' he said
Friday. ``I'm feeling fine physically and mentally. However I'm
taking nothing and no one for granted. Everyone will want the gold
medal as much as me.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONG WEEKEND: &LR;  It's a four-day holiday in Hungary. The holiday,
known simply as ``August 20,'' commemorates the organizing of the
Hungarian state in 1,000 by St. Stephen. It's also the traditional
weekend to celebrate the ``new bread,'' signifying rebirth and the
annual harvest of wheat.
	   The Hungarian capital of 2 million, usually bustling with
traffic, is quiet and nearly smog-free with many families out of
town at weekend homes on the Danube. The most popular resort area
is the country, Lake Balaton in the southwestern part of the
country, is also packed.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WHAT'S IN A NAME? &LR;  Pressed by a British reporter on the correct
pronunciation of his surname, 800-meter world record-holder Wilson
Kipketer said he really didn't care how foreigners said it.
	   Unsatisfied, the reporter asked again, ``But what do your family
and friends call you?''
	   Kipketer replied, sheepishly, ``They call me Wilson.''
	   For the record, the Kenyan-born Dane eventually said it's
Kip-KAY-ter.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FAITHFUL:  &LR;  Erki Nool, the Estonian who won the decathlon _ the
first from the Baltic country to win European gold since 1938 _
shocked some reporters after his victory.
	   ``I know I am the most popular citizen of my country,'' he said.
``But no matter how many girls come to the airport to greet me, I
will be faithful to my fiance, Kadri, who is pregnant.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ODDS AND ENDS: &LR;  Former Olympic, world and European champion
Linford Christie will receive an honorary doctorate in November
from Sheffield Hallam University.
	   Spanish 800-meter hopeful Roberto Parra assessing his chances
against world record-holder Wilson Kipketer. ``Nobody is Superman,
not even Wilson Kipketer.''
	   Nep stadium, the site of the championships, is celebrating its
45th anniversary Thursday. The stadium was opened Aug. 20, 1953
with a friendly match between Budapest Honved and Spartak Moscow.
The Hungarians won, as they did most of the time in the 50s when
the country was a world soccer power.

US to brief council on Afghan, Sudan bombings

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US postponing briefing, no formal request for

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States postponed a briefing
Friday morning to the Security Council on its decision to bomb
suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan amid
complaints from some member states that it had acted unilaterally
on an international problem.
	   The council met for less than an hour to discuss an unrelated
issue and broke for the morning without any discussion on the
raids. U.S. diplomatic officials said they decided a letter
Thursday from the U.S. ambassador defending Washington's air
strikes to the council was sufficient for the time being.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hadn't
received any formal request from Sudan to hold a special meeting or
investigation into the issue. But council sources said Sudan was
making a push for such a meeting in informal consultations with
council members.
	   When asked whether a meeting was possible, Turk said, ``For the
time being no, because there has been no initiative in that
direction.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan condemned America's attack
on neighboring Afghanistan as a violation of international norms
conducted without its knowledge _ and added a missile gone awry
killed at least five Pakistanis.
	   The outrage the Pakistani government expressed was mirrored
Friday in protests across the country. Violence broke out at one
demonstration, in the Afghan border city of Peshawar that hosts
thousands of Afghan refugees.
	   The missile that hit Pakistan was part of the barrage fired
Thursday at Afghanistan, where U.S. officials said they were
targeting the alleged militant training camps of Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden is believed behind the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies
in Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said five or
six people were killed, but did not say where the missile struck in
Pakistan.
	   ``It seems there has been some technical error,'' he said
	   The U.S. Embassy spokesman said he had no information on Altaf's
report.
	   Pakistan condemned the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan.
Altaf said a U.S. envoy was called to the Foreign Ministry for a
formal protest over those strikes, as well as over the mistaken
missile strike on its own soil and the presumed violation of its
airspace to hit Afghanistan. He said Pakistan had been neither
consulted nor warned of the attack.
	   ``Pakistan takes a serious view of this unilateral action of the
U.S. involving the use of force against sovereign countries in
violation of the recognized principles and norms,'' Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Pakistani senate.
	   Aziz, though, also condemned ``terrorism in all its
manifestations.''
	   The Pakistani government is a U.S. ally as well as one of the
few country's in the world to recognized the Taliban, the extremist
Islamic militia that harbors bin Laden, as Afghanistan's legitimate
government.
	   ``Clearly Pakistan is caught between two allies,'' said Maleeha
Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. ``Whatever it
does there are costs. It's not an enviable position to be in.''
	   Pakistani politicians must answer to a vocal minority in the
officially Muslim country that often portrays the United States as
an enemy of Islam. Already weakened by an economic crisis and other
domestic issues, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government cannot
appear to have abandoned an Islamic neighbor.
	   Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and
chanted angry slogans Friday across Pakistan. In the northern city
of Peshawar, on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, Afghan refugees
clashed with police as they tried to march to the American
consulates. Shots were exchanged, and several injuries were
reported.
	   Many of the protests were called by conservative Islamic parties
whose religious leaders announced them at mosques on Friday, the
Muslim holy day.
	   The United Nations closed its offices and directed its American
and other foreign staff to stay home for their own safety.
	   The U.S. State Department had recalled all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families Monday and warned other
Americans to leave the country. Many Americans who had stayed are
now flying out, some catching flights early Friday morning.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said Americans had been
issued no additional warnings since the strikes on Afghanistan,
adding ``we're still operating under the previous advisory that
Americans should consider leaving.''
	   Hoagland said he had no numbers on how many of the estimated
6,700 Americans living in Pakistan have left.

Swiss central bank refuses to pay into Holocaust settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous, ADDS further detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss central bank Friday refused
to contribute to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement by the country's
two biggest commercial banks with Holocaust survivors.
	   The Swiss National Bank announced the decision after an
extraordinary meeting of its 40-member board to discuss the accord.
	   United Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse said they expected
other Swiss companies and institutions to help finance the
agreement they made in an out-of-court settlement of billions of
dollars worth of claims by Holocaust survivors.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the central bank, the Swiss
government, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   Although welcoming the accord, the SNB stressed in a statement
that it was not involved in the settlement negotiations.
	   It ``holds the view that its subsequent participation in the
costs of the settlement would lend this an official character,
which is not in the interests of the country as a whole,'' the
statement added.
	   The central bank, which was the central relay point for the bulk
of gold the Nazis sold to neutral nations during World War II, has
said any obligations arising from its dealings have been settled in
a 1946 treaty.
	   The bank said it regrets some of the decisions by the wartime
board of directors but rejects the jurisdiction of any U.S. court
to handle such a case against a sovereign country.
	   ``The National Bank once more regrets the dark sides of its
conduct in this difficult period,'' Friday's statement said.
	   UBS chief executive officer Marcel Ospel last weekend said he
hoped the SNB would ``show financial solidarity.''
	   One of the suits dropped by the claimants in the settlement was
against the SNB because it accepted Nazi gold stolen from Holocaust
victims.
	   Studies in recent months have said the central bank should have
known that much of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany during
the war had been looted from the national treasuries of occupied
countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   Bank directors said their wartime predecessors had to accept
gold from both sides to fulfill their mandate of maintaining the
value of the gold-backed Swiss currency.
	   The small neutral nation surrounded by Germany and Nazi allies
needed increasing amounts of gold in the face of demand for the
Swiss franc, the only internationally acceptable currency on the
European continent.
	   Earlier this week, SNB board chairman Jakob Schoenenberger said
he and bank president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution to
the settlement.
	   A contribution also is opposed by Switzerland's main political
parties. But the government has declined to make any
recommendation, saying the decision is a matter for the bank
itself.
	   The government says the agreement creates no obligations for it
as it was not involved in the negotiations, and rules out use of
taxpayers' money to help finance the settlement.
	   Central bank officials have noted that the SNB did make a
contribution of 100 million francs (dlrs 69 million) to a Swiss
fund to help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   Swiss banks and industry have given a total of 275 million
francs (dlrs 190 million) to that fund, set up last year by the
commercial banks.

Palestinian says he was stoned by settlers in revenge attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian man told police that
Jewish settlers pulled him from his car, dragged him to a cemetery,
forced him to lie face down and pelted him with stones, a
Palestinian security officer said Friday.
	   The victim, Mohammed Abdel Qader, said his assailants told him
they were avenging the slaying of two residents of the Jewish
settlement of Itzhar by Palestinian militants earlier this month.
	   The vigilante attack occurred Wednesday at Itzhar, said Col.
Fahed Diab, a Palestinian security official who serves as a liaison
with Israeli forces in the Nablus area.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said no complaint was
received at the Israeli-Palestinian liaison office, and that she
was checking the report.
	   Abdel Qader, a resident of the village of Burin near Nablus,
said he was driving in his van when he was stoned by settlers who
brought the vehicle to a halt and pulled him out.
	   The settlers took Abdel Qader to the graves of the two recent
shooting victims in Itzhar, forced him to down and called children
in from the settlement who began pelting him with stones.
	   ``They said I had to die because we were responsible for the
death of the two settlers,'' Abdel Qader said.
	   In the meantime, Abdel Qader's sisters, who had been riding with
him in the van, alerted Palestinian police who in turn notified the
Israeli authorities, Diab said.
	   Israeli police rescued Qader, who suffered some bruises. Diab
said no arrests were made in Itzhar.

	   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador Ahmad Kamal, said Pakistan agreed
with the right of countries to self-defense but said the ``scourge

states.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
Kamal said. ``And that requires an international consensus and that
requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.''

	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended Washington's air
strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied
with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N.
charter and international law.
	   Repeated threats by Osama Bin Laden's terrorist organization
left Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   The article requires member states to report any such actions
immediately to the Security Council.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The threat of a full-scale war loomed
Friday in sub-Saharan Africa, with countries from the eastern Great
Lakes region lining up against several of embattled Congo's
southern neighbors.
	   Zimbabwe began deploying troops in support of President Laurent
Kabila, while Rwanda in the east called for a cease-fire, but
warned it would intervene unless the Zimbabweans withdrew.
	   Angolan soldiers have also begun arriving in Kinshasa to help
Kabila, Mozambican radio reported.
	   Spanning from central to eastern and southern Africa, vast and
troubled Congo appears to be threatening the stability of an
already troubled region.
	   Kinshasa, struggling through power cuts and dwindling food
stocks, was on a war footing, with hundreds of protesters
converging on the French Embassy and state radio blasting Rwanda
and the West for meddling in Congo's internal affairs.
	   ``We have our allies who believe we must change the mentality of
Rwanda,'' Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi said in a telephone
interview. ``If Rwanda does not withdraw we risk a war of a hundred
years.''
	   Kabila says Rwanda and Uganda are behind a rebel movement that
began earlier this month and threatens to march all the way to the
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Earlier this week, Information Minister Didier Mumengi said
Uganda had sent a column of troops across its border into Congo.
Mumengi previously accused Uganda of sending tanks and troops into
Congo.
	   Both countries deny the charges, but Rwanda warned it would
intervene to protect its borders if other nations send troops to
prop up Kabila.
	   Rebels in Congo's west have marched to the strategic town of
Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Those same forces, with important help from Rwanda and Uganda,
last year helped Kabila oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko. They have since grown disenchanted with the new government,
while Rwanda has become increasingly concerned that Kabila has done
little to secure the turbulent eastern border region.
	   ``Rwanda reserves the right to get involved and to assist the
Congolese people in their search for lasting solution in whatever
manner it deems appropriate,'' said a statement released in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   South Africa hastily called for weekend peace talks to ward off
an expanded conflict that could pit troops from several countries
battling for and against Kabila.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela plans to host the talks
between the presidents of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``It's in that context
that we view the weekend discussions in a very, very serious
light.''
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principle to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the South African capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to comment on whether the rebels themselves were
invited.
	   An offer earlier this week by the rebels to negotiate a
cease-fire with Kabila was dismissed by the government, which says
it will only talk directly with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The new peace effort came as military technicians and advisers
from Zimbabwe started to arrive in Congo's capital.
	   Rwanda's ambassador to South Africa, Ben Karenzi, earlier said
his country was ready for full-out war with Congo if the
Zimbabweans troops don't withdraw.
	   Angola also appeared to be preparing to provide troop and air
support to Kabila, a western diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Although embroiled in its own domestic problems, Angola may
enter the conflict on Kabila's behalf as a preemptive move to stop
UNITA rebels from linking up with the Congolese rebels _ an army of
ethnic Tutsis, Rwanda soldiers and members of Kabila's military.
	   About 600 people, many waving banners, blowing whistles and
carrying sticks, protested Friday in front of the French Embassy in
Kinshasa, accusing France and the United States of trying to
destabilize Congo and of supporting Rwanda.

Ukrainian chief banker sees no grounds for major hryvna
</HEADLINE>
devaluation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to UPDATE with Friday's hryvna rate. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's chief banker said Friday that the
recent drop in the country's currency was a response to Russia's
ruble crisis and other international financial turmoil and he saw
no reason for a major devaluation.
	   ``We have no economic, political and financial conditions that
could cause a deep devaluation of the hryvna,'' said National Bank
chairman Viktor Yushchenko.
	   The hryvna slipped from 2.143 to the U.S. dollar last week to
2.243 on Friday after a devaluation of the Russian ruble earlier in
the week.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main trading partner and Ukrainian officials
fear its economic problems will spill over the border. They also
fear more foreign investors would withdraw from Ukraine's battered
financial market, putting further pressure on the hryvna.
	   Yushchenko also cited the lack of new foreign credits for the
former Soviet republic and some ``purely psychological factors''
for the hryvna's fall, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year, and Yushchenko's
bank has brought its reserves down from dlrs 2.34 billion in early
1998 to dlrs 1.15 billion this month in attempts to support the
hryvna.
	   The government has established a currency fluctuation band of
1.8 to 2.5 to the dollar for 1998.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Friday that the
government's adherence to the hryvna fluctuation band would
``depend on the processes taking place in Russia.''
	   He voiced hope that Ukraine would not face a financial crisis
similar to that in Russia, but noted that the government must
carefully ``follow every step by Russia.''
	   In particular, it must not allow an increase in Russian imports
and at the same time should stimulate Ukrainian exports to Russia,
which would be ``one of the key issues in adhering to the currency
corridor,'' Pustovoitenko said.
	   In 1997, Russia accounted for 32 percent of Ukraine's total
exports, but exports to Russia have been decreasing this year.

Big European markets hit by Russia, Asia woes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets
Friday, as waves of global turmoil rattled traders. A sharp early
fall on Wall Street made things even worse.
	   Frankfurt's blue chips took the biggest hits _ at one point
falling as far as 6 percent _ on concerns that Russia's economic
troubles could prove painful to German banks.
	   The London and Paris markets lost more than 3 percent each, with
red ink spreading wildly through through smaller bourses across
Europe.
	   Sentiment was bearish from the start, following a drop Thursday
in New York, lower prices Friday on the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets
and persistent concerns about the fallout from the Asian crisis.
	   Traders cited concerns over factors ranging from the U.S.
military strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan to the possible devaluation of Venezuela's currency.
	   ``The uncertainty is adding up,'' said Regis Khaber, an analyst
at the Aurel brokerage in Paris.
	   Many investors were moving money out of stocks and into the
safer haven of bonds amid all the gloom _ including fears that some
Russian banks might fail.
	   ``People are really flying into quality,'' said Bart Peters, a
bond trader at Cera Investment Bank in Brussels.
	   In Frankfurt, the Dax index finished the afternoon electronic
trading session with a loss of 5.4 percent at 5,190.60 points _
recovering only modestly from the day's low of 5,156.24.
	   German banks are big lenders to Russia, which this week devalued
its ruble and suspended debt payments. The crisis has fueled
considerable negative sentiment in German markets.
	   The expiration of August options on German stocks also
contributed to the decline in Frankfurt.
	   In London, Europe's biggest stock market, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 3.4 percent lower at
5,477.0. In Paris, the CAC 40 index closed with a loss of 3.5
percent at 3,943.68.
	   Prices were falling sharply even before a new sell-off on the
New York Stock Exchange aggravated the situation late in the
European trading day. The Dow Jones industrial average lost about
200 points in early dealings.

Romania to receive 43 tanks from Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian army is to receive a
donation of 43 antiaircraft tanks from Germany, a Defense Ministry
official said Friday.
	   Defense Minister Victor Babiuc wrote to his German counterpart
Volker Ruehe in April 1997, asking for used equipment that could be
used in training Romania's post-communist army.
	   Last November, Ruehe replied that the Germans would donate 43
Gaped tanks, to be delivered in 1999 along with 50 free trucks for
their transportation and 50,000 shells, the defense ministry said
in a statement. No comment was immediately available from German
officials Friday.
	   ``It is and extraordinary deal,'' Lt. Col. Mohair Alexandru
Stoenescu of the Defense Ministry told the Associated Press.
	   Earlier in the week, the Romanian Finance Ministry approved dlrs
37,5 million to modernize the tanks, which were made between
1978-80. The tanks are shell-proof, have a high mobility and will
be provided with new defense equipment in Germany.
	   Romania badly wanted to join NATO, but despite its
200,000-strong army, it was deemed not ready for the first round of
invitations issued in July 1997.
	   Last month, Prime Minister Radu Vasile appealed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton to donate 50 to 60 used Cobra attack
helicopters and six to eight fighter planes, also to be used for
training.
	   No acknowledgment from the White House has been announced so
now.

	   Sudan has said it plans to file complaints with the United
Nations and the Security Council over the strikes, which the
Khartoum government says targeted a pharmaceutical factory, not a
terrorist chemical plant.
	   Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview
with The Associated Press, also called for a formal investigation
and was consulting with council members to raise the issue before
the council.
	   ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because
military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who
represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
who was ousted by the Taliban in 1996.

Pole wins gold medal in the 50K walk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, adds Backley's championship record &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Robert Korzeniowski of Poland added the
European Championship gold medal to his Olympic and world titles
when he won the men's 50-kilometer walk Friday.
	   The 30-year-old Pole was in the front group from the start and
began pulling away at 40K.
	   He finished the grueling course on a muggy morning in three
hours, 43.51 minutes to beat Valentin Kononen of Finland by a
comfortable margin of 38 seconds.
	   ``This is my third title but my first ever European medal and
now, finally, I am a complete athlete,'' Korzeniowski said.
	   Kononen, the world 1995 champion, clinched the silver at
3:44.29, while Andrey Plotnikov of Russia was more than a minute
behind at 3:45.53 for the bronze.
	   ``Korzeniowski was always going to win this race,'' said
Kononen, who was behind the Pole at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
``The silver is as much as I could expect.''
	   The walk was the first of the nine finals to be decided Friday
with Russia leading with eight medals overall through the first
three days.
	   Steve Backley of Britain, seeking his third straight European
title, set a championship record of 87.45 meters in qualifying for
the javelin final.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and world record-holder, easily
passed the first round of the men's 800-meter qualifying, although
he was only second in his heat after not pushing hard. He is
recovering from a bout of malaria in February, which set his
training back by three months.
	   Kipketer, who was born in Kenya but now holds Danish
citizenship, clocked 1:46.19, more than five seconds outside his
world record of 1:41.11.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, world record-holder Colin
Jackson of Britain, who is seeking his third consecutive title, had
the fastest time in the first qualifying round of 13.47 seconds.
Two other British runners also advanced, Tony Jarrett and Andrew
Tulloch.
	   Heike Drechsler of Germany, seeking to become only the third
athlete to win four straight titles in the same event, cleared 6.79
meters to make the final in the women's long jump.
	   Drechsler had the second longest jump after Russian Lyudmila
Galkina's 6.83.
	   Already Estonia's most popular athlete, Erki Nool became a hero
in his tiny Baltic homeland when he captured the decathlon
Thursday, Estonia's first European gold medal since 1938.
	   ``I cannot tell you how happy I am,'' said the 28-year-old
athlete.
	   Nool was lagging sixth after six events. But then he cleared
5.40 meters in the pole vault and then stunned the field with a
throw of 70.65 meters in the ninth event of the decathlon.
	   He collected a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, coming off left-knee and right
Achilles tendon surgeries, had to settle for silver after holding
the lead in the middle stages. He was more than 15 meters behind
Nool in the javelin. Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze.
	   While Estonia got a rare gold, Spain got a gold it expected in
the men's 1,500.
	   It didn't come from Fermin Cacho, but from Reyes Estevez. Cacho
started the strong Spanish showing in the distance by winning the
Olympic gold in Barcelona in 1992. He also had the silver in
Atlanta four years later and another silver at last year's worlds.
	   Cacho was the defending champion here, but he had no chance
against Estevez, the fastest in Europe this year at the distance.
	   A strong finisher, Estevez pulled away with 200 meters left in a
slow race to cruise home in 3:41.31.
	   Rui Silva of Portugal, who was slightly ahead entering the last
lap, held off Cacho to win the silver in 3:41.84. Cacho finished in
3:42.13 for the bronze.
	   Other champions Thursday: Pavel Januszewski of Poland in the
men's 400 hurdles; Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia in the women's 800;
Annarita Sidoti of Italy in the women's 20K; Vita Pavlish of
Ukraine in the women's shot put, with a heave of 21.69 meters, a
championship record and the best in the world this year; and Olga
Vasdeki of Greece in the women's triple jump.

Belarusian, Ukrainian presidents to meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
plans to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma in the
Crimea on Wednesday and Thursday, a news agency said.
	   Lukashenko told Interfax on Friday that he plans no other trips
outside Belarus, as he has ``many problems'' at home and wants to
study the effects of the Russian financial crisis on his country.
	   ``We are monitoring this very carefully and keeping the
situation under control,'' said Lukashenko. He added that his
meeting with Kuchma would be devoted to the development of
bilateral ties.

Rare cases of dengue reported in Bahamas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Six cases of dengue fever have been
confirmed in Bahamas, which has not had a significant outbreak of
the mosquito-borne disease since 1981, health officials said.
	   In addition to the six confirmed cases in New Providence, 19
other possible cases have been identified.
	   While the disease is rare in the Bahamas, the current cases are
nothing to be alarmed about, said Health Minister Dr. Ronald
Knowles.
	   ``I get concerned that persons are feeling like a great disaster
is about to happen,'' said Knowles. ``What we are doing is
recognizing the potential for a problem and trying to abort that
problem.''
	   Mosquito-control programs have been stepped up to slow the
spread of the disease and the Health Department has begun an
educational campaign, Knowles said.
	   Mercelene Dahl-Regis, chief medical officer for the Ministry of
Health, said no dengue cases had been reported in the Bahamas since
1996, and those were two individuals who caught the illness
elsewhere before arriving to the islands.
	   The disease is far more common in other islands in the Caribbean
region, with nearly 10,000 cases reported recently in Puerto Rico.

	   Council members took a more distanced reaction to the strikes,
with France's U.N. ambassador Alain Dejammet, saying his government
took note of the right of countries to protect themselves ``which
is acknowledged by international law.''
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said his country
``condemns all forms of terrorist acts,'' and said his country was
waiting for further information and details before commenting on
whether the United States was acting in self-defense.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. forces carried out the
strikes in retaliation for the bombings linked to bin Laden at U.S.
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which
killed over 250 people.
	   ``The targets struck, and the timing and method of attack used,
were carefully designed to minimize risks of collateral damage to
civilians and to comply with international law, including the rules
of necessity and proportionality,'' Richardson wrote in his letter.
	   In April, Richardson travelled to Afghanistan, where the
Saudi-born Bin Laden lives, and received a promise from Taliban
leaders to keep him ``under wraps'' and prevent him from using
Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activities.
	   ``It is the sincere hope of the United States government that
these limited actions will deter and prevent the repetition of
unlawful terrorist attacks on the United States and other
countries,'' Richardson in the letter to council president Danilo
Turk of Slovenia.
	   ``We call on all nations to take the steps necessary to bring
such indiscriminate terrorism to an end.''

Canadian mining company hit with more lawsuits over chemical spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Dozens of small lawsuits were filed
Friday against a Canadian mining company over a 1995 chemical spill
in Guyana.
	   A group of 68 persons, most of them farmers along the Essequibo
River, claimed they lost thousands of dollars after a dam holding
cyanide-tainted mining waste collapsed, allowing the chemicals to
flow down the river.
	   The new suits join some 250 other complaints filed against
Cambior Inc. of Montreal, the principle owner of the mine. In
addition to seeking damages ranging from dlrs 300 U.S. to thousands
of dollars, the suits ask the court to order Cambior to take steps
to prevent future spillage.
	   Cambior owns 60 percent of the Omai Gold mine in western Guyana,
which is operated by Golden Star Resources, based in Denver. It is
one of the largest gold mines in the hemisphere, producing more
than 330,000 ounces per year.
	   Cambior spokeswoman Seeta Mohamed said dozens of lawsuits filed
by individuals and communities downstream of the operation have
already been settled.
	   Omai accounts for more than 25 percent of the South American
country's gross domestic product and employs 1,000 people.

Austrian chancellor arrives for three-day visit

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima arrived
in this northern port city Friday for a three-day visit that will
include a trip to one of the world's only all-male monastic
retreats.
	   During his visit, Klima will holds talks with Premier Costas
Simitis and other government officials. Although talks are expected
to focus on developments inside the European Union as Austria holds
its rotating presidency, Klima is also expected to discuss the
crisis in the nearby Serb province of Kosovo.
	   Simitis is expected to bring up Greece's testy relations with
Turkey and the war-divided island of Cyprus, which is a thorny
issue in Europe's relations with member-state Greece and aspirant
Turkey.
	   The EU opened membership talks in March with Cyprus that could
see the island joining the 15-nation Union by the middle of the
next decade. Turkey was excluded from a list of potential EU
members.
	   Conflict could break out between Greece and Turkey if Greek
Cypriots go ahead with plans to deploy Russian anti-aircraft
missiles on Cyprus in November. Turkey, which keeps an estimated
35,000 troops in the occupied northern third of Cyprus, has
threatened to take military action to stop their deployment.
	   On Saturday, Klima will visit the Christian Orthodox monastic
community on the Mount Athos peninsula east of this city. He will
depart Sunday.

US postpones Security Council briefingl on Afghan, Sudan bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs; REORGANIZES and TRIMS outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States postponed a briefing
Friday morning to the Security Council on its decision to bomb
suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan amid
complaints from some member states that it had acted unilaterally
on an international problem.
	   The council met for less than an hour to discuss an unrelated
issue and broke for the morning without any discussion on the
raids. U.S. diplomatic officials said they decided a letter
Thursday from the U.S. ambassador defending Washington's air
strikes to the council would suffice for now.
	   Sudan has said it plans to file complaints with the United
Nations and the Security Council over the strikes, which the
Khartoum government says targeted a pharmaceutical factory, not a
terrorist chemical plant.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said he hadn't
received any formal request from Sudan to hold a special meeting or
investigation into the issue. But council sources said Sudan was
making a push for such a meeting in informal consultations with
council members.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday U.S. forces carried
out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over
250 people.
	   U.S. officials have linked the bombings to groups affiliated
with Osama bin Laden, who has been living in Afghanistan as a guest
of the country's Taliban rulers. Washington has said it acted to
prevent future terrorist attacks.
	   Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview
with The Associated Press, called for a formal investigation into
the strikes and was consulting with council members to raise the
issue before the council.
	   ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because
military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who
represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended Washington's air
strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied
with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N.
charter and international law.
	   Repeated threats by Bin Laden's terrorist organization left
Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   The article requires member states to report any such actions
immediately to the Security Council.
	   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, said Pakistan agreed
with the right of countries to self-defense but said the ``scourge
of terrorism'' is a fight which shouldn't be fought by individual
states.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
Kamal said. ``And that requires an international consensus and that
requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.''
	   Pakistan has condemned the United States' attack on neighboring
Afghanistan as a violation of international norms and says a stray
missile killed at least five Pakistanis.
	   Council members took a more distanced reaction to the strikes,
with France's U.N. ambassador Alain Dejammet, saying his government
took note of the right of countries to protect themselves ``which
is acknowledged by international law.''
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said his country
``condemns all forms of terrorist acts,'' and said his country was
waiting for further information and details before commenting on
whether the United States was acting in self-defense

South Africa moves toward making work forces represent country's
</HEADLINE>
racial mix &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The National Assembly passed a
bill on Friday which aims to make the work forces of large and
medium-sized companies reflect the diversity of South Africa's
population.
	   A tumultuous debate preceding the vote underscored the
sensitivity of the issue _ with fear among whites of losing
privileges enjoyed under apartheid clashing with aspirations of
blacks who, four years after the end of white rule, represent the
vast majority of the nation's jobless.
	   Under the Employment Equity Bill, companies with more than 50
employees must draw up plans on how they will make their work
forces representative of South Africa's racial and gender mix.
	   The bill, which now goes to the upper house of parliament where
it will almost certainly be passed although perhaps be slightly
amended, does not call for a quota system.
	   Instead, companies will send their plans to the Labor
Department, which will approve them or recommend changes on a
case-by-case basis. Companies that don't comply will be subject to
fines.
	   President Nelson Mandela's spokesman said the bill will ``help
eliminate decades, even centuries, of racism.''
	   ``One of the hallmarks of apartheid and white domination has
been the accumulation of wealth by the minority community based on
the exploitation of cheap black labor,'' spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said in a telephone interview. ``This legislation goes a long way
in addressing one of these historic imbalances and injustices.''
	   Members of four opposition parties with mostly white
constituencies voted against the bill in the powerful lower house
of parliament in Cape Town.
	   Pieter Groenewald, a member of the conservative Freedom Front,
branded Labor Minister Shepherd Mdladlana a racist if he supported
the measure.
	   A lawmaker from the ruling African National Congress asked
Groenewald to withdraw the word ``racist.'' After he refused,
Groenewald was ejected from the chamber as ANC members applauded.
	   Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen then walked out with his
fellow party members.
	   The leader of the National Party, which ruled during apartheid,
charged that the bill represents reverse discrimination.
	   ``The bill itself makes provision for preferential treatment,''
Marthinus van Schalkwyk said in remarks carried by the media. ``Our
society is moving from the equal opportunity approach to one of
preferential treatment based on skin color.''
	   ANC lawmaker Godfrey Oliphant tried to soothe worries that the
bill would be used as a weapon against Afrikaners _ the descendants
of Dutch settlers _ and other whites.
	   ``I want to stress ... that no white Afrikaner will be excluded
by the bill,'' Oliphant said.
	   Non-whites have gained a political voice since white rule ended,
but their share of the economic pie remains thin.
	   Whites account for 15 percent of the population. Blacks account
for about 80 percent. Yet of South Africa's unemployed, 87 percent
are black and only 3 percent are white.
	   About 92 percent of executive or senior managers are white,
according to the Breakwater Monitor, a private survey group.

Croatian TV receives ultimatum on political coverage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ By midnight Sunday,
Croatia's state-run television must start providing fair coverage
and equal access for all political parties competing in elections
in neighboring Bosnia, international officials said Friday.
	   If HRT doesn't comply, candidates from the Bosnian branch of the
Croatian Democratic Union, led by Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman, could be struck from the ballot.
	   HRT management has repeatedly been warned by Western officials
about its biased approach to reporting about Bosnia, and the issue
has been raised with Tudjman.
	   Thursday, members of a media experts commission established by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe decided to
set a deadline for the station. The OSCE is in charge of Bosnian
elections.
	   Also, by midnight Wednesday the TV station must hold a lottery
to determine the placement of political party coverage throughout
the broadcast day.
	   In a letter to the OSCE, Obrad Kosovac, HRT's editor in chief,
said the station would comply with the organization's instructions.
He pledged HRT would cover the activities of all political parties
in a ``correct, impartial and balanced way, as it ... has done so
far.''
	   Croatian media do not come directly under OSCE control. But
because the station uses frequencies and transmitters in Bosnia, it
must conform to broadcast rules designed by the international
community, which is overseeing the reconstruction of Bosnia.
	   Those rules require that all candidates and political parties
have equal access and air time.
	   But OSCE monitoring reports ``demonstrated grossly
disproportionate coverage'' of the Bosnian branch of the Croatian
Democratic Union and its leader Ante Jelavic, an OSCE letter to
Croatian TV Director General Ivica Vrkic said.
	   This creates disadvantages for candidates from other political
parties in the Sept. 12 and 13 Bosnian elections and violates OSCE
rules, the letter said.
	   Vrkic was out of town Friday and could not be reached for
comment. Croatian Democratic Union officials also were unavailable.
	   If the station does not comply, the case will be turned over to
an OSCE subcommission.
	   In a worst-case scenario, candidates from the Bosnian branch of
the Croatian Democratic Union could be bumped from the ballot. The
Bosnian company EROTEL, which rebroadcasts HRT programming in
Bosnia, is controlled by that party.
	   While licensed foreign TV stations can broadcast in Bosnia, a
program that ``reinforces national division rather then
reconciliation is essentially not a good thing,'' said Simon
Haselock, the spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's top
international official.
	   Another media watchdog, the Independent Media Commission, is
examining the legality of Croatian TV broadcasts in Bosnia.
	   ``We have considerable reservations about the legal basis for
it,'' Haselock said. EROTEL has a license from the Croat-controlled
part of Bosnia, but has not been licensed by the federal
government.

Bomb-hit Nairobi divided on U.S. raids

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Still mourning more than 230 compatriots
slain in the bombing of the American Embassy, Kenyans on Friday
expressed mixed feelings about U.S. missile raids on Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``As a Kenyan, I think what the Americans did was a good
thing,'' said Ernest Kariuki, a 26-year-old insurance salesman. But
he said he worried about the loss of innocent lives in Thursday's
raids, which the Clinton administration said targeted sites
believed to be linked to terrorist activity.
	   Kariuki, perusing newspaper headlines about the raids at a
sidewalk newsstand only a few blocks from the bomb-shattered
embassy, said Americans and Arabs should ``come to a dialogue''
about their differences.
	   Officially, Kenya was silent on the strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan. President Daniel arap Moi was out of the capital when
the American raids occurred and issued no statement on them.
	   In Tanzania, where 10 died in the almost simultaneous Aug. 7
bombing at the U.S. embassy there, officials also refused to
comment on the American raids.
	   The Sudanese Embassy in Nairobi said in a statement that Kenyan
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana had once toured the El Shifa
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, which was hit in the U.S. air
strike.
	   The United States described the facility was a suspected
chemical weapons factory.
	   American officials in Kenya said they hadn't been given advance
word on the raids.
	   ``We learned of it the way everyone else did, with the
president's announcement,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris
Scharf. FBI director Louis Freeh, in East Africa to oversee the
investigations into the bombings, abruptly cut short his visit
Thursday to return to Washington for consultations.
	   On Friday, two weeks after the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, Kenyans were still grappling with the
violence that shook their capital.
	   Near the site of the embassy blast, ordinary Kenyans were being
urged to leave handwritten notes describing their feelings about
the attack.
	   Some were bitter about the fact that the overwhelming majority
of victims were Kenyans, even though the bomb was aimed at
Americans.
	   ``If enemies will be fighting on their friends' ground, I would
rather stay alone without any of the two enemies instead of these
effects on the innocent,'' wrote one Kenyan, O.K. Chege.
	   But others said Americans were also innocent victims, and
cheered the U.S. missile strikes.
	   ``We needed a response from the U.S.,'' said Moses Mungai, 22.
``There was no way we should be attacked and do nothing. So it's a
good move. This is a way of stopping them (the bombers).''
	   George Orido, 25, said he was ``delighted'' when he heard about
the strikes. ``Let them do more,'' he urged.
	   But Hakim Yarrow, a 21-year-old Muslim, said he resented the
American attitude toward Islam and condemned the air strikes
Thursday as indiscriminate killings.
	   ``I feel bad about it, because so many innocent people died,''
Yarrow said. ``Not all Muslims are bad. Not all Muslims are
terrorists ... If they would just leave us alone, there would be no
fighting and no killing.''

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The threat of a full-scale war loomed
Friday in sub-Saharan Africa, with countries from the eastern Great
Lakes region lining up against several of embattled Congo's
southern neighbors.
	   Zimbabwe began deploying troops in support of President Laurent
Kabila, while Rwanda in the east called for a cease-fire, but
warned it would intervene unless the Zimbabweans withdrew.
	   Angolan soldiers have also begun arriving in Kinshasa to help
Kabila, Mozambican radio reported.
	   Spanning from central to eastern and southern Africa, vast and
troubled Congo appears to be threatening the stability of an
already troubled region.
	   Kinshasa, struggling through power cuts and dwindling food
stocks, was on a war footing, with hundreds of protesters
converging on the French Embassy and state radio blasting Rwanda
and the West for meddling in Congo's internal affairs.
	   ``We have our allies who believe we must change the mentality of
Rwanda,'' Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi said in a telephone
interview. ``If Rwanda does not withdraw we risk a war of a hundred
years.''
	   Kabila says Rwanda and Uganda are behind a rebel movement that
began earlier this month and threatens to march all the way to the
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Earlier this week, Information Minister Didier Mumengi said
Uganda had sent a column of troops across its border into Congo.
Mumengi previously accused Uganda of sending tanks and troops into
Congo.
	   Both countries deny the charges, but Rwanda warned it would
intervene to protect its borders if other nations send troops to
prop up Kabila.
	   Rebels in Congo's west have marched to the strategic town of
Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Those same forces, with important help from Rwanda and Uganda,
last year helped Kabila oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko. They have since grown disenchanted with the new government,
while Rwanda has become increasingly concerned that Kabila has done
little to secure the turbulent eastern border region.
	   ``Rwanda reserves the right to get involved and to assist the
Congolese people in their search for lasting solution in whatever
manner it deems appropriate,'' said a statement released in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   South Africa hastily called for weekend peace talks to ward off
an expanded conflict that could pit troops from several countries
battling for and against Kabila.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela plans to host the talks
between the presidents of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``It's in that context
that we view the weekend discussions in a very, very serious
light.''
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principle to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the South African capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to comment on whether the rebels themselves were
invited.
	   An offer earlier this week by the rebels to negotiate a
cease-fire with Kabila was dismissed by the government, which says
it will only talk directly with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The new peace effort came as military technicians and advisers
from Zimbabwe started to arrive in Congo's capital.
	   Rwanda's ambassador to South Africa, Ben Karenzi, earlier said
his country was ready for full-out war with Congo if the
Zimbabweans troops don't withdraw.
	   Angola also appeared to be preparing to provide troop and air
support to Kabila, a western diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Although embroiled in its own domestic problems, Angola may
enter the conflict on Kabila's behalf as a preemptive move to stop
UNITA rebels from linking up with the Congolese rebels _ an army of
ethnic Tutsis, Rwanda soldiers and members of Kabila's military.
	   About 600 people, many waving banners, blowing whistles and
carrying sticks, protested Friday in front of the French Embassy in
Kinshasa, accusing France and the United States of trying to
destabilize Congo and of supporting Rwanda.

On Arab streets, Clinton-Lewinsky affair seen behind attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes, CHANGES overline and byline. &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Bombings, Sudan-US &QL; 
 &UR; By G.G. LaBELLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Bill Clinton's need to escape scandal than
by a battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle
East was predictable, and American allies mostly remained silent.
The Cairo-based Arab League condemned the attack in Sudan, calling
it ``an unjustified and flagrant aggression on ... an Arab
country.''
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip
operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli,
thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.''
	   The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab
Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of
terrorist sponsoring states.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run
radio.
	   In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme
was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain,
25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American
missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's
wrongdoings.''
	   But asked if he sympathized with bin Laden, he said ``he's no
better.''
	   Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand,
was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United
States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
	   More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper
from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.
	   ``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never
be clean,'' he said. ``Clinton and the U.S have for years been
killing indiscriminately, so this is not new. But it certainly
won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.''

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi met
Friday with Prime Minister Fernando Franca van Dunem for talks on
the fighting in Congo, saying he was seeking to build a regional
consensus on the revolt against President Laurent Kabila.
	   Angola and Uganda ``share the same concerns as the rest of the
region and we want stability to return to the Congo, Mbabazi told
reporters, adding that the region must reach agreement on the
situation in the neighboring country.
	   Mbabazi said he would travel later Friday to Namibia and then to
South Africa for similar talks.
	   He said he had given Van Dunem a written message from Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni for his Angolan counterpart, Jose Eduardo
dos Santos. He declined to reveal the content of the message.
	   He denied that Uganda had sent troops to support the rebels
fighting Kabila.
	   Kabila claims that Uganda and neighboring Rwanda are behind the
rebellion by a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and disenchanted members
of Congolese Army who are advancing on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Kabila flew to Luanda last Sunday for a brief visit to enlist
support for his government.
	   Angola last year provided troops to help Kabila oust President
Mobutu and said earlier this week that it still backed Kabila's
administration. However, officials have declined to comment on
reports that Angolan troops have crossed the country's northern
border into Congo.

African anger over meddling in Congo raises specter of larger war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Rwandan threat of war, South
African peace talks. Edits throughout to conform. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Last time around, most African
leaders simply winked and called the fight against Zaire's dictator
an internal rebellion _ despite widespread knowledge that Rwanda
and Uganda were supporting the rebels.
	   Mobutu Sese Seko, after all, was an embarrassing Cold War
anachronism, a man whose corrupt rule had turned Africa's
third-largest country into an economic and political wasteland. If
the rebels needed help to get rid of him _ including soldiers,
armament, air support and strategic guidance _ accepting such
outside meddling was the price that had to be paid.
	   But now, rebel leader Laurent Kabila is president of the country
he renamed Congo, and he faces a rebellion by soldiers apparently
supported by his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda.
	   This time around there is no winking. And the rebellion against
Kabila, which he paints as an invasion by his former allies, is
threatening to flare into something bigger.
	   Shifting alliances, security problems along volatile borders,
greed for mineral resources and a complex web of rebel movements
are fueling fears of a wider war across central Africa.
	   On Friday, Rwanda warned that it was ready for an all-out war
with Congo if Zimbabwean troops, which recently arrived in Kinshasa
to support Kabila, didn't leave. Later, Rwanda called for a
cease-fire but warned that it could still intervene to protect its
borders.
	   In South Africa, Nelson Mandela planned weekend peace talks to
try to hold off a regional war. His spokesman said the meeting
would include the heads of state of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda.
Zimbabwe's president was invited but it was not clear if he would
attend.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement in the Congolese fighting,
but diplomats and witnesses say there is little doubt that they
have provided military guidance, men and supplies to the rebels, a
coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers and
disaffected members of Kabila's military.
	   In response, Kabila _ a clumsy diplomat who has made few close
allies during his 15 months in power _ has been offered support
from a number of African countries.
	   Angola has thrown its support behind Kabila, as have some
southern African nations who say Rwanda and Uganda's meddling must
be stopped.
	   Non-interference has traditionally been a major precept of
African diplomacy. In addition, Kabila has been quick to play on
long-held fears that the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government may be
trying to create a sort of trans-African Tutsi state, even though
Tutsis make up a small percentage of the few countries where they
live.
	   The Organization of African Unity has said that it backs Kabila,
and ``condemned all external intervention in the internal affairs''
of Congo. The group urged the rebels to lay down their weapons.
	   The rebels' surprise announcement Wednesday that they were ready
to negotiate with Kabila has done little to calm the situation as
the rebels reportedly continued their advance on Kinshasa, the
Congolese capital.
	   But despite the widespread anger at Rwanda and Uganda, the
outside involvement in the Congolese rebellion has as much to do
with other African rebellions and regional power politics as it
does with issues inside Congo.
	   Uganda and Rwanda, for instance, helped install Kabila in part
to bring stability to eastern Congo, where rebels opposed to the
Rwandan and Ugandan governments are based. Kabila, however, proved
unable to stem the cross-border attacks from his country and
eventually lost the support of his former allies.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in Rwanda in attacks by
Hutu rebels since Hutu former soldiers and militiamen, responsible
for the 1994 genocide of at least 500,000 people in Rwanda, fled
the country ahead of Tutsi-led forces who stopped the killing.
	   Angola, for its part, is facing a resurgence of its own
rebellion, and reportedly backs Kabila because it fears a possible
marriage of Congolese rebels to its UNITA rebel movement.
	   As for Zimbabwe, political analysts speculate that the basis for
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's support may be personal _ and
directed at Mandela.
	   Mugabe has long seen himself as Africa's elder statesman and is
believed to be furiously jealous of Mandela's fame. With his
political future in doubt at home, and with South Africa pushing
for a diplomatic solution in Congo, Mugabe could simply be using
the crisis to raise his own profile.
	   The question is, however, whether that involvement will stem the
tide of war _ or spur it to greater bloodshed.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged at the London Stock Exchange on
Friday, with traders caught up in a flurry of fears about the
global economy that rattled markets from Hong Kong to New York.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
dropped 190.4 points, or 3.4 percent, to 5,477.0.
	   Investors worried about the economic crises in Russia and Asia,
and drops on other big markets _ including Friday's early plunge on
Wall Street _ aggravated their concerns.
	   Volume came to 720.6 million shares, compared with 702.4 million

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI Director Louis Freeh said Friday he
had made ``no final conclusions'' about who bombed two U.S.
embassies in East Africa, a day after the U.S. military struck
alleged terrorist bases in retaliation.
	   Freeh abruptly curtailed his visit to Kenya following the
attacks Thursday on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to
anti-American Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden.
	   U.S. embassies in the capitals of both countries were the
targets Aug. 7 of car-bombings in which 257 people died, all but 10
of them in Kenya.
	   The White House said the U.S. raids were linked to the Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam embassy bombings.
	   Freeh, speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport before
flying back to Washington, declined to say whether evidence
developed during U.S. inquiries at the bomb scenes led to the
missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether he had evidence connecting bin
Laden to the embassy attacks. The twin bombings could have involved
``many, many people in different places at different times,'' Freeh
said.
	   The director said, however, that the two bombings were probably
linked. ``We're beginning on a preliminary basis to see forensic
similarities at the crime scene both here and in Dar es Salaam,''
he said, refusing to elaborate.
	   Freeh refused to comment on whether he knew in advance of the
U.S. action, but an FBI source said he did not.
	   While he was pleased with the progress of the inquiries in
Tanzania and Kenya, he still was far from producing sufficient
evidence to sustain criminal charges in court.
	   ``We have made no final conclusions,'' Freeh said. ``We are at a
fairly preliminary stage, the investigation is only two weeks
old.''
	   He refused to comment on how many suspects were in custody.
	   On Thursday, the United States launched Tomahawk cruise missiles
at a suspected chemical weapons plant in Khartoum, Sudan, and at a
terrorist training complex in eastern Afghanistan near the
Pakistani border.
	   Clinton said he ordered the attacks not only in retaliation for
the embassy bombings, but also to preempt more planned terrorist
attacks on Americans.
	   Meanwhile, the FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices
of a Saudi Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief Agency,
in connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers
and cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after the raid Thursday, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary.
	   The Sudanese director, Mohammed Abdullah, has been missing for
three weeks, Ahmed said.
	   A Sudanese, along with a Saudi, was arrested at the Afghan
border on Saturday. Both were still being questioned, and have not
been named. According to local media reports here, one suspect,
named by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had
said one of his accomplices was named ``Abdullah.''
	   Five FBI agents wearing gloves and two Kenyan police officials
searched a house in a slum of Malindi, on the Indian Ocean Coast,
for three hours Friday. Hassan Omar Hassan, the homeowner and a
Labor Ministry driver, was taken into custody, witnesses said.
	   The FBI and police refused to comment on either raid.
	   Freeh canceled plans to lay a wreath amid the rubble of the
bombed-out U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, but walked though the wreckage
with investigators. Kenyan police barred journalists from the site
while Freeh was there.
	   Freeh toured the destroyed embassy in Tanzania on Thursday.

Peru's Fujimori names new prime minister, defense chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori named a new prime
minister and defense minister Friday as part of a shakeup of Peru's
political and military leaders that has also toppled its top
general.
	   In a ceremony in the presidential palace, Fujimori swore in
Alberto Pandolfi as the new prime minister and intelligence chief
Gen. Julio Salazar Monroe as the new defense minister. Pandolfi had
been prime minister for two years before resigning in June.
	   Fujimori said the remaining 15 members of his Cabinet would
stay.
	   In a surprise move Thursday, Fujimori fired powerful armed
forces chief Gen. Nicolas Hermoza and replaced him with Defense
Minister Gen. Cesar Saucedo, clearing the way for Salazar's
appointment.
	   Saucedo and Salazar are allies of de facto intelligence chief
Vladimiro Montesinos, considered the second most powerful man in
Peru after Fujimori, analysts said.
	   Salazar was the formal head of Peru's feared National
Intelligence Service, but answered to Montesinos.
	   Peru had been ruled for the past seven years by the trio of
Fujimori, Montesinos and Hermoza, but Fujimori had tried to oust
Hermoza and exert his authority over the powerful armed forces,
analysts said.
	   ``The new men are all closely tied to Fujimori and Montesinos,''
said political analyst Fernando Rospigliosi.
	   Former Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra had resigned two
weeks ago, charging that factions in Fujimori's government were too
authoritarian.

Norwegian ace may move after United, Spurs agree transfer terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be a
Tottenham player by Monday after Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson had an apparent change of heart Friday and accepted Spurs'
bid of 5.5 million (dlrs 9 million).
	   Ferguson said earlier in the day he wasn't interested in selling
any of his players even after the arrival of Tobagan striker Dwight
Yorke from Aston Villa for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20 million).
	   But Spurs spokesman John Fennelly said that United had accepted
a bid made by Tottenham owner Alan Sugar.
	   ``United have accepted our bid for Solskjaer and all that
remains is for us to agree terms with the player,'' Fennelly said.
``We are hoping to meet with him in the next couple of days to sort
that out.''
	   Sugar and Spurs manager Christian Gross have not been active in
the transfer market during the summer despite a poor season in
which the club went perilously close to relegation from the Premier
League.
	   Angry Spurs fans, envious of the fact that its north London
rival won both the league title and FA Cup last season, are
planning protests against both Sugar and Gross.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Still mourning more than 230 compatriots
slain in the bombing of the American Embassy, Kenyans expressed
mixed feelings Friday about U.S. missile raids on Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``As a Kenyan, I think what the Americans did was a good
thing,'' said Ernest Kariuki, a 26-year-old insurance salesman. But
he said he worried about the loss of innocent lives in Thursday's
raids, which the Clinton administration said targeted sites
believed to be linked to terrorist activity.
	   Kariuki, perusing headlines about the raids at a sidewalk
newsstand only a few blocks from the bomb-shattered embassy, said
Americans and Arabs should ``come to a dialogue'' about their
differences.
	   Officially, Kenya was silent on the strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan. President Daniel arap Moi was out of the capital at
the time and issued no statement on them.
	   In Tanzania, where 10 died in the almost simultaneous Aug. 7
bombing at the U.S. embassy, officials also refused to comment.

Man Utd, Liverpool fans oppose Super League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with media company sending plans to UEFA &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fans of Manchester United and Liverpool say
they're not supporting the idea of a European Super League.
	   Convinced that the clubs are only interested in forming the
league to gain revenue from TV and sponsors, the fans are annoyed
they're not being consulted and say they don't like the concept
anyway.
	   ``No-one has asked the fans what they think,'' said Andy Walsh,
chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters'
Association
	   ``The match-going fan is the biggest single sponsor of football
and unless our interests are paramount, the game itself will suffer
irreparable damage.''
	   Speculation has abounded in recent weeks that a Super League
could be formed around 2001 with the biggest names in European
soccer, such as Inter and AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and
Barcelona, also involved. Such a league would take the glamor away
from UEFA's three long-standing competitions, the Champions, Cup
Winners and UEFA Cups.
	   Media Partners, a media company behind the move to set up a
league, announced Friday it had presented its proposal to UEFA,
which has threatened to suspend teams and players who take part.
	   ``UEFA has agreed to review the EFL plans in consultation with
national associations,'' the company said in a statement.
	   Officials of United, Liverpool and Arsenal are due to have
discussions this weekend about the possibility of joining up.
	   ``The proposals for the European Super League as we know them
are driven by the TV companies and the pursuit of cash,'' Walsh
said.
	   Liverpool fanzine editor Steve Kelly said supporters would soon
lose interest in the league if there were to be no promotion and
relegation.
	   ``The current proposals have nothing to do with the needs of
football or its fans, but are all about money and the business
interests of media moguls,'' he said.
	   ``Domestic football and the domestic title are still the most
important thing to fans and anything that devalues the existing
league structure should be opposed.
	   ``Fans must be consulted fully and openly before any club
negotiates its entry into a proposed Super League.''

	   JOHANNESBURG (AP) _ The National Union of Metalworkers of South
Africa announced Friday that more than 220,000 members will go on
strike Sept. 1 for higher pay.
	   The strike is targeted directly at the motor industry and is
designed to affect automakers, component manufacturers and
retailers.
	   The union wants pay rises of 12 percent to 18 percent for
workers to close what union leaders call ``the apartheid wage
gap.''
	   The South African Motor Industry Employers Association has
responded with an offer of a 4.5 percent increase for those on
minimum wages.
	   Having explored ``all legal procedures'' to have wage
inequalities addressed by motor manufacturers, the union said it is
braced for ``a major battle with the employers,'' beginning with
the strike in September.
	   In addition to across-the-board pay increases, NUMSA wants wage
negotiations to be conducted on an industry-wide basis, instead of
the existing plant-level approach.
	   Seven of the world's major automakers or their affiliates have
assembly and manufacturing facilities in South Africa:
Daimler-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Ford and General
Motors Corp.
	   ------
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ties between Ghana and Togo, West African
neighbors with a history of enmity, have strengthened in the wake
of an alleged attack Sunday on Togo's capital by insurgents from
Ghana, Ghana's foreign minister said.
	   Koffi Panou said Thursday that Togo President Gnassigbe Eyadema
was pleased by Ghana President Jerry Rawlings' swift military
reaction to the alleged shooting on Sunday in the border area
between the two countries.
	   Opposition newspapers have accused Togo's government of hatching
the alleged weekend attack as a ruse to crack down on opposition
leaders.
	   Rawlings deployed Ghanaian helicopters as Togolese government
troops battled the alleged insurgents. Small and heavy weapons fire
could be heard in Togo's capital of Lome.
	   Togo's strongest opposition leader, Gilchrist Olympio, lives in
exile in Ghana. The two countries have long had cool relations,
partly as a result of Olympio's presence in Ghana and also because
of attempts by ethnic Ewe activists to form a homeland encompassing
parts of both countries.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The wife of a foreign ministry
official jailed in neighboring Mozambique for alleged gun-running
has placed an ad in the press appealing for financial assistance
for her husband's legal costs.
	   Paula McBride, Robert McBride's wife, said his legal costs so
far exceeded dlrs 50,000.
	   ``It is very difficult for me to appeal to the public for
funds,'' she said. ``It is for people to decide whether they want
to contribute.''
	   She said the South African government would not bear the
expenses because McBride was on leave at the time of his arrest.
	   McBride has been in Machava prison in Mozambique for six months
on gun-running and espionage charges.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A six member International Monetary Fund
delegation has concluded a two-week study of Zimbabwe's progress in
implementing reforms without giving a firm verdict on whether the
next dlrs 20 million of budget support will be forthcoming.
	   A decision will be reached in Washington during the IMF's annual
meetings in October, said a statement released Friday as the
delegation, led by head of IMF Africa desk Michael Nowak, left for
home.
	   A statement said they found President Robert Mugabe's Government
had met all the ``program targets for fiscal, monetary, and foreign
exchange policies
	   for end - June 1998'' and the budget deficit was 1.5 percent
below the 1998 target of 5.5 percent of gross domestic product.
	   However, food price controls had been reimposed and state
enterprises were being sold off to the public more slowly than
expected ``because of technical difficulties,'' said the IMF
delegation. It has been strongly criticized by economists here for
ignoring outstanding state debts not ``factored in'' to their
financial calculations, including dlrs 200 million losses by the
state oil monopoly and the bailout for a failed banking empire.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Malawian troops went on a rampage,
injuring at least 30 people in the capital Lilongwe as police
looked on, according to witnesses and officials.
	   The soldiers, who according to the newspaper The Nation wanted
to avenge the death of a colleague, beat up street vendors and
minibus workers on Wednesday. A soldiers, Mike Moyo, had been
stabbed to death by pickpockets as he was boarding a minibus
earlier in the week, The Nation reported.
	   Police spokesman Oliver Soko said police did not attempt to
intervene in Wednesday's rampage ``for fear of provoking a
confrontation with the army.''
	   ------
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Presdient Sam Nujoma is suing newspaper
editor Hannes Smith for writing editorials accusing Nujoma of
corruption, nepotism and other evils, local media reported Friday.
	   Nujoma is seeking R1.2 million (dlrs 192,000) from the editor
and owner of the Windhoek Observer.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Ugandan Minister of Regional Cooperation
Amama Mbabazi met Friday with Prime Minister Fernando Franca van
Dunem for talks on the fighting in Congo, saying he was seeking to
build a regional consensus on the revolt against President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Angola and Uganda ``share the same concerns as the rest of the
region and we want stability to return to the Congo, Mbabazi told
reporters, adding that the region must reach agreement on the
situation in the neighboring country.
	   Mbabazi said he would travel later Friday to Namibia and then to
South Africa for similar talks.
	   He said he had given Van Dunem a written message from Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni for his Angolan counterpart, Jose Eduardo
dos Santos. He declined to reveal the content of the message.
	   He denied that Uganda had sent troops to support the rebels
fighting Kabila.
	   Kabila claims that Uganda and neighboring Rwanda are behind the
rebellion by a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and disenchanted members
of Congolese Army who are advancing on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Kabila flew to Luanda last Sunday for a brief visit to enlist
support for his government.
	   Angola last year provided troops to help Kabila oust President
Mobutu and said earlier this week that it still backed Kabila's
administration. However, officials have declined to comment on
reports that Angolan troops have crossed the country's northern
border into Congo.

	   ``Irrespective of the motives of these strikes, the act of
violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these
Islamic countries cannot but be a matter of grave concern to the
people of Pakistan who justifiably feel outraged,'' Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Pakistani senate earlier.
	   Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and
chanted angry slogans Friday across Pakistan.
	   Many of the protests were called by conservative Islamic parties
who have condemned the U.S. military attacks on bases linked to
Osama Bin Laden. Clinton said investigators had determined bin
Laden was behind Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa that
killed 257 people.
	   The United Nations closed its offices and directed its American
and other foreign staff to stay in their homes for their own
safety.
	   The U.S. State Department had recalled all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families Monday and warned other
Americans to leave the country. Many Americans who had stayed are
now flying out, some catching flights early Friday morning.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said Americans had been
issued no additional warnings since the strikes on Afghanistan,
adding ``we're still operating under the previous advisory that
Americans should consider leaving.''
	   Hoagland said he had no numbers on how many of the estimated
6,700 Americans living in Pakistan have left.
	   On Friday, Police rolled out barbed wire outside the American
cultural center, where Hoagland has his office. Dozens of Pakistani
police and a few paramilitary troops stood guard, some on the roof
of the center. Across town, more police officers stood guard at the
U.S. Embassy.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM _ A well-known rabbi, stabbed to death by a
Palestinian assailant in the tensely divided West Bank city of
Hebron, was laid to rest Friday as dozens of Jewish settlers called
for revenge.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the slaying
strengthened his resolve not to sign a deal on a West Bank troop
pullback unless the Palestinians do more to curb terrorism.
	   An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that Israel committed to
the Palestinians, for the first time in writing, to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank, with some conditions.
	   Netanyahu would not confirm the report but hinted that gaps on
the scope of a withdrawal were narrowing. The remaining
differences, he said, were regarding Palestinian security
obligations.
	   ``The gap is the Palestinian failure so far to give us the
assurances that they will concretely fight terrorism, fight it in
practical terms ... but also fight it in moral terms.''
	   ``We expect this dual Palestinian battle against terrorism ...
to be part of the agreement and that is what is holding up the
agreement so far,'' Netanyahu told reporters at a news conference
he called at his residence.
	   In Hebron, hundreds of Jewish settlers marched under the late
afternoon heat in the funeral procession of 63-year-old Rabbi
Shlomo Raanan, who was stabbed to death late Thursday by a
Palestinian intruder.
	   Raanan was killed in the bedroom of his trailer home in Hebron's
heavily fortified Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, one of several in
the center of the city. The assailant then torched the home with a
firebomb before fleeing. The rabbi's wife suffered smoke
inhalation.
	   During a mourning ceremony earlier Friday, the rabbi's body,
wrapped in a prayer shawl and placed on a stretcher, was laid under
an oak tree in the tiny playground of Tel Romeida. Hundreds of
mourners squeezed into the yard to listen to eulogies, weep and say
prayers. Later, dozens shouted ``revenge,'' and heckled a
government minister who came to pay respects.
	   Israeli troops enforced a curfew on 30,000 Palestinians still
living there under Israeli rule, barring them from leaving their
homes while settlers carried Raanan's body through the deserted
city streets.
	   Raanan belonged to a dynasty of spiritual leaders of the Jewish
settlement movement, and there was concern that his brutal killing
could trigger revenge attacks.
	   Near the West Bank settlement of Itzhar, a Palestinian man
claimed that Jewish settlers nabbed him and beat him in revenge for
the killing of two Itzhar settlers earlier this month. Police said
they were checking the report.
	   Netanyahu contacted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with the
demand that Palestinian security forces arrest the assailant of
Thursday's killing who is believed to have fled to the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled for 17 months, with the sides now haggling over the scope
of a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank land. The
Palestinians accepted an American plan calling for Israel to
hand-over 13 percent of the territory, but Netanyahu initially
balked, saying the withdrawal would be harmful to Israel's
security.
	   In recennt weeks, Israel floated a compromise under which it
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, but 3 percent of
that area would be declared a nature reserve and the Palestinians
would have virtually no say over land use, including construction.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Friday that Israel has now
submitted the plan to the Palestinians in writing and that the
compromise was accepted by the Palestinians, a claim staunchly
denied by Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   ``The redeployments must be in accordance with the agreements
and not creating new categories of land,'' Asfour said Friday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Posh Spice Victoria Adams, fiance of Manchester
United and England soccer star David Beckham, reportedly is three
months pregnant and the news already has bookmakers taking odds on
the future exploits of their offspring.
	   Bookmakers Williams Hill is offering odds of 1,000-1 that the
child, assuming it is a boy, will play soccer for England and
10,000-1 that he will emulate his father and be sent off playing
against Argentina.
	   Beckham was shown the red card during the World Cup and was
blamed for England's elimination. The team was forced to play a man
short for 70 minutes against Argentina before losing on penalties
after a 2-2 tie.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan condemned America's attack
on neighboring Afghanistan on Friday, but the government retracted
an earlier statement that a stray missile had struck its territory
and killed at least five people.
	   The retraction followed a telephone call from President Bill
Clinton to the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said earlier
Friday that five or six people were killed by a stray American
missile.
	   But hours later, a Foreign Ministry statement said Altaf's
comments were based on ``inaccurate information.''
	   ``No casualty has occurred inside Pakistani territory as
believed earlier,'' the statement said. ``No damage either has been
caused on the Pakistan side.''
	   Before Altaf's announcement, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told
the Pakistani senate: ``Irrespective of the motives of these
strikes, the act of violation of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of these Islamic countries cannot but be a matter of
grave concern to the people of Pakistan who justifiably feel
outraged,''
	   Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and

Four new landslides batter buried Himalayan village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Boulders and sludge roared down a hill in
the northern Himalayas on Friday, burying the remains of a remote
village where 202 people were already feared dead in an earlier
landslide.
	   Monsoon rain stopped briefly Friday for the first time in weeks,
raising hopes for rescue efforts in Malpa, but four new landslides
buried the mountain village under 35 feet (10 meters) of rocks and
mud.
	   Army rescuers plowing through debris to look for bodies had to
rush to safer positions on a nearby hill. Before the new
landslides, rescuers had found eight more bodies.
	   In a week of devastation, more than a dozen major landslides
have hit the lower Himalayas. In all, 32 bodies have been found
since Tuesday.
	   Rescuers have found 18 survivors in Malpa, said Ashok Kumar, the
relief commissioner for the state of Uttar Pradesh.
	   Five helicopters a few miles from Malpa have not been able to
reach the village to ferry back the dead. Authorities plan to
airlift the injured to Bareilly, the nearest big city, once the
weather clears.
	   ``Hopes of recovering more bodies have receded after the new
landslides,'' said the senior official in Malpa, R.L. Yadav.
	   In the morning, the break in monsoon storms allowed nearly 200
rescue workers to intensify their search for victims in the sludge
and along the banks of the Kali River.
	   The landslide occurred when the river broke its weak embankment
and changed course, submerging the village and sweeping away a
Hindu pilgrims' campsite.
	   Authorities have evacuated more than 30,000 people to higher
ground from 30 towns and villages facing a flood threat after a
blockage in the Mandakini River about 185 miles (300 kilometers)
east of New Delhi.
	   After two days of indecision, Army and civil engineers decided
not to dynamite the blockage caused by falling boulders and
mudslides. Removing the blockage would have made the water level
shoot up by as much as 26 feet (8 meters) downstream, perhaps
engulfing towns as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, Yadav
said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's chief banker said Friday that the
recent drop in the country's currency was a response to Russia's
ruble crisis and other international financial turmoil and he saw
no reason for a major devaluation.
	   ``We have no economic, political and financial conditions that
could cause a deep devaluation of the hryvna,'' said National Bank
chairman Viktor Yushchenko.
	   The hryvna slipped from 2.143 to the U.S. dollar last week to
2.243 on Friday after a devaluation of the Russian ruble earlier in
the week.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main trading partner and Ukrainian officials
fear its economic problems will spill over the border. They also
fear more foreign investors would withdraw from Ukraine's battered
financial market, putting further pressure on the hryvna.
	   Yushchenko also cited the lack of new foreign credits for the
former Soviet republic and some ``purely psychological factors''
for the hryvna's fall, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year, and Yushchenko's
bank has brought its reserves down from dlrs 2.34 billion in early
1998 to dlrs 1.15 billion this month in attempts to support the
hryvna.
	   The government has established a currency fluctuation band of
1.8 to 2.5 to the dollar for 1998.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Friday that the
government's adherence to the hryvna fluctuation band would
``depend on the processes taking place in Russia.''
	   He voiced hope that Ukraine would not face a financial crisis
similar to that in Russia, but noted that the government must
carefully ``follow every step by Russia.''
	   In particular, it must not allow an increase in Russian imports
and at the same time should stimulate Ukrainian exports to Russia,
which would be ``one of the key issues in adhering to the currency
corridor,'' Pustovoitenko said.
	   In 1997, Russia accounted for 32 percent of Ukraine's total
exports, but exports to Russia have been decreasing this year.
	   Pustovoitenko also called for an informal meeting of prime
ministers from the former Soviet republics to determine their
stance in the wake of the Russian crisis. He said his counterparts
from Moldova and Belarus already have supported the idea.
	   ``We cannot all fall down together with Russia. We would not
want that,'' he said.

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former President P.W. Botha, given a
day in court his government denied thousands of opponents, was
convicted Friday of ignoring a subpoena to testify about apartheid
atrocities.
	   A black magistrate gave apartheid's last hardline president a
one-year suspended jail sentence and ordered him to pay a fine of
10,000 rands (dlrs 1,577) for ignoring the summons from South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
	   Magistrate Victor Lugaju could have sentenced the 82-year-old
Botha to two years in prison, but said he took into account Botha's
age and frail health.
	   Lugaju criticized Botha for his refusal to cooperate with the
commission that was investigating abuses, including murder and
torture, carried out under his rule.
	   ``Right through the proceedings, the accused has shown no
remorse,'' Lugaju said in his ruling at the end of a trial that
underscored South Africa's still-simmering racial divisions.
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison had asked for a fine of 60,000
rands (dlrs 9,463), but because of Botha's age, did not seek a
prison term.
	   ``Had the accused been 30 or 40 years younger, the state would
have asked for imprisonment to be imposed,'' he said.
	   Truth Commission chairman Desmond Tutu told a news conference at
Emory University in Atlanta, where he will spend the academic year
writing and teaching, that he felt ``sorry'' for Botha.
	   ``He has been found guilty in an open court where he had the
opportunity of being defended by lawyers of his own choice _
something he did not allow opponents at the time he was state
president,'' the retired archbishop and Nobel laureate said.
``Ultimately, right will prevail. I'm still distressed for him.''

Company wins first round in battle over telephone monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A U.S. company that owns a majority
share of Guyana's telephone system has won the first round in a
battle to retain the monopoly the government granted it in 1991.
	   In a ruling Thursday evening, Acting Chief Justice Prem Persaud
stopped the Public Utilities Commission's plans to hold public
hearings Monday on whether the Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Co.
should have a monopoly on telephone land lines and other services.
	   Atlantic Tele Network, the U.S. Virgin Islands-based company
that owns 80 percent of GT&AMP;T, argued that the commission does not
have the legal authority to question the monopoly granted to the
company by the government.
	   Atlantic Tele Network paid dlrs 16.5 million U.S. for 80 percent
of the local telephone company in 1991. While it has a 40-year
monopoly on telephone land lines, other companies control wireless
communications.
	   Public sentiment is against the monopoly.
	   ``Everybody is talking about this now, even housewives,'' said
Eileen Cox, head of the Consumers Advisory Bureau. ``All the
consumer groups are meeting on Monday to debate this thing. We want
to end it, of course we do.''

U.N. panel urges government action over human rights abuses in
</HEADLINE>
Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Mexican authorities should punish those
responsible for serious human rights abuses allegedly committed
against numerous native Indians in the rebellious southern state of
Chiapas, a U.N. panel of experts has said.
	   ``Developments in the human rights situation in Mexico are
becoming more and more disturbing,'' members of the Sub-Commission
on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities said.
	   The Mexican army has sent thousands of soldiers into the state
to contain leftist Zapatista rebels, which critics say has fueled
tension and created a climate of fear. Several vigilante groups
have taken up arms.
	   The government in recent months has cracked down foreign
involvement in Chiapas, expelling more than 150 people for
allegedly violating Mexico's law banning foreigners from political
activities.
	   The rebels, who took up arms in January 1994, have demanded
greater democracy and rights for Chiapas' dirt-poor Indian
communities. Peace talks with the government have been at a
standstill since 1996.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes between
government and rebel supporters. In December, 45 people were
massacred in a village sympathetic to the rebels.
	   The sub-commission, which has been holding its fiftieth session
in Geneva this month, said it regarded as encouraging and positive
a Mexican government delegation statement apparently saying the
authorities had decided to try to resolve the four-year-old
conflict with the help of dialogue, without first requiring the
rebels to hand over their arms.
	   But members urged the government to fully respect the
international humanitarian law to which it has signed up and
guarantee the safety of those trying to uphold human rights.

family in 2nd, last grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Kazimierz Dziewanowski, a Solidarity
activist who became Poland's first ambassador to the United States
after communism, has died. He was 68.
	   The family did not want to give the cause of death. News reports
said Dziewanowski died from a sudden illness Wednesday in a
hospital.
	   Dziewanowski received a law degree from Warsaw University, and
became a journalist after graduating. In 1980, he joined other
intellectuals in supporting the Gdansk shipyard strike that gave
birth to Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the
former Soviet bloc.
	   Dziewanowski created the ``Solidarity Weekly'' newspaper in 1981
with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who became Poland's first prime minister
after communism.
	   When martial law was imposed by communist rulers in 1981,
Dziewanowski was fired from his post at the literary and social
issues weekly Literatura, and state publishing houses canceled
contracts for his books.
	   From 1990-93, Dziewanowski served as Poland's ambassador to
Washington and lobbied for his country's membership in NATO. He
also wrote about international affairs for the Polish daily
newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
	   ``He opened the doors to NATO for us,'' former President Lech
Walesa said in Friday's issue of Rzeczpospolita. ``It is a pity he
did not live to the moment they are wide open.''
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is scheduled
to join NATO in April.
	   Dziewanowski is survived by his wife, Malgorzata, and a
daughter, Krystyna.

Croatian TV receives ultimatum on political coverage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Croatia's state-run
television must start providing fair coverage and equal access for
all political parties competing in elections in neighboring Bosnia
by midnight Sunday, international officials said Friday.
	   If HRT doesn't comply, candidates from the Bosnian branch of the
Croatian Democratic Union, led by Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman, could be struck from the ballot.
	   HRT management has repeatedly been warned by Western officials
about its biased approach to reporting about Bosnia, and the issue
has been raised with Tudjman.
	   Members of a media experts commission established by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe decided
Thursday to set a deadline for the station. The OSCE is in charge
of Bosnian elections.
	   Also, the TV station must hold a lottery by midnight Wednesday
to determine the placement of political party coverage throughout
the broadcast day.
	   In a letter to the OSCE, Obrad Kosovac, HRT's editor in chief,
said the station would comply with the organization's instructions.
He pledged HRT would cover the activities of all political parties
in a ``correct, impartial and balanced way, as it ... has done so
far.''
	   Croatian media do not come directly under OSCE control. But
because the station uses frequencies and transmitters in Bosnia, it
must conform to broadcast rules designed by the international
community, which is overseeing the reconstruction of Bosnia.
	   Those rules require that all candidates and political parties
have equal access and air time.
	   But OSCE monitoring reports ``demonstrated grossly
disproportionate coverage'' of the Bosnian branch of the Croatian
Democratic Union and its leader Ante Jelavic, an OSCE letter to
Croatian TV Director General Ivica Vrkic said.
	   This creates disadvantages for candidates from other political
parties in the Sept. 12 and 13 Bosnian elections and violates OSCE
rules, the letter said.
	   Vrkic was out of town Friday and could not be reached for
comment. Croatian Democratic Union officials also were unavailable.
	   If the station does not comply, the case will be turned over to
an OSCE subcommission.
	   In a worst-case scenario, candidates from the Bosnian branch of
the Croatian Democratic Union could be bumped from the ballot. The
Bosnian company EROTEL, which rebroadcasts HRT programming in
Bosnia, is controlled by that party.
	   While licensed foreign TV stations can broadcast in Bosnia, a
program that ``reinforces national division rather than
reconciliation is essentially not a good thing,'' said Simon
Haselock, the spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's top
international official.
	   Another media watchdog, the Independent Media Commission, is
examining the legality of Croatian TV broadcasts in Bosnia. EROTEL
has a license from the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia, but has not
been licensed by the Bosnian federal government.
	   ``We have considerable reservations about the legal basis for
it,'' Haselock said.

	   CONTROLLING WATER VILLAGE, China (AP) _ Controlling Water
Village, despite its name, is drowning. Its streets are murky
canals. Its lush fields are a dirty brown sea. Its hardy farmers
are a downcast, waterlogged lot.
	   While hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians fight to
keep the rain-swollen Songhua River out of Harbin, a major city in
northeast China, the battle to save rural areas on the river's
opposite shore has already been lost.
	   Controlling Water Village, home to about 500 people, succumbed
to the Songhua on Tuesday, when the river broke through a nearby
dike. It's a pattern that has been repeated over and over as China
fights its worst floods in decades: cities are being protected at
all costs while farms have been allowed to go under.
	   ``We have no homes and no one is looking after us,'' said
villager Lu Zhi, standing knee-deep in water. ``All my crops have
been washed away.''
	   The devastation is more widespread in central China. The Yangtze
River, China's longest, has stood above emergency levels for more
than a month, weakening protective levees. The government says more
than 2,000 people have died nationwide and millions left homeless _
two-week-old figures that are certain to rise.
	   President Jiang Zemin on Friday postponed September trips to
Japan and Russia due to the floods' severity. Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan told the Japanese and Russian ambassadors the flooding was
the nastiest since the communists came to power in 1949, and there
was no end in sight.
	   Three days of heavy rains upriver in Sichuan province stranded
7,300 people and fueled a new surge of floodwaters, the seventh
since early July, that is expected to roar down the Yangtze over
the next week, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   In northeastern Harbin, 400,000 soldiers and civilians have
battled night and day to build up sandbag defenses that have kept
the Songhua at bay, safeguarding urban areas of the city of 9
million people.
	   Zhang Bailu, an officer overseeing a 1.4-kilometer (mile-long)
stretch of dikes along the riverside Stalin Park, likened it to a
``people's war.''
	   ``Other countries have armies, they have money, but they can't
get the whole of society motivated like we have,'' he said, sitting
on the dike, dangling the tips of his boots in the swollen river.
	   Grateful city residents brought watermelons, crates of mineral
water, dumplings, even whole freshly slaughtered pigs for the
floodfighters.
	   ``People, people, don't worry. Wherever there's danger there's
the People's Liberation Army,'' soldiers sang to keep spirits high.
``We'll defend Harbin to the death.''
	   But 10 kilometers (six miles) away in Controlling Water Village
_ in sight of Harbin's belching smokestacks _ farmers said no one
came to help them when their levee started giving away. Nor, they
said, has the government delivered relief supplies to the village
since the flooding.
	   Farmers said they were surviving on biscuits, instant noodles
and potatoes. One woman on higher ground in the village cooked
greens in a wok over an open fire. But other farmers lacked
firewood and said they had to drink river water without boiling it.
	   Officials said it was not possible to allocate flood relief
until all the victims were counted.
	   ``At the moment, we are concentrating all our energies on
stopping the water from coming in, keeping losses to a minimum,''
said Qian Yaping, a spokesman for Heilongjiang province, of which
Harbin is the provincial capital.
	   On a patch of dry land _ a raised road bed _ on the river's
north bank opposite Harbin, Shi Baohuai, his wife and two children
faced another night in a cramped, mosquito-ridden lean-to _ their
home since the Songhua swamped their village of Qianjijia on
Sunday.
	   The family was living on 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of rice they
managed to salvage and handouts. Some Chinese reporters gave them
some noodles; soldiers gave them mineral water. Shi's wife gutted a
bowl of fish given by a neighbor, their only meal for the day.
	   ``We've got enough food for the next couple of days, but then it
will get dangerous if this goes on,'' said Shi.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians chanted threats
against U.S. President Bill Clinton and burned American flags at a
West Bank protest rally Friday against air strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``America is the first terrorist state in the world,'' prayer
leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000 people outside a Nablus,
West Bank mosque after Friday noon prayers. ``America is an enemy
of the Muslims.''
	   The Palestinian Authority condemned the U.S. missile strikes,
saying the attacks would bring more turmoil to the Middle East.
	   ``I believe that this act will bring the world back to the rule
of the jungle,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Cabinet. ``As Palestinians we know what it means to
have solutions imposed by the use of force.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned Clinton to
convey his support for Thursday's attack against suspected terror
bases and infrastructure used by Islamic militants.
	   An Israeli newspaper said Friday that in the two weeks ahead of
the air strikes, Israeli intelligence agents provided their U.S.
counterparts with considerable information on Islamic militant
groups.
	   Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether Israel helped the
United States select the targets in Thursday's air raids which came
in retaliation for the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa earlier
this month.
	   ``The Americans do not need our operational help,'' Netanyahu
said. ``As for coordination, we are partners in the struggle ...
against those who blow up embassies, children, women, old people,
innocent civilians.'' Netanyahu said Israel cooperated with
``American and other intelligence services.''
	   Netanyahu said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried
to contact him just before the air strikes were launched,
presumably to inform him of the operation ahead of time.
	   Netanyahu, who was vacationing in northern Israel on Thursday,
said he was only available on a cellular phone at the time and that
it was decided to hold off on the conversation until he could reach
a more secure phone line.
	   ``Later, I was briefed by the secretary of state (Madeleine
Albright) on the details, or to be more exact on the principles
which guided the Americans in their action,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``Of course, these are principles known to Israel. It was Israel
that generally charted the course in the struggle against
terrorism,'' he said.
	   The Haaretz daily said that in the past two weeks, Israel gave
the United States considerable information about the connections of
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the
embassy bombings, to Islamic militant groups.
	   At the anti-American rally in the Palestinian-controlled city of
Nablus, one masked demonstrator called on the militant Palestinian
group Hamas to carry out a bombing in Israel to avenge the U.S.
attacks.
	   Masked Hamas activists burned two U.S. flags and led the crowd
in chanting: ``Clinton, wait, wait, Islam will take you to your
grave.'' Some demonstrators held up newspapers with front page
pictures of bin Laden.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 1,000 Hamas supporters attended an
indoor protest rally. The group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, said the group would remain focused on its struggle against
Israel and not go after U.S. targets. ``When we fight Israel, we
fight the Americans,'' Yassin said. ``When we weaken the Israelis,
we affect U.S. interests.''
	   In Friday noon services at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's
third holiest shrine, prayer leader Yousef Abu Sneineh told
thousands of faithful that U.S. President Bill Clinton only ordered
the attacks to deflect attention from his domestic woes.
	   ``This is an act of terrorism committed by a state,'' Abu
Sneineh said.

<TEXT>
	   BURGOS, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Abraham Olano won the Tour of
Burgos Friday, a task that was made slightly easier after his main
competitor Laurent Jalabert dropped out hours before the final
stage.
	   Olano, cycling for Banesto, covered the five days of racing
across north-central Spain in 17 hours, 38 minutes, 21 seconds,
just 56 seconds ahead of Italian rider Leonardo Piepoli.
	   Belgium's Andrei Tchmil won the final stage, finish the 167
kilometers (104 miles) in 3.51:21, followed by Russia's Sergei
Smetanine and Italy's Mario Traversoni.
	   The tour received an upset earlier Friday when top French
cyclist Jalabert, of the ONCE team failed to make the start
complaining of a stomach illness.
	   Olano and Jalabert had held the first and second places since
the start of the tour Monday. Olano led the Frenchman by just three
seconds going into the final day.
	   Spaniards Angel Casero finished No. 3, 1:21 behind Olano while
fellow countryman Fernando Escartin was fourth at 1:49.
	   The race is one of the final warm-ups for the Sept. 5-27 Tour of
Spain.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen seriously injured
two U.N. workers in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday, a day
after a U.S. missile attack on a suspected Islamic militant base
that the country's Taliban rulers said killed 21 people.
	   Prayer leaders at mosques in Kabul and the southern city of
Kandahar, the Taliban's stronghold, exhorted the faithful to
protest the missile strikes on eastern Afghanistan. Hundreds heeded
the call in both cities, taking to the streets to shout ``God is
great! Down with U.S.!'' and to decry the attack on Afghanistan as
an attack on the entire Islamic world.
	   The United Nations confirmed that two men, an Italian and a
French man, were shot as they drove in Kabul. No other details were
available, and it was not immediately clear if the attack was
related to the U.S. missile strikes on Thursday.
	   The Italian Defense Ministry said an Italian soldier working as
a U.N. observer, Lt. Col. Carmine Calo, was shot by a ricocheting
bullet.
	   The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Eric
Lavertu, a civilian U.N. worker, was wounded in the hand. Both
Lavertu and Calo are now at the Red Cross hospital in Kabul and the
United Nations is arranging their evacuation, it said.
	   Foreigners had been advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan.
Those still in Kabul stayed out of sight Friday, while the United
Nations and other agencies arranged evacuations.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada, reached by telephone at
the Taliban's headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said
21 people were killed and another 30 were injured when U.S. cruise
missiles exploded on the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base near Khost, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul.

Swiss central bank refuses to pay into Holocaust settlement

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss central bank Friday refused
to contribute to the dlrs 1.25 billion Holocaust settlement by the
country's two biggest commercial banks, saying Switzerland had
already met its obligations under international law.
	   Heavily criticized by Jewish organizations for its acceptance of
large quantities of gold from Nazi Germany during World War II, the
Swiss National Bank made the decision at a special, three-hour
meeting of its 40-member board.
	   Bank President Hans Meyer told a news conference the board
rejected making a contribution by a large margin, but declined to
give voting figures.
	   United Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse had indicated they
hoped SNB would join Swiss companies and institutions to help
finance the out-of-court settlement they reached in New York last
week with Holocaust survivors.
	   UBS and Credit Suisse spokesmen said Friday they regretted SNB's
refusal.
	   The settlement involved the release of all U.S. claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the central bank, Swiss
government, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The government welcomed the SNB's decision and said the
commercial banks were well aware before reaching the settlement
that it opposed any payments by either itself or the central bank.
	   Switzerland's finance minister has indicated the settlement may
indirectly cost taxpayers some 400 million Swiss francs (dlrs 270
million) because of deductions the banks will take.
	   Although welcoming the accord, the SNB stressed in a statement
that it was not involved in the settlement negotiations.
	   It ``holds the view that its subsequent participation in the
costs of the settlement would lend this an official character,
which is not in the interests of the country as a whole,'' the
statement added.
	   The SNB, the central relay point for gold the Nazis sold to
neutral nations during World War II, restated its position that any
obligations arising from its dealings were settled in a 1946 treaty
with the United States, Britain and France.
	   ``The National Bank once more regrets the dark sides of its
conduct in this difficult period,'' Friday's statement added.
	   One of the suits dropped by the claimants in the settlement was
against the SNB because it accepted Nazi gold stolen from Holocaust
victims.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds) of
gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.
	   The panel says the central bank bought 1.2 billion francs (then
dlrs 284 million) worth of gold from Germany during the war. That
is about three-quarters of all the gold shipped by wartime Germany.
	   Studies in recent months said the central bank should have
suspected at least some of the gold it accepted from Nazi Germany
during the war had been looted.
	   The Swiss historians' study last May said nearly dlrs 500
million of the total dlrs 890 million worth of gold available to
the German Reichsbank came from countries occupied during the war.
	   Bank directors say their wartime predecessors accepted gold on
good faith from both sides to fulfill their mandate of maintaining
the value of the gold-backed Swiss currency.
	   The small neutral nation surrounded by Germany and Nazi allies
needed increasing amounts of gold in the face of demand for the
Swiss franc, the only internationally acceptable currency on the
European continent.
	   Central bank officials noted that the SNB did make a
contribution of 100 million francs (dlrs 69 million) to a Swiss
fund to help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   Swiss banks and industry have given a total of 275 million
francs (dlrs 190 million) to that fund, set up last year by the
commercial banks.
	   The central bank said ``it continues to support all official
endeavors regarded as conducive to overcoming Switzerland's past in
a meaningful way.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to
hold informal consultations on the U.S. decision to bomb suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, which Khartoum has said
was a breach of international law, Kuwait's deputy ambassador said
Friday.
	   Sudanese Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa was also drafting
a letter requesting a U.N. fact-finding investigation into the U.S.
air raids at a Khartoum factory, said the Kuwaiti deputy, Ali
Sulaiman R. al-Saeid.
	   Kuwait chairs the Arab Group of states, which met Friday at U.N.
headquarters and voted to support Sudan's request, said al-Saeid.
	   African, Islamic and non-aligned states were also meeting Friday
and were expected to support the request as well, other Arab
diplomats attending the meeting said.
	   The Sudanese requests were expected later Friday, al-Saeid said.
	   By early afternoon, the office of the council president, Danilo
Turk of Slovenia, said it hadn't received any formal request from
Sudan to hold a special meeting into the issue. U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said no request for a U.N. investigation had been received.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday U.S. forces carried
out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over
250 people.
	   U.S. officials have linked the bombings to groups affiliated
with Osama bin Laden, who has been living in Afghanistan as a guest
of the country's Taliban rulers. Washington has said it acted to
prevent future terrorist attacks.
	   Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview
with The Associated Press, called for a formal investigation into
the strikes and was consulting with council members to raise the
issue before the council.
	   ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because
military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who
represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended Washington's air
strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied
with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N.
charter and international law.
	   Repeated threats by Bin Laden's terrorist organization left
Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the raids Thursday by phone from Mali,
where Annan is vacationing, Eckhard said.
	   Annan repeated his condemnation of terrorism and said the
attacks on the U.S. embassies ``illustrate the need for the
international community to come together to combat this menace,''
Eckhard said.
	   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, said Pakistan agreed
with the right of countries to self-defense but said the ``scourge
of terrorism'' is a fight which shouldn't be fought by individual
states.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
Kamal said. ``And that requires an international consensus and that
requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.''
	   Pakistan has condemned the United States' attack on neighboring
Afghanistan as a violation of international norms and a breach of
Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says member states should
refrain from the use of force against the territory of any state.
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Shen Guofang, said Beijing was waiting
for more information before deciding whether the United States had
violated any U.N. norms.

Brittin misses third century.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WORCESTER, England (AP) _ English opener Jan Brittin showed she
isn't infallible as the home side finished 183 for six after the
first day of the third and final womens Ashes cricket test against
Australia.
	   Brittin, who scored centuries in the first and second tests, was
bowled by Cathryn Fitzpatrick for 72, although she was still a long
way clear as England's top scorer.
	   The 39-year-old opener created a women's test scoring record in
the first test at Guildford, scoring 146 to surpass the
1,594-record set by England's Rachael Heyhoe-Flint in 1979.
	   For Australia, Fitzpatrick finished the day with bowling figures
of 3-70.
	   The first two tests in the inaugural series have both resulted
in draws, meaning the team which wins this test at Worcester will
claim the series.

Scientists discover new robin species in Central African Republic

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Scientists say they have discovered
a new species of robin in the Central African Republic, a find that
ornithologists use as an example of how little is known about birds
in Africa.
	   Pamela Beresford made the announcement at the 22nd International
Ornithological Congress, which brought together more than 1,000 of
the world's leading birders in Durban through Saturday.
	   Beresford, a graduate student with the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, made her find in November 1996. She
was on a World Wildlife Fund-sponsored survey in the southwestern
Central African Republic.
	   ``When we first collected it we thought it was a typical forest
robin, but when we tried to classify it we realized we had
something new,'' Beresford said.
	   The little olive-brown bird, no more than 4 inches (10
centimeters) from beak to tail, is remarkably similar to the other
forest robins except that its throat and upper breast are a bright
yellowy red and its stomach is washed with yellow. Other forest
robins typically have a white stomach and upper breast.
	   Still, Beresford had to examine some 300 specimens from 89
different areas, housed in collections in seven different museums,
before she was convinced that she had found a new species.
	   ``Sometimes you know right away that it's a new bird, sometimes
you have to look at other specimens. With this bird we had to look
at lot of specimens. Even so the morphology (the bird's appearance)
is very distinct,'' said Dr. Joel Cracraft, curator at the American
Museum of Natural History's Department of Ornithology and
co-discoverer of the robin.
	   Beresford declined to provide details such as the bird's name,
height and weight until the full scientific description can be
published _ probably sometime next year in the scientific journal
Novitates.
	   Surprisingly, the robin is one of the most common low-flying
birds in the lowland African rain forest. It just hasn't been
tallied before because there's still so much ground to cover.
	   ``There's never been an inventory of Central African rain forest
before us. And this type of activity is essential for conservation
planning,'' Beresford said.
	   Dr. Phil Hockey, a professor of ornithology at the University of
Cape Town, said that while the new robin is an exciting find, it
may only be the tip of the iceberg.
	   ``Ten or so years ago, ornithologists were saying that by now
all the bird species would be known,'' Hockey said. ``But today new
species are popping up all over the place.''
	   New species of lark and another bird called a cisticola still
await description, he said, as do a host of other birds, seen but
not captured, that scientists suspect are new species.
	   Yet more new species probably live in remote, politically
unstable areas like eastern Cameroon, northwestern Congo and
northern Mozambique, Hockey said.
	   Over the last 50 years, 47 new species have been found using
what Hockey calls the ``pith helmet and butterfly net technique,''
that is, by birders going out into the forest and catching them.
	   Many more have been discovered through more modern molecular
techniques, which use DNA analysis to show that birds of similar
appearance are genetically quite different and thus not the same
species after all.
	   Something similar happened with Beresford's robin, in fact.
Trying to classify her find, she said, she found that a DNA
analysis suggested that three robins believed to be sub-species are
actually three separate species.

Rebel spokesman chides West for supporting pacifist leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The political representative of the
Kosovo rebels said Friday the United States and its allies are
basically wrong in supporting Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader, instead of the armed rebels.
	   Both the underground Kosovo Liberation Army and Rugova want
Kosovo, a southern Serbian province, to become independent. But
while Rugova seeks a peaceful solution, the KLA is still determined
to fight.
	   In an interview with the independent news agency Beta, Adem
Demaci criticized Rugova, claiming he was the only politician in
Kosovo ready to agree to an autonomy solution.
	   He said Rugova had lost his credibility and believes that the
Americans and Europeans will soon realize that.
	   ``I think they (foreign powers) are dealing with wrong people,
because after the appearance of the KLA the policy of Mr. Rugova
has faded, it is outdated, it is no longer the central policy,''
Demaci was quoted as saying.
	   ``All his (Rugova's) attempts to remain the central political
force are in vain, and I think the Americans and the Europeans will
soon realize that, so that cooperation on new ground can start,
with a new center,'' he added.
	   Demaci also said he was ``disappointed'' by the policies of the
U.S. and its allies toward Kosovo, saying the West was too soft on
Serbia and ``the Albanian people (in Kosovo) are paying the price
of the contradictory interests of America and Europe ...''
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova called on foreign powers to declare a
``no-fly zone'' over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war
machine'' in its crackdown on secessionist rebels.
	   He spoke after France warned that military intervention may be
the only alternative to halt the fighting in Kosovo if U.S.
diplomacy does not produce a cease-fire and peace talks soon.
	   In Kosovo Friday, state-run Tanjug news agency reported rebels
opened fire on a Serb police patrol some 30 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of Pristina, in the town of Vucitrn. The report said an
unspecified number of Albanians were injured in the shootout.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said instead that
Serbian police shot a 29-year-old Albanian from a village near
Vucitrn. Avni Saraci was reported to have been accidentally killed
after police fired at another man who refused to show his ID and
ran away.
	   Also in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, the Serbian Media Center
reported that a Serb policeman was killed Thursday evening in the
village of Lapusnik, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the west in
an attack by armed Albanians.
	   Both ethnic Albanian and Serb sources reported fighting between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army Thursday, despite
Serb success in driving the secessionist rebels from most of their
strongholds this month.
	   At a news conference, Rugova repeated demands that civilians
driven from their homes by the fighting be allowed to return ``with
international supervision,'' claiming Serb police were preventing
them from going home.
	   ``It is necessary to establish a ban on military flights over
Kosovo,'' Rugova said. ``That is one of the ways to stop Serbian
war machinery in Kosovo.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is very difficult and dangerous,'' he
added. ``The offensive by Serbian police and military forces
continues, as well as the shelling of Albanian villages ... In
other parts of Kosovo, repression continues.''
	   Such confrontational rhetoric continued despite American efforts
to pave the way for a cease-fire and peace talks on the future of
the Serb province, whose population is 90 percent Albanian.

Foreign office advises Britons to ``extra vigilance'' in Islamic
</HEADLINE>
countries

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Following the U.S. bombing of alleged terrorist
sites in Afghanistan and Sudan, the Foreign Office Friday advised
Britons against traveling to Sudan or Pakistan, and warned them to
be extra vigilant in other Islamic countries.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday strongly backed
the U.S. raids, and a spokesman for the Foreign Office, speaking on
terms of anonymity, said that Britons could be seen as substitute
targets for anti-American militants.
	   ``Some people may misinterpret our support for the U.S. and
actively look for British interests,'' the spokesman said.
	   The Foreign Office said in a statement that ``all nonessential''
visits to Sudan should be canceled, and advised the 250 Britons in
the African state to keep in close touch with British officials for
updated advice.
	   The Foreign Office said it has long advised Britons not to
travel to Afghanistan, and said Friday that any remaining should
leave as soon as possible.
	   In Pakistan, the Foreign Office said it was urging British
nationals to leave the North West Frontier Province, Baluchistan
and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
	   The Foreign office said nonessential visits to Pakistan should
also be put on hold, while British visitors to all other Islamic
countries should ``exercise extra vigilance.''

Robbins shoots course record, seeks first Europan victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ American Kelly Robbins shot a
five-under-par 67 in Friday's second round of the dlrs 450.000
Compaq Open.
	   Defying stormy, rainy weather at the Barseback course near
Malmo, the 28-year-old Robbins, No. 1 in the U.S. Cup rankings,
collected six birdies, including four in a row from the 14th hole,
shooting a course record.
	   ``I have always been a good wind player. Today I also managed to
hole a few putts,'' said Robbins, who has never won a tournament in
Europe.
	   In spite of her strong performance, Robbins is trailed by one
shot behind Briton Johanna Head Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, the
world No. 1, both at 141.
	   Overnight co-leader Sophie Gustafson of Sweden carded a second
sound of 74, keeping her just three shots off the lead.
	   Britain's Laura Davies came to Barseback aiming for a Swedish
double following her win in the Chrysler Open in Goteborg last
month. On Thursday, she scored 74 but moved into contention Friday
with 71.
	   ``Weather conditions were evil today,'' Davies said. Last week,
she missed the British Open cut in similar weather.
	   The Barseback tournament is part of the European women's tour
and is the last before the Europe vs. America Solheim Cup in
Muirfield, Ohio, next month.

European golfers to play Pro-Am in memory of bomb victims

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Europe's top golfers are to take part in
a fund-raising Pro-Am in memory of those killed and injured in last
weekend's bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland.
	   The event will be at Portmarnock Links in Northern Ireland on
Sept. 14, the day after the British Masters at the Forest of Arden
in central England.
	   It is hoped to raise 150,000 pounds (dlrs 247,000) for the Omagh
Fund. Last Saturday's bomb killed 28 people, many of them children,
and injured more than 330.
	   ``We can't bring people back, but we would like to do something
to show our support,'' said Ryder Cup player Darren Clarke, who is
from County Tyrone where the tragedy took place.
	   ``I didn't know anybody who died, but I'm from Dungannon and
Omagh is not far away. I used to play there as an amateur.
	   ``I thought of this at the start of the week,'' the Northern
Ireland star said. ``I've a few people I knew in the troubles over
the years.
	   ``Not that other atrocities haven't affected me, but this one
has hit deeper. Adults and children were just slaughtered _ it was
a senseless, murderous act.''

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Doug Walker pulled away coming out of
the bend and cruised home to lead a British sweep in the men's 200
meters at the European Championship Friday.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64.
	   Julius Golding snatched the bronze by pipping Troy Douglas of
the Netherlands on the line. Both were timed in 20.72.
	   Britons Darren Campbell and Dwain Chambers had placed 1-2 in the
men's 100 on Wednesday.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany won her first major individual gold medal
since coming back from a doping ban when she captured the women's
400 meters.
	   Irina Privalova of Russia, coming back from leg surgery,
retained her 200-meter title and beat world champion Zhanna
Pintusevich of Ukraine.
	   Artur Partyka captured his first major title and gave Poland its
second gold medal of the day when he won the men's high jump.
	   Breuer, 26, who had won the European title for the first time in
1990 when she was still a junior, came back from a three-year
doping ban in 1995. She helped Germany win the 1,600 relay at last
year's worlds.
	   The German led coming out of the final bend and powered home to
win in 49.93 seconds. Helena Fuchsova of the Czech Republic
clinched the silver in 50.21, while Olga Kotlyarova of Russia took
the bronze in 50.38.
	   Privalova surged ahead in the last 30 meters to edge
Pintusevich, clocking 22.62 seconds in the 200.
	   Pintusevich took the silver at 22.74, while Melanie Paschke of
Germany snatched the bronze in 22.78.
	   Ionela Tirlea of Romania cruised home to win the women's
400-meter hurdles in 53.37, ahead of Tatyana Tereshchuk of Ukraine
in 54.07. Silvia Rieger of Germany took the bronze in 54.45.
	   Partyka has had silvers at the Olympics, world and European
championships, but this was his first gold. He cleared 2.34 meters
in his first attempt to edge Dalton Grant of Britain, who had the
same height but needed two attempts.
	   Sergey Klygin of Russia took the bronze at 2.32.
	   Franka Dietzsch of Germany won the women's discus with a throw
of 67.49 meters. Natalya Sadova of Russia was second at 66.94 and
Nicoleta Grasu of Romania third at 65.94.
	   Poland's first triumph came in the men's 50-kilometer walk, when
Robert Korzeniowski added the European gold medal to his Olympic
and world titles.
	   Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine won the first women's pole vault
European title by clearing 4.31 meters, ahead of two Germans.
	   The women's pole vault is relatively a new event and is on the
European schedule for the first time.
	   The two Germans, Nicole Rieger and Yvonne Buschmann, also
cleared 4.31, but had more attempts than Balakhonova. Rieger
clinched the silver because she had one successful attempt at 4.25,
while Buschmann needed two.
	   Korzeniowski, 30, was in the front group from the start and
began pulling away at 40K.
	   He finished the grueling course on a muggy morning in three
hours, 43.51 minutes to beat Valentin Kononen of Finland by a
comfortable margin of 38 seconds.
	   Kononen, the world 1995 champion, clinched the silver at
3:44.29, while Andrey Plotnikov of Russia was more than a minute
behind at 3:45.53 for the bronze.
	   Steve Backley of Britain, seeking his third straight European
title, set a championship record of 87.45 meters in qualifying for
the javelin final.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and world record-holder, easily
passed the first round of the men's 800-meter qualifying, although
he was only second in his heat after not pushing hard. He is
recovering from a bout of malaria in February, which set his
training back by three months.
	   Kipketer, who was born in Kenya but now holds Danish
citizenship, clocked 1:46.19, more than five seconds outside his
world record of 1:41.11.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, world record-holder Colin
Jackson of Britain, who is seeking his third consecutive title, had
the fastest time in the first qualifying round of 13.47 seconds.
Two other British runners also advanced, Tony Jarrett and Andrew
Tulloch.
	   Heike Drechsler of Germany, seeking to become only the third
athlete to win four straight titles in the same event, cleared 6.79
meters to make the final in the women's long jump.
	   Drechsler had the second longest jump after Russian Lyudmila
Galkina's 6.83.

Villa boss: I would have shot Yorke if I had a gun
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Confirms Solskjaer deal in 10th graf

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Aston Villa manager John Gregory is
furious that Dwight Yorke turned his back on the club after nine
years to move to Manchester United in a 12.6 million-pound (dlrs
20.5 million) transfer deal.
	   ``If I'd had a gun I would have shot him,'' an angry Gregory
said after the deal was completed Thursday.
	   Gregory's reaction was splashed across the headlines Friday.
	   ``Dwight Yorke came to see me two weeks ago to tell me he wanted
to play for Manchester United and not Aston Villa,'' he said.
	   ``If I'd had a gun at the time I would have shot him. What he
said really hurt. It really got me.
	   ``I had hoped he would change his mind. Yet in the last few days
he made it very clear he wanted to go.''
	   The 26-year-old Tobagan striker had been consisently linked with
a transfer to Manchester United in the off-season as the Red
Devil's boss Alex Ferguson combed the competition in search of a
striker.
	   Ferguson's original 10 million pound (dlrs 16.25 million) offer
was rejected by Gregory, who said he wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs
26.4 million) for Yorke.
	   After stating Tuesday he planned to see out his contract at
Villa despite being disappointed about a failed move to the Red
Devils, he suddenly confirmed Wednesday that transfer negotiations
were back on.
	   He eventually signed with Manchester United Thursday, just in
time to meet the deadline to play in the European Champions' Cup.
	   Yorke's arrival at Old Trafford may result in the departure of
Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to Tottenham, which said
that United had agreed a 5.5 million pound (dlrs 8.9 million) deal.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Iwan Thomas completed a British sweep
of the men's sprints at the European Championship when he won the
400 meters Friday in a new championship record of 44.52 seconds.
	   Just minutes earlier, Doug Walker pulled away coming out of the
bend and cruised home to lead a British sweep in the men's 200.
	   Britons Darren Campbell and Dwain Chambers had also taken silver
and gold, respectively, in the 100 on Wednesday.
	   Thomas led coming out of the turn and stretched his lead over
the last 80 meters, as Robert Mackowiak of Poland passed Mark
Richardson to prevent another gold-silver British sweep.
	   Mackowiak clinched the silver in 45.04 and Richardson was third
in 45.14.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64.
	   Julius Golding snatched the bronze by pipping Troy Douglas of
the Netherlands on the line. Both were timed in 20.72.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany won her first major individual gold medal
since coming back from a doping ban when she captured the women's
400 meters.
	   Irina Privalova of Russia, coming back from leg surgery,
retained her 200-meter title and beat world champion Zhanna
Pintusevich of Ukraine.
	   Artur Partyka captured his first major title and gave Poland its
second gold medal of the day when he won the men's high jump.

Langer, Rivero lead at halfway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Langer No to Ryder Cup captaincy, Payne Stewart
also missing cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Two-time winner Bernhard Langer collected
an eagle and five birdies in a 7-under 65 Friday to share the
halfway lead in the 1.25 million pounds (dlrs 2 million) European
Open with Spain's Jose Rivero.
	   While the Spaniard carded eight birdies in his round of 66,
Langer, winner in 1985 and '95, chipped out of a bunker for his
eagle at the par-5, 568-yard 13th and covered the back nine in 31.
	   It gave him a two-round, 6-under par total of 138 and showed he
had no ill effects from a back injury which forced the German to
miss last week's PGA championship.
	   Langer also said he was not interested in being Europe's Ryder
Cup captain in next year's competition.
	   ``It's just a rumor,'' he said a week before the captaincy is to
be announced. ``It would be an honor to be asked but I've not been
and, even if I had been, I would not have accepted.''
	   First round leader Mathias Gronberg of Sweden slipped to third,
a shot off the lead, after a 71 gave him a halfway total of 139 and
then come Americans Craig Hainline and Gary Nicklaus on 140.
	   Hainline, who plays regularly on the European Tour, carded a 69
while Nicklaus made 66 and then was unable to contact his famous
father to tell him.
	   ``I talk a lot with my dad but we haven't spoken for two
weeks,'' he said. ``He's in Africa with the rest of the family and
it's pretty tough to reach him out there.''
	   Colin Montgomerie, struggling to keep his game together on the
U.S. Tour, missed the cut after a disastrous 79 left him 10-over on
152.
	   The Scot was 2-over at the turn, but double-bogeyed the 10th,
bogeyed the 11th and had a triple bogey six on the 170-yard 12th
after hitting into water. He finished with a birdie to at least
avoid making 80.
	   Justin Rose, the 18-year-old who became famous with his fourth
place finish at the British Open five weeks ago, still hasn't made
in into the third round as a pro.
	   The Englishman missed the cut for the third time after a second
round 75 gave him 151, two too many.
	   Payne Stewart missed the cut too. The American bogeyed five of
the last eight holes for his second 77 and a 10-over total.

Pakistan denies missile landed on its soil

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After a day of angry protests over
the U.S. strikes on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan and a phone call
from the American president, Pakistan said Friday that a stray
missile had not landed on its soil and killed five people after
all.
	   ``No casualty has occurred inside Pakistani territory as
believed earlier,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. ``All
casualties and damage as a result of the U.S. strikes have occurred
across the border in Afghanistan.''
	   The ministry gave no reason for its about-face, but said that
the earlier comments were based on ``inaccurate information.''
	   The United States carried out near-simultaneous attacks Thursday
on Sudan, which Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorism, and
Afghanistan, where U.S. officials said they were targeting a
suspected training camp of Saudi militant millionaire Osama bin
Laden.
	   Bin Laden is believed to have been behind the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   Pakistan condemned the U.S. strikes, saying America's attack on
neighboring Afghanistan was conducted without its knowledge and
constituted a violation of international norms.
	   That outrage was mirrored in protests across the country.
Demonstrators burned U.S. flags, threw stones at consulates and
chanted slogans. Violence broke out at a demonstration in the
border city of Peshawar, which hosts thousands of Afghan refugees.
	   Police clashed with a group of 2,500 Afghan refugees who tried
to demonstrate outside the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar. One
protester was killed and three Pakistani policemen were injured.
	   The U.S. attacks have the Pakistanis in a tough situation.
	   The government is a U.S. ally as well as one of the few
countries in the world to recognize the Taliban, the extremist
Islamic militia that harbors bin Laden, as Afghanistan's legitimate
government.
	   ``Clearly Pakistan is caught between two allies,'' said Maleeha
Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. ``Whatever it
does there are costs. It's not an enviable position to be in.''
	   Further, Pakistani politicians must answer to a vocal minority
in the officially Muslim country that often portrays the United
States as an enemy of Islam. Already weakened by an economic crisis
and other domestic issues, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
cannot appear to have abandoned an Islamic neighbor.
	   Many of the protests were called by conservative Islamic parties
whose religious leaders announced them at mosques on Friday, the
Muslim holy day.
	   Earlier Friday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf
said that one of the missiles fired on Afghanistan had landed in
Pakistan, killing ``five or six people.'' He did not say where the
missile struck.
	   Altaf said that a U.S. envoy was called to the Foreign Ministry
for a formal protest over the strikes and over the presumed
violation of its airspace necessary to hit Afghanistan.
	   He said Pakistan had been neither consulted nor warned of the
attack.
	   Later, the ministry said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had
called Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to explain the
attacks.
	   Its statement gave no details of what Clinton said, but quoted
Sharif as saying that the attacks ``constituted a violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent states.''
	   Sharif also stressed that Islamabad was committed to ``combating
terrorism in all its forms,'' the Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations closed its offices and directed
its American and other foreign staffers to stay home for their own
safety.
	   The U.S. State Department recalled all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families Monday and warned other Americans to leave
the country.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said Americans had been
issued no additional warnings since the strikes on Afghanistan.
Hoagland said he had no numbers on how many of the estimated 6,700
Americans living in Pakistan have left.

Seeking unity, including with Cuba, Caribbean leaders discuss

trade, aid &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Seeking strength
through unity, including their renewed ties with Cuba's Fidel
Castro, leaders from 16 Caribbean nations launched talks Friday to
bolster their struggling economies.
	   At stake in the two-day Santo Domingo summit: How small
Caribbean nations can avoid being sideswiped in negotiations to
create a Free Trade Area of the Americas stretching from Canada to
Argentina.
	   One step will be Saturday's signing of a trade pact between the
15-nation Caribbean Community common market and the Dominican
Republic, which last year reached a similar accord with Central
American nations.
	   By inviting Castro to the summit, the Caribbean Community
leaders also want added muscle when it comes time to renegotiate a
key aid and trade pact, called the Lome Agreement, between European
nations and their former African, Caribbean and Pacific colonies.
	   The pact, worth dlrs 18 billion a year, comes up for renewal in
2000, while hemispheric leaders have set a 2005 target date for
free trade in the Americas.
	   ``We are still not in a position to make our economies
resilient,'' warned Suriname's president, Jules Wijdenbosch. ``We
may have spent nearly 500 years assuming different postures. We
have less than a decade to fully assume the natural roles of
Caribbean men, women and children.''
	   Most Caribbean nations only gained their political independence
in recent decades and are still struggling to diversify economies
heavily dependent on trade incentives for sugar, cotton and banana
exports.
	   The Dominican economy, too, relies on agriculture to employ half
its work force; while Cuba lost its leading market for sugar with
the Soviet bloc's demise and wants to become a member of the Lome
pact.
	   Caribbean leaders want Washington to drop its embargo of
communist Cuba _ a nation they call essential to the region's
future prospects.
	   Shunning confrontation, and borrowing a phrase from the former
U.S. Reagan administration's policy on white-ruled South Africa,
the Caribbean Community has opted for ``constructive engagement''
with Castro to promote human rights in Cuba.
	   ``Dr. Castro, your presence at this historic conference
reconfirms that Cuba is an undeniable part of the Caribbean and
this hemisphere,'' Wijdenbosch declared. ``Cuba should ... be fully
involved in the ongoing process.''
	   With democracy a key agenda item at the summit, the head of the
Organization of American States, which suspended Cuba in 1962, held
out the possibility that Cuba one day could rejoin its ranks.
	   Among OAS leaders, Cesar Gaviria said, ``I have heard plenty of
the desire to have Cuba be part of our organization.'' But Gaviria,
an observer at the summit, also noted that another common wish was
for changes that permit more freedom in Cuba.

On Arab streets, Clinton-Lewinsky affair seen behind attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Inserts grafs 6-7 on few demonstrations, one in West Bank;
EDITS to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Bombings, Sudan-US &QL; 
 &UR; By G.G. LaBELLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a
battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   Despite anger over the U.S. attacks, there were few large
protests like those often organized by Arab states. Egypt, which
accused Sudan of harboring the radicals who unsuccessfully tried to
kill President Hosni Mubarak in 1995, issued a bland statement
calling for a meeting on international terrorism.
	   In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians chanted threats
against Clinton and burned American flags. ``America is the enemy
of the Muslims,'' prayer leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000
people outside a Nablus mosque.
	   The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle
East was predictable, and its allies mostly remained silent.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip
operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli,
thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.''
	   The strikes were criticized by Iraq and non-Arab Iran which _
along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of
terrorist-sponsoring states.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run
radio.
	   In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the feeling was
that Clinton ordered the attacks to deflect attention from his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said
that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world
after Clinton has discovered Osama bin Laden's dishdasha (Arab
robe).''
	   Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain,
25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the missile
strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's
wrongdoings.''
	   Another Saudi, Seneitan Hazzam, agreed and added ``somehow,
somewhere they (Americans) will pay the price.''
	   But asked if they sympathized with bin Laden, both men said
``he's no better.''
	   In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the
bombing ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless action. ... This
violence will only beget more violence.''
	   Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand,
was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United
States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
	   More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper
from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.
	   ``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never
be clean,'' he said. ``Clinton and the U.S have for years been
killing indiscriminately, so this is not new. But it certainly
won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders defended their handling of the
country's financial crisis before a hostile, booing parliament on
Friday, saying the banking system would have collapsed if they
hadn't spent billions of dollars to prop up the ruble.
	   In another attempt to ease the crunch, Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov said the government was considering new restrictions on
moving money out of the country.
	   But Russian and international investors remained skeptical the
government could resolve its severe economic problems, and
lawmakers again demanded the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin
and his government.
	   The Russian Trading System continued its downward spiral. The
country's major stock index fell 5.6 percent to close at 81.76
points.

U.S. senator arrives in Lebanon on fact-finding trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel arrived in
Lebanon Friday on the third leg of a fact-finding trip to the
Middle East.
	   ``The point of this trip is to hear and see and try to
understand more of what is going on,'' Hagel, Republican-Nebraska,
told reporters after meeting Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
	   ``Once we understand one another, the makers of policies in the
Congress will be able to point out things in a more realistic
way.''
	   Hagel is scheduled to travel to Damascus, Syria, on Saturday and
then on to Saudi Arabia. He has already visited Israel, the
Palestinian territories and Egypt.
	   Hagel, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said the current stalemate in the peace process will do no good for
any of the parties involved.
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks have not taken place since February
1996 and Israeli-Palestinian talks have failed to advance since
March 1997.

Sudan council to meet, authorize UN fact-finding team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES attribution with Sudanese ambassador comments; Sudan
accusing US of violating international law; UN saying Sudanese
factory had contract to supply veterinary pharmaceuticals to Iraq. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to
consider authorizing a U.N. investigation into the U.S. airstrikes
on a Khartoum factory, Sudan's ambassador said Friday, calling the
attack a breach of international law.
	   Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa said he would deliver a
letter of formal complaint requesting the investigation later
Friday to the council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia. The
letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said.
	   The Arab Group of states would support Sudan's request for an
investigation, said Ali Sulaiman R. al-Saeid, the deputy ambassador
of Kuwait.
	   The group, chaired by Kuwait, met Friday to discuss Sudan's
options.
	   Non-aligned states were also meeting Friday and Sudan hoped they
would support the investigation as well, Erwa said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
	   U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the
bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a
flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says
member states must refrain from using force against other states.
	   U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the
Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical
plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the
embassy bombings.
	   Erwa told the Arab Group on Friday that the factory was a
pharmaceutical plant that had no links to bin Laden.
	   The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the
el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary
pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The
pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
	   Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan
criticized Washington for acting unilaterally on what it described
as an international problem.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires
an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on
the same side of the table.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a
letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the
rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter
and international law.
	   Repeated threats by Bin Laden's terrorist organization left
Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Shen Guofang, said Beijing was waiting
for more information before deciding whether the United States had
violated any U.N. norms.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the raids Thursday by phone from Mali,
where Annan is vacationing, Eckhard said.
	   Annan repeated his condemnation of terrorism and said the
attacks on the U.S. embassies ``illustrate the need for the
international community to come together to combat this menace,''
Eckhard said.

 &UR; French visit seeks to capitalize on moderate signs from Iran
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Vedrine comments on arrival; trims pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In yet another high-profile visit showing
Europe's eagerness to forge closer ties with Iran, France's foreign
minister traveled to Tehran Friday to meet the country's moderate
president and other leaders.
	   ``My country places great importance on what is going on in
Iran,'' Hubert Vedrine said upon his arrival Friday night. ``I came
to see for myself, to listen and understand better.''
	   Vedrine's two-day trip, which officially begins Saturday, is the
highest-level French visit in seven years.
	   Coming only weeks after the visit of Italy's prime minister, it
is a clear sign that Europe, eager to increase trade with Iran, is
moving to capitalize quickly on the moderate signs coming out of
Tehran since the election of President Mohammad Khatami a year ago.
	   Though he won't say it publicly, Vedrine clearly hopes to give
Khatami and his moderate camp a boost with his visit.
	   The trip also comes amid a tentative but obvious softening of
the relationship between Iran and the United States _ or ``The
Great Satan,'' as it's been known in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   Vedrine says he plans to broach all subjects, including the
thorniest issue affecting Iran's ties to the West: terrorism.
	   The subject clearly will be on the front burner, with the recent
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and Washington's
retaliatory attacks Thursday in Sudan and Afghanistan. Iran has
condemned the embassy bombings.
	   Only last April, the 15 European Union countries broke off
regular contacts with Iran and withdrew their envoys after a German
court found Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 assassination of
Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
	   But four months later, the moderate Khatami was elected by a
landslide, and a month after that the EU ambassadors returned. In
January, Khatami called for a ``break in the wall of mistrust''
with the United States. In March, the Europeans resumed ministerial
talks.
	   Earlier this summer, both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made conciliatory statements
to Iran. Clinton said it was ``changing in a positive way,'' and
Albright said it was ``time to test the possibilities for bridging
this gap.''
	   In light of improving ties between Tehran and Washington,
Vedrine feels he can serve a useful role by raising some of the
problem issues between the two capitals _ problems that pose an
obstacle to closer European-Iranian ties, too.
	   Chief among them is terrorism. The United States has long seen
Iran as a rogue state that sponsors terrorism, and Albright has
said European allies ``just don't get it'' about Iran's terrorist
activity.
	   The issue directly concerns France. In the last 10 years, eight
Iranian dissidents have been assassinated on French soil; the last
as recently as 1996. They're believed to have been killed by
Iranian government hit squads.
	   While France may envision a role in facilitating an Iran-U.S.
rapprochement _ Vedrine and Albright discussed the visit last week
_ there is one area where Paris and Washington could become rivals
in the event of such a reconciliation: trade.
	   European companies have benefited from U.S. economic sanctions.
Last year, Washington wasn't pleased when the French oil giant
Total, which is partly state-owned, signed a dlrs 2 billion
contract in Iran to expand a southern gas field, along with a
Russian and a Malaysian company.
	   The deal was made despite a U.S. law authorizing President
Clinton to impose sanctions against companies investing more than
dlrs 20 million in Iran's energy sector.
	   ``American laws apply in the United States, not in France,''
said French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

Diplomats tour battered factory, protesters denounce U.S.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Diplomats from more than a dozen nations
were taken on a tour Friday of the Sudanese factory struck a day
earlier by U.S. missiles.
	   Firemen still rushed about, their faces covered with surgical
masks to keep out the smell of burning plastic as they tried to put
out blazes that persisted more than 24 hours after the attack.
	   ``We ask the American people to push their government to stop
interfering in our internal affairs,'' said Bishop Gabriel Rorej,
minister of state for foreign affairs who showed the diplomats
around. ``We are innocent people, and we renounce terrorism, and we
are not a safe haven for terrorists and we will never be so.''
	   President Clinton ordered the attack on the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Thursday on grounds the factory
was producing precursors for the deadly VX chemical weapon.
American missiles also struck suspected bases of Muslim extremist
Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   The factory complex is in an industrial zone that is surrounded
by mud and brick houses, mainly for factory workers.
	   At least three dozen anti-riot police guarded the road leading
to the site to try to keep away gawkers.
	   The pharmaceutical factory complex consists of a half-dozen
buildings, two of which _ a cafeteria and a storage building _ were
still smoldering on Friday.
	   Two floors of the four-story administration building were
flattened in the missile attack, and half of the main two-story
factory was destroyed. A warehouse also sustained heavy damage from
a missile hit.
	   One missile that landed between buildings left a crater about 2
meters (yards) in diameter and two meters deep. It was quickly
filling up with water from the fire-fighting efforts.
	   Pills, smashed plastic medicine bottles and paper cartons were
scattered over the ground, along with concrete rubble and shards of
glass.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at El-Shifa,
estimated the damage to the 2-year-old factory at dlrs 100 million.
He said the owner was Sudanese businessman Salah-Eddin Ahmed
Idriss, who lives in Saudi Arabia.
	   He described El-Shifa as ``the largest pharmaceutical factory we
had in this country'' and added: ``We never produced any chemical
material.''
	   As the diplomats toured, about 100 Sudanese women _ most in the
head scarves of devout Muslims _ protested outside the factory
gate, shouting ``America should be destroyed!'' and ``The factory
should be rebuilt!''
	   Khadisha Ali, a sophomore from an Islamic university who led the
chanting, told The Associated Press: ``We condemn this American
aggression on our country. We call on the world community to come
to the aid of Sudan.''

Two people die in bomb attacks on Algerian beaches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Two bombs exploded on packed beaches in
western Algeria Friday, killing at least two people _ including a
young child _ and injuring two others, authorities said.
	   The bombs were hidden in the sand at the Chlef beach resort,
about 100 kilometers (62.5 miles) west of Algiers. Two people died
in the first bombing, and two others were injured in the second
attack, three hours later.
	   One of the victims was identified as a young child, but no
further details were released.
	   Since July, 12 people have died and 100 others injured in a
dozen explosions at beaches in Algeria, which has been rocked by
violence during a six-year insurgency by Islamic insurgents.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to
win. An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence.

Rebel spokesman chides West for supporting pacifist leader

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The political representative of the
Kosovo rebels said Friday that the United States and its allies are
basically wrong in supporting Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader, instead of the guerrillas.
	   Both the underground Kosovo Liberation Army and Rugova want
Kosovo, a southern Serbian province with a 90-percent ethnic
Albanian population, to become independent. But while Rugova seeks
a peaceful solution, the KLA is determined to fight. The Serbs,
meanwhile, have cracked down hard.
	   In an interview with the independent news agency Beta, Adem
Demaci criticized Rugova and said that he himself was the only
politician in Kosovo ready to agree to a solution that would bring
autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   He said Rugova had lost his credibility and that the Americans
and Europeans will soon realize that.
	   ``After the appearance of the KLA the policy of Mr. Rugova has
faded, it is outdated, it is no longer the central policy,'' Demaci
was quoted as saying.
	   ``All (Rugova's) attempts to remain the central political force
are in vain, and I think the Americans and the Europeans will soon
realize that, so that cooperation on new ground can start, with a
new center,'' he added.
	   Demaci also said he was ``disappointed'' by the policies of the
United States and its allies toward Kosovo, saying the West was too
soft on Serbia and ``the Albanian people (in Kosovo) are paying the
price of the contradictory interests of America and Europe ...''
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova called on foreign powers to declare a
no-fly zone over the rebellious province to halt the ``Serb war
machine'' in its attacks on secessionist rebels.
	   Rugova repeated demands that civilians driven from their homes
by the fighting be allowed to return ``with international
supervision,'' claiming Serb police were preventing them from going
home.
	   ``The offensive by Serbian police and military forces continues,
as well as the shelling of Albanian villages,'' Rugova said. ``In
other parts of Kosovo, repression continues.''
	   He spoke after France warned that military intervention may be
the only way to halt the fighting if U.S. diplomacy does not
produce a cease-fire and peace talks soon.
	   In Kosovo, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported that rebels
opened fire on a Serb police patrol in the town of Vucitrn, about
30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina, the provincial
capital. The report said an unspecified number of Albanians were
wounded.
	   The pro-ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said that
Serbian police shot and killed a 29-year-old ethnic Albanian from a
village near Vucitrn when they opened fire on another man who
refused to show his ID and ran away.
	   Also in Pristina, the Serbian Media Center reported that a Serb
policeman was killed Thursday evening in the village of Lapusnik,
about 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the west, in an attack by armed
ethnic Albanians.

UN says factory contracted to supply pharmaceuticals to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations said Friday that the
Sudanese factory destroyed by U.S. airstrikes had been contracted
to supply dlrs 199,000 in veterinary pharmaceuticals to Iraq.
	   The contract was signed in January but the pharmaceuticals were
never delivered, according to a statement from U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
	   The contract was part of the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program,
which lets Iraq sell its oil to buy food and medicine for Iraqis
suffering under sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The
sanctions bar sales of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, on the open
market.
	   Sudan's U.N. ambassador, Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa, told a
group of Arab states on Friday that the factory had no connection
to Osama bin Laden, whom the United States accuses in the twin
bombings of its embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.
	   ``The Shifa factory has always been sending medical assistance
to the children in refugee and displaced camps,'' said a statement
from Erwa's office.
	   U.N. approval of contracts for Iraqi medicine ``stands as a
crystal clear evidence and thus refuting the American allegations
that the factory is designed to produce chemical weapons,'' the
statement said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger said Friday the factory _ which U.S. officials say was used
to make ingredients for VX nerve gas _ was ``functionally
destroyed.''

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian secret police and the CIA have
launched a nationwide manhunt for suspects involved in terror
attacks in Egypt, including the November 1997 massacre of 62 people
in Luxor, Albanian sources said Friday.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
investigation was mainly focused on Tirana, the capital, and four
other central Albanian cities, including Elbasan, where two of five
terrorist suspects were arrested earlier this summer.
	   An Association for the Revival of Islamic Heritage, to which the
suspects reportedly belonged, was headquartered in Elbasan.
	   Also on Friday, security was tightened on the final day of a
NATO military exercise following U.S. missile attacks on alleged
terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials canceled a media visit to the USS La Salle, one
of the ships taking part in the five-day ``Cooperative Assembly
1998'' exercise, which began Monday.
	   On Sunday, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines were first reported
securing the American diplomatic compound here after U.S. officials
said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S.
Embassy here.
	   Three days later, Albanian and American agents were reported
searching nationwide for suspected members of a terrorist group
that planned to blow up the diplomatic mission.
	   Word on Friday that agents from both countries were looking for
suspects involved in terrorist attacks in Egypt suggested that the
search had been widened.
	   Speaking on television late Friday, Albanian Socialist Premier
Fatos Nano appeared to confirm the joint manhunt for terrorist
suspects.
	   ``I want to inform you that the ambassador of the United States
has constantly talked to me on the need of joint action,'' Nano
said.
	   ``We will continue to work with our allies, especially with the
United States of America, to shut once and forever the doors to
terrorism and in this way strengthen relations with the the
government of the United States,'' he added.
	   Nano explained his party had warned former President Sali
Berisha, now the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, of his
``policy of torn-down doors.'' While Berisha was in power travelers
from Arab countries could obtain visas at the border without a
problem.
	   The Nano government has announced it will tighten border
controls to fight international terrorism.
	   An Interior Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday the search began after American officials
last week uncovered ``serious evidence'' of plans to bomb the U.S.
Embassy.
	   He said the Albanian secret service and the CIA are compiling
lists of suspects and sending police to arrest them.
	   The plot apparently was related to recent arrests of several
Egyptians believed linked to terror attacks in Egypt, including the
November 1997 massacre of 62 people at a temple in the southern
city of Luxor.
	   The plot also may have been linked to the bombings this month of
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 257 people were
killed.
	   The NATO exercise, which ended Friday and involved 1,700 troops
from the United States, Russia and 12 other countries, was aimed at
sending a signal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that the
Alliance was capable of moving to halt the fighting in neighboring
Kosovo province.
	   Ethnic Albanians there are fighting for independence from
Serbia, the largest of the two republics that form Yugoslavia.
	   But the exercise has been dogged by the threat of terrorism
which heightened following bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

French Foreign Minister arrives in Sudan for 2-day visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, background. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In another visit showing Europe's eagerness
for closer ties with Iran, France's foreign minister arrived here
Friday for talks with the country's leaders.
	   ``My country places great importance on what is going on in
Iran,'' Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at Tehran airport. ``I
came to see for myself, to listen and understand better.''
	   Vedrine's two-day trip is the highest-level French visit to Iran
in seven years.
	   Coming only weeks after the visit of Italy's prime minister, the
trip is a clear sign that Europe, keen to increase trade with Iran,
is moving to capitalize quickly on the moderate signals from Tehran
since the election of President Mohammad Khatami a year ago.
	   Though he won't say it publicly, Vedrine clearly hopes to give a
boost to Khatami and his moderate camp in its ongoing power
struggle with hard-liners in Iran's ruling hierarchy.
	   The trip also comes amid a tentative but obvious softening of
the relationship between Iran and the United States _ or ``The
Great Satan,'' as it's been known in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   Vedrine says he plans to broach all subjects, including the
thorniest issue affecting Iran's ties to the West: terrorism. The
issue directly concerns France. In the last 10 years, eight Iranian
dissidents have been assassinated on French soil; the last as
recently as 1996. They're believed to have been killed by Iranian
government hit squads.
	   The issue terrorism has also been brought to the fore by the
recent attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and
Washington's retaliatory attacks Thursday in Sudan and Afghanistan.
Iran has condemned the embassy bombings.
	   In April 1997, the 15 European Union countries broke off regular
contacts with Iran and withdrew their envoys after a German court
found Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 assassination of Kurdish
dissidents in Berlin.
	   But four months later, the moderate Khatami was elected by a
landslide, and a month after that the EU ambassadors returned. In
January, Khatami called for a ``break in the wall of mistrust''
with the United States. In March, the Europeans resumed ministerial
talks.
	   Earlier this summer, both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made conciliatory statements
to Iran. Clinton said it was ``changing in a positive way,'' and
Albright said it was ``time to test the possibilities for bridging
this gap.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's peso plunged to an all-time low
against the dollar Friday as declining global equity prices sparked
a massive sell-off.
	   In Mexico City on 48-hour spot dollar markets, banking leader
Banamex quoted the peso closing at a mid rate of 9.74 per dollar,
weaker from its open of 9.55 and from its Thursday close of 9.345.
	   Traders cited worries of a devaluation in Venezuela spreading
through Latin America, and said domestic speculators were
especially active.
	   The Bank of Mexico's sale of dlrs 200 million in dollar options
at midsession didn't help. The central bank automatically sells the
options if the peso weakens more than 2 percent from its fix the
previous day.
	   The peso weakened to 9.875 shortly after the options were sold.
	   ``You'd have to call it a panic,'' said Eduardo Estrada Lopez,
economist at Grupo Financiero Bancomer. ``There's no floor. Monday,
the market was talking about a floor of 9.3 and look what's
happened.''
	   The Mexican Stock Exchange's key IPC index was down 3.2 percent
when peso trading ended after being down as much as 7.8 percent
earlier in the session.
	   Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria described the market's fall
as a reaction to economic slides in Russia, Venezuela and Germany,
the government news agency Notimex said.
	   ``This has nothing to do with internal factors,'' he said in
Veracruz state, where President Ernesto Zedillo was making a visit.
	   ``It has been a very difficult day in the world markets,'' he
said.

	    &UR; No Spider Fighting Allowed
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Education officials in a southern
Philippine province have banned spider wrestling, a favorite
children's pastime in many rural areas, to discourage students from
skipping classes to catch spiders, an official said Thursday.
	   The ban began last week after education officials noticed that
an increasing number of absences among school children were traced
to the game, said Isidro Valeroso, superintendent of the Department
of Education in North Cotabato province.
	   Valeroso said spider wrestling, in which children collect
spiders and have them fight to the death on a stick, also
encourages children to gamble.
	   The spiders wrestle ferociously for a few seconds amid the
cheers of children. The battle ends when the champion completely
wraps the vanquished spider in a cocoon of webbing. Children often
bet on the outcome.
	   Children usually go to meadows or farms at dawn or dusk to catch
spiders, sometimes skipping classes or coming in late.
	   They usually house their best ``gladiators'' in matchboxes.
	   Many aficionados spend large amounts of time searching for the
best spiders. Most of the spiders are collected from trees but some
children say the best fighters are found on electric power lines.
	   A prized fighter sells for up to 100 pesos (dlrs 2.40).
	   ``We have to teach children that spiders are a farmer's best
friend because they catch insects that destroy or damage crops,''
Valeroso said. ``We really have to stop children from killing
spiders.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use information from the story to answer the following
questions:
	   1. What is a favorite spare-time activity for children in many
rural Philippine provinces?
	   2. Why did education officials decide to ban (forbid) spider
wrestling?
	   3. Why do you think some students would rather catch spiders
than go to school?
	   4. Name four places where spiders are found.
	   5. Where do the students keep their best ``gladiators''
(fighters)?
	   6. Why do you think a spider fight takes place on a stick?

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM _ A well-known rabbi, stabbed to death by a
Palestinian assailant in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, was
laid to rest Friday as dozens of Jewish settlers called for
revenge.
	   Signaling that settlers would not be forced out of the West
Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said mobile homes like the
one lived-in by the rabbi, would be replaced with permanent
structures.
	   He said the slaying strengthened his resolve not to sign a deal
on a West Bank troop pullback unless Palestinians do more to curb
terrorism.
	   ``I plan to replace the temporary structures there for two
reasons; one to protect the settlement there and two, to emphasize
the permanence of a Jewish and Israeli settlement in Hebron,'' he
told Israel TV.
	   An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that for the first time
Israel committed in writing to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with some conditions.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Friday that Israel has now
submitted the plan to the Palestinians in writing and that the
compromise was accepted by the Palestinians, a claim staunchly
denied by Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   Netanyahu would not confirm the report but hinted that gaps on
the scope of a withdrawal were narrowing. The remaining
differences, he said, were regarding Palestinian security
obligations.
	   ``The gap is the Palestinian failure so far to give us the
assurances that they will concretely fight terrorism, fight it in
practical terms ... but also fight it in moral terms.''
	   ``We expect this dual Palestinian battle against terrorism ...
to be part of the agreement and that is what is holding up the
agreement so far,'' Netanyahu told reporters at a news conference
he called at his residence.
	   In Hebron, hundreds of Jewish settlers marched in the late
afternoon heat in the funeral procession of 63-year-old Rabbi
Shlomo Raanan, who was stabbed to death late Thursday by a
Palestinian intruder.
	   Raanan was killed in the bedroom of his trailer home in Hebron's
heavily fortified Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, one of several in
the center of the city. The assailant then torched the home with a
firebomb before fleeing.
	   During a mourning ceremony earlier Friday, the rabbi's body,
wrapped in a prayer shawl and placed on a stretcher, was laid under
an oak tree in the tiny playground of Tel Romeida.
	   Hundreds of mourners squeezed into the yard to listen to
eulogies, weep and say prayers. Later, dozens shouted ``revenge,''
and heckled a government minister who came to pay respects.
	   Israeli troops enforced a curfew on 30,000 Palestinians still
living there under Israeli rule, barring them from leaving their
homes while settlers carried Raanan's body through the deserted
city streets.
	   Raanan belonged to a dynasty of spiritual leaders of the Jewish
settlement movement, and there was concern that his brutal killing
could trigger revenge attacks.
	   Netanyahu contacted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with the
demand that Palestinian security forces arrest the assailant of
Thursday's killing who is believed to have fled to the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled for 17 months, with the sides now haggling over the scope
of a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank land.
	   The Palestinians accepted an American plan calling for Israel to
hand-over 13 percent of the territory, but Netanyahu initially
balked, saying the withdrawal would be harmful to Israel's
security.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Nassau Tribune has signed an
agreement with the Miami Herald to distribute the two newspapers
jointly in the Bahamas, the two newspapers announced Friday.
	   While the two papers will retain their separate identities, they
will be sold as a daily combination. Bahamas residents will get
local news from the Tribune but also benefit from the resources of
the Herald, the flagship of the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain, the
second largest in the United States, said the statement by Tribune
Publisher Eileen Carron.
	   ``It's exciting in this technological and satellite-driven age
that ideas that were once dreams are now reality,'' said Carron.
	   The Tribune will also begin offering home delivery of the Sunday
Herald at lower prices than its current price in the Bahamas.
	   Herald Publisher Alberto Ibarguen said the partnership would
allow the papers to provide more news, advertising and information
to Bahamas residents.
	   The partnership will begin Tuesday.

Quebec separatist leader says Supreme Court ruling boosts his

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Lucien Bouchard, the separatist premier of
Quebec, said Friday that a historic Supreme Court ruling on
secession will provide a crucial boost to his drive for
independence.
	   The court, as expected, ruled Thursday that Quebec had no right
to secede unilaterally, but the judges said the federal government
and Canada's other nine provinces would be obligated to negotiate
if a clear majority of Quebeckers supported secession in a
referendum.
	   ``The court has shaken the very foundation of the federalist
strategy, which was based on fear and the refusal to negotiate,''
Bouchard told a news conference in Quebec City.
	   He predicted the separatists, who narrowly lost a 1995
referendum on secession, would gain enough votes to win next time
because the ruling gave assurances there would be negotiations.
	   ``It eliminates the uncertainty that many Quebeckers felt,''
Bouchard said. ``Many more Quebeckers will conclude the time has
come once and for all to put aside our quarrels with Canada and
build a country called Quebec.''
	   In effect, Bouchard was declaring victory in a court case he had
rejected as an unwarranted intrusion into Quebec's internal
politics. He said the ruling had backfired on the federal
government and mocked Prime Minister Jean Chretien's key adviser on
the issue, Stephane Dion, as ``the Einstein of politics.''
	   Bouchard's Parti Quebecois will be seeking re-election in a
provincial vote expected either late this year or next spring.
Bouchard plans to call another referendum on secession if he wins a
second term, but he gave no details Friday about the timing.
	   In the provincial election, Bouchard faces a close race against
Jean Charest, a popular anti-separatist politician. Charest said
Friday he would try to focus his campaign on economic issues and
hope most voters would be wary of the uncertainty that would
accompany another referendum.
	   ``People are fed up with this issue,'' Charest said. ``The vast
majority of people in this province don't want another
referendum.''
	   The Supreme Court case was initiated by the federal government,
which sought legal backing for its claim that Quebec could not
simply split away from Canada on its own terms.
	   Chretien and his top aides welcomed the part of the judgment
that ruled out unilateral secession. But their muted reaction
suggested they realized the separatists were pleased by other parts
of the ruling.
	   Outside the political establishment, there was widespread praise
for the court's balanced judgment.
	   ``The winners were the citizens, and democracy,'' wrote Alain
Dubuc, chief editorial writer for the Montreal daily La Presse.
``The losers were those at the two extremes, those favoring
scenarios which are a recipe for chaos.''
	   Don Macpherson, columnist for the Montreal Gazette, called the
ruling ``a fair compromise and full of common sense, with something
for everybody, but with nobody getting everything they wanted.''
	   The high court decided to leave some of the thorniest issues to
the politicians. It did not specify what victory margin would
constitute a ``clear majority'' in a secession referendum, and it
did not grapple with the possibility that negotiations over
secession might reach an impasse.

South Africa: from champs to depths back to top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Shoved off their perch atop
rugby since winning the World Cup in 1995, South Africa's
Springboks have sprinted back to the top in little more than a
year.
	   In position to win the Southern Hemisphere's Tri-Nations title
with a victory Saturday against Australia in Johannesburg, the Boks
also seem poised to defend their world crown despite a period of
turmoil.
	   On the field and in the offices, the Springboks and South
African Rugby Football Union have changed dramatically since
President Nelson Mandela donned the famous green and yellow shirt
and hoisted the cup at Ellis Park.
	   The old guard is gone. After months of internal struggle that
involved a fight with Mandela and the country's sports authorities,
a black man is set to take over as the SAFRU president _ a
situation unthinkable under apartheid.
	   And after suffering its worst test defeat in their history last
year, a 55-35 embarrassment at the hands of New Zealand, the
Springboks are on the verge of sweeping both the All Blacks and
Australia, both at home and away, in less than a month-and-a-half.
	   Problems in South Africa started almost immediately after
winning the title in 1995.
	   The champion coach Kitch Christie, now deceased, resigned after
steering the side to 14 successive test wins, including six during
the World Cup.
	   It was his departure which triggered a self-destructive
landslide within South African rugby. Two coaches were appointed
and sacked post-Christie until Nick Mallet was appointed in
September last year.
	   Andres Markgraaff was the first to oversee the slid. His sides
lost four consecutive tests to New Zealand, including a home series
loss.
	   It was only the second time South Africa had lost a series at
home in more than a century of international competition. The first
was against the British Lions in 1974.
	   Markgraaf's reign was marked by the dismissal of World Cup
winning captain Francois Pienaar in 1996 _ a decision met with
public backlash and allegations that it was brought about by
Pienaar's close link with Mandela and the reconciliation process.
	   However, Markgraaf was forced to resign in February 1997 after
public disclosure of a taped telephone conversation in which he
made racist remarks.
	   That brought on Carel du Plessis, a former Springbok winger, as
coach.
	   His term started badly with the rout by New Zealand.
	   De Plessis also suffered the further ignominy of losing a series
on home soil, when an unlikely British Lions team upset the
Springboks by winning the 1997 series 2-1. South Africa's third
series defeat in history but its second in two seasons.
	   At that stage, defending their World Cup couldn't have seemed
more remote.
	   By the time an internal political struggle reached a boil
earlier this year with the National Sports Council, an umbrella
group of the country's governing sports bodies, threatening to call
for an international boycott of the team, Springbok fans were
fearing disaster.
	   Only one South African provincial side had finished in the top
eight in the annual Super 12 competition, and it, the Coastal
Sharks, were quickly eliminated in the semifinals.
	   The political struggle dealt with Mandela's approval of a
judicial commission to investigate charges of racism, nepotism and
mismanagement within SARFU.
	   Longtime union president Louis Luyt and SARFU sued, claiming
there was insufficient evidence to start a probe. The suit resulted
in dragging Mandela into court to testify, further enraging rugby's
critics.
	   Demands for Luyt and SARFU management to resign came in March
with noncompliance resulting in the call for a boycott. When Luyt
won his court challenge in April, the crisis deepened. Initially he
refused to step down but finally relented in May and the new SARFU
management apologized to Mandela to ease the crisis.
	   This past week, SARFU announced that former vice president Silas
Nkanunu, a black, was the only nominee for president and is
expected to be elected on Sept. 1.
	   After the Luyt resignation, the union and the team rallied
behind Mallet _ who was famous for giving the selectors in the old
regime a finger gesture after proving them wrong when he was dumped
from the national team in 1984 _ and the Springboks have been
unbeatable since.
	   Already this year, South Africa scored its first victory in New
Zealand in 17 years when it beat the All Blacks 13-3 in Wellington
on July 25. That was followed by a return victory in Durban when
the Springboks came back from 23-5 down to beat the All Blacks
24-23 last week.
	   Another victory against Australia Saturday, following its 14-13
triumph in Perth on July 18, will give South Africa the Tri-Nations
trophy. That comes on top of a record 96-13 win over Wales and
comprehensive victories over England and Ireland earlier in the
season.
	   What has led the onfield turnaround is a change in attitude as
well as a cleaning from the 1996-1997 era and rebuilding phase.
	   The team no longer seems content just to hammer away
relentlessly through its giant forwards and kick for territory
through the backs.
	   Instead, the Boks play an expansive game involving a slick
backline which prefers to run the ball than kick away possession.
	   The result is a winning formula. While the Springboks are still
champions at dominating through the forwards, the backs have proved
this season that they can match it with the best Australia and New
Zealand can produce.
	   As defending champions, South Africa is exempt from World Cup
qualifying. But as the qualifying gets down to its final stages, a
new attitude and regained form have many envisioning the Springboks
as the first team to win consecutive title.

Vos winner gets Feyenoord off to winning start

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Henk Vos' last-minute winner,
created by Russian Igor Korneev who coolly stepped over the ball,
gave Feyenoord a 2-1 victory at Fortuna Sittard Friday.
	   The game was the second of the Dutch season with Jeffrey Talan's
strike giving SC Heerenveen a 1-0 win over FC Twente in Thursday's
opener.
	   Feyenoord and Fortuna cancelled each other out in a dull first
half but both teams came out after the break to attack.
	   Korneev broke the deadlock in the 50th minute with a 15-meter
(yard) precision shot which sneaked a fraction inside the righthand
post.
	   Fortuna's top marksman Ronald Hamming, who netted 20 times last
season, opened his account with a brilliant 64th-minute equalizer.
	   But after Fortuna pressure, Feyenoord's Bonaventure Kalou broke
on the right and sent across a low center.
	   Korneev sold his dummy and Vos pounced at the far post to give
Feyenoord, a troubled side last season, a reassuring start to this
campaign.

Quebec separatist leader says Supreme Court ruling boosts his

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Lucien Bouchard, the separatist premier of
Quebec, said Friday that a historic Supreme Court ruling on
secession will provide a crucial boost to his drive for
independence.
	   The court, as expected, ruled Thursday that Quebec had no right
to secede unilaterally, but the judges said the federal government
and Canada's other nine provinces would be obligated to negotiate
if a clear majority of Quebeckers supported secession in a
referendum.
	   ``The court has shaken the very foundation of the federalist
strategy, which was based on fear and the refusal to negotiate,''
Bouchard told a news conference in Quebec City.
	   He predicted the separatists, who narrowly lost a 1995
referendum on secession, would gain enough votes to win next time
because the ruling gave assurances there would be negotiations.
	   ``It eliminates the uncertainty that many Quebeckers felt,''
Bouchard said. ``Many more Quebeckers will conclude the time has
come once and for all to put aside our quarrels with Canada and
build a country called Quebec.''
	   In effect, Bouchard was declaring victory in a court case he had
rejected as an unwarranted intrusion into Quebec's internal
politics. He said the ruling had backfired on the federal
government and mocked Prime Minister Jean Chretien's key adviser on
the issue, Stephane Dion, as ``the Einstein of politics.''
	   Chretien, at news conference later Friday, said he was not
surprised that the separatists were putting a positive spin on the
ruling. But he said federal officials, who initiated the case,
achieved their goal of showing that secession would not be a simple
process.
	   ``The court has confirmed just how difficult it will be to break
up one of the most successful countries in the world,'' Chretien
said. '' Canada is not a prison... but we have established a
barrier you have to go over.''
	   He also said secession would have to be approved by more than
just a simple majority, putting him at odds with separatists who
say 50 percent plus one vote would be sufficient.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians chanted threats
against U.S. President Bill Clinton and burned American flags at a
West Bank protest rally Friday against air strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``America is the first terrorist state in the world,'' prayer
leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000 people outside a Nablus,
West Bank mosque after Friday noon prayers. ``America is an enemy
of the Muslims.''
	   The Palestinian Authority condemned the U.S. missile strikes,
saying the attacks would bring more turmoil to the Middle East.
	   ``I believe that this act will bring the world back to the rule
of the jungle,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Cabinet. ``As Palestinians we know what it means to
have solutions imposed by the use of force.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned Clinton to
convey his support for Thursday's attack against suspected terror
bases and infrastructure used by Islamic militants.
	   An Israeli newspaper said Friday that in the two weeks ahead of
the air strikes, Israeli intelligence agents provided their U.S.
counterparts with considerable information on Islamic militant
groups.
	   Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether Israel helped the
United States select the targets in Thursday's air raids which came
in retaliation for the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa earlier
this month.
	   ``The Americans do not need our operational help,'' Netanyahu
said. ``As for coordination, we are partners in the struggle ...
against those who blow up embassies, children, women, old people,
innocent civilians.'' Netanyahu said Israel cooperated with
``American and other intelligence services.''
	   Netanyahu said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried
to contact him just before the air strikes were launched,
presumably to inform him of the operation ahead of time.
	   Netanyahu, who was vacationing in northern Israel on Thursday,
said he was only available on a cellular phone at the time and that
it was decided to hold off on the conversation until he could reach
a more secure phone line.
	   ``Later, I was briefed by the secretary of state (Madeleine
Albright) on the details, or to be more exact on the principles
which guided the Americans in their action,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``Of course, these are principles known to Israel. It was Israel
that generally charted the course in the struggle against
terrorism,'' he said.
	   The Haaretz daily said that in the past two weeks, Israel gave
the United States considerable information about the connections of
Saudi multi-millionaire Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of
the embassy bombings, to Islamic militant groups.

Vos winner gets Feyenoord off to winning start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Henk Vos' last-minute winner,
created by Russian Igor Korneev who coolly stepped over the ball,
gave Feyenoord a 2-1 victory at Fortuna Sittard Friday.
	   The game was the second of the Dutch season with Jeffrey Talan's
strike giving SC Heerenveen a 1-0 win over FC Twente in Thursday's
opener.
	   Feyenoord and Fortuna cancelled each other out in a dull first
half but both teams came out after the break to attack.
	   Korneev broke the deadlock in the 50th minute with a 15-meter
(yard) precision shot which sneaked a fraction inside the righthand
post.
	   Fortuna's top marksman Ronald Hamming, who netted 20 times last
season, opened his account with a brilliant 64th-minute equalizer.
	   But after Fortuna pressure, Feyenoord's Bonaventure Kalou broke
on the right and sent across a low center.
	   Korneev sold his dummy and Vos pounced at the far post to give
Feyenoord, a troubled side last season, a reassuring start to this
campaign.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The threat of a full-scale war loomed
Friday in sub-Saharan Africa, with countries from the eastern Great
Lakes region lining up against several of embattled Congo's
southern neighbors.
	   Zimbabwe began deploying troops in support of President Laurent
Kabila, while Rwanda in the east called for a cease-fire, but
warned it would intervene unless the Zimbabweans withdrew.
	   Angolan soldiers have also begun arriving in Kinshasa to help
Kabila, Mozambican radio reported.
	   Spanning from central to eastern and southern Africa, vast and
troubled Congo appears to be threatening the stability of an
already troubled region.
	   Kinshasa, struggling through power cuts and dwindling food
stocks, was on a war footing, with hundreds of protesters
converging on the French Embassy and state radio blasting Rwanda
and the West for meddling in Congo's internal affairs.
	   ``We have our allies who believe we must change the mentality of
Rwanda,'' Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi said in a telephone
interview. ``If Rwanda does not withdraw we risk a war of a hundred
years.''
	   Kabila says Rwanda and Uganda are behind a rebel movement that
began earlier this month and threatens to march all the way to the
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Earlier this week, Information Minister Didier Mumengi said
Uganda had sent a column of troops across its border into Congo.
Mumengi previously accused Uganda of sending tanks and troops into
Congo.
	   Both countries deny the charges, but Rwanda warned it would
intervene to protect its borders if other nations send troops to
prop up Kabila.
	   Mumengi visited neighboring Republic of Congo's capital of
Brazzaville on Friday in a possible diplomatic bid to repair
fragile ties between the two countries and push for Republic of
Congo's neutrality in the war.
	   Kabila's government gave aid to Republic of Congo's former
leader Pascal Lissouba in that country's civil war last year that
ended in October with Lissouba's archrival Denis Sassou-Nguesso
rising to the presidency.
	   Rebels in Congo's west have marched to the strategic town of
Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Kinshasa
possibly further. Rwandan radio reported the rebels had captured
the town and sent some troops as near as 100 kilometers (60 miles)
from the capital.
	   Those same forces, with important help from Rwanda and Uganda,
last year helped Kabila oust longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko. They have since grown disenchanted with the new government,
while Rwanda has become increasingly concerned that Kabila has done
little to secure the turbulent eastern border region.
	   ``Rwanda reserves the right to get involved and to assist the
Congolese people in their search for lasting solution in whatever
manner it deems appropriate,'' said a statement released in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   South Africa hastily called for weekend peace talks to ward off
an expanded conflict that could pit troops from several countries
battling for and against Kabila.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela plans to host the talks
between the presidents of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
	   ``We are taking the initiative to avoid a bloodbath,'' spokesman
Parks Mankahlana told The Associated Press. ``It's in that context
that we view the weekend discussions in a very, very serious
light.''
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe have all
agreed in principle to attend the peace summit on Saturday in
Pretoria, the South African capital, Mankahlana said.
	   He declined to comment on whether the rebels themselves were
invited.
	   An offer earlier this week by the rebels to negotiate a
cease-fire with Kabila was dismissed by the government, which says
it will only talk directly with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The new peace effort came as military technicians and advisers
from Zimbabwe started to arrive in Congo's capital. Rwandan state
radio reported the new Zimbabwean group included between 150 and
200 soldiers, although this could not be independently confirmed.

medium-sized companies will reflect the diversity of South Africa's
population under legislation passed Friday by the National
Assembly.
	   A tumultuous debate preceding the vote underscored the

privileges enjoyed under apartheid clashing with aspirations of
blacks who, four years after the end of white rule, represent a

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Seeking strength
through unity, including their renewed ties with Cuba's Fidel
Castro, leaders from 16 Caribbean nations launched talks Friday to
bolster their struggling economies.
	   At stake in the two-day Santo Domingo summit: How small
Caribbean nations can avoid being swamped in negotiations to create
a Free Trade Area of the Americas stretching from Canada to
Argentina.
	   One step will be Saturday's signing of a trade pact between the
15-nation Caribbean Community common market and the Dominican
Republic, which last year reached a similar accord with Central
American nations.
	   ``Globalization is inevitable,'' Castro told the meeting, and
``... the Caribbean confronts the serious danger of a growing
marginalization.''
	   One weapon to fight it, he suggested, might be tourism.
	   ``Tourism ... could well become the leading engine of Caribbean
integration, business growth, investment,'' Castro said.
	   He added that Caribbean nations should ``not be competitors but
rather partners'' in developing tourism _ an apparent response to
some fears that a revitalized Cuba would enjoy a tourist boom at
the expense of other islands.
	   Caribbean leaders are backing Cuba's request to join the Lome
Convention, hoping Castro will add muscle at upcoming negotiations
to renew the agreement under which the European Union gives dlrs 18
billion worth of preferential trade tariffs and aid to 71 former
colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
	   The pact comes up for renewal in 2000, while hemispheric leaders
have set a 2005 target date for free trade in the Americas.
	   ``We are still not in a position to make our economies
resilient,'' warned Suriname's president, Jules Wijdenbosch.

Britons 1-2-3 in 200, sweep even without Christie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS throughout; adds new quotes; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Britain proved Friday it still owns
European sprinting, even without retired Linford Christie.
	   Iwan Thomas won the 400 and Doug Walker led a 1-2-3 finish in
the 200 at the European Championships, as they joined fellow
countryman Darren Campbell, who won gold Wednesday in the 100.
	   Even if there were no Americans or Africans around to beat, it
was a night to wave the Union Jack. But the times were pedestrian
with Thomas winning in 44.52 and Walker in 20.53.
	   Led by Christie in 1990, Britain also swept the sprints and then
won two of the three in '94.
	   For Thomas, it was only his second victory this season over
teammate Mark Richardson, who took bronze behind Poland's Robert
Mackowiak.
	   ``A lot of people have doubted me this year,'' said Thomas,
after slicing .07 off the championship record set 12 years ago by
fellow Briton Roger Black, who failed to make this Euro team.
	   `All I have heard is Mark this, Mark that. I just want to thank
everyone who didn't doubt my ability,'' Thomas said.
	   For Walker in the 200, there was no pain in a tender knee as he
pushed Doug Turner to silver (20.63) and Julian Golding to bronze
(20.72).
	   Troy Douglas of the Netherlands, who also clocked 20.72, was
given fourth in a photo-finish and then disqualified for apparently
swearing at officials for not giving him third.
	   ``You don't get any pain if you win,'' Walker said. ``But if I'd
been beaten, I'm sure my knee would have been hurting.''
	   ``This is great, I have finally won something big,'' he added.
``I got what I came to Budapest for, so that's good.''
	   Germany and Poland matched Britain's two golds, but probably had
even more impressive numbers.
	   Germany's 26-year-old Grit Breuer, coming off a doping ban that
ended three years ago, won the 400 in 49.93, slightly off her world
No. 2 time this season (49.51). It was her first individual gold in
a major competition, matching a relay gold in last year's worlds.
	   ``I always thought the gold would be mine today,'' Breuer said.
``The last 50 meters I found very hard to run because I was quite
tired. I was confident that I would hold on for the gold, although
I did have a few doubts.''
	   In an upset, teammate Franka Dietzsch won the discus with a
throw of 67.49 meters, pushing world No. 1 this season Natalya
Sadova of Russia to silver (66.94) and world No. 2 Nicoleta Grasu
of Romania to bronze (65.94).
	   Dietzsch's throw was No. 3 in the world this season and more
than a meter over her previous best this season.
	   And Polish high jumper Artur Partyka _ after silver medals in
the last Europeans, Olympics and worlds _ got his gold with a jump
of 2.34, nipping Britain's Dalton Grant with the same height.
	   ``It was a great competition, but it would be since it's my
first big-time gold,'' Partyka said. ``I always seem to medal but
not get the gold. Now all that's changed.''
	   Poland's other gold came from Robert Korzieniowski, clocking 3
hours 43 minutes 51 seconds in the 50-kilometer walk.
	   Russia's Irina Privalova kept her European 200 title, rebounding
from leg surgery to take win in 22.62, pushing world champion
Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine to silver (22.74).
	   ``This is amazing,'' said Privalova, who was second in the 100
Wednesday to France's Christine Arron. ``Coming back from injury
and an operation, this is a dream come true.''
	   In the other two medal events, Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine
took the first-ever Euro pole vault (4.31) and Ionela Tirlea of
Romania won the 400-meter hurdles (53.27), upsetting European No. 1
Tatyana Tereshchuk of Ukraine (54.07), who took silver.
	   On the medal table, Russia leads with four golds and 13 overall.
Germany, Britain, Ukraine and Poland have three golds apiece.

<SLUG> Crude tumbles anew as world remains awash in oil,0463 </SLUG>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Crude oil futures tumbled Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations U.S. attacks on targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan would not impede the flow of oil from the
Middle East, leaving the world awash in ample supplies.
	   On other markets, grains, soybeans and meat and livestock also
fell sharply amid general weakness in U.S. commodities prices.
	   Crude oil gave back gains made a day earlier as market
participants were digesting news of missile attacks on suspected
terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The Clinton administration said the attacks were against assets
of Osama bin Laden, a Saudi multimillionaire accused of
masterminding embassy bombings in Africa.
	   On Friday, market participants shrugged off ideas the U.S.
missile strikes could lead to a disrupted flow of oil from Saudi
Arabia and elsewhere.
	   Instead, investors again focused on weak fundamentals _ too much
supply and too little demand. American oil inventories remain at
their highest since 1983 despite world oil producers' attempts to
cut daily output and reduce prices, which hover near 10-year lows.
	   Crude for October delivery fell 43 cents to dlrs 13.37 a barrel;
September heating oil fell 1.02 cents to 34.20 cents a gallon;
September unleaded gasoline fell .78 cent to 40.91 cents a gallon;
September natural gas fell 0.8 cent to dlrs 1.945 for each 1,000
cubic feet.
	   Corn futures plummeted to their lowest level in six years on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat and soybeans also fell, amid
expectations for bumper fall harvests at a time when the world
economic picture appears to be getting gloomier.
	   Soybean, wheat and corn futures all were hurt by reports from
Midwestern crop tours, which showed nearly ideal summer growing
weather has boosted yields on the plants, perhaps increasing the
size of harvests already expected to be large.
	   With good rainfall expected this weekend in Illinois, Indiana
and Iowa, market participants were gloomy about prospects for
selling the crop and noted that grain elevators already were having
trouble storing winter wheat crops.
	   Expectations for a record soybean crop, the second-largest corn
crop on record and a large spring wheat harvest also led investors
to ignore continued reports of flooding in Chinese growing regions,
which washed out the competing crops and could lead to greater U.S.
exports.
	   Prices also were hurt by the fall in the Dow Jones industrial
average, which reinforced concerns the world may be sliding into a
recession which would sharply reduce purchases of U.S. commodities.

opening round of the dlrs 1 million senior tournament.
	   Gary Player and Lee Trevino led a group of six at 68, while
Raymond Floyd was the top name among nine players another stroke
back.
	   Hall was playing in just his second Senior PGA Tour event when
he had a 66 and 68 to open the tournament last year only to fall
out of the top 10 with a final-round 74.
	   ``I've played four rounds here,'' the 51-year-old Hall said.
``One wasn't very good and three were very good.''
	   The latest round saw him make seven birdies on the 6,842-yard
(6,226-meter) Meadow Brook Club, four on putts of 15 feet (4 1/2
meter) or more, including a 15-footer (4.5-meter) for a 2 on the
167-yard (152-meter) 18th. He capped a run of three straight
birdies with a tap-in two-putt from 100 feet (30 meters) on No. 10.
	   ``These are 18 perfect greens, even better than last year,''
said Hall, who was a sales manager for an appliance company in
North Carolina before turning pro in 1994 when he headed for the
Asian Tour. ``I didn't play well there, barely won enough money to
pay the bills, but I did learn a little more patience.''
	   The others at 68 were Tom Shaw, J.C. Snead, Ed Dougherty and
Jose Maria Canizares.
	   Joining Floyd at three under were Frank Conner, Larry Ziegler,
Dale Douglass, Bruce Summerhays, Tom Wargo, Joe Inman, John
Mahaffey and Fred Gibson.
	   George Archer, a three-time champion in this event and the
winner at last week's First of America Classic, had a 71, two shots
better than defending Northville champion Dana Quigley.
	   Player and Shaw each had an eagle Friday.
	   ``I'm very pleased with the way I played, especially since I
started with three-putt bogey on 1,'' Player said, referring to the
opening par-5. ``It's not easy to play well when you're flying all
over like I am but I am very pleased with the way I'm playing tee
to green.''
	   Shaw had a 4-under 32 on the back nine, including consecutive
birdies from 54 feet on No. 13 and 3 feet on the 14th.
	   ``I've been playing well all year just not scoring well but the
last six weeks things have been getting better because I started
putting better and driving the ball in the fairway,'' Shaw said.
``The back nine was an example of that. I hit every fairway and
green and had an opportunity to make birdies.''
	   Hall had two top 10 finishes in eight events as a senior rookie
last year and is 35th on the current money list with dlrs 331,728
in 16 events.
	   ``I had a few close calls last year and there have been more
opportunities to win,'' he said. ``I believe that when it's my time
to win it will be my time, but I also believe that you have to be
there several times before it's going to happen.''

Bandit-turned politician hiding to evade arrest : police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAJUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A bandit leader-turned politician who once
struck terror in northern India at the head of an armed gang has
gone into hiding to evade arrest on charges of mass murder,
abduction and robbery, police said Friday.
	   Phoolan Devi was untraceable when a police team from Kanpur, an
industrial town in the northern Uttar Pradesh state, Friday raided
her residence and several other places in New Delhi, 500 kilometers
(310 miles) away.
	   A court trying 25 cases against her _ all of them part of a
staggered 15-year-old trial _ ordered police on Wednesday to arrest
and produce her in court Sept. 4.
	   The cases have been caught in legal wrangles for years and Devi
has moved the Supreme Court on several cases, further stretching
the trial.
	   Devi belongs to the low-caste Mallah community of boatpeople.
The cases against her include the 1981 massacre of 21 men, 18 of
them from the warrior caste of Thakurs, allegedly sprayed with
bullets at close range in Behmai village in northern India.
	   She allegedly killed the men to avenge her alleged rape by them
in 1980. Devi denies the charge. Devi's alleged mass rape and the
massacre are shrouded in doubt with survivors of the massacre and
the villagers of Behmai denying the rape charge.
	   A senior intelligence official said his department had reports
that Devi had fled to the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh,
where an 1983 understanding with the provincial government provides
her immunity from arrest. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Devi was in prison for 11 years without charges after she
surrendered with her gang in 1983 before the top elected official
of Madhya Pradesh in central India in an amnesty deal.
	   She was released on parole in 1994. Soon after, she joined a
socialist political party and became a lawmaker in 1996. She lost
in the 1997 mid-term election, forced by the dissolution of
parliament.
	   ``Phoolan has evaded arrest and defied the law too many times
after her release,'' said Nandlal Jaiswal, counsel for the widows
of the 21 men killed in Behmai village. ``A mass murderer like her
cannot be let off so lightly, it will only make a mockery of the
law.''
	   Devi's husband Umed Singh confirmed in New Delhi that his wife
was in Madhya Pradesh, but claimed she was visiting the state on
work. He refused to say which city she had traveled to.
	   Devi gained worldwide fame with the release of ``Bandit Queen,''
a 1993 movie about her life as leader of a band of feared bandits
in the ravines of northern India.

Pamic carries Rostock to draw against Wolfsburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Croatian striker Igor Pamic put on a spectacular
performance Friday in the Bundesliga, carrying Hansa Rostock to a
3-3 draw against VfL Wolfsburg by connecting twice and creating the
third score.
	   Newly-promoted FC Nuremberg, behind two goals by Czech
international Pavel Kuka, also took a temporary lead in the
Bundesliga table with four points by edging Werder Bremen 3-2.
	   Wolfsburg was unable to control Pamic until the shaven-headed
striker was removed 15 minutes before the whistle to frenetic
applause from 15,000 spectators in Rostock's home opener.
	   The Rostock crowd favorite, nicknamed ``Tyson'' for the fierce
way he plays, knocked in a running 22nd minute header and scored
again in the 59th. He also forced Marijan Kovacevic's own goal in
the 24th.
	   The Croatian's short-range shot blasted against the post, then
landed in the net after the Wolfsburg player's desperate attempt to
clear with his leg backfired.
	   Andre Breitenreiter equalized for Wolfsburg in the 85th minute,
spoiling the strong performance by Rostock, the only side from East
Germany playing in the Bundesliga.
	   U.S. international Claudio Reyna was the only Wolfsburg player
that turned in a good match, but the team victimized Rostock with
Kovacevic's 31st minute penalty conversation and Andrzei
Juskoviak's goal's two minutes later.
	   Team captain Michael Wiesinger assisted on all three Nuremberg
goals in its victory. Kuka connected in the 19th and 41st minute
and Sascha Ciric shot the gamewinner in the 62nd.
	   While Nuremberg confused the defenders with fast combination
play, a flat Bremen eked out its goals on Lodi Roembiak's
22nd-minute penalty conversion and Jens Todt's free kick.

UN, Iraq discuss cuts in `oil-for-food' aid distribution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations and Iraq have begun
discussing cuts in Baghdad's plan to distribute food and medicine
to needy Iraqis because revenues from oil sales are coming up less
than expected, U.N. officials said Friday.
	   Next week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to deliver
his mid-term update on the so-called oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to circumvent U.N. sanctions and sell its oil to buy
humanitarian goods for its 22 million people.
	   The report notes that oil-for-food revenues over the last three
months will fall short of expectations and that Baghdad must begin
work on prioritizing aid requests, said a U.N. source familiar with
the data of the report.
	   The United Nations had expected the shortfall because of current
low oil prices and known production limits of Iraq's oil
infrastructure.
	   In a letter to the U.N. chief made public Friday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Said al-Sahaf blamed the United States and Britain for the
shortfall in revenues, saying the two countries were delaying
approval of contracts.
	   The delays will force Iraq to reduce the quantities of exports
already agreed to in some oil contracts, al-Sahaf wrote. ``It will
also have an adverse impact on the quantities of humanitarian goods
and supplies for which contracts have already been concluded,'' he
said.
	   U.N. officials are establishing its priorities in the three
northern governates of Iraq where the central government's control
is limited.
	   ``There have been discussions on it,'' said the U.N. official.
``There is certainly an awareness on the Iraqi side of a need to
prioritize.''
	   While it's up to Baghdad to decide where and how deeply to cut
the aid plan, diplomats said they will favor keeping food, medical
supplies, and spare parts for Iraq's oil sector. The council
recently authorized the delivery of dlrs 300 million in spare
pipeline parts to help Iraq repair its oil infrastructure and boost
oil revenues.
	   The oil-for-food program was established in 1996 to help provide
for Iraqis suffering under U.N. sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Concerned that Iraqis were still suffering despite the program,
the Security Council in February raised the maximum amount of oil
Iraq can sell over six months from dlrs 2 billion dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   Nevertheless, Iraq is on course to raise only dlrs 3 billion
through oil sales in the six months beginning May 30, al-Sahaf
wrote. Since 34 cents of every oil-for-food dollar go for Gulf War
reparations and administrative costs, only dlrs 2 billion is
expected to be available for humanitarian aid.
	   Baghdad has characterized oil-for-food as a tool to justify what
it considers unjust sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding
committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in
Khartoum.
	   The foreign minister spoke to reporters after arriving in
Baghdad a day after U.S. missiles devastated a factory in the
Sudanese capital. The United States said the plant produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said it produced
pharmaceutical products.
	   ``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee
from the American administration to come and freely investigate
whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical
(weapons),'' Ismail said.
	   Such a committee could also check whether the factory was owned
by Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based extremist whom the
Americans have blamed for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7, the foreign minister said.
	   If the Americans proved the factory was producing chemical
agents, ``we will accept the attempt (attack),'' Ismail added.
	   Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north
Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were
injured.
	   The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin
Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of
aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   ``They (the Americans) are behaving like international
mercenaries.''
	   Ismail, who is making a three-day visit to Iraq, crossed into
the country from Jordan. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ban flights to and from Iraq.

On Arab streets, Clinton-Lewinsky affair seen behind attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Syrian reaction graf 7 &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Bombings, Sudan-US
 &UR; By G.G. LaBELLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a
battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   Despite anger over the U.S. attacks, there were few large
protests like those often organized by Arab states. Egypt, which
accused Sudan of harboring the radicals who unsuccessfully tried to
kill President Hosni Mubarak in 1995, issued a bland statement
calling for a meeting on international terrorism.
	   In Syria, a government official said ``these acts can't be
justified because they violate the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of other states and endanger the innocent civilians and
their properties,'' the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians chanted threats
against Clinton and burned American flags. ``America is the enemy
of the Muslims,'' prayer leader Sheik Hamed Bitawi told about 2,000
people outside a Nablus mosque.
	   The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle
East was predictable, and its allies mostly remained silent.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip
operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli,
thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.''
	   The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab
Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of
terrorist sponsoring states.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run
radio.
	   In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme
was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said
that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world
after Clinton has discovered Osama bin Laden's dishdasha (Arab
robe).''
	   Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain,
25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American
missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's
wrongdoings.''
	   Another Saudi, Seneitan Hazzam, agreed and added ``somehow,
somewhere they (Americans) will pay the price.''
	   But asked if they sympathized with bin Laden, both men said
``he's no better.''
	   In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the
American action ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless action.
... This violence will only beget more violence.''
	   Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand,
was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United
States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
	   More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper
from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.
	   ``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never
be clean,'' he said. ``Clinton and the U.S have for years been
killing indiscriminately, so this is not new. But it certainly
won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the man whose Afghan
base the United States set out to destroy, is ready for war with
Washington, according to a statement received by a Pakistani
newspaper Friday.
	   ``The war has just started. The Americans should wait for the
answer,'' the respected national newspaper The News quoted a
statement from a bin Laden spokesperson as saying.
	   The threats followed Thursday's U.S. missile attacks against a
base linked to bin Laden in Afghanistan and on a factory in Sudan.
The United States suspects bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, was
connected with the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 257 people.
	   The News said its reporter in the border city of Peshawar
received a satellite telephone call Friday from Ayamn al-Zawahri,
leader of the militant Egyptian group that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Al-Zawahri, known to be a bin Laden
confidant, said he was with the terrorist leader in Afghanistan.
	   The statement was read by Al-Zawahri, who the newspaper has said
often acts as bin Laden's spokesman because of his command of
English.
	   Bin Laden rarely speaks to reporters. Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers have said he was not injured in the U.S. attacks.
	   In London, a man claiming to be a bin Laden spokesman issued a
similar warning in a call Friday to the Arabic-language Al-Quds
Al-Arabi newspaper.
	   The newspaper's editor, Abdel Bari-Atwan said a man who
identified himself only as Dr. Abu Haqu phoned from Afghanistan
with a message for U.S. President Bill Clinton, vowing to ``answer
his raids with deeds, not words.''
	   Abu Haqu said six followers of bin Laden _ two Egyptians, three
Yemenis and a Saudi, had been killed in the raid. In addition, he
said seven Pakistanis and 15 Afghans who Abu Haqu claimed were not
bin Laden followers died in the attack.
	   He did not explain why they were at the complex.
	   Bari-Atwan said a trusted journalistic source had assured him
that Abu Haqu was a spokesman for bin Laden.

Tyson licensing hearing delayed until Sept. 19
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson will have to wait even longer to
find out if Nevada will let him box again.
	   Tyson's hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission was moved
back Friday to Sept. 19 so that it will not interfere with cancer
treatments that commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem is undergoing.
	   The hearing had been set for Sept. 9, but commission executive
director Marc Ratner said Friday that Ghanem asked that it be
delayed while he undergoes further treatment.
	   ``Dr. Ghanem's medical treatment would preclude him from being
able to attend Sept. 9,'' Ratner said.
	   Ratner said he sent a letter to Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel,
advising him of the delay.
	   The hearing will be held the morning after the Sept. 18 rematch
between Oscar De La Hoya and Julio Cesar Chavez in Las Vegas.
Commission members have said they expect Tyson to appear in person
to plead his case.
	   Tyson will learn his fate on the same day as the hearing,
commissioners have said, promising no delays.
	   Tyson was banned by the commission in July 1997 after biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight championship
fight.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada on July 9,
but bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in
New Jersey. On the eve of that licensing decision, he abruptly
withdrew the application in New Jersey and said he would seek
licensing in Nevada.
	   Nevada boxing regulators expected all along that Tyson would
reapply for his license in Nevada after a mandatory one-year wait.
	   Asking New Jersey for the license was seen as a calculated
gamble by Finkel. The gamble didn't appear to be paying off, as
political pressure from inside and outside the state grew in the
days before the licensing decision was to have been made.
	   Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3 million for
biting Holyfield's ears during the third round of their June 28,
1997 rematch for the heavyweight title.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding
committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in
Khartoum.
	   The foreign minister spoke to reporters after arriving in
Baghdad a day after U.S. missiles devastated a factory in the
Sudanese capital. The United States said the plant produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said it produced
pharmaceutical products.
	   ``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee
from the American administration to come and freely investigate
whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical
(weapons),'' Ismail said.
	   Such a committee could also check whether the factory was owned
by Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based extremist whom the
Americans have blamed for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7, the foreign minister said.
	   If the Americans proved the factory was producing chemical
agents, ``we will accept the attempt (attack),'' Ismail added.
	   The foreign minister said Sudan was also inviting the U.N.
Security Council to send a committee to investigate the plant.
	   Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north
Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were
injured.
	   The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin
Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of
aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   ``They (the Americans) are behaving like international
mercenaries.''
	   Ismail, who is making a three-day visit to Iraq, crossed into
the country from Jordan. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ban flights to and from Iraq.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a
battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   Despite anger over the U.S. attacks, there were few large
protests like those often organized by Arab states. Egypt, which
accused Sudan of harboring the radicals who unsuccessfully tried to
kill President Hosni Mubarak in 1995, issued a bland statement
calling for a meeting on international terrorism.
	   In Syria, a government official said ``these acts can't be
justified because they violate the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of other states and endanger the innocent civilians and
their properties,'' the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic advanced to the
semifinals of the Pilot Pen tennis tournament Friday with a quick
straight-set victory over the player who eliminated the event's top
seed the day before.
	   Ivanisevic, the No. 8 seed, needed 55 minutes to beat Leander
Paes 6-2, 6-4.
	   Paes, a doubles' specialist ranked 100th in singles, defeated
top-seeded Pete Sampras in straight sets Thursday but said he
couldn't handle Ivanisevic's serve.
	   ``I could not really get into a groove of chipping and charging
and playing my style of tennis,'' said Paes, the only unseeded
player to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Ivanisevic never was in danger of being broken. He said he
thought it was difficult for Paes to maintain his intensity after
the win over Sampras.
	   It ``is tough to keep this momentum going, especially with the
way I play. You know, if I serve good, I don't give him a lot of
free points. He was trying to hit winners, but those were going
everywhere,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Ivanisevic will play defending champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
semifinals. Kafelnikov, the No. 5 seed, defeated No. 13 seed Bohdan
Ulihrach, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Kafelnikov is making a bid to be the tournament's first
back-to-back victor since Jimmy Connors in 1975 and 1976.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera defeated Guillaume Raoux 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Raoux had knocked off defending U.S. Open champ Patrick Rafter, the
tournament's No. 2 seed, on Thursday.
	   Kucera plays in the semifinals against the winner of the night
match between No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek and No. 6 seed Tim
Henman.
	   A day after ousting Rafter, the third-ranked player in the
world, Raoux's powerful play was not nearly as effective.
	   The ferocious forehands and powerful backhands that picked deep
corners and hugged baselines for the 6-1 win in the first set
started missing wide after Kucera adjusted by hitting deeper to
snarl the Frenchman's baseline game.
	   ``He started to play deeper and stronger,'' said Raoux, who is
ranked No. 48 in the world and No. 16 in the tournament. ``You have
to be 100 percent, even Sampras has to be 100 percent to beat this
guy.''
	   Helped by 10 aces, it was Kucera's fifth straight win over
Raoux.
	   ``If I get good into the rhythm, I can beat him,'' said Kucera,
who made the semifinals of the Australian Open this year with a win
over Sampras.

Novotna creeps toward another title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ While the fans had their eyes fixed on the new
generation of women tennis players Friday, veteran Jana Novotna
moved into the semifinals of the du Maurier Open.
	   Novotna, 29, won her 19th consecutive match 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 over
19-year-old upstart Magui Serna of Spain and now is two victories
shy of a fourth straight tourament title on the WTA Tour.
	   ``As always, everybody else is getting all the attention and I
am quietly progressing in the tournament,'' said Novotna, a lanky
right-hander from the Czech Republic. ``That's the way I like it.''
	   The crowd poured into court No. 1 to watch teen-ager Anna
Kournikova of Russia lose a rain-delayed third-round match to
Spain's Conchita Martinez 6-0, 6-3 while Novotna was finishing off
Serna on Centre Court.
	   An all-Spanish Martinez vs. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario quarterfinal
scheduled for later Friday was to determine Novotna's opponent for
Saturday's semifinals.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland reached the semifinals
with a 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-4 victory over Sandrine Testud of France
and next will play the winner of the Monica Seles-Anke Huber match.
	   Novotna returned to action this week from a four-week break
after winning at Eastbourne, Wimbledon (her first Grand Slam title)
and Prague _ the longest winning run on the tour this year.
	   She has hardly looked rusty, even though Serna, a left-hander
ranked 26th in the world who was coming off an upset of two-time
champion Steffi Graf of Germany, gave Novotna fits for one set.
	   ``She played incredible tennis against Steffi and I knew she was
really confident,'' Novotna said. ``She was serving really well _
acing me and winning her service games quite easily.
	   ``But I knew that usually you will get a chance in a match like
this and I did in the second set. I started to play better tennis
with more variety and I won 11 games in a row.''
	   Serna broke a string on her racket in the second set and never
looked comfortable with her backup weapon.
	   ``I saw her complaining about it and I really felt her balls
started to be a little shorter,'' Novotna said. ``This could have
been a turning point, but things like this happen in every match
and you have to take advantage of it.''
	   Novotna, like Graf and Kournikova, has entered the U.S.
Hardcourt Championships in New Haven, Conn., next week, the last
tuneup before the U.S. Open in New York, the final grand slam event
of the year.
	   ``I'm very impressed by the way I have started to play,''
Novotna said. ``I think as the tournament goes on and the more
matches I play, I will get the feeling again.
	   ``I'm moving well and it feels good.''
	   Hingis, 17, may have expected an easy match because Testud was
in her second match of the day after finishing a rain-delayed 7-6
(7-4), 4-6, 6-1 victory over ninth-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania
in the morning.
	   ``I thought she might be a little tired in the third set, but
she could still run and we had some great rallies,'' said Hingis,
who is seeking her first victory since the Italian Open in May.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Despite efforts to remove its cargo
and free it, a barge that grounded Tuesday remained stuck in the
mouth of San Juan Bay on Friday.
	   Attempts to unload the barge's cargo of grain so it can be freed
have forced the U.S. Coast Guard to occasionally close the route
into the bay, the Caribbean's busiest port.
	   The Coast Guard said Friday that 4.5 tons of the 17 tons of
grain aboard the 485-foot (145-meter) barge had been removed.
Officials said the operation would probably take four more days.
	   The same barge also grounded in the bay in May of 1996 and May
of 1997, the Coast Guard reported.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to
consider authorizing a U.N. investigation into the U.S. airstrikes
on a Khartoum factory, Sudan's ambassador said Friday, calling the
attack a breach of international law.
	   Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa said the letter, which was
delivered Friday afternoon to council President Danilo Turk of
Slovenia, would lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's
airstrikes were a breach of the U.N. charter and a violation of its
sovereignty.

Cubs rally past Giants 6-5; Sosa hits 49th home run

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 49th home run Friday and the
Chicago Cubs rallied for two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning
to beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5.
	   Trailing 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth, Sosa singled with one
out off Robb Nen (7-4) and Mark Grace walked. Henry Rodriguez then
lofted a broken bat single to right to drive in Sosa and tie the
game.
	   Jose Hernandez singled down the right-field line over a drawn in
infield as Nen blew his fourth save in 35 opportunities. Felix
Heredia (1-3) got two outs for the victory.
	   Sosa moved within two of Mark McGwire's major league home run
lead. His 49 homers ties Andrew Dawson for second most in club
history, a mark Dawson set in 1987. The club and National League
record is 56 set by Hack Wilson in 1930. Entering the game, the
Cubs trailed the Mets by a half-game in the NL wild card race. The
Giants now trail Chicago by two games.

Pippen says he and Jordan probably not returning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Scottie Pippen said Friday he doesn't expect to
return to the Chicago Bulls once the National Basketball
Association lockout ends and he doesn't think Michael Jordan, his
sidekick on six championship teams, will either.
	   Pippen's comments were his first since undergoing surgery for
two herniated discs last month.
	   ``I'm pretty sure Michael's not coming back,'' Pippen said
during a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field. He said he talked
recently with Jordan but not about the future.
	   ``Michael's always stated that he doesn't want to play for any
coach other than Phil (Jackson). And we have to one day wake up and
say, `Hey, you have to believe it.'''
	   The Bulls hired Tim Floyd as their coach-in-waiting last month,
giving him the title of director of basketball operations until the
lockout ends and Jordan announces a decision on whether to retire.
	   Jordan has long said Jackson is the only coach he'll play for
and reiterated that during a golf outing last month.
	   Would Pippen play for Floyd?
	   ``I won't say I won't play for him. I can't judge Tim Floyd but
I don't think I'm planning on coming back here next year,'' Pippen
said.
	   ``Judging that Michael may be retiring and Phil is not coming
back, it's a team right now with three players and the situation
just doesn't look good for me.
	   ``I've been around the game for such a long time, and I've
probably gotten spoiled by being with a coach like Phil. I don't
think it's the right situation for me at this stage of my career.
... I just have to look at it as the Chicago Bulls are not going to
be a contender next year.''
	   Pippen acknowledged that Floyd was thrust into a difficult
situation.
	   ``You don't want to be known as the guy who ran Michael out,''
Pippen said.
	   ``He has to be the guy who Jerry (Krause, the general manager)
has thrown in to take the blame. It's unfortunate that it's that
type of situation.''
	   Pippen said there are a lot of teams he'd enjoy playing for, but
he wouldn't name them. He said he's rehabbing his back and hopes to
be ready by late November or early December.
	   And he said he wouldn't accept a one-year deal to prove that
he's recovered from surgery.
	   ``If I don't feel like I'm ready to come back, then I'm not
coming back at all,'' Pippen said.
	   ``If I have to put someone in that situation, I don't feel like
there is anything left for me in the game.''

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a
battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   Despite anger over the U.S. attacks, there were few large
protests like those often organized by Arab states. Egypt, which
accused Sudan of harboring the radicals who unsuccessfully tried to
kill President Hosni Mubarak in 1995, issued a bland statement
calling for a meeting on international terrorism.
	   In Syria, a government official said ``these acts can't be
justified because they violate the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of other states and endanger the innocent civilians and
their properties,'' the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JYVASKYLA, Finland (AP) _ World champion Tommi Makinen of
Finland, driving a Mitsubishi, opened his favorite world
championship event, the ``Neste Rally Finland'' Friday leading
Toyota driver Carlos Sainz of Spain by seven seconds after the
first nine special stages of 24.
	   Scotsman Colin McRae, the championship runnerup, saw his hopes
of catching Sainz diminish. McRae had to abandon the rally after
only four stages with a broken rear strut on his Subaru.
	   McRae had won the previous two stages. The rally promised to be
a close fight with the top five drivers inside 22 seconds after the
first day. No less than seven pilots shared the nine stage
victories.
	   Heavy rain made the Central Finland gravel roads very slippery
for the 116 cars going out, demanding strong concentration from the
drivers.
	   ``I dont remember anything of the stage,'' Spaniard Carlos Sainz
said after one of the initial stretches.
	   Sainz is trailed by former four-time world champion Finlands
Juha Kankkunen, who drives a Ford. Marcus Gronholm, a privateer,
holds fourth in a Toyota, ahead of Toyota factory driver Didier
Auriol of France.
	   Sainz leads the world championship standings withg 48 points.
McRae has 38 points, Makinen 28, Auriol and Kankkunen 27 and
Richard Burns of Britain is in sixth place witb 21 points.
	   The rally finishes on Sunday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A well-known rabbi, stabbed to death by a
Palestinian assailant in the tensely divided West Bank city of
Hebron, was laid to rest Friday as dozens of Jewish settlers called
for revenge.
	   Signaling that settlers would not be forced out of the West
Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said mobile homes like the
one lived-in by the rabbi, would be replaced with permanent
structures. He said that the slaying strengthened his resolve not
to sign a deal on a West Bank troop pullback unless the
Palestinians do more to curb terrorism.
	   ``I plan to replace the temporary structures there for two
reasons; one to protect the settlement there and two, to emphasize
the permanence of a Jewish and Israeli settlement in Hebron,'' he
told Israel TV.

Sudanese minister invites America to inspect alleged chemical

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding
committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in
Khartoum.
	   The foreign minister spoke to reporters after arriving in
Baghdad a day after U.S. missiles devastated a factory in the
Sudanese capital. The United States said the plant produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said it produced
pharmaceutical products.
	   ``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee
from the American administration to come and freely investigate
whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical
(weapons),'' Ismail said.
	   Such a committee could also check whether the factory was owned
by Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based extremist whom the
Americans have blamed for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7, the foreign minister said.
	   If the Americans proved the factory was producing chemical
agents, ``we will accept the attempt (attack),'' Ismail added.
	   The foreign minister said Sudan was also inviting the U.N.
Security Council to send a committee to investigate the plant.
	   Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north
Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were
injured.
	   The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin
Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of
aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   ``They (the Americans) are behaving like international
mercenaries.''
	   Ismail, who is making a three-day visit to Iraq, crossed into
the country from Jordan. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ban flights to and from Iraq.

Agassi cruises into semifinals of RCA Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES; will be updated with results of night match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Andre Agassi played a tougher opponent in
Friday's quarterfinal round of the RCA Championships, so he
elevated his game accordingly.
	   The result was a 6-2, 6-1 rout of 14th-seeded Wayne Ferreira.
Agassi, the tournament's fifth seed, will play unseeded Ramon
Delgado of Paraguay in Saturday's semifinal round.
	   The 21-year-old Delgado, who beat No. 1 Pete Sampras in the
second round of the French Open earlier this year, reached his
first semifinal in five years on the ATP circuit by beating
Zimbabwe's Byron Black 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. Black ousted top-ranked
Marcelo Rios on Thursday.
	   Saturday's other semifinal pits 15th-seeded Todd Martin against
the winner of the Friday night match between third-seeded Greg
Rusedski and No. 6 Alex Corretja. Martin defeated unseeded Hicham
Arazi of Monaco 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (13-11).
	   Agassi, eighth in the ATP rankings, needed just 51 minutes to
eliminate Ferreira, the 1994 champion. He broke Ferreira's serve in
the first and third games of the first set. Then, after Ferreira
held serve in the first game of the second set, Agassi broke his
three remaining serves.
	   ``I wasn't expecting it to be easy, by any means,'' Agassi said.
``He's solid from the ground, so I have to respect his ability to
hit big shots. It makes me address my shots with much more focus
and purpose. I think I just always raise my level to the
challenge.''
	   Agassi acknowledged that Ferreira needed 2 1/2 hours to
eliminate Jason Stoltenberg in three sets Thursday, and that
Ferreira joined partner Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden for a three-set
doubles match later Thursday.
	   ``It surprised me when he (Ferreira) was just keeping the ball
in play, and then all of a sudden, he started making some errors,''
Agassi said. ``I think that's when you could tell that it probably
had taken its toll.''
	   Agassi, who has won four championships this year, won for the
18th time in 20 matches on the hardcourt summer circuit. He found
the mark on 71 percent of his first serves, won 22 of 30
first-serve points and nine of 12 points on his second serve. He
had just 10 unforced errors to 32 for Ferreira.
	   ``I didn't do anything particularly special,'' Agassi said. ``I
didn't have to, so I just kind of stayed rather solid and got the
job done.''
	   This is the first time that Agassi has reached the semifinals in
four appearances here. He was eliminated in the quarterfinal round
in 1990 and '97.

Singh clings to second-round lead

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ First-round co-leader Vijay Singh
maintained his narrow advantage in Friday's second round as
lightning again interrupted play in the Sprint International.
	   Lightning, which caused a 2-hour, 40-minute delay on Thursday
and forced 36 players to finish their rounds early Friday, struck
again Friday afternoon with half the field still on the course.
	   Singh, who began the day with 15 points under the modified
Stableford scoring system used in this event, added 9 points to his
total and stood at 24 through 13 holes of his second round when
play was suspended.
	   Singh, the newly crowned PGA champion, had one bogey and five
birdies, including three in a row.
	   Steve Flesch completed 36 holes and had 23 points. Brandt Jobe
also was in the clubhouse with 22 points, Jesper Parnevik finished
at 21 and Davis Love III had 20.
	   Journeyman Jim Carter, who matched Singh's first-round score,
stood at 19 through nine holes Friday.
	   Tiger Woods, who accumulated 14 points in the opening round,
double bogeyed his first hole, then suffered four straight bogeys
to drop to 7. He rallied with three birdies to climb back to 13
points through 14 holes.
	   The International's scoring format awards 5 points for an eagle,
2 for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double-bogey or worse.
	   Points accumulate over all four rounds. The field will be cut to
the low 70 players and ties for Saturday's third round and to the
low 36 and ties for Sunday's final round.
	   Flesch, a Nike Tour graduate who ranks 37th on this year's PGA
Tour money list, scored 11 points on Friday for a 36-hole total of
23.
	   The left-handed Flesch, wielding his backup driver after
breaking his regular one in a mild temper tantrum midway through
the opening round, bogeyed his first two holes but then ran off
seven birdies with only one more bogey.
	   ``I couldn't think of a worse way to start the day,'' he said.
	   But he promptly sank birdie putts of 15 and 40 feet at Nos. 3
and 4, ``and that kind of got me turned around and relaxed me a
little bit. I played my own game the rest of the day and was
fortunate enough to make birdies.''
	   Jobe, who has won three times this year on the Japanese PGA
tour, was another point behind at 22. Jobe, among those who
completed their first rounds early Friday, had a steady round of
five birdies and one bogey.
	   ``I hit a lot of greens and made a couple of putts and was
pretty consistent, which is kind of a change for me,'' he said.
	   Jobe, a Colorado native who lives just two minutes from the
Castle Pines driving range, admitted he felt pressure as a hometown
favorite.
	   ``You always want to play a little bit better at home,'' he
said. ``But I've finally realized I don't have to beat the world. I
wanted to come here and have fun and not beat myself up.''
	   Parnevik had a 16-point round that included six birdies and an
eagle.
	   Parnevik's surge actually began late Thursday when play resumed
after that day's lightning delay. Struggling at minus-1, Parnevik
birdied three of his last four holes to get to plus-5. He then
birdied his first three holes on Friday.
	   ``The rain delay definitely helped me,'' he said. ``I couldn't
get anything going, couldn't make a par, couldn't hit a green.
	   ``I was pleased with today, of course. Starting with three
birdies, that shows you how this format can really swing things
around for you. If you get things going, you can really move right
up there.''

Estill shoots 65 for first-round LPGA lead

	   MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota (AP) _ Michelle Estill, whose only LPGA
tour victory came as a rookie seven years ago, birdied the final
three holes Friday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round
of the LPGA Rainbow Classic.
	   Estill shot a 7-under-par 65, two shots off the tournament
record, taking advantage of a depleted field and a forgiving course
to begin a bid for her first victory since the 1991 LPGA
Championship.
	   Nancy Harvey, a 10-year tour veteran still looking for her first
victory, was on stroke back. Tracy Hanson was two back, and Sherri
Steinhauer, last week's Women's British Open champion, was among
five players at 4-under 68. Twelve more players were at 3-under on
the 6,360-yard (5,787-meter) Rush Creek Golf Club layout, which was
left defenseless on a still, sunny day.
	   Only two of the tour's top 10 money winners this season and
eight of the top 20 entered the dlrs 600,000 event. Se Ri Pak,
winner of two majors and four tournaments overall this year, pulled
out last week, and many of the top European players, including
money leader Annika Sorenstam, are playing in this weekend's
Swedish Open.
	   Estill, who is having by far her best year with dlrs 256,283 in
earnings, took advantage with a hot start and an even hotter
finish.
	   She birdied three of the first four holes and, after seven
consecutive pars, sank a birdie putt on the 12th to move to
4-under. She stayed there until hitting a 7-iron to five feet (1.5
meters) and making the birdie putt on the 16th.
	   With her energy waning _ she forgot to make her usual peanut
butter and jelly sandwich for a late-round boost _ Estill hit a
9-iron to nine feet (2.7-meter) for birdie on No. 17.
	   She finished by knocking a pitching wedge to eight feet for
birdie on the 530-yard (482-meter) 18th.
	   The 65 matched her lowest round of the season, which came July
18 in the third round of the JAL Big Apple Classic.
	   Harvey, whose best career finish was second in last year's
Welch's Championship, is struggling through a terrible year because
of injuries after posting a career high in 1997 with dlrs 187,339.
She has missed the cut in 12 of her 22 tournaments, including her
last two, and has finished no better than a tie for 24th.
	   Like Estill, she played a bogey-free round Friday.
	   Harvey made four long birdie putts, including one on No. 7 and a
another on No. 15, to go 6-under. She had a chance to take the
first-round lead, but missed birdie putts of nine and eight feet,
respectively, on the final two holes.
	   After a first-round 81 left her 10 strokes back in last week's
British Open, Steinhauer started strongly after a whirlwind week. A
native of Madison, Wisconsin, she briefly had a share of the lead
when she moved to 5-under with a birdie putt on No. 16.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir launched a
diplomatic offensive Friday to protest the U.S. missile strike on a
factory in the Sudanese capital.
	   After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir said
Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations, the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity.
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility
described by U.S. officials.
	   El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese
who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques
chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag.
	   The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear.
	   Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated
for injuries, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said there was still concern that some
victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated
Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been
accounted for.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory,
estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of
Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six
Tomahawk missiles.
	   He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate
if it did any damage.
	   At the factory, enveloped in a white haze caused by smoldering
fires, brown glass jars sat in piles amid bricks and twisted sheet
metal. Soldiers and civil defense workers in surgical masks milled
around the site. A white box for latex gloves and blue cartons for
anti-biotics were piled next to the building.
	   There was little security late Friday and visitors were allowed
to enter the deserted factory unhindered.
	   Earlier in the day, a young woman who worked at the factory had
asked The AP: ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really
a weapons factory?''
	   State-run Sudan television said the factory, which opened in
1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main
products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
	   Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert
public attention from the grand jury investigation into his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a
sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his
crumbling credibility and reputation.''
	   The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with
pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton:
Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ...
Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.''
	   He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the
missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all
training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia.
	   Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy
compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest
the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of
Khartoum in 1996.

International Court asks Trinidad to reconsider withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ The president of the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights has asked Trinidad and Tobago to reconsider
its decision not to participate in a hearing on a death penalty
case.
	   ``The non-appearance by a country at a public hearing that has
been duly convened has no precedent in the history of the court,''
said Judge Hernan Salgado in a letter sent to Trinidad and Tobago
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday.
	   Salgado asked Panday to reverse his decision not to participate
in the Aug. 28 hearing.
	   Trinidad and Tobago is one of several Caribbean nations trying
to make it easier to execute convicted killers. In the past,
convicts had the right to appeal to the court, which is an entity
of the Organization of American States, but Trinidad is now
limiting those appeals.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks tumbled Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average falling as much as 283 points at midday as
investors reacted to turmoil in financial markets and new political
tensions around the world. The Dow Jones industrial average
finished the day down 77.76 _ or 0.9 percent _ at 8,533.65,
recovering from its earlier lows but still extending the 103 point
loss from the previous two days. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets
Friday, as waves of global turmoil rattled traders. A sharp early
fall on Wall Street made things even worse. Frankfurt's blue chips
took the biggest hits _ at one point falling as far as 6 percent _
on concerns that Russia's economic troubles could prove painful to
German banks. The London and Paris markets lost more than 3 percent
each, with red ink spreading wildly through through smaller bourses
across Europe. Sentiment was bearish from the start, following a
drop Thursday in New York, lower prices Friday on the Tokyo and
Hong Kong markets and persistent concerns about the fallout from
the Asian crisis. Many investors were moving money out of stocks
and into the safer haven of bonds amid all the gloom _ including
fears that some Russian banks might fail. (EUROPE-STOCK MARKETS)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Investors, still fearful of a
devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, sold off stocks throughout
Latin America Friday, worsening a crisis in emerging markets that
began with a de facto devaluation of the Russian ruble earlier in
the week. Trading on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, South America's
largest, was temporarily halted after the benchmark index plunged
10 percent, tripping a circuit breaker. However, stocks staged an
impressive rebound later in the day, with the Bovespa Index off by
just 2.9 percent at closing. In Lima, the general stock index at
midday had fallen by 8.3 percent and the blue-chip index by 10.1
percent _ the biggest falls in 10 months _ but late buying resulted
in closing falls of 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively. (LATIN
AMERICAN MARKETS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar soared nearly 2 yen Friday following
Japan's third-largest corporate failure, but slipped against the
German mark and other major world currencies. The Mexican peso fell
to a new low against the dollar for a second straight day amid a
decline in worldwide financial markets, including selloffs in Latin
America. In volatile trading, the dollar fell against the German
mark as rumors circulated that the U.S. Federal Reserve was holding
an emergency meeting, which the Fed later denied. (US-DOLLAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders defended their handling of the
country's financial crisis before a hostile, booing parliament on
Friday, saying the banking system would have collapsed if they
hadn't spent billions of dollars to prop up the ruble. Russian and
international investors remained skeptical the government could
resolve its severe economic problems, and lawmakers again demanded
the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin and his government. The
Russian Trading System continued its downward spiral. The main
index fell 5.6 percent to close at 81.76 points. The ruble, which
the government effectively devalued on Monday, slid to 7.005 to the
dollar from 6.995 a day earlier. Demand for dollars remained high,
forcing the Central Bank to intervene in trading. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a crucial test of Japan's ability to clean up
its ailing financial system, the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. proposed a far-reaching restructuring and requested
government financial support for the plan. The bank will close all
overseas operations, sell its Tokyo headquarters and cut more than
700 employees this year to make it fit for its previously-disclosed
plans to merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. President
Katsunobu Ohnogi said Friday the bank plans to write off about dlrs
5.3 billion in bad loans by the end of the year and called on the
government to provide money for that as well as for the planned
merger with Sumitomo. LTCB is one of Japan's biggest lenders.
Speculation that it may collapse under the weight of failed real
estate loans made during the late 1980s had driven down share
prices of other Japanese banks. (JAPAN-TROUBLED BANK)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States could claim only partial
success Friday from the cruise missile strikes at suspected
terrorist strongholds in Sudan and Afghanistan. U.S. officials
warned of retaliation against Americans at home and abroad. In
Sudan, a purported chemical weapons plant was flattened. But the
CIA and Pentagon were unsure if the strike in Afghanistan smashed a
meeting of terrorist leaders as hoped. Cloud cover prevented spy
satellites from assessing structural damage to the so-called
terrorist university. President Bill Clinton spent the day calling
world leaders and the White House reported winning support from
allies, with some exceptions. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
condemned the U.S. action. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's war threatened to polarize
sub-Saharan Africa, with countries from the eastern Great Lakes
region lining up Friday against several of Congo's southern
neighbors. Zimbabwe began deploying troops in support of President
Laurent Kabila, while Rwanda in the east called for a cease-fire,
but warned it would intervene unless the Zimbabweans withdrew.
Angolan soldiers have also begun arriving in Kinshasa to help
Kabila, Mozambican radio reported. About 600 people, many waving
banners, blowing whistles and carrying sticks, protested Friday in
front of the French Embassy in Kinshasa, accusing France and the
United States of trying to destabilize Congo and of supporting
Rwanda. (CONGO)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the man whose Afghan
base the United States set out to destroy, is ready for war with
Washington, according to a statement received by a Pakistani
newspaper Friday. ``The war has just started. The Americans should
wait for the answer,'' the respected national newspaper The News
quoted a statement from a bin Laden spokesperson as saying. The
threats followed Thursday's U.S. missile attacks against a base
linked to bin Laden in Afghanistan and on a factory in Sudan. The
United States suspects bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, was
connected with the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 257 people. The News said its reporter in the
border city of Peshawar received a satellite telephone call Friday
from Ayamn al-Zawahri, leader of the militant Egyptian group that
assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. (PAKISTAN-US
BOMBINGS-BIN LADEN)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Lucien Bouchard, the separatist premier of
Quebec, said Friday that a historic Supreme Court ruling on
secession will provide a crucial boost to his drive for
independence. The court, as expected, ruled Thursday that Quebec
had no right to secede unilaterally, but the judges said the
federal government and Canada's other nine provinces would be
obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers supported
secession in a referendum. ``The court has shaken the very
foundation of the federalist strategy, which was based on fear and
the refusal to negotiate,'' Bouchard told a news conference in
Quebec City. He predicted the separatists, who narrowly lost a 1995
referendum on secession, would gain enough votes to win next time
because the ruling gave assurances there would be negotiations.
(CANADA-QUEBEC-SECESSION)
	   JERUSALEM _ A well-known rabbi, stabbed to death by a
Palestinian assailant in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, was
laid to rest Friday as dozens of Jewish settlers called for
revenge. Signaling that settlers would not be forced out of the
West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said mobile homes like
the one lived in by the rabbi, would be replaced with permanent
structures. He said the slaying strengthened his resolve not to
sign a deal on a West Bank troop pullback unless Palestinians do
more to curb terrorism. ``I plan to replace the temporary
structures there for two reasons; one to protect the settlement
there and two, to emphasize the permanence of a Jewish and Israeli
settlement in Hebron,'' he told Israel TV. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori named a new prime
minister and defense minister Friday as part of a shakeup of Peru's
political and military leadership that has toppled its top general.
	   In a ceremony in the presidential palace, Fujimori swore in
Alberto Pandolfi as the new prime minister and intelligence chief
Gen. Julio Salazar Monroe as the new defense minister. Pandolfi had
been prime minister for two years before resigning in June.
	   Fujimori said the remaining 15 members of his Cabinet would
stay.
	   In a surprise move Thursday, Fujimori fired powerful armed
forces chief Gen. Nicolas Hermoza and replaced him with Defense
Minister Gen. Cesar Saucedo, clearing the way for Salazar's
appointment.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Federal judicial police have arrested
four men suspected of belonging to a leftist guerrilla group that
allegedly clashed with the army in June.
	   The men are among 17 Indians whose arrests were ordered
following the June 7 clash in the village of El Charco in which 11
people were killed. The village is 70 miles east of Acapulco.
	   The four, who were jailed in Acapulco, are allegedly members of
the Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People, an offshoot of the
Popular Revolutionary Army that appeared in 1996. They are charged
with rebellion and conspiracy.
	   The Mexican army said troops on an anti-drug patrol stumbled
across a group of rebels meeting in a schoolhouse and claimed the
rebels opened fire on them. The defendants claim the army ambushed
the group of people in the school.
	   ___
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's most feared
kidnapping suspect was transferred to the country's top-security
prison Friday, four days after a nationwide manhunt led to his
capture.
	   Daniel Arizmendi, known as the ``Earlopper,'' was captured
Monday in Naucalpan, just north of Mexico City.
	   His brother Aurelio and several other alleged members of the
gang were already being held at Almoloya, which is used for
Mexico's most dangerous prisoners.
	   Prosecutors claim Arizmendi's band committed at least 21
kidnappings over the past three years, often sending victims' ears
to their families to terrorize relatives into paying ransom.
	   If convicted, Arizmendi could face up to 40 years in prison on
each homicide or kidnapping count.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 24-year-old fisherman lost in the Pacific
for nearly two months has been rescued, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Jesus Gerardo Urquiza Soto, who survived on rain and seawater,
turtle meat and fish, was rescued Wednesday by a tuna boat off the
coast of Colima in Jalisco state, the daily La Jornada reported.
	   He set sail June 22 from El Castillo, a fishing village in
Sinaloa state about 450 miles up the coast from Colima, with his
friend Jose Luis Zavala, 45.
	   They were overwhelmed by a storm and their boat's motor fell
into the sea, he said.
	   After 18 days, Zavala died of hunger and dehydration. Zavala's
body was also recovered, La Jornada said.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Three days after she was kidnapped,
a relative of the Honduran president walked free of her captors
early Friday and returned to her family unharmed.
	   Tania Facusse, 23, whose father, Mario, is a presidential
hopeful, was kidnapped Tuesday when she was dragged from her car in
a Tegucigalpa suburb.
	   Police captured three suspects Friday and were searching for
others.
	   The kidnappers had demanded dlrs425,000 for Facusse's freedom,
but family members said no ransom was paid. She is the president's
second cousin.
	   Her father, a prominent textile industry businessman, launched
his campaign for his party's nomination for the 2002 presidential
election last weekend.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's state telephone company
has suspended direct service to Sierra Leone, Canada and Australia
after hundreds of users refused to pay for phone-sex calls made to
those countries.
	   Phone users denied they had made calls to the so-called ``hot
lines,'' a spokesman for the Nicaraguan Telephone Company said
Thursday. Fees to the services had amounted to nearly dlrs 1
million, he said.
	   The state company was to have received a commission of 40
percent on the calls.
	   On Tuesday, Nicaragua's Presidential House announced it had
disconnected a telephone in a cafeteria used by journalists because
it was used for phone-sex calls. The June bill on the phone
amounted to nearly dlrs 3,000.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Searching for clues in the East Africa
embassy bombings, authorities staged a pair of raids, but were
tight-lipped about what evidence, if any, was uncovered.
	   Two weeks after twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, investigators on the ground were still describing their
probe as being in the preliminary stages _ even after the United
States staged raids it said were in response to the embassy
attacks.
	   Neither the Kenyan nor Tanzanian governments made any public
comment about Thursday's U.S. cruise missile strikes on targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan, which the Clinton administration said were
tied to terrorist activity.
	   Instead, American and Kenyan investigators widened their net. On
Friday in the Indian Ocean coast town of Malindi, five gloved FBI
agents and two Kenyan police officials made a three-hour search of
a slum house.
	   Witnesses said the homeowner, who is a driver for the Labor
Ministry named Hassan Omar Hassan, was taken into custody.
	   That came on the heels of another raid, this one in the Kenyan
capital.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices of a Saudi
Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief Agency, in
connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers and
cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after Thursday's raid, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary.
	   The Sudanese director, Mohammed Abdullah, has been missing for
three weeks, Ahmed said.
	   A Sudanese, along with a Saudi, was arrested at the Afghan
border on Saturday. Both were still being questioned, and have not
been named.
	   According to local media reports here, one suspect, identified
by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had said one
of his accomplices was named ``Abdullah.''
	   The FBI and Kenyan police refused to comment on either raid.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh, who flew back to Washington Friday
after visiting the two bombed-out embassies and conferring with
field agents, said he had made ``no final conclusions'' about who
carried out the bombings.
	   The embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were the targets Aug.
7 of car bombings in which 257 people died, all but 10 of them in
Kenya.
	   Freeh, speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport, declined to
say whether evidence developed during U.S. inquiries at the bomb
scenes led to Thursday's American missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether there was any direct physical
evidence connecting bin Laden to the embassy attacks.
	   The two bombings could have involved ``many, many people in
different places at different times,'' the FBI director said.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ In Europe at least, no one can measure
up to British men sprinters.
	   Since the retirement of Linford Christie, no Briton _ and no
European for that matter _ has come close to challenging the North
American, African and Caribbean runners.
	   In Europe, Britons continue to rule.
	   Iwan Thomas completed a British sweep of the men's sprints in
the European Championship when he won the 400 meters on Friday in
44.52 seconds, a championship record.
	   Minutes earlier, Doug Walker led a 1-2-3 British triumph in the
200. Britain also had had a gold-silver sweep in the 100 on
Wednesday.
	   Britain was not the only nation picking up multiple medals on a
day of nine finals.
	   Poland and Germany also won two golds each to pull level with
Britain and Ukraine on three golds through four days of
competition. Russia leads the medal table with four golds and 13
overall.
	   Thomas led coming out of the turn and held on, as Robert
Mackowiak of Poland passed Mark Richardson to prevent another 1-2
British finish. Mackowiak clocked 45.04 and Richardson 45.14.
	   ``I thought I had run a bit too hard in my semifinal so I didn't
know if I'd be able to hold on,'' Thomas said. ``I didn't know how
far ahead I was in the home straight.''
	   ``But I knew it was going to take a good runner to beat me
tonight,'' he said.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64. Julius Golding snatched
the bronze in 20.72.
	   ``This is great, I have finally won something big,'' Walker
said. ``I got what I came to Budapest for, so that's good.''
	   Led by Christie, the British team had also swept the sprints in
1990 and took two four years ago, losing only the 200.
	   Britons were left-empty-handed in the women's sprints.
	   Irina Privalova of Russia won a Slavic battle in the 200,
surging ahead in the last 30 meters to beat Zhanna Pintusevich of
Ukraine, the world champion.
	   ``This is amazing,'' Privalova said after retaining one of her
two titles. She lost the 100 to Christine Arron of France.
	   Privalova, coming off major leg injuries and surgery, clocked
22.62 seconds. Pintusevich took the silver at 22.74, while Melanie
Paschke of Germany snatched the bronze in 22.78.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany won her first major individual gold medal
since coming back from a doping ban when she captured the women's
400 meters in 49.93.
	   ``I always thought the gold would be mine today,'' Breuer said.
	   Breuer, 26, who had won the European title for the first time in
1990 when she was still a junior, came back from a three-year
doping ban in 1995.
	   Artur Partyka of Poland, who has had silvers at the Olympics,
world and European championships, finally captured his first gold
by clearing 2.34 meters in the men's high jump.
	   His compatriot Robert Korzeniowski won the men's 50-kilometer
walk to add the European to his Olympic and world titles.
	   Other winners were: Ionela Tirlea of Romania in the women's
400-meter hurdles; Franka Dietzsch of Germany in the women's
discus; and Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine in the women's pole
vault.

U.S. ambassador criticizes Mexico on immigration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISAAC GUZMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ The new U.S. ambassador criticized
Mexico on Friday for failing to slow illegal immigration to the
United States, but lauded the government's handling of the current
economic crisis.
	   ``I believe that the Mexican government has as a policy of not
impeding the flow of immigrants to the United States. I do not
agree with that policy,'' Jeffrey Davidow said at a news conference
during a visit to the western city of Guadalajara.
	   ``I'd like to see a better economic situation in Mexico so fewer
Mexicans have to leave their country,'' he said.
	   Davidow was making his first tour around the country since
presenting his credentials Aug. 5. He met with Francisco Ramirez
Acuna, the mayor of Guadalajara, and Alberto Cardenas Jienez,
governor of Jalisco state, which includes Guadalajara.
	   The tour comes as Mexico is bracing for tough economic times,
with oil prices falling and sharp declines in the stock market and
the value of the peso.
	   ``Mexico is suffering like everyone from the effects of multiple
financial crises,'' Davidow said. ``I would say that Mexico is
handling the reaction to these crises in a prudent and responsible
manner.''
	   ``Mexico is known abroad as a model country in its handling of
its financial situation,'' he said.
	   He also said Mexico and the United States are collaborating more
in the fight against drug trafficking and that he hopes cooperation
will continue to improve.

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Marcelo Rios of Chile, currently No. 1
in the ATP rankings, is the first seed in the Hamlet Cup which gets
underway Monday.
	   Rios will oppose Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, the 1997 French Open
titlist, on Tuesday night.
	   Patrick Rafter of Australia, winner of last year's U.S. Open and
now No. 3 on the ATP ladder, is the Hamlet's second seed. He also
is scheduled to play Tuesday against a still-to-be-determined wild
card.
	   Carlos Moya of Spain, fifth in the ATP rankings and the Hamlet
defender, is the third seed and drew No. 8 Felix Mantilla as his
opponent.
	   Greg Rusedeski is the fourth seed. Also entered in the
tournament is Yevgeny Fafelnikov of Russia, a two-time Hamlet champ
who is No. 16 in the ATP ratings and seeded seventh.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ From Hong Kong to New York, global stock markets
were roiled by investors skittish about economic woes in countries
as varied as Russia and Venezuela.
	   Unease about U.S. strikes on suspected terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan also took its toll on Friday.
	   In Brazil, trading was temporarily halted on the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange, South America's largest, after its key index tumbled 10
percent, automatically suspending trading for the first time this
year. Stocks made up some of their losses, and the index ended the
day off 2.9 percent.
	   Traders said Brazil was being punished for investor jitters over
Russia's financial crisis, a possible currency devaluation in
Venezuela and weakness in other equity markets. Also spurring the
selloff: Wall Street's sharp decline, with the Dow Jones industrial
average plummeting 283 points, then rebounding to close with a loss
of 77.76 at 8,533.65.
	   ``There's no critical factor in Brazil causing this panic,''
said one Sao Paulo trader. ``It's all pressure from abroad.''
	   In Venezuela, government officials insisted there were no plans
to devalue the currency. But the central bank said it will allow
the bolivar to trade more freely within an established band,
without trying to keep it at the midpoint of the trading range.
	   ``As we have made clear, we are not studying a devaluation or
exchange controls,'' said Finance Minister Maritza Izaguirre.
	   That did little to ease investors fears. The Caracas stock
exchange fell 8.4 percent, following a 9.5 percent plunge on
Thursday.
	   Traders estimated the Central Bank sold about dlrs 150 million
Friday to prop up the bolivar, which closed at 575.50 per dollar,
down from 574.50 a day earlier.
	   Mexico's currency, the peso, plunged to an all-time low against
the dollar. The peso closed at a mid-rate of 9.74 per dollar, off
9.345 a day earlier.
	   ``You'd have to call it a panic,'' said Eduardo Estrada Lopez,
economist at Grupo Financiero Bancomer.
	   The Mexican Stock Exchange's key IPC index was down 3.2 percent.
	   Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria described the market's fall
as a reaction to economic slides elsewhere.
	   ``This has nothing to do with internal factors,'' he said,
according to the government news agency Notimex.
	   In Russia, the main stock index continued its downward spiral,
skidding 5.6 percent. The government, struggling to repair the
ailing economy, effectively devalued its currency on Monday,
sending shudders throughout emerging markets.
	   Prices also plunged on Europe's biggest stock markets.
	   Frankfurt's blue chips took the biggest hits _ finishing down
5.4 percent after being off as much as 6 percent _ on concerns that
Russia's economic troubles could prove painful to German banks.
	   The London and Paris markets lost more than 3 percent each, with
red ink spreading wildly through smaller bourses across Europe.
	   ``The uncertainty is adding up,'' said Regis Khaber, an analyst
at the Aurel brokerage in Paris.
	   Asian markets also were sharply lower, with the key index in
Malaysia plunging nearly 8 percent as investors took profits
following sharp gains in the past two days.
	   Share prices also tumbled in Hong Kong on profit-taking from
Thursday's gains.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's main indicator of
blue chips, fell 2.8 percent.
	   In Tokyo, share prices fell as Japan's third-largest corporate
failure _ trading firm Okura and Co. _ this year raised fears about
the health of the economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 93.21 points,
or 0.61 percent, to close at 15,298.20.

Scientists discover new robin in Central African Republic

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The discovery of a new robin species
in the Central African Republic illustrates how little is known
about birds in Africa, according to participants at an
ornithological convention in South Africa.
	   Pamela Beresford, a graduate student with the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, announced the discovery at the 22nd
International Ornithological Congress.
	   The congress has brought together more than 1,000 of the world's
leading birders in this eastern coast city. The meeting will
continue through Saturday.
	   Beresford first encountered the bird in November 1996, during a
World Wildlife Fund-sponsored survey in the Central African
Republic.
	   ``When we first collected it we thought it was a typical forest
robin, but when we tried to classify it we realized we had
something new,'' Beresford said.
	   The small olive-brown bird is similar to other forest robins
except that its throat and upper breast are bright yellow-red and
it stomach is a shade of yellow.
	   Other forest robins typically have white stomachs and upper
breasts. Beresford had to examine some 300 specimens from 89
different areas at seven museums before she was convinced it was a
new species.
	   ``Sometimes you know right away that it's a new bird, sometimes
you have to look at other specimens,'' said Dr. Joel Cracraft,
curator of the American Museum of Natural History's Department of
Ornithology and co-discoverer of the bird.
	   Beresford declined to provide other details such as the bird's
name, height and weight until after a full scientific description
is published _ probably sometime next year.
	   The robin is one of the most common low-flying birds in the
lowland African rain forest. It just hasn't been recorded before
because there's still so much ground to cover.
	   ``There's never been an inventory of Central African rain forest
before us,'' Beresford said.
	   Dr. Phil Hockey, a professor of ornithology at the University of
Cape Town, said that while the new robin is an exciting find, it
may only be one of many more to come.
	   ``Ten or so years ago, ornithologists were saying that by now
all the bird species would be known. But today new species are
popping up all over the place,'' said Hockey.
	   He said there is also a new lark and a new cisticola species
awaiting description as well as a host of birds, who have been seen
but not yet captured, that scientists suspect are new species.
	   Many areas like eastern Cameroon, northwestern Congo and
northern Mozambique haven't been studied because of their
remoteness and political instability, and are likely to harbor new
species, said Hockey.
	   Over the last 50 years, 47 new species have been found using
what Hockey called the ``pith helmet and butterfly net technique''
_ in other words, by birders going out into the forest and catching
new specimens.
	   Many more new species have been discovered in recent years
through modern techniques. DNA analysis has shown that birds of
similar appearance that were thought to belong to the same species
are in fact genetically quite different.

Sudan asks council to authorize fact-finding team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with text of letter &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan asked the Security Council to
convene an urgent meeting to authorize a fact-finding investigation
into the ``barbaric, unjust'' U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum
factory.
	   The Security Council was expected to take up the matter on
Monday, council sources said Friday.
	   Washington's justification that Thursday's bombing raids were an
act of self-defense were ``very naive, lacking in logic and
baseless because Sudan did not carry out any act or threat against
the United States,'' said a letter from the state minister at the
ministry of external relations.
	   The minister, H.E. Bishop Gobrial Roric, urged the council to
``condemn this barbaric, unjust aggression and make the United
States responsible for the human and material damage.''
	   The letter, sent to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia,
was intended to lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's U.S.
airstrikes on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory were a breach of
the U.N. charter and a violation of its sovereignty.
	   U.S. officials have said they were targeting a terrorist
chemical plant linked to a suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in
east Africa.
	   Bahrain, the lone Arab on the council, was expected to raise the
issue at the council meeting Monday. The Arab Group of states and
another group of Islamic states met Friday at the United Nations to
express support for Sudan's effort.
	   The United States hadn't decided what it's response would be,
said a U.S. official.
	   U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the
bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the
Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical
plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the
embassy bombings.
	   In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the
pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory
produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States
government does not have evidence.''
	   The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the
el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary
pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The
pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
	   Roric called for an ``emergency Security Council meeting to
discuss this aggression, and send a technical fact-finding mission
to investigate the American claims and take the necessary measures
to guarantee (the attack) won't be repeated and guarantee the
safety and security of my country.''
	   Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan
criticized Washington for acting unilaterally for what it said was
an international problem.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires
an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on
the same side of the table.''
	   In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a
flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says
member states must refrain from using force against other states.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a
letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the
rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter
and international law.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states have the
right to self-defense if attacked.
	   Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview
with the AP called for a formal investigation into the strikes and
was consulting with council members to raise the issue before the
council.
	   ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because
military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who
represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
ousted by the Taliban in 1996.

Ireland plans minute's silence of `solidarity' with Omagh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Will be updated after 1410 GMT when leaders of
Ireland's four largest Christian denominations observe their call
for people to fall silent to remember last week's Omagh bomb.
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The people of Ireland, north
and south, Protestant and Catholic, plan to observe a minute of
silence and prayers on Saturday to remember Northern Ireland's
worst terrorist atrocity.
	   The leaders of Ireland's four largest Christian denominations _
Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist _ have called for
Ireland's 5.2 million people to fall silent at 3:10 p.m. (1410GMT),
exactly one week after a car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army
dissidents killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 in the town
70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   The main focus of Saturday's ``Acts of Prayerful Reflection''
will be Omagh itself.
	   ``We want to say with as loud a voice as possible that evil is
not going to defeat us and that good will prevail,'' said a
Presbyterian minister in Omagh, the Rev. Robert Herron, who is
helping organize the ceremony.
	   Ministers will lead ecumenical prayers in public places in at
least 40 other towns across Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.
	   ``We must all go out in huge numbers if we can. It will be an
important act of solidarity at this difficult time,'' said Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who will visit patients in Omagh's
Tyrone County Hospital after attending the ceremony.
	   In a symbol of new life amid so much death, a 21-year-old
Protestant woman who suffered leg wounds in the blast gave birth
Friday in another hospital to a 7-pound, 6-ounce (3.3 kg) baby
girl.
	   ``I don't know how I feel, but I'm glad she's OK,'' Ms. Emery
said of the unnamed baby in her arms, her Catholic partner Michael
Mulholland beside them.
	   ``I hope that the wee girl can grow up without any violence,
without bombs and can be safe,'' said Mulholland, who suffered
shrapnel wounds in his back. ``We will tell her what happened and
how special she is.''
	   Nicola Emery's own mother remained hospitalized in Belfast with
more severe leg wounds, but phoned congratulations after seeing her
new granddaughter on television reports.
	   Public revulsion against the dissidents _ dubbed the ``Real
IRA'' after its members refused to accept the IRA's July 1997 truce
_ was demonstrated Friday in the Irish Republic border town of
Dundalk, where several hundred people rallied in support of the
Omagh victims.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, the political activist most
prominently associated with the dissidents, was prevented from
opening up her picture-frame and printing shop in a Dundalk
shopping mall.
	   Mall managers complained they were losing business in droves and
didn't want to be associated with her or her partner _ widely
identified as the Real IRA's founder _ and so changed the locks on
her shop. Two security guards kicked her out after she refused to
leave.
	   Sands-McKevitt, sister of the late IRA hunger-strike leader
Bobby Sands, helps lead a legal pressure group called the 32 County
Sovereignty Committee. Its members oppose the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party's acceptance of the April agreement outlining a new
compromise government for Northern Ireland.
	   While she has condemned the killing of civilians in Omagh, she
maintains the accord makes more violence inevitable because it
didn't achieve the traditional IRA objective of abolishing Northern
Ireland as a Protestant-majority state.
	   A Real IRA spokesman on Wednesday said the group had
``suspended'' its efforts to bomb Northern Ireland towns, a step
short of calling a formal cease-fire.

to persuade Iraq to rescind its decision to cooperate with arms
inspectors.
	   The council wasn't scheduled to take any formal action following
the briefing by Prakash Shah of India. But some diplomats have
suggested the council could consider measures to punish Baghdad
after hearing from Shah personally that his mission had failed.
	   Since his mission, French and Russian officials have been
intervening to try to break the impasse, the diplomats said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The council has so far only called Baghdad's Aug. 5 announcement
that it was suspending cooperation with inspectors ``totally
unacceptable.'' On Thursday, council members decided to extend
sanctions against Iraq for at least another two months.
	   But some diplomats have said the next logical step in punishing
Iraq was suspending future sanctions reviews if Iraq doesn't
rescind its decision.
	   Such a move would scuttle a critical six-month review scheduled
for October, when Iraq and its council supporters were expected to
push for the measures to be eased.
	   Iraq announced it was breaking off cooperation with the United
Nations because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
refused to certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The Security Council will continue the sanctions, imposed in
1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, until it is convinced that Iraq no
longer has long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.
	   Thursday's decision to maintain sanctions at a regular review
was a setback for Iraq, which has pushed to have the sanctions
lifted, claiming it has complied with U.N. resolutions.
	   Shah told reporters from Baghdad that after two meetings, he had
been unable to persuade Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to back
down from the cut in relations with the inspectors.

Novotna creeps toward another title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Seles victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ While the fans had their eyes fixed on the new
generation of women tennis players Friday, veteran Jana Novotna
moved into the semifinals of the du Maurier Open.
	   Novotna, 29, won her 19th consecutive match, beating 19-year-old
upstart Magui Serna of Spain 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 to move within two
victories of a fourth straight tournament title on the WTA Tour.
	   ``As always, everybody else is getting all the attention and I
am quietly progressing in the tournament,'' said Novotna, a lanky
right-hander from the Czech Republic. ``That's the way I like it.''
	   The crowd poured into court No. 1 to watch teen-ager Anna
Kournikova of Russia lose a rain-delayed third-round match to
Spain's Conchita Martinez 6-0, 6-3, while Novotna was finishing off
Serna on Centre Court.
	   Martinez later lost 6-3, 6-4 to third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario to set up a Sanchez Vicario-Novotna semifinal Saturday.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland reached the semifinals
with a 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-4 victory over Sandrine Testud of France.
Hingis will face fifth-seeded Monica Seles.
	   Seles, seeking her record fourth consecutive Canadian title,
beat Germany's Anke Huber 6-3, 6-4.
	   Novotna returned to action this week from a four-week break
after winning at Eastbourne, Wimbledon (her first Grand Slam title)
and Prague _ the longest winning run on the tour this year.
	   She has hardly looked rusty, even though Serna, a left-hander
ranked 26th in the world who was coming off an upset of two-time
champion Steffi Graf of Germany, gave Novotna fits for one set.
	   ``She played incredible tennis against Steffi and I knew she was
really confident,'' Novotna said. ``She was serving really well _
acing me and winning her service games quite easily.
	   ``But I knew that usually you will get a chance in a match like
this and I did in the second set. I started to play better tennis
with more variety and I won 11 games in a row.''
	   Serna broke a string on her racket in the second set and never
looked comfortable with her backup weapon.
	   ``I saw her complaining about it and I really felt her balls
started to be a little shorter,'' Novotna said. ``This could have
been a turning point, but things like this happen in every match
and you have to take advantage of it.''
	   Novotna, like Graf and Kournikova, has entered the U.S.
Hardcourt Championships in New Haven, Connecticut next week, the
last tuneup before the U.S. Open in New York, the final grand slam
event of the year.
	   ``I'm very impressed by the way I have started to play,''
Novotna said. ``I think as the tournament goes on and the more
matches I play, I will get the feeling again.
	   ``I'm moving well and it feels good.''
	   Hingis, 17, might have expected an easy match because Testud was
in her second match of the day after finishing a rain-delayed 7-6
(7-4), 4-6, 6-1 victory over ninth-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania
in the morning.
	   ``I thought she might be a little tired in the third set, but
she could still run and we had some great rallies,'' said Hingis,
seeking her first victory since the Italian Open in May.

Whitewater rafting is booming in West Virginia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BC-TRAV-Wild Rapids-Tips &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THURMOND, West Virginia (AP) _ Jon Dragan, a stranger to these
parts, watched the water spraying violently over the rocks in the
fast-moving New River. He had an itch to run those whitewater
rapids.
	   The locals laughed and shook their heads.
	   ``They said nobody goes down there,'' Dragan recalls. ``People
who do it, they die.''
	   It was 1964 and Dragan, just 18, took the risk. He had no idea
how far that first raft run would take him.
	   Today, nearly 250,000 people raft the New, Gauley and three
other West Virginia rivers, ranging in difficulty from Class I for
beginners to Class V for experts. About 40 rafting businesses
generate nearly dlrs 75 million a year.
	   And Rose Shleser of Waimamalo, Hawaii, proved this summer that
knowing how to swim isn't even necessary today.
	   ``I think it's great. It wasn't as scary as I expected,'' she
said after running that same section Dragan braved more than 30
years ago.
	   But it wasn't exactly a snooze, either. Heavy rains had left the
river 12 feet (4 meters) above normal, resulting in what Dragan
calls ``Grand Canyon-style'' whitewater.
	   Shleser watched as one raft flipped and a rafter hit his head on
a rock. She also saw another raft dump nearly its entire crew
overboard, including the guide.
	   Still, she plans to go again.
	   ``I say go for it. Just go for it,'' Shleser said while perched
on a rock, eating a picnic lunch on the riverbank. ``I'm always
reluctant, but I do a lot of water sports. I dog paddle and feel
what the life vest is like in the water.''
	   The rafting network initially consisted of about 200 people who
bounced around the country, navigating tough rivers in primitive
Army surplus rafts that required bailing, unlike the self-bailing
rafts of today.
	   ``I look back and think, 'Boy we were really stupid to use those
inadequate rafts,''' Dragan says.
	   Dragan and his younger brothers, Tom and Chris, started
Wildwater Expeditions Unlimited in 1968 _ West Virginia's first
commercial whitewater rafting business. Tom and Chris were still
teen-agers.
	   But the Dragans, of Monessen, Pennsylvania, didn't pick the New
River just because it was close to Pennsylvania's Youghiogheny
River, their first run.
	   Instead, Jon Dragan spent two years searching for the wildest,
most diverse whitewater one river could spit at him.
	   ``It had to be a year-round river, not with just good whitewater
in May and June, but all through the summer,'' he says. ``The
changeability, that's what really keeps people coming back. The New
River is always changing.''
	   Then there is the nearby Gauley River and the lush New River
Gorge.
	   The gorge is an estimated 65 million years old and holds
remnants of coal towns, a railroad depot and foundations of
once-prominent houses located along the river.
	   The New River Gorge Bridge, the world's longest steel arch span
at 1,700 feet (520 meters), also greets rafters at the end of their
journey down the Lower New.
	   While the New is the most popular, the Gauley is the toughest.
Visitors come from all over the world every fall during a 22-day
period known as Gauley Season.
	   Starting Sept. 11, the Summersville Dam is opened, allowing
thousands of gallons to pour into the river. The result: the only
Eastern river with 100 rapids, enough to give any thrill-seeker a
paddling and adrenaline workout.
	   The end of this year's Gauley Season also corresponds with
Bridge Day on Oct. 17. Hundreds of parachutists leap off the bridge
on the only day it's legal to do so.
	   Thousands of sightseers also take advantage of the prime
whitewater on Bridge Day weekend.
	   Rafting did not begin to get attention until the early 1970s.
	   Dave Arnold, managing director of Class VI River Runners and a
state tourism commissioner, says the sport got a boost from the
invention of self-bailing rafts and the addition of a kayaking
event in the 1972 Munich Olympics.
	   James Dickey's novel and the ensuing film, ``Deliverance,''
didn't hurt either.
	   ``When we first started, the whole scene was only extreme,''
Arnold says. ``Basically, now if you've got a Visa card and a pair
of tennis shoes and you're not afraid of water, you can go.''
	   And even if rafters or beginning kayakers aren't into the
``big'' Class IV and V rapids of the New and Gauley rivers, West
Virginia's Eastern Panhandle offers plenty of calmer Class I, II
and III rapids on the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.
	   The Cheat River in the northern part of the state also is a
popular run in the spring when the water is high. But as the
weather warms, the water slows _ perfect for lazy afternoon floats.
	   ``We're very fortunate in West Virginia to have the caliber of
whitewater we have,'' Jon Dragan says. ``In less than a half a
day's drive, you can go from mild to wild.''
	   Chris Dragan, the only brother who still owns a share in
Wildwater, says rafting has its risks.
	   ``It's not a roller-coaster ride where you get strapped in, ride
and get off,'' Chris said. ``You're always dealing with Mother
Nature and just about the time you think you're getting good, the
river comes up and slaps you in the face and it tells you: 'I let
you come out and play, but the river's still in charge.'''

	    &UR; If You Go ...
	   There are about two dozen whitewater rafting outfitters on the
Ocoee River in Tennessee. Prices vary depending on time of year and
day of the week. Expect to pay about dlrs 40 per person, and to pay
in advance. Many outfitters charge you a cancellation fee in case
you chicken out.
	   Here are few outfitters:
	   Ocoee Outdoors: 1-800-533-7767.
	   Southeastern Expeditions: 1-800-868-7232.
	   Quest Expeditions: 1-800-277-4537.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   There are a variety of choices for whitewater rafting in the
South, depending on what you are looking for and your expertise.
	   The Ocoee River: A fun river in Eastern Tennessee with Class III
and IV rapids that turn beginners into rafters out of necessity.
The five-mile (8-kilometer) trip takes anywhere from 1 1-2 and 2
hours as rafters drop 275 feet (84 meters). Children must be at
least 12 and since the river is dam-controlled, it runs 116 days a
year.
	   The Chattooga: This river along the Georgia-South Carolina
border became famous in the film ``Deliverance.'' It is a
challenging river that contains Class II-IV rapids.
	   Big Pigeon: Not as intense as the Chattooga or the Ocoee, it
gives adults an exciting ride on its upper part, and allows
children as young 6 to raft in the lower river.
	   The Nolichucky: Catch this deep-canyon river in Tennessee
between March and July when the river is at its highest and most
exiciting with Class III-IV rapids.
	   The Hiwassee: This is a multipurpose big river, known as much
for its trout fishing as for its leisurely rapids. It's perfect for
family outings. It's about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Ocoee.

	   LAKE GEORGE, New York (AP) _ People have been plying the waters
of Lake George for centuries, from American Indians defending their
culture to Jesuit priests on a mission and colonial armies on the
march.
	   When future U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison
passed through the region in 1791, Jefferson deemed the lake ``the
most beautiful water'' he had ever seen.
	   The 32-mile-long (51-kilometer-long) lake in the southeast
corner of the Adirondack Park is still one of the most popular
tourist destinations in upstate New York. The Lake George region
offers numerous campgrounds, marinas, beaches, amusement parks and
lakeside motels and hotels.
	   The village of Lake George sits on the southern shore, and it's
filled with the typical trappings found in tourist hot spots from
Key West, Florida, to Venice Beach, California: T-shirt shops,
bars, pizza parlors, a wax museum and video arcades.
	   Motels line the western shore for miles (kilometers), but they
eventually give way to natural scenery that has captivated visitors
since the first Indian paddled these waters.
	   Craggy islands topped with trees dot the surface, giving what
19-century historian Francis Parkman called ``a certain savage
character to the beauties of Lake George.'' Sheer cliffs plunge
into dense forests, while mountains shoulder their way right down
to the waterline. In their shadows, cozy, secluded bays ringed with
pine trees offer boaters glimpses of a wilderness on the edge of
civilization.
	   On the more rugged and less accessible eastern shore, the inlets
are even more pristine. Over them loom such peaks as Pilot Knob and
Black Mountain, their summits catching the last rays of sun at dusk
or disappearing all together in the clouds and mist as summer
storms rumble through the Adirondacks.
	   Lake George, along with Lake Champlain to the north, forms a
natural water route linking Canada with the upper Hudson River.
What nature provided, man utilized in his quest for glory or
empire.
	   Iroquois and Algonquin warriors used Lake George in their forays
against each other. French explorers and Jesuit missionaries took
the same route, often with dire consequences, in their efforts to
win over the Indians. The armies of France, Britain and the young
United States turned its shorelines into killing grounds during two
centuries of strife, ranging from European-style sieges to short,
bloody Indian ambushes along dark forest trails.
	   One of the more famous battles took place during the French and
Indian War in August 1757, when the British surrendered Fort
William Henry to the French, who razed the fortress. It was
reconstructed in the 1950s and once again commands the bluff on the
lake's south shore. Tour guides in 18th-century military uniforms
tell the story of the fort and Lake George's place in American
history.
	   As the ``Queen of American lakes,'' Lake George had a thriving
tourist trade as early as the first decades of the 1800s, when
visitors came to view the fort ruins and trenches left over from
the ``old French war.''
	   The first steamboat launched on Lake George took its maiden
voyage in 1817, and excursion boats have been a popular way to view
the lake ever since.

 &UR; Outfitters add food frills to thrills
	   CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) _ Gourmet food has come to
white-water rafting. Fancy touches are being added by outfitters to
distinguish themselves from the pack.
	   ``We used to take a loaf of Wonder Bread, a pack of frozen
bologna, some fake Oreos, a bottle of squirt mustard and a head of
lettuce, and throw them into a duffle bag,'' said Jeff Proctor,
co-founder of Class VI River Runners.
	   Class VI overnight trips now offer meals from the grill or dutch
oven.
	   ``We'll take cobblers, brownies and breads in the dutch oven and
grill meat, chicken or fish, or set up a taco bar,'' Proctor said.
``We'll have side dishes like couscous, marinated salads or orzo.
On overnights, the sky's the limit.''
	   Two other river outfitters, Appalachian Wildwaters and ACE,
offer hot lunches on shore cooked over open grills.
	   In the fall, Appalachian's overnight guests will be treated to
six-course dinners that range from goose pate to salmon fillet.

 &UR; Vegas antes up dlrs 50 million for promotion
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The city's high-rollers plan to gamble dlrs 50
million on an advertising and marketing campaign in the next year
to lure more visitors.
	   ``We'll talk about the diversity of the city,'' said Rossi
Ralenkotter, vice president of marketing for the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitor's Authority. ``Our research indicates 50
percent of our customers view Las Vegas most favorably for its
entertainment, 48 percent for gaming.''
	   Las Vegas has lost some visitors, presumably to such other
gambling destinations as Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica,
Mississippi, and casinos on Indian reservations.

 &UR; Promoter pushes bull run for Nevada
	   MESQUITE, Nevada (AP) _ A Phoenix, Arizona, promoter hopes to
organize an annual running of the bulls here to mimic the yearly
event in Pamplona, Spain.
	   Phil Immordino staged a first run in July and is planning to ask
the City Council for a five-year contract for the event.
	   This year's run was originally scheduled down Mesquite
Boulevard, which is the business route for Interstate 15. It was
moved to a ranch on the outskirts of Mesquite when the state balked
at the idea.
	   Thousands of people turned out to watch more than 600 hardy
souls run from the bulls. Three minor injuries were reported.

 &UR; New England: Uniform region or unique states?
 &UR; Eds: Dann in 2nd graf is CQ
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The problem for New England's state tourism
officials and their ad agencies is how to sell tourists on one
state over another.
	   ``There's not much that differentiates one from the other,''
said Dann Lewis, director of Maine's Office of Tourism. As if to
confirm the idea, the official tourism brochure for each of the six
states has a picture of a church with a white steeple, The Wall
Street Journal said.
	   ``It's the subtleties that we're trying to stress,'' said Thomas
Altemus, Vermont's commissioner of tourism and marketing.
	   But Judson Hale Sr., for 40 years the editor of Yankee magazine,
based in Dublin, New Hampshire, disagrees.
	   ``I don't think there are any two states in the union more
different'' than Vermont and New Hampshire. Anyone who thinks New
England is homogenous is ``misinformed or ignorant,'' he said.
	   The states _ Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island and Vermont _ began promoting themselves to foreign
tourists as a region since they joined in Discover New England in
1992.

 &UR; New Year to bring price hike for Eurail passes
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ Prices of European rail passes are to
rise Jan. 1. Rail Europe says the increases will be about 3 percent
on most passes.
	   The only relief in sight is for families, who can take advantage
next year of a new pass called Europass that will allow a 15
percent reduction for up to five people traveling together. The
current Eurail pass allows a 20 percent discount for two companion
travelers.
	   Bargain hunters can purchase Eurail passes at the old rates
through Dec. 31, but they must begin to use them within three
months.
	   Rail Europe's Web site is www.raileurope.com. There are frequent
offers on other Web travel sites for discount rates on the European
rail passes.

Stepped-up war on terrorism means vulnerability for Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In explaining the U.S. missile strikes in
Afghanistan and Sudan, Clinton administration officials were
careful to caution against thinking this was the final salvo in the
war against global terrorism.
	   If, as Joint Chiefs Chairman Hugh Shelton said, this is a new
kind of warfare, can the U.S. military win? Can it stop terrorists
from hitting Americans at home?
	   If U.S. forces are prepared, as Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering said Friday, to use any means at their disposal in this
intensified war against terrorism, what means _ chemical,
biological or other _ might the terrorist groups be ready to use?
	   Such questions cannot be answered with certainty. But what does
seem likely is that the war on terror will take a further toll on
Americans somewhere.
	   ``We should expect future attacks against Americans, whether at
home or abroad,'' Robert Gates, a former CIA director, said Friday.
``This is a protracted conflict.''
	   President Bill Clinton said when he announced Thursday's missile
attacks that Americans must realize ``this will be a long, ongoing
struggle between freedom and fanaticism.''
	   The United States and its interests abroad have been a target of
terrorists for years. What has changed now is the nature of the
terrorist threat. Instead of relying on individual states such as
Iran or Syria for financial support, terrorists now use
``transnational'' networks not tied to any specific nation, either
for resources or for ideology.
	   ``You're talking about a privatization of international
terrorism,'' said Vincent Cannistraro, a former National Security
Council intelligence director and terrorism expert.
	   As the nature of terrorism has changed, the U.S. national
security establishment has been slow to adapt. With the Cold War
over, ending the threat of a huge land war in Europe, U.S. military
forces have been reshaped. But the closer coordination needed
between the military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to
pre-empt and defeat terrorism has sometimes been lacking, experts
generally agree.
	   Roy Godson, a terrorism expert and president of the National
Strategy Information Center in Washington, applauds Clinton's
decision to use force. But he urges a broader approach. Moderate
Muslim leaders, for example, should be given more help _ financial
and otherwise _ in their political struggles against the radicals,
he said.
	   Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and Islamic militant whose
terrorist network was the target of the U.S. missile strikes
against his training camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in
Sudan, has declared his intention to carry out a terrorist war
against America.
	   In his speech to America on Thursday, Clinton said bin Laden had
vowed to kill Americans and did not care if they were civilians or
soldiers. The president said U.S. intelligence had determined that
one of bin Laden's groups was behind the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
	   The embassy bombings, Clinton said, were not the beginning of
this terrorism war, and the retaliatory U.S. strikes on Thursday
were not the end. ``No matter how long it may take,'' he said, the
United States must be willing to fight back at every turn.
	   Implicit in his message was a warning that Americans are
particularly vulnerable.

semis &QL;

 &UR; By EVAN BERLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic advanced to the
semifinals of the Pilot Pen tennis tournament Friday with a quick
straight-set victory over the player who eliminated the event's top
seed the day before.
	   Ivanisevic, the No. 8 seed, needed 55 minutes to beat Leander
Paes 6-2, 6-4.
	   Conversely, Richard Krajicek survived a three-set match Friday
night against Britain's Tim Henman, winning 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (18-16).
Krajicek, the No. 4 seed, defended eight match points in the
tiebreaker and finally won it when Henman returned a serve wide.
	   Paes, a doubles' specialist ranked 100th in singles, defeated
top-seeded Pete Sampras in straight sets Thursday but said he
couldn't handle Ivanisevic's serve.
	   ``I could not really get into a groove of chipping and charging
and playing my style of tennis,'' said Paes, the only unseeded
player to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Ivanisevic never was in danger of being broken. He said he
thought it was difficult for Paes to maintain his intensity after
the win over Sampras.
	   It ``is tough to keep this momentum going, especially with the
way I play. You know, if I serve good, I don't give him a lot of
free points. He was trying to hit winners, but those were going
everywhere,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Ivanisevic will play defending champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
semifinals. Kafelnikov, the No. 5 seed, defeated No. 13 seed Bohdan
Ulihrach, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a match that lasted more than two hours.
	   ``But that is how every match is supposed to be _ you know, big
battle _ and fortunately, I was able to close it out,'' Kafelnikov
said.
	   After losing the first set to the fleet-footed Czech, the
somewhat fatigued Kafelnikov slowed the pace and took control of
the match.
	   ``It works successfully because he is the kind of player who
likes to dictate the game and be fast on the court,'' Kafelnikov
said.
	   Kafelnikov is making a bid to be the tournament's first
back-to-back victor since Jimmy Connors in 1975 and 1976.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera defeated Guillaume Raoux 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Raoux had knocked off defending U.S. Open champ Patrick Rafter, the
tournament's No. 2 seed, on Thursday.
	   Kucera will face Krajicek in the semifinals.
	   A day after ousting Rafter, the third-ranked player in the
world, Raoux's powerful play was not nearly as effective.
	   The ferocious forehands and powerful backhands that picked deep
corners and hugged baselines for the 6-1 win in the first set
started missing wide after Kucera adjusted by hitting deeper to
snarl the Frenchman's baseline game.
	   ``He started to play deeper and stronger,'' said Raoux, who is
ranked No. 48 in the world and No. 16 in the tournament. ``You have
to be 100 percent, even Sampras has to be 100 percent to beat this
guy.''
	   Helped by 10 aces, it was Kucera's fifth straight win over
Raoux.
	   ``If I get good into the rhythm, I can beat him,'' said Kucera,
who made the semifinals of the Australian Open this year with a win
over Sampras.

shots into water, birdied seven holes and widened his lead Friday
in the weather-interrupted second round of the Sprint
International.
	   Singh had 27 points under the modified Stableford scoring system
used in this event, giving him a 4-point lead over Steve Flesch.
	   For the second straight day, lightning and rain invaded Castle
Pines Golf Club. After causing a 2-hour, 40-minute delay on
Thursday that forced 36 players to finish their rounds early
Friday, lightning struck again with half the field still on the
course.
	   After a delay of 2 hours, 25 minutes, play resumed, but 31
players were unable to finish by nightfall. They were to complete
their rounds early Saturday, with the cut to follow and the third
round to begin about an hour later than originally scheduled.
	   Singh, who began the day as the co-leader with Jim Carter at 15
points, added 12 points to his total _ tying the 36-hole tournament
record set by defending champion Phil Mickelson last year.
	   Brandt Jobe finished with 22 points and Jesper Parnevik had 21.
Davis Love III was at 20.
	   Among those not finishing, David Sutherland had 22 points
through 16 holes, and Carter stood at 19 through 14 holes.
	   Tiger Woods, who accumulated 14 points in the opening round,
struggled early in his round, surrendering 7 points when he double
bogeyed his first hole and then took four straight bogeys, dropping
to 7 points. But he rallied with five subsequent birdies to finish
at 17.
	   The International's scoring format awards 5 points for an eagle,
2 for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double-bogey or worse.
	   Points accumulate over all four rounds. The field will be cut to
the low 70 players and ties for Saturday's third round and to the
low 36 and ties for Sunday's final round.
	   Singh, the newly crowned PGA champion, admitted to some negative
thoughts at the start of his second round.
	   ``Sooner or later this run was going to come to an end, I
thought,'' Singh said. ``I wasn't expecting to go out there and
shoot another 15 to 20 points.
	   ``I didn't play as good as yesterday but I hit a lot of good
iron shots and made some good putts. I got some momentum going and
had a good run there with birdies at 18, 1 and 2. Then when I came
back from the rain delay, I made a good (birdie) putt on 5.''
	   Singh drove into water on the par-5 17th hole but salvaged par.
He also drove into water on his last hole, just after the horn
sounded to suspend play because of darkness, but players were
allowed to finish any hole they started. Singh scrambled to make
bogey.
	   Flesch, a Nike Tour graduate who ranks 37th on this year's PGA
Tour money list, scored 11 points Friday for a 36-hole total of 23.
	   The left-handed Flesch, wielding his backup driver after
breaking his regular one in a mild temper tantrum midway through
the opening round, bogeyed his first two holes but then ran off
seven birdies with only one more bogey.
	   ``I couldn't think of a worse way to start the day,'' he said.
	   But he promptly sank birdie putts at Nos. 3 and 4, ``and that
kind of got me turned around and relaxed me a little bit.''
	   Jobe, who has won three times this year on the Japanese PGA
tour, was another point behind at 22. Jobe, among those who
completed their first rounds early Friday, had a steady round of
five birdies and one bogey.
	   ``I hit a lot of greens and made a couple of putts and was
pretty consistent, which is kind of a change for me,'' he said.
	   Jobe, a Colorado native who lives just two minutes from the
Castle Pines driving range, admitted he felt pressure as a hometown
favorite.
	   Parnevik had a 16-point round that included six birdies and an
eagle.
	   Parnevik's surge actually began late Thursday when play resumed
after that day's lightning delay. Struggling at minus-1, Parnevik
birdied three of his last four holes to get to plus-5. He then
birdied his first three holes on Friday.

Teams prepare for Little League World Series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) _ Nail-biters like Thursday night's
extra-innings battle between Cypress, California and Woodenville,
Washington are the stuff of Little League lore.
	   Down 1-0 and facing one last out, Cypress scored. Then, in extra
innings, with the winning run on second base and players literally
crossing their fingers in the dugout, Matt Swims hit a two-run home
run that gave the Cypress 11- and 12-year-olds a 3-1 win, the
Western Regional title and a trip to the Little League World
Series.
	   ``We got a little sniff of the dream tonight,'' said Armando
Alba, whose son, Alex, plays for Cypress. ``Now we got to make the
rest of the dream come true.''
	   Eight of the more than 7,000 Little League teams get that same
chance starting Sunday at Howard J. Lamade Stadium in Williamsport.
The championship game is Aug. 29.
	   Guadalupe, Mexico, has three players returning from last year's
championship team, which scored four runs in the final inning to
beat Mission Viejo, Calif. Only one team has repeated as Little
League champ: Monterrey, Mexico, in 1957 and 1958.
	   Kashima, Japan, won the Far East Regional, and the Arabian
American Little League of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, won the European
Regional for the fourth consecutive year. In the United States,
Greenville, North Carolina, Toms River, New Jersey and Jamison,
Michigan join Cypress in Williamsport.
	   The team representing Canada will be determined Saturday in Nova
Scotia.

Agassi cruises into semifinals of RCA Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with night match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Andre Agassi played a tougher opponent in
Friday's quarterfinal round of the RCA Championships, so he
elevated his game accordingly.
	   The result was a 6-2, 6-1 rout of 14th-seeded Wayne Ferreira.
Agassi, the tournament's fifth seed, will play unseeded Ramon
Delgado of Paraguay in Saturday's semifinal round.
	   The 21-year-old Delgado, who beat No. 1 Pete Sampras in the
second round of the French Open earlier this year, reached his
first semifinal in five years on the ATP circuit by beating
Zimbabwe's Byron Black 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. Black ousted top-ranked
Marcelo Rios on Thursday.
	   In the other quarterfinals, 15th-seeded Todd Martin beat Hicham
Arazi of Monaco 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (13-11), and sixth-seeded Alex
Corretja of Spain defeated beat third-seeded Greg Rusedski of
Britain 6-4, 6-3.
	   Agassi, eighth in the ATP rankings, needed just 51 minutes to
eliminate Ferreira, the 1994 champion. He broke Ferreira's serve in
the first and third games of the first set. Then, after Ferreira
held serve in the first game of the second set, Agassi broke his
three remaining serves.
	   ``I wasn't expecting it to be easy, by any means,'' Agassi said.
``He's solid from the ground, so I have to respect his ability to
hit big shots. It makes me address my shots with much more focus
and purpose. I think I just always raise my level to the
challenge.''
	   Agassi acknowledged that Ferreira needed 2{ hours to eliminate
Jason Stoltenberg in three sets Thursday, and that Ferreira joined
partner Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden for a three-set doubles match
later Thursday.
	   ``It surprised me when he (Ferreira) was just keeping the ball
in play, and then all of a sudden, he started making some errors,''
Agassi said. ``I think that's when you could tell that it probably
had taken its toll.''
	   Agassi, who has won four championships this year, won for the
18th time in 20 matches on the hardcourt summer circuit. He found
the mark on 71 percent of his first serves, won 22 of 30
first-serve points and nine of 12 points on his second serve. He
had just 10 unforced errors to 32 for Ferreira.
	   ``I didn't do anything particularly special,'' Agassi said. ``I
didn't have to, so I just kind of stayed rather solid and got the
job done.''
	   This is the first time that Agassi has reached the semifinals in
four appearances here. He was eliminated in the quarterfinal round
in 1990 and '97.

semis &QL;

 &UR; By EVAN BERLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic advanced to the
Pilot Pen semifinals Friday with a quick straight-set victory over
the player who eliminated the event's top seed the day before.
	   Ivanisevic, the No. 8 seed, needed 55 minutes to beat Leander
Paes 6-2, 6-4.
	   Conversely, Richard Krajicek survived a three-set match Friday
night against Britain's Tim Henman, winning 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (18-16).
Krajicek, the No. 4 seed, defended eight match points in the
tiebreaker and finally won it when Henman returned a serve wide.
	   The 34-point tiebreaker was the longest on tour for a singles
match this year.
	   ``Mentally it's pretty tough,'' Krajicek said. ``You both feel
the same pressure.''
	   Henman agreed.
	   ``I don't think I played a closer match in my career,'' he said.
	   Krajicek had 14 aces to Henman's seven in the 2-hour, 19-minute
match. It was the first time in three meetings that he defeated
Henman. The difference he said was the neutral court. Both losses
were in Britain.
	   ``It was nice that only five or six people are shouting his name
instead of the whole stadium the whole time,'' Krajicek said.
	   Paes, a doubles' specialist ranked 100th in singles, defeated
top-seeded Pete Sampras in straight sets Thursday but said he
couldn't handle Ivanisevic's serve.
	   ``I could not really get into a groove of chipping and charging
and playing my style of tennis,'' said Paes, the only unseeded
player to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Ivanisevic never was in danger of being broken. He said he
thought it was difficult for Paes to maintain his intensity after
the win over Sampras.
	   It ``is tough to keep this momentum going, especially with the
way I play. You know, if I serve good, I don't give him a lot of
free points. He was trying to hit winners, but those were going
everywhere,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Ivanisevic will play defending champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
semifinals. Kafelnikov, the No. 5 seed, defeated No. 13 seed Bohdan
Ulihrach, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a match that lasted more than two hours.
	   ``But that is how every match is supposed to be _ you know, big
battle _ and fortunately, I was able to close it out,'' Kafelnikov
said.
	   After losing the first set to the fleet-footed Czech, the
somewhat fatigued Kafelnikov slowed the pace and took control of
the match.
	   ``It works successfully because he is the kind of player who
likes to dictate the game and be fast on the court,'' Kafelnikov
said.
	   Kafelnikov is making a bid to be the tournament's first
back-to-back victor since Jimmy Connors in 1975 and 1976.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera defeated Guillaume Raoux 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Raoux had knocked off defending U.S. Open champ Patrick Rafter, the
tournament's No. 2 seed, on Thursday.
	   Kucera will face Krajicek in the semifinals.
	   A day after ousting Rafter, the third-ranked player in the
world, Raoux's powerful play was not nearly as effective.
	   The ferocious forehands and powerful backhands that picked deep
corners and hugged baselines for the 6-1 win in the first set
started missing wide after Kucera adjusted by hitting deeper to
snarl the Frenchman's baseline game.
	   ``He started to play deeper and stronger,'' said Raoux, who is
ranked No. 48 in the world and No. 16 in the tournament. ``You have
to be 100 percent, even Sampras has to be 100 percent to beat this
guy.''
	   Helped by 10 aces, it was Kucera's fifth straight win over
Raoux.
	   ``If I get good into the rhythm, I can beat him,'' said Kucera,
who made the semifinals of the Australian Open this year with a win
over Sampras.

For Israel, strikes against terrorists often produce a backlash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's aggressive pursuit of terrorists often
has led to political backlashes or acts of bloody retribution,
raising questions about the price of such campaigns.
	   Israel's policy of targeting terror suspects began after the
massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.
	   According to a former aide, the late Aharon Yariv, then Prime
Minister Golda Meir authorized the Mossad spy agency to assassinate
the leaders of Black September, a Palestinian group linked to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Unofficial accounts have attributed
at least 12 killings to Mossad agents in the 1970s and '80s.
	   ``It was Israel that generally charted the course in the
struggle against terrorism,'' said Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, author of a book on fighting terror and a one-time
commando who helped rescue 98 passengers from a hijacked Sabena
airliner in May 1972.
	   Speaking on Israel radio, Netanyahu said Friday that nations
have to strike back at terrorist groups, even if there is a strong
likelihood that it could trigger more attacks.
	   The cycle of attack and counterattack can escalate beyond
acceptable limits or produce an unexpected backlash.
	   The January 1996 assassination of Yehiya Ayyash, responsible for
a series of suicide attacks by Hamas, was killed by a bomb-rigged
cellular telephone in the Gaza Strip. The killing, which was widely
attributed to the Israeli secret service, turned Ayyash into a hero
among young Palestinians.
	   It also triggered a series of revenge bombings that undercut the
peace policy of former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and brought
Netanyahu to power.
	   In some cases, the assassination of a leader can effectively
eliminate a group. Such was the case, Israeli experts say, in the
case of the October 1995 assassination of Fathi Shikaki, shot by a
man on a motorcycle on the Mediterranean island of Malta. Shikaki
headed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from a base in Damascus,
Syria.
	   The group, funded in part by Iran, has carried out few attacks
since then.
	   David Kimche, former director-general of the Foreign Ministry
and an ex-Mossad official, said Saudi-born millionaire Osama bin
Laden's group was the ``most dangerous that we have seen in this
century'' because it was large, well-funded and ensconced in
difficult terrain.
	   ``If you attack their bases and infrastructure, you are not
going to stop terrorism. You will disrupt them from planning
actions against you,'' said Kimche.
	   Bin Laden's Afghan base was one of the targets of U.S. missile
attacks on Thursday.
	   Joseph Alpher, former director of Tel Aviv University's
strategic studies center and a one-time Mossad official, said a
sustained campaign could keep the bin Laden group off balance and
should be pursued.
	   ``But it's a double-edged sword. It may inspire these terrorists
to redouble their efforts. We've seen that this can be part of a
spiral,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A man convicted of participating in a 1996
guerrilla attack that killed 12 people has been sentenced to 50
years imprisonment, according to the attorney general's office.
	   Celso Almaraz was convicted in the Aug. 29, 1996, attack by the
Popular Revolutionary Army against government, police and military
installations in Huatulco in the southwestern state of Oaxaca. The
attacks killed nine security force members and three civilians.
	   Almaraz was sentenced Thursday on homicide, robbery, terrorism,
conspiracy and other charges.
	   The guerrilla group, known as the EPR, rose up in neighboring
Guerrero state in June 1996 on the anniversary of a massacre of 17
peasants by state police. It has demanded sweeping political
reforms.

Juror who had affair with defendant says she didn't break law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ A woman convicted of obstructing justice for
having an affair with a defendant while on serving the jury that
acquitted him said she committed no crime.
	   Gillian Guess wrapped up a two-day sentencing hearing Friday
with a rambling, 20-minute address.
	   ``I will never accept this conviction,'' Guess said. ``Remorse,
regret. I will not stand before you and ask for leniency for a
crime I did not commit.''
	   Justice Raymond Paris of the British Columbia Supreme Court will
sentence Guess on Monday. The maximum sentence is 10 years.
	   The government wants Guess, 43, jailed for between two and four
years. The defense has proposed a conditional sentence that would
allow Guess to stay free and care for her two teen-age children.
She shares custody with her ex-husband.
	   Guess was convicted in June over her affair with Peter Gill, one
of six men charged in two gang-style slayings. She was arrested in
May 1996 after an investigation that confirmed she was having a
sexual relationship with Gill during his 1995 trial.
	   Prosecutors solicited testimony from other jurors that Guess had
consistently argued in support of Gill.

Wilson wins third straight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Blaine Wilson, performing on one healthy
arm, became the first three-time repeat all-around winner in 20
years in the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Friday night.
	   Competing with a torn right rotator cuff, Wilson executed the
first three-peat since Kurt Thomas strung together successive
titles from 1976-1978. The 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, is
scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery Sept. 3.
	   ``It's something you try not to think about a whole lot,''
Wilson said of his three-straight championships. ``But once you get
in here, people are talking about it non-stop.''
	   As the all-around champion, Wilson is eligible for the dlrs
37,000 first-place funding allotted from USA Gymnastics for living
and training support. Wilson blew away the field with a two-day
combined score of 112.425. Jason Gatson was far back at 109.625.
	   Wilson's score for the night was 55.675, the highest for the
evening.
	   ``Blaine's an extraordinary gymnast,'' said former U.S. star
Bart Conner, who broke Thomas' three-year run by capturing the U.S.
Gymnastics Championships title in 1979. ``I wish he had more
competition.''
	   Wilson entered the all-around finals Friday with slight lead
over Jay Thornton. But Thornton struggled in the second day of
competition and dropped to third with 107.750 points. Thornton's
score Friday was just 52.450 as he fell on three of the six events.
	   ``He's the top guy in the country,'' Thornton said of Wilson.
``He has been for a couple of years. We need to push Blaine more
and keep him trying harder.''
	   The champion was determined by the combined scores from the
preliminary round on Wednesday and Friday's results.
	   A bronze medalist in the all-around competition in the Goodwill
Games, Wilson grimaced in pain on the rings but turned in the
highest mark in the event _ a 9.900. On the night, Wilson had the
highest marks in three of the six events. He added top scores in
the parallel bars (9.800) and pommel horse (9.550).
	   The single highest score of the night was a 9.925 in the vault
by Brent Klaus, who turned in a perfect 10.00 on the same event
Wednesday night.
	   ``It's been non-stop since Wednesday,'' said Klaus, who placed
16th overall. ``I've heard ``10.0, 10.0.'' There was a lot more
pressure tonight. I don't think people thought I could do it
again.''

	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Both government mediators and union
leaders pressed Hyundai Motor Co. on Saturday to accept a smaller
workers' layoff to help bring a negotiated end to a monthlong
strike at the nation's largest automaker.
	   ``Whether we can end the strike now depends totally on
management's attitude,'' said Lee Yong-bum, spokesman for a
government mediation team.
	   The government attempt to settle the dispute made a stride
Friday when the 26,000-member Hyundai union accepted ``a minimum
level of layoffs.'' It was the first time a major South Korean
union agreed to layoffs, deemed crucial to bring badly needed
foreign investment.
	   But management wanted a bigger layoff and accused the government
of pampering the union known for its militancy.
	   ``The company is guaranteed by law to dismiss redundant workers.
If the government ignores the law and intervenes for political
purposes, it will set a bad precedent,'' said Hyundai spokesman
Shin Dong-woo.
	   Some 5,000 workers and their families picketed Hyundai's plant
at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, since July
20 demanding that Hyundai take back 1,538 laid off workers. Hyundai
had shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   During talks that continued on and off until late Friday, the
union agreed to a government proposal calling for up to 300 workers
to be dismissed.
	   It was a major concession for the union, which has until then
insisted it would never accept a single layoff.
	   In return, the government agreed to drop charges against Hyundai
union leaders, who were being sought by police for organizing what
it had earlier ruled as illegal strikes.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, is
the first major business to shed redundant workers. The outcome
will set an example for other businesses and affect South Korea's
overall efforts to woo back foreign investors. Observers have
called the Hyundai dispute a ``proxy war'' between labor and big
businesses.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, accused the government of siding with the union because
of political risks from using police force to break up strikes.
	   The use of force could prove an embarrassment to President Kim
Dae-jung, a former opposition leader who routinely accused past
governments of police brutality in breaking up strikes.
	   Hyundai maintains it needs to reduce its work force because of
sharply falling sales at home and abroad. Hyundai has been
operating at 40 percent of its annual capacity of 1.25 million
units.
	   Creation of a more flexible labor market was one of the reforms
South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout of
its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers resisted
layoffs with a spate of strikes this year.
